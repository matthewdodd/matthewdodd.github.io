               <persName id="t18280110-26-person263">
                  Richard

             at that time; my husband went out at church-time, and Moss went out about eleven o'clock; my husband went out first - I was left alone in the house - after Moss had been gone about half an hour, I was up stairs in my bed-room, over my parlour; a ring came at the shop bell; I went down to the shop door, opened it, and found the prisoner, Charles Melford, at the door; he said he wanted a piece of good Cheshire cheese, for Mr. Law, the surgeon: Mr. Law is a customer of ours - Moss knew that - I said, "We don't serve on Sunday, but I don't wish to disoblige Mr. Law;" Charles Melford walked into the shop; he passed me, and walked into the shop; the prisoner, William Melford, walked in after; I had not seen him before; when William was a little way in the shop, I said "I have not any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100024"></xptr>one to send;" William Melford said "We must take it then, I suppose," or words to that effect; the shop door, when I went behind the counter, was shut, but I do not recollect who shut it - I observed that it was shut; when I got behind the counter I pulled a piece of Cheshire cheese from the shelf behind the counter, and, as I put it on the counter, I observed the prisoner Charles Melford coming round the counter after me; the prisoner William Melford stood opposite to me, on the other side the counter, and presented a pistol near my face.</p>
               <p>Q. As William stood opposite to you, did you observe any thing particular in his countenance? A. Yes; I observed a piece of his nose was gone; Charles touched me lightly on the left arm, and presented a pistol at the side of my head; they each had a pistol; the prisoner William said, "It is your money we want - if you make the least noise, you are a dead woman;" I was alarmed, but perfectly collected; I said, "Good God!" and I think it was William who said, "Don't be frightened - we won't hurt you, but we must have your money;" I stood a little, hesitating, and the prisoner Charles said, "Come, come, show us where the money is;" I walked from behind the counter, and said, "If you will stop here, I will fetch it;" Charles said "No;" I then went up stairs, followed by the prisoner Charles; he was close behind me; I went into my bed-room, and when I got there, Charles Melford said,"Where is your cash-box, and where is your plate?" I said I had neither; I then went into a small room, over the shop - it communicates with the bed-room; he followed me into that small room; I unlocked the top drawer of a chest of drawers which stood there, and pulled a purse out of the drawer, containing 5l. 4s. all in silver, and gave it to him; he said, "What is that?" I said silver, and gave it to him - it consisted of crowns, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences - I think there were a good many half-crowns, but am not certain of their number; I then pulled out a purse, containing 9l. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, and gave that to him; he said that was very little - he thought there was more; I said I had no more; we came down stairs both together, to the parlour door - there is a cupboard in the parlour, and when I came to the parlour door, the prisoner William Melford was turning from the cupboard; I said to him, "You have taken my husband's silver spoon - it is a family relic - pray give it to me;" the prisoner William said, "What spoon?" and gave it me; one of them gave me back the purses, but I am not certain which it was; my husband had a watch, which he put in the cupboard when he went to church; I missed that watch when they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened afterwards? A. I stood in the parlour; the prisoner William stood on the mat, at the parlour door; he pulled a cord out of his pocket, and said, "We must tie you;" I said, "For God's sake don't tie me; pray don't tie me - I cannot do anything - I won't move;" he said, "If you move for a quarter of an hour, we have plenty outside." I was not tied. Before they went away, I heard one say to the other that the money was very little; they went away, and shut the door after them - they banged it to, hard; I stopped in doors till my husband came from church, and soon afterwards missed the watch from the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated you were alarmed by the production of the pistols, were you in a state to make accurate observation on what passed? A. Yes, as much as I am now; Charles Melford had a white handkerchief on his neck, and a blue coat, with metal buttons; the other had on a large drab great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, in your judgment, were the prisoners in your house? A. A very short time - about eight minutes, I suppose. On the next day (Monday) I was standing in our shop, and the prisoner Charles walked into the shop - I had previously described his person and dress to Hanley; Hanley followed him into the shop - he was with him; I lifted up my hands, and said, "That is the man that robbed me."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time see Hanley? A. I saw the prisoner first; I had not caught sight of Hanley before I made that exclamation. I had previously been to see several persons who were pointed out to me by the officers - there were a dozen or more; I told the officer neither of those were the persons who robbed me. I saw the prisoner William, I think, on the Wednesday week after - he was produced to me at Worship-street, in custody; I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, this is a most serious charge, affecting their lives, have you a belief of their being the men, or are you certain of them? A. I am certain they are both the same men.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain from a recollection of their persons, or what? A. It is the impression their countenances made upon me altogether at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You have mentioned the observation occurred twice, about their being but little money, had you more money in the house the previous week? A. I think we had hardly ever so little - we had more the Sunday preceding. Moss was employed in the shop, and could see what we took.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what o'clock was this? A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning - it was Charles who went up stairs; we went into a small room on the first floor, over the shop; I opened the top drawer of a chest - that occupied a very short time; I have said they might be in the house altogether about eight minutes; the stairs are very short, the bed-room very small, and the other room is close to it - it could not take many minutes; I had to open the drawer, but my keys were in my pocket ready - it might take about five minutes; William was not up stairs at all; I saw him when he came in at the door, and spoke to me about the cheese; I took particular notice of him; I did not count the money - I was as firm as I am at present; I was frightened, but quite collected - I was not much agitated - I was as much agitated at the rope as at the pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. You were agitated at both? A. Yes, of course, it made an impression on me, as I saw my life was in danger; but they told me they would not hurt me if I gave them the money; they did not commit any violence on me; one of them told me not to be alarmed; and they returned the spoon when I said I wished it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not somebody been taken up for William, who had the same defect in his countenance? A. I know nothing of who has been taken; I did not see any other person taken up; I have not a doubt of their persons; our shop shutters were all up - the shop was not so light as when opened, but it was a very fine bright day, and there was light enough to read the smallest print; there is a light from the back room - that is a borrowed light: the shop door was closed, but I do not know who closed it - that is the front door.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100025"></xptr>Q. When they were in the shop, your means of seeing them was by a borrowed light from the back? A. No; there is a good light over the door - it is a regular fan-light, but has no glass in it - it is merely irons, to let the air into the shop - it is as wide as the door, and the usual height - that, and the borrowed light from behind, was the only light I had.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Was it light enough for you to make accurate observation? A. It was - it was quite light enough to do any thing.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you a private door? A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I and Garton saw Mrs. Pring, at her house, on Sunday evening, the 9th of December; she described to us very particularly the persons of two young men; she also described their dress, and the particulars of the robbery; we went to the King's Arms public-house, in Charles-street, on that Sunday night, in consequence of her description, and sent for her, as there were about seventeen persons there; we desired them to put their hats on, but she did not know either of them. Next morning, about ten o'clock, I went to No. 24, Henrietta-street, Hackney-road, and saw the prisoner Charles Melford there; I told him, I suspected, from the description which had been given me, that he had been at a robbery the preceding day, and he must go with me to the City-road; we went there, and I saw Mr. and Mrs. Pring in the shop; I desired Charles Melford to walk in before me; he did so, and almost instantly that he went in, Mrs. Pring lifted up her hands, and exclaimed, "That is one of the men who robbed me;" I took him to the office, and also Moss, the servant, who was afterwards discharged. Charles Melford had a light coloured great coat on, when I took him; and when I took him to the shop, he had not a blue coat on then; I returned with Wilmot, the parish officer, to the house in Henrietta-street, where I had taken him, and, in a back bed-room, in a box, near the foot of the bed, I found two small bottles of gunpowder, six pistol bullets, and six pistol flints, and, on the mantle-piece, I found two other bullets, in the frame of a time-piece; I found a pistol bullet mould in another box, in the same room, and in the same room I found two masks; there was a box on the landing-place, near the door; I could not procure the key of that; a woman, who said she was Melfords' mother, was with me when I made the search; I broke the box open, and found this pistol, which was loaded with small shot, and primed - I have drawn the charge - the box in which it was, was about one yard from the room door; I found a blue coat hanging on the door of the room, and Charles Melford owned that coat - there was a white neck handkerchief in the pocket of it; there were several letters in the room, directed to William Melford, and one to Charles Melford; the blue coat was delivered to Charles, and I will not be certain whether the one William has on now is the same or not. On Monday, the 17th of December, in consequence of information, I went, with two other officers, to the Olive Branch public-house, in the Maze, in the Borough, and apprehended William Melford; he also had a light great coat on then. Mrs. Pring gave me this spoon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Charles claimed the coat at once? A. Yes; he said it was his; he knew I was an officer - I had apprehended him two days before; Mrs. Pring had been in a room with seventeen men, on the night of the robbery, and she knew I was an officer then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to hear her exclaim, "That is one of the persons who robbed me?" A. Yes; I was about three yards from her; Charles Melford stood between us.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a tall man - she was near enough to see you at the time? A. She might, or she might not have seen me - there was no door or bulk to intercept her view; when she exclaimed that he was one of them, Mr. Pring was angry, and took up a knife; I stepped between them, and said, "You must not burt the man." I know a man named Tibbs - I cannot, from my own knowledge, say whether a person was taken for William Melford - I do not believe that Tibbs is here to day.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Were the prisoners the only persons you presented to Mrs. Pring, except those at the public-house? A. There were no others. I apprehended the prisoners in consequence of her description; I cannot say whether Mrs. Pring had seen me at the time she made the exclamation - I saw her change countenance directly he went in.</p>

            . I keep a coffee-shop, in Grub-street, Cripplegate, which is about half a mile from Mr. Pring's; Richard Moss' sister lodged there; Moss was in Mr. Pring's service. On Sunday, the 9th of December, I let Moss in, and while he was there, a young man, in a drab coat, came- this was near upon half-past twelve o'clock, I think - my little boy opened the door to him; I could not hear what passed between them, but I asked the person myself who he wanted; he said, "I want Richard, your lodger;" I told him he was in the second floor, back room; the prisoner Charles Melford appears to be that man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him before? - A. Never in my life; Moss' sister was my lodger - this was about half-past twelve o'clock, as near as I can guess; I was in the parlour - the stairs are close to the parlour door- I went to the door to him.</p>

            . I am the son of Sarah Hayes. On Sunday, the 9th of December, there was a ring at the bell, and a young man, dressed in a drab coat, asked me if Richard was at home; I said I did not know, and told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100026"></xptr>to go to the second floor back room; my mother met him at the foot of the stairs.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Richard live there? A. No; Moss' sister lived there; Richard was in the habit of coming there- the prisoner Charles is the gentleman who came - I have a clear recollection of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. No: I saw him again at Worship-street; he was about two minutes in my sight - he had his hat on.</p>

            . I am a brass and iron-founder, and lodge on the same floor with Moss' sister. On Sunday, the 9th of December, I went to Gerrard's Hall (where a coach was going from), to keep a place for Moss' sister; when the horses where put to; I returned from the inn, and, about half way from Cheapside, I met Moss, his sister, and another person with them, who I believe to be Charles Melford - they were carrying the sister's trunk - this was near about ten minutes to two o'clock.</p>

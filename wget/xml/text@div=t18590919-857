Byers; and was supported by Reg. v. Gill. The Court intimated that the objection would go much further than was suggested by counsel, for the insolvent jurisdiction depended a good deal on 1 and 2 Vic. c. 110, which was not recited at all in the indictment.</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">METCALFE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">would not go so far as to say it was necessary that the 1 and 2 Vic. should be recited; or, indeed, that it was essential that the other three Acts should be; but having been so recited, it was necessary that they should be correctly described; at present the jurisdiction was alleged to depend upon three specific Acts, whereas, as regarded two of them, no such Acts in fact existed. He further objected to the vague form of the statement alleged to be false, and con<lb></lb>tended that there was no evidence to go to the Jury of perjury as to the hand<lb></lb>writing, the prisoners expression merely being, "I do not think it is my writing?" I believe it is my brother's." The Court was of opinion that it had power to amend the misdescription of the Acts of Parliament, but considered the objections taken of sufficient importance to reserve for the consideration of the Court of Criminal Appeal.</hi>

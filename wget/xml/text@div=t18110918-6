On Friday the 16th of August, between four and five in the evening, the prisoner came into our shop, she asked to look at some patterns for a gown, she looked at them, and bought none, she went away, I suspected her, I went out and followed her, and brought her in, and when she came in again. I saw the prints drop from her, four lengths.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards - A. I do not know exactly; it was worth twenty shillings, we could sell one piece for that and there were three lengths besides that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that printed cotton - A. Yes, it was my master's property, it had his shop mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it the last time before it was taken - A. I pulled it off the shelf about half an hour before; I am confident it is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her in the shop before - A. No,</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutor, I saw the prisoner brought back, and I saw the printed cotton fall at her feet, it fell from under her clothes I fancy; I know it is my master's property; there were four lengths containing about twenty yards. One length cost twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is one length - A. One length is twenty yards it cost twenty pence a yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the shop to purchase some callico, when I went away the young man called after me. I immediately turned round. I never saw the cotton, untill I saw it on the floor of the shop.</p>
               <p>JURY to Banks. Where did this lay - A. On the counter; I did not see her take it; I missed them before I suspected the prisoner and followed her out; I can swear positively I saw it drop from her.</p>

            ; we looked through a board in a skettle ground behind the house; the skettle ground belongs to the Rose and Crown in Cloth-fair; it is partly a wall, and the rest is carried up with boards, and there was a knot in one of these boards, which was cut; I saw Hill at work at the fire, with a crucible heating the metal; I saw Lard, who is an evidence, at work; and there was mould and sand, I saw him throw sand and dust over it: Guire came down as I was upon the ladder, he came through the shed, and came up the wall, and came out of a trap door, I was then upon the ladder; Guire came up to this trap door and came out; there were sacks at that time over the windows, which is a sky-light, he moved the sacks, and I thought we were perceived, and I pointed to the top of the place immediately, and the other officers went to the door of the street, and broke it open; I went in at the trap door, and that brought me into the room where these people were at work; Hill and Lard made their escape up stairs, it was a shed on the ground floor adjoining to the house, I found only Guire there.</p>
               <p>How came he to stay for you there? - I cannot say, I was down very soon after him, he let himself down very easy, and I dropped down after him, I cannot say where he was going.</p>
               <p>You did not see Guire doing any thing in the shed? - I did not myself, I was the last that looked through the board. and I suppose there was an alarm; I searched Guire, and found two halfpence upon him, which I suppose to be like them that were making, and some others that were very good, the others were in his pockets; many other things were found there, which the other witnesses have; I was the first person that was in the room, I found the crucible in the furnace at that very time, there was boiling hot metal in it, there were scales and weights, and a pair of tongs, and things of different kinds, and this ladle, and this is what they hand the crucible out with; I saw the prisoner Hill using these things, as I was on the ladder looking through the hole; this ladle was laying on the furnace, here is the mould, it was then open, but it was put together since to keep it, as it was then set; there were some old buckles for melting, and some small sheets of copper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. I suppose you know as little about casting, as you do about coining? - I know nothing at all about it, I never saw a thing of this kind before.</p>

               <p>What did you understand by small work? - Such as watch seals and that.</p>
               <p>How do you mean to do, lad? - To cast it; I went to Hill's house, No. 4, Cloth-fair, on the 21st of March, and there was about ten pound of metal run in a square piece, and afterwards Hill said he had a little job to do, and this mould had thirty-nine halfpence in one part, I made one side by the help of Hill and Guire, we made it between us.</p>
               <p>What is it for? - They told me it was do some cast-iron halfpence.</p>
               <p>Did you make any? - There was some made in metal.</p>

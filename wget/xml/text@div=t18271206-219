               <p>MARK RUDKIN. On the 30th of October, about two o'clock in the morning, I was at the entrance of a court in <placeName id="t18271206-219-crimeloc1168">Fleet-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where had you spent the evening? A. I had dined with a friend between five and six o'clock - I had not been drinking from then till one o'clock; I was tipsy; I did not accuse any one else of this; I recollect I did stop with other females - I cannot say how many, perhaps, two or three - matters might occur that I cannot bring to my recollection - I did not go into any house; the purse was a crimson figured one - I never described it as a long green purse - it was said by the officer, at the watch-house, that I described it so; he was sober; if I did describe it so, it must have been from my state of confusion at the time; but I do not see how I could describe it so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you also accused of having said there were 5s. in the purse? A. I do not recollect; I did not afterwards say there were 10s. in it, to my knowledge; I said there was some small change- I did not say any thing about the loss of my watch - it was a gold watch; I felt Bracker's hand about my person- Newby was away from me at that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what time can you swear you had your purse, and knew what was in it? A. About ten o'clock; I was then at my friend's house, and paid a bill; there were then two sovereigns, a 30s. note, and some small change in it - it was a crimson purse; I was not up a court with any body but the prisoners; I had been to an auctionshop, and left it about twelve o'clock.</p>

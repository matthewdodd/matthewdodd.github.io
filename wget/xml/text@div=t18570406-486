                  </hi>. I live at No. 14, Ranelagh Grove, Pimlico. I ocupy the two parlours—on 14th Jan. I received at Coutts's bank these notes—this is the cheque, it has my writing on the back of it—I took the notes home, and placed them with some more in a pocket book—on 3rd Feb. I went out to a public house in the Haymarket, between 8 and 9 o'clock, in search of a man named Stewart—I saw the prisoners at the bar; I knew them before—I asked them about Mr. Stewart; they said that he was not there, he was at the ball at the Harlequin—I agreed to go with them to the ball, but I had no money with me; I got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with them, and went to my house—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was left at the door, and we three went into the parlour—I carry two keys, locking the outer door and the parlour door—I opened the street door with this key, and the parlour door with this one—we all got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and went into the parlour—I opened the folding doors of the back parlour, and took my pocket book, and took out one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; there were twelve 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes left in it, and nine of them were those I had received at Coutts's—I placed my pocket book between the chairs against the wall, and I heard it fall on the floor—the prisoners could see what I was doing—the room is very small—I closed the folding doors after me, and came out, and joined the prisoners; we all went into the street; I looked my doors after me, and put the keys into the right hand tail pocket of my coat—I found the keys afterwards in my left hand pocket—we then went across the road to the Union public house, and had some bread and cheese and ale—I paid for it out of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—we stood at the bar while we were eating and drinking—the prisoners were close to me—Morton went out during the time—he might be away three or four minutes, or more—I did not look after him—Farthing stood there talking to me, and eating the bread and cheese, and drinking the ale—Farthing went to the door—when Morton came back, he went out—Farthing went out once or twice—after they returned, we all got in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and went to the ball—we all three went in together; I missed them in about an hour or an hour and a half—I never saw them again till they were in custody—on my return home, I found the doors locked, everything right as I left it, but the notes were gone—I found my keys in my left hand pocket, which is quite a different place to where I put them—Mr. John Morris is the landlord of the house I live in—that is nearly opposite to the Union public house—you may cross to it in about a minute; I got to the ball about 11 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of a boot and shoe maker, at No. 343, Strand. I saw Morton buy a pair of boots on 4th Feb., about 9 o'clock in the morning; they came to 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid me this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for them, No. 95340—here is a name and address on it written by our foreman, Mr. Williams—I got change for it—I am quite sure Morton is the person who gave me the note.</p>

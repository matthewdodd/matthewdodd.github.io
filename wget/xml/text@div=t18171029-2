On the 25th of August, about a quarter after twelve o'clock at night, I was in bed-an alarm was given; I got up, primed my pistols, and went to the back staircase window it was moonlight. I heard somebody breaking open the door; under the window there is a projection which prevented me from seeing anybody. I called out twice "who is there?" in half a minute three men ran from the back door. I fired and one of them fell, wounded; I immediately went into the garden and found the prisoner lying there, wounded in the back, I heard him cry out i nstantly; there were no other fire-arms discharged at that time. He implored mercy and requested me to send for a surgeon, which I did. A cooper's gimlet and a dark-lanthorn, with a candle in it, a phosphorus box and matches were found on him. I sent for a surgeon. When I suggested searching him, he said, "you find nothing but implements of house-breaking." He was taken to the hospital. He said that want drove him to that method of life, and I should not have shot him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. I believe he is a member of a respectable family.</p>

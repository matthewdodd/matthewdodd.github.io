                  </hi>. I live at 5, Bolton Street, Piccadilly, and keep house for a gentleman—I have known Jones as collector for the Provincial Union Assurance Company, for some time—I have given him subscriptions—this "William Heather, 5, Bolton Street, Piccadilly," is not my handwriting, inside this blue sheet—I never authorised anyone to write that, or to put me down as a subscriber for five shares—Jones came and asked for the use of my name for registering the society at Somerset House—I had no idea that I was giving him permission to put me forward as a director of this company—I never intended any such thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier at the General Bank of London, 17, James Street, Covent Garden—we have never had an account kept at this bank in the name of the National Provincial Union Assurance and Loan Society—on November, 1868, Reid opened an account at the bank with 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was drawn out within a month or six weeks—on 31st Dec., 1861, there was 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. standing to the credit of field—I knew he was the secretary of some society.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. I do; he came into my shop on the 11th of November, between the hours of eleven and one, I was not at home; I went out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020022"></xptr>about half past ten; I had seen the prisoner before that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him in the shop on the 11th of November. - A. I did not; I came home about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. After you came home you discovered that you lost the things mentioned in the indictment. - A. I examined and missed them.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose your daughter at that time told you she suspected the prisoner. - A. She said there was not any body there but the prisoner, that she could suspect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come to the shop any day after that. - A. This was on the Wednesday; on the Friday following he came to the shop again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him then with stealing the property on the Wednesday. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been often at your shop before. - A. Yes. the last time he was at my shop he asked me if I had such an article.</p>
               <p>Q. When you charged the prisoner on the Friday with having stolen the property, what did he say to it. A. He said upon the word of a man he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him up on the Friday. - A. No, he gave me his address, he told me he lodged at the Temple in the room above Mr. Hoare, which would be above the tiles. Mr. Hoare lives in the attic story; he gave his address, No. 5, Inner Temple-lane above Mr. Hoare.</p>
               <p>Q. You let him go then upon giving his address. - A. Yes, and on last Thursday was a week I met the prisoner in Mrs Hart's shop, a piece broker in Bedford-bury; he then agreed to go before a magistrate with me to take his oath that he did not take it; I proposed it to him and he agreed to it; I applied at Bow-street office, to them that makes the affidavit; when they knew the cause they would not give him one; the oath was not taken.</p>
               <p>- ROBERTSON. Q. You are the daughter of the last witness. - A. Yes, I keep the shop in the time of my father's absence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 11th of November seeing the prisoner coming to your shop. - A. Yes, between eleven and twelve this man came in the shop, he wanted to purchase some cassimere; I shewed him some; he agreed to have four yards and a half of cassimere, and I was to damp it; there were two pieces of cloth remnants in the window, which this man took out a yard and a half each, one brown and the other black; he measured them, he said they would suit him if I could tell him the price; there were neither ticket nor mark on them; I could not tell him the price; I put them back in the same place where they were; he went away then, and left the cassimere for me to damp; he returned about twelve, he brought a great bundle of cloth with him, he wished me to see whether the cloth that he brought with him and the cassimere matched; he untied one end of his own cloth and put the cassimere to it; he asked my opinion of it, I said I thought it matched very well; he said he would untie it further, and then he should see better, he said then he thought it matched very well; I then went to fold up the cassimere out of the damper.</p>
               <p>Q. In doing that did you turn from him. - A. I did, to the other counter, my back was to him two or three minutes, there was nobody in the shop but me and him at that time; I went to fold up the cassimere, he said if I would give him leave he would, he understood folding better than me, he would fold it; I gave it to him to fold; in the mean time he was folding it, a young man came into the shop and another followed; I left him to serve them, I went to the other counter, the young men stood close to the other counter with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on the same side of the counter with them. - A. Yes, all three; one of the young men I knew, he is a tailor; the other I do not know. While I was serving these men Mr. Man tied up his parcel, he wished me a good morning, he went out; he had paid me for the cassimere.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to swear these two men were standing by you at the time he wished you good morning and went out. - A. Yes, I am positive of that. And these two pieces of cloth I swear to being in the window when Mr. Mann came in.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very clear from what you have said because he took them down. - A. But that was the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Very true; but in the interval of time from his first coming in, and the second time, had you seen them. - A I did, and there had nobody been in the shop at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you all that interval in the shop. - A. I was not, I was in the kitchen on the same floor; I could see into the shop, and there is a bell at the shop door, it could not be opened without hearing it.</p>
               <p>Q. When Man was gone what became of the two men - A. They went out one after the other; one purchased a piece of cloth, which came to ten pence; he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. In passing through the door way could he go up to where the remnants were. - A. He could not the door went back between the remnants and the door way, he left the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. As the door was open, it in a manner covered that part of the window where the remnants were. - A. It did; then the other man sold me two dozen of buttons; I paid him and he went out, I shut the door after him myself; there was no one in the shop from then till my father came home; after my father came in a gentleman came in to ask for the quantity of one of these pieces of cloth, my father went to shew him the cloth, both the remnants were missing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I believe no part of this property has been found. - A. None.</p>

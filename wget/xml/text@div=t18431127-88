                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger. On Friday, 24th of Nov., I had two pieces of cheese on a board outside my shop window, with a ticket on them—I missed them about a quarter of an hour after I had placed it there, and saw it within twenty minutes after at a house in White Bear-gardens, where I went with the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 24th of Nov. I was in my father's shop, and saw the prisoners waiting outside Mr. Hellen's shop, which is nearly opposite—I watched them, and saw them speak to each other—Smith put his hand on the cheese, as if going to take it—I had occasion to turn round to speak to a person in the shop, and when I turned round again they were running away, and the cheese was gone—Smith had on an apron, which he held up, and it had a bulk in it—I told my brother which way they had run, and he ran after them—I am sure the prisoners are the persons—I knew them well before by sight.</p>

                  </hi>. In consequence of my sister speaking to me, I ran down Union-street, and saw the prisoners turn round Union-walk—I called, "Stop thief," and they ran faster, and ran into White Bear-gardens—Roworth ran straight on, and I lost sight of him—Smith turned into a little place, and into a house—I went for an officer, and went with him into the house, and saw him find, under some straw, these two pieces of cheese, and another policeman found this ticket in the same place—I saw the prisoners in custody on Saturday night—I am sure they are the persons—I had never seen them before—I was about ten yards behind them when they were running.</p>

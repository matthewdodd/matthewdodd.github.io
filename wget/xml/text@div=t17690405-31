On the 23d of February, about half an hour past ten at night, I was alarmed by the watchman, who said, Why do not you come and assist? and who said the next house to me was robbed. I said, You can rob it of nothing but old iron and tools. He said, it was old iron the man had got. I went to the watch-house, and there saw this old iron (produced in Court ) my property.</p>

            . I was at that gentleman's door, and saw the prisoner come out of the next house with a load. He piled it up in a heap, and went in, and presently he came out again with a bar, and it made a noise against a post. I knew it to be iron. I said to him, What have you got? He was going off. I said, My friend, I must know what you have got. I ran, and catched hold of him, and he threw the old iron about my legs. I called for help. There were two gentlemen coming along, who stopt him, and we brought him to the watch-house. I said, I would send him to Newgate. He said, It is hard to be sent to Newgate for old iron; that he said as I was bringing him to Newgate.</p>

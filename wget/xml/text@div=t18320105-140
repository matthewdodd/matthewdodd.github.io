On the 10th of December I saw this coach-cover at the White Horse, Fetter-lane, and knew it to be my manufacture; I cannot tell when it was last in my warehouse - I never saw the prisoner till he was in custody; the coach-cover was kept in my warehouse, in Montague-close, by St. Saviour's church - they hang near the door till they are dry and fit for use; when I saw it, it appeared to have been recently dressed and fresh - the prisoner was taken the same night; Bonus, who had bought it, said he did not know where he lived - it is worth 26s.; it was in a very unfinished state, and should not have been sold in that state - I told the prisoner we should hold out no promise to him, but he was at liberty to say how he came by it; he at first said he had manufactured it, and on being pressed where he dressed it, he said he bought it of a man in the street - I asked if he knew his name; he said not - I asked how he was dressed, and what age he was; he said he could not tell, and on being further questioned, I think he said he bought it in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you at the last trial say a word about the account he gave of it? A. No, his Lordship did not ask me, and I heard some objection taken to what he said being stated; he did not in my presence say he had received it from Pearce - I cannot tell when it was taken; I have no mark on it, but know the dressing, which is peculiar, and I have no hesitation in swearing to it - I cannot swear I ever saw this identical cloth on my premises: I should think it had not been dressed more than three weeks previous - I believe Pearce was in my employ eight or nine years ago, but I do not know him; I have heard he lodged in Moregan's-lane - he was not charged with this; Bonus said no doubt we should hear of the prisoner about Whitechapel.</p>

            . I am foreman at the White Horse, Fetter-lane - I have known the prisoner all my life. On the 3rd of December I saw him in the street, opposite the White Horse, and bought this cloth of him; he asked 15s. for it - I gave him 14s., as it had no strings; he has been a large farmer, but I have seen very little of him for seven years, till within the last year - I asked him no questions; Edgington's foreman called for orders - I told him I could buy them better than of him; I showed him this, and he said he thought it was Mr. Edgington's property - he did not swear to it at the time, and I took no further notice of it; I did not know where the prisoner lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he has once been much better off? A. He was worth 8,000l., I believe, but fell into misfortunes - I believed him honest; he has dealt in sacking, hay, and straw for the last year - I bought two cloths of him before; he brought this through the street openly, under his arm, and told me he manufactured these things himself - I see nothing remarkable in it; he was always about Whitechapel - it may be worth 18s. or 20s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you swear this is completely finished? A. Certainly not, it only wants strings - the prosecutor claimed it from the peculiarity of the dressing.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. What do you usually give for covers? A. The usual value is 1l. with strings; I did not know this was wider than common - Mr. Edgington found that out.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 10th of December, in Bishopsgate-street, and as I took him to the Compter I told him it was for having a till in his possession of Mr. Edgigton's - he immediately fell down in a fit, and said nothing: I inquired in Whitechapel, and got information where he lived - I went to his son's and found no manufactured cloths there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Bonus told you you would find him in that neighbourhood? A. Yes; he at last gave me the name of Pearce, as having got it from him: I went to Pearce in consequence of his information - he has been convicted.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has Pearce been convicted of this offence? A. I took him on account of this being stolen, but finding other property there nothing more was said of this; he is convicted of robbing Deacon and Co., of Smithfield - he lived in Morgan's-lane, Tooley-street, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's warehouse.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's fureman, and have been so about six years.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did your master, at the last trial, swear it was worth 26s.? A. I was not here; I say what we should sell it for - it is worth 26s. with strings; it is complete, except the strings and stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. You stamp it to know it again? A. Of course, to recommend it to our customers - I did not know Pearce;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050076"></xptr>it might have been made three months for what I know - I cannot say I ever saw this identical one.</p>

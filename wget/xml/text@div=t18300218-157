            . I live in the Hackney-road. On the 5th of February I went to <placeName id="t18300218-157-crimeloc880">Smithfield</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How often had he it from you to try to dispose of on commission? A. I have been to sell it three times, and my son several times; he never had from me - I received the letter on the 6th, but he was not apprehended till Monday, the 8th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not come to you on Monday, the 8th, in person, tell you he had been robbed, and put down four sovereigns, which he had borrowed to pay you? A. He did not put down any money; he said he had four sovereigns, if I would take it, compromise it, and make a debt of it - I refused; he had appointed to meet me by letter at the White Hart, and offered to pay four sovereigns - he said he had been robbed; he did not show me his pocket - I had an officer, and he was apprehended; I understand four sovereigns were found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The horse was in a stable? A. Yes, at Newman's, in London-wall; I should never have trusted him to sell it for me - he had said he would come directly, after drinking some rum and water with me, and he never came; I never authorized him to sell it, only to find a customer - he attends the market for that purpose.</p>
               <p>JOHN JACKSON. On the 5th of September I was showing the horse for sale in Smithfield; the prisoner came and informed me the horse was sold, that he had made it all right, and settled with the governor - this was between six and seven o'clock; I was in the market - he said he had settled, and would make it all right with the governor; the horse was in the market - he took off the saddle and bridle, gave them to me, and told me I was to take them home; I have never seen the horse since - I did not see Mr. Wynn till next morning - I then told him of this; I saw the prisoner at Guildhall on the Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At the time he told you the horse was sold, was it not in your possession? A. Yes, and the purchaser was present as far as I know; there was a man who said he was the purchaser - the prisoner took it away with a halter; there was nothing to prevent his taking the saddle and bridle - he had the horse out of my hands eight or nine times to try to sell it, on three different days; I always led the horse about, and he brought gentlemen to look at it - he sometimes rode upon it; I did not lead it then - he has rode it about three or four times</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know where your master was, when he took the horse away? A. There were two persons with the prisoner; he did not say which was the purchaser - neither of them said they had bought it: they went away together - I was not to sell the saddle; he said he had settled with the governor - my master was at the Greyhound</p>
               <p>JOHN FORRESTER. I am a constable. I apprchended the prisoner at the White Hart, Giltspur-street; Mr. Wynn was with me - he said he had four sovereigns to pay; Wynn gave him in charge; I found four sovereigns and a duplicate on him - he said he had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not go to the White Hart expecting to meet him there by his appointment? A. Certainly, from what Wynn said.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WYNN re-examined. I had seen the prisoner once before; I am well known at Hackney - the letter was directed to Hackney; I live in the Hackney-road - the bridle and saddle did not belong to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I could not direct the letter right; I did not know Mr. Wynn's address - I leave my case entirely to your consideration.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHURCH. I lodge with the prisoner, at Mrs. Coker's, Brackley-street, Golden-lane. On the 5th of February, about one o'clock in the night, I saw him in Beech-street, Barbican, about three hundred yards from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180075"></xptr>our lodgings; I found him laying on the pavement, and said, "Halloo old chap, what do you here?" I looked at him, not knowing him, and saw it was him - I lifted him up: he was very much intoxicated; his breeches pockets were torn down - he said he had been robbed, and in the morning his landlady lent him another pair of trousers while his own were mended; there was nothing to prevent his running away - he came home regularly to bed at night.</p>

            . My husband is a town-carman. -The prisoner has lodged with us above twelve months, and conducted himself remarkably well - I saw him on Saturday morning, the 6th; his trousers pocket was ripped down to the thigh - I asked how it came to be done; he said he did not know - I lent him four sovereigns on Monday morning; he said he had been robbed of some money not his own, and he wanted to make up all he could for the gentleman, and had pawned a coat to try to make up some more.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Cumberland-street, Hackney-road—on 5th August, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the evening, I was crossing Hackney-road, near Union-street—some persons came, one pushed the other against me, and pushed me down into the road—one man came on the right side of me and said, "What did you knock the old lady down for?"—he picked me up, snatched my parcel, and ran down Crabb-tree-road—another ran after him, who I believe was the person who knocked me down—that was the prisoner—my parcel contained a silk parasol, a new muslin dress, a family gold brooch set in pearls, some stockings and other things—I got up as quickly as I could, and gave information of the robbery—there were other persons behind me—my opinion was that they all belonged to one another.</p>

I am an engineer's clerk, and live in Crabb-tree-row—on 6th July I was standing at my door between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening, and I saw the prisoner walk by with two other men—I saw him again from 10 to half-past 10; he came by from Hackney-road running very fast; he had a parcel under his arm, in a lightish paper, about sixteen or eighteen inches long—I am quite positive it was the prisoner I saw.</p>

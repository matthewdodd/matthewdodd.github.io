               <p>Messrs. Beiridge's barges, <hi rend="italic">Hannah</hi> and <hi rend="italic">William</hi> lying off the City Flour Mills, in the Thames—the <hi rend="italic">Hannah</hi> was laden with wheat in sacks—I was in charge of the <hi rend="italic">Hannah</hi>, stationed at Blackfriars, to look after barges—Nicholson had brought up the <hi rend="italic">Hannah</hi>, and both barges were left in my charge—there was nothing in the <hi rend="italic">William</hi>—they were lying about 20 yards apart at 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw the two doors of the fore-scuttle of the <hi rend="italic">William</hi> were open, and the gratings were standing in front of the doors, and I was able to see that there was nothing in the cabin—at 5 o'clock the <hi rend="italic">William</hi> was still there, and at 8 o'clock on the Tuesday morn<lb></lb>ing, both were still at the wharf, but the doors of the <hi rend="italic">William</hi> were shut—I was not able to see into the scuttle until I went on deck and lifted up the hatch, and I saw four sacks full of wheat—I knew that to be wrong—there ought not to have been anything in the scuttle—I said nothing to anybody at the time—Hester came on board the <hi rend="italic">William</hi> on Tuesday, between 9 and 10 o'clock; no one else was on board—he pushed off and proceeded down the river—I watched the barge and saw her near Southwark Bridge, she passed us; I was standing on Paul's Pier—she touched South wark-Bridge; Hester jumped up just before and straightened her down the river—I went to London Bridge and took the steamboat on to Cherry Gardens; I passed the <hi rend="italic"> "William</hi> at Horsley down, and Hester was in charge of her then—I afterwards went to William Berridge, in Jamaica Level—I heard the orders given to Hester that he was to take the <hi rend="italic">William</hi> to Lucas Spencer's, and to load wheat into the empty sacks—Lucas &amp; Spencer's wharf is lower down the river than Cherry Garden Pier.</p>

Hester only passed the compliments of the morning before he went down with the tide—he did not complain that I should have put a tarpaulin over the sacks; it is usual to put tarpaulins over them—none was put over them that morning—with regard to the <hi rend="italic">Hannah</hi>, I saw wheat in some of the sacks—it is usual to give all the air we can and to keep the scuttle open—when the sacks are on board we shut it—I did not count them on this occcasion.</p>

The governor's place is at Jamaica Level—Cherry Garden Stairs are next to his place—I have known sacks to be over before—I have been in my business five years—different flour factors buy portions of the cargo—on this occasion I fetched 194 quarters—I had not fetched any more from that ship—I do not know of any more being fetched from the same ship—I am out of my time as apprentice—I have known Hester three or four years—he has not all that time been in Messrs.

                  </hi>. I live in Jamaica Level—I manage the business of my sister—I am also employed by Messrs.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. The prisoner has been in my deceased brother's and my sister's service over four years—I did not say at the police-court six—we placed every trust in him—Nicholson gave me information about the four sacks on the Monday, about dinner time—I could not tell you whether at the time he told me he had mentioned it to Hester—the <hi rend="italic">Wil<lb></lb>liam</hi> is a two-commanded barge attimes—we always send two men—as a rule there was no oocasion for her to have had two men to have brought her up before reaching Gordon Wharf—Hester was on shore when I went on board the <hi rend="italic">William</hi>—I will pledge my oath he never said anything about the four sacks being on the barge—I did not tell him that he had four sacks on board—he never told me he had the four sacks and was going to speak to me about them—the sacks were to be filled at Lucas &amp; Spencer's to come back in the <hi rend="italic">William</hi>—it is the general course of business when a ship arrives from India that the cargo is sold to different persons; parcels greater or less according to the requirements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The information about the four sacks was given me by Nicholson—it is usual to report anything that is over and the men always tell me—there is no authority to remove them from one barge to another—the <hi rend="italic">William</hi> was not employed by anyone else on that day only by Mr. Hadley—it was ascertained that there were four sacks in excess by counting</p>

                  </hi>. I and my three brothers are partners in the City Flour Mills—Indian grain is unpacked from the original sacks and put into our own—it is only the last two years that we have received much wheat from India—in this case it had been taken from the ship—Berridge acted in this and acts in every like manner for ns as waterman—of course I have no par ticular knowledge except through him—it would not be proper for any sacks full of grain to go down the river—it was not right for anyone to remove sacks full of grain from the <hi rend="italic">Hannah</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">William.</hi>

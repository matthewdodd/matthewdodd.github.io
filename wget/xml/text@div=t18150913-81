            . I am porter at the Saracen's Head, Snow-hill. On the 22nd of June, the prisoner arrived at our inn, by the Portsmouth coach, slept there that night and the next day went away. The next day, I went to the York Hotel, and there heard that the prisoner, or a foreigner answering his description, had taken up his abode there. I asked the waiter to let me look at his trunk; which I did, and then was convinced it was him. The next day the waiter's clothes were stolen, and I went to Bow-street to get an officer, and on our enquiring at the Golden Cross, Charing Cross, we found that the prisoner had sent his trunks there, and was to sleep there that night, in order to go off by some one of the coaches in the morning. We examined his room, and there we found the waiter's clothes laying open and exposed in the room, but his trunks fast. Beresford knew them to be his property. We gave information at the bar, and requested to be informed when the prisoner came in, which was at eleven o'clock that night, and then he was taken into custody; he was taken to the watchhouse, and on Monday morning to Queen-square office.</p>

            . I am an officer. On my arriving at the Golden Cross, I went up stairs to the prisoner's room, No. 34, and unlocked it, and in it, we found two tranks, a leather one, and a pasteboard one, and loose on a chair were laying all the prosecutor's clothes, which he missed, except the silk stockings, which were afterwards found in one of the trunks. By the direction of Mr. Fielding, I brought every thing of the prisoner's to the office. Here are the clothes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Being deprived of my papers and money by the Police, I have been unable to procure an advocate: I have therefore committed my defence to paper in my own language, and will take the liberty of reading it to the court. I am an <rs id="t18150913-81-deflabel460" type="occupation">officer in French Army</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18150913-81-defend724 t18150913-81-deflabel460"></join>, and served under the Emperor Napoleon in all the battles on the Continent, and in Egypt, where by an ophthalmia I was nearly deprived of my sight, and cannot distinguish any object except by the assistance of my spectacles. On the return of the Bourbon family to the French Throne, I was honoured by having a commission in the Garde De Corps. But soon after Napoleon returning from Elba, and I wishing not to draw my sword against my lawful Savereign, I returned, by the advice of my friends, to this Country, where I remained at bath for a considerable time. In June last, I came to this City to meet some of my brother officers; I took up my lodging at the York Hotel,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130028"></xptr>at which place the innocent cause of my present misfortunes arose. I have been reared in the paths of rectitude and truth by my excellent parents, and am confident that justice for which a British Jury is celebrated throughout Europe, will this day be shewn towards me. I am most innocent of the charge which is imputed to me, and I will in a moment account for this unhappy mistake. The morning after I arrived in London, I received orders with some of my brother officers, to join my regiment; the next morning, I packed up all my clothes, and went to the Golden Cross, Charing Cross, but then found the coach had gone off. I returned to the York Hotel to change my trowsers, and without going up into my own room, went into an empty room, which I saw open, and there unpacked the whole of my things in one trunk, as my trowsers were at the bottom; in re-packing them, I suppose it was, that I put up the clothes of the prosecutor's; for as I said before, I am so blind that I never perceived them; I then went to the Golden Cross, determined to sleep there that night, in order to be in time for the coach the next morning. When I went into my room, I put my spectacles on, and on examining my clothes, was greatly surprized to find a coat, waistcoat, shirt, and stockings, which did not belong to me; I could not conceive how they came there, and it was not until I was in prison, that I supposed they came there, by the means I have suggested. I did not conceal them as if stolen, but put them openly out, and locked my trunks. Unfortunately all my papers and trunks have been kept from me, together with a pocket-book, which if I had, I might be able to convince the Court and Jury of the rank I held in the French Army, and of my belonging to the Legion of Honor. I have not a friend in this Country, as all my brother officers are gone. I have only again to repeat my innocence, and place myself in the hands of a British Jury, from whom I am sure I shall receive justice.</p>

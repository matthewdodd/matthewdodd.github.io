               <p>Q. Did you lose any of your property on the 5th of April? - A. There was a silver watch of my nephew's lost from the premises, and all the articles mentioned in the indictment; I saw all the linen, I believe, about twenty minutes before hanging up on the line in the kitchen; she absconded about half past ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen your table-spoon? - A. I saw it at one o'clock, when at dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time do you shut up your house? - A. About ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss this woman out of your house? - A. At eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether your house was shut up safe? - A. The way that I came to discover it, was this; it was the usual practice of the servant to set up to let the man in for his nightly labour, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110067"></xptr>came, and knocked at the door two or three times; the man begins his work at eleven at night, and myself about two; she was not there to answer the door when the man knocked; he rung the bell, and not hearing the servant attend the door, I went down to let the man in, or rather, the door was open to let the man in, but he did not discover it; I called to the prisoner by name, and told the man the door was upon the jar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the door upon the jar at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure? - A. I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - A. Yes, I have four children, my wife, and a nephew.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your wife gone to bed? - A. Yes; I secured the door, as I usually do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man and you look over the house? - A. I went into the kitchen, and perceived the things were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the woman again? - A. On Monday, the 9th of April, I saw her in Lambeth-street Office, Whitechapel, in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things again? - A. One petticoat only.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has got that? - A. The person who took it into pledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that produced at the Office? - A. Not at the Office she was first taken to; she was sent to Bow-street, and there I attended, and saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she given you any intimation that she meant to leave you? - A. No; we were quite happy to think that we had got a woman that suited us so well; she was a very handy woman in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it the same day you pawned these things? - A. The very same day; she took this petticoat out of a bundle; she said, I have no money; she offered the petticoat to a little girl that was there; I said, they will not take things of little children; she said, will you take it; I went and pawned it, and gave her the money; I live at No. 4, Nag's-head-court, Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Look at that petticoat, is it a child's or a woman's? - A. A woman's petticoat, it is my property; here is a drop of wine has been spilt upon it; I heard my wife give directions to get that stain out.</p>

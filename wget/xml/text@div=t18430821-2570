The prisoner is a labourer, and lived about 600 yards from me—on the 1st of Aug. I was drinking with him from about ten till half-past one o'clock—I had a dispute with him, and we parted at that time—he went away—I remained—we were at a public-house in Tooley-street—I went to different houses, from the time he left me till eight o'clock, when I went home—I was very tipsy, and was led home—I do not know what happened—I was helpless—I did not see the prisoner in my way home—when I got home, I found I was wounded very badly indeed—I have been under the doctor's hands ever since, at the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old, and am the prosecutor's sister. I met him in Russell-street, Bermondsey, between seven and eight o'clock—he was able to walk, but not well—he was very drunk indeed—I helped him home—I met him above a hundred yards from home—he went home quietly down the court—we met the prisoner in the court—he hit my brother, and knocked him down—the prisoner was tucking his shirt collar down when I met him—he struck my brother several times while he had him down, and every time he struck him blood flowed—I saw something glittering in his hand, like a knife—Robert Parker was sitting at the door of his sister's house—several persons came out of that house—Parker's brother came out, and pulled the prisoner from my brother—I saw my brother go into the door of his house, but I did go in.</p>

               <p>sitting out in the court, not doing anything, not drinking—Buckley-came home very tipsy—he came straight to my door, then the prisoner <hi rend="italic">pitched</hi> into him—they both had their clothes on then, and both fell together—the prisoner did not seem tipsy—I did not see Buckley fall on anything but the stone paving—I saw the blood spring out after he fell two or three times, first from his eye, then from his head—there was some on his arm—I could not tell where it came from—my sister fetched Fenson, the policeman, who took him home, and went to the top of the court, when the prosecutor came out again, bleeding—he had bis clothes on then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. On 30th Sept. I was selling fruit in a barrow, in Brewer-street, golden-square—the prisoners came up, and Barry asked for a penny<lb></lb>worth of pears—he gave me a half crown—I gave him a shilling, with a Queen's head on, and a sixpence—I was going to give him the rest in half<lb></lb>pence, when Allen said, "Never mind changing the half crown," and she produced a penny—Barry gave me back a shilling and a sixpence, and I saw that the shilling was one with a King's head on it—the prisoners immediately left—I saw the shilling that Barry had given me was bad—I put it to my mouth, and bent it—I went with a policeman after the prisoners—I saw them by the stall of a woman who was selling fruit at the corner of Carnaby-street—when Barry saw me he ran away, but he was pursued, and stopped, and given in charge—I had the shilling in my hand, and I gave it to the policeman at the station.</p>

In consequence of what the last witness said, I went, and saw the two prisoners at a fruit stall, at the corner of Carnaby-street—as I approached them, Barry said something to Allen, and he ran away immediately—as he was going he threw something away, which appeared like silver, but I could not say it was silver—it fell down a grating in the street—he was stopped by a gentleman soon afterwards, and was handed to me—I took him to the station—I found on him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money, and one counterfeit shilling—he said, "You won't find any more; that is all I have"—I received this counterfeit shilling from the last witness—when I went in pursuit of Barry, I gave Allen in charge of another officer—she was searched by a female, who gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoners denied all knowledge of each other, and said they had met one another in the street that morning—Allen gave her address at 20, Brunswick-street, New-road—I went there, and no such person was known.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far was the last fruit stall from the stall of the first witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 300 yards; the prisoners were standing before, apparently dealing—when Barry saw me coming he ran away, when I was twenty yards from them he turned round, saw me, and spoke to Allen, and then ran away—he threw away something that looked like silver—I was then about ten yards from him—there was a convenient sink which it fell into—it was a sink where the water runs down—I heard what he threw jink—I stated that in my examination—Barry gave his address, which was correct—when he ran, he ran 300 or 400 yards—I was in sight of him all the time.</p>

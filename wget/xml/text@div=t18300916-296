            . I am an out-pensioner of the 66th regiment, and live at Chelsea. On the 2nd of September I met the prisoner coming out of Chelsea at half-past ten o'clock in the morning, driving a pig - I suppose it was three-quarters of a mile from Mr. Brown's; it was a very large sow; the road was newly covered with flint stones, and her belly hung on the stones; I said to him, "Drive her on the side and then she can't injure;" I went on and met Mr. Brown, who said he had stolen it - I thought it was a joke, and I said, "That won't do;" I went on about ten yards further, and met another man - he asked if I had seen a man driving a pig; I said Yes; he said, "He has stolen it;" I turned and followed him - the prisoner took the first turning, they went down the second; I took the same turning as the prisoner did - he went on to some buildings where there were boards projecting from the area; he got over the boards and dropped down fifteen feet; I followed him - there were a number of men who said he was in this room and that room, and the cellar - I lost him, but was on the look out for him for some days, when I saw him looking over the curtain of a lower room; I got an officer, we could not get in - the officer broke the door open and took him; he asked what he had done - he said it was on a charge of felony; he said, "My father sent for me, and told me all about it - it is for stealing a pig."</p>

I lost the sow from a little bit of grass where I had turned her to graze - I heard she was gone, and pursued her; I met this witness - the prisoner turned down a turning, and I went down the next turning; he took up two or three stones to throw at the sow, and turned to see if any body was watching him - we lost him in the buildings; I had not seen him before - he left the sow, and I took it.</p>

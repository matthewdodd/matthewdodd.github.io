                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">on his behalf, applied to the Court that the indictment should be quashed, on the ground that a charge of obtaining by false pretences from two different persons could not be made in one indictment; that the prosecutor was only bound over to give evidence in reference to the charge of obtaining by false pretences from Hester, but that a second count had been added to it, which, although it was an offence ejusdem generis, a different person was alleged to be defrauded, and therefore, as regarded the second count, the indictment was untenable.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on the same side, submitted that the two counts were two separate transactions, and that if part of the indictment was quashed, the whole must be.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">for the prosecution) contended that the two counts were part of one transaction, and that Mr. Hester and Mr. Grainger were both bound over to prosecute, and give evidence against the prisoner.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">urged that they were bound over merely as witnesses, in the same way as the policeman was bound over; his contention was, that if this was a good indictment, then the object of 22 and 23 Vic., c. 17, would be entirely defeated, and any person getting a committal of a prisoner for one offence might indict him for twenty others which were never dreamt of by the Magistrate; he then contended that the Court had no power to quash an indictment part, it must be dealt with as a whole, and as this indictment (the second count) had been found without proper authority, the whole was bad; the whole record, as presented by the grand jury, was not accompanied by that condition precedent of exami<lb></lb>nation before a Magistrate, and binding over to prosecute.</hi>

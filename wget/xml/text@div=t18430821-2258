                  </hi>. I live at Wapping-wall, and work for a ship<lb></lb>ping master—on the 4th of July I was at the Coach and Horses, High-street, Shadwell, about three or four o'clock in the afternoon—two sailors went in with me to get some half-and-half—the prisoner who was there asked them for some beer—one refused, the other said, "Give her a drop"—the prisoner then took the pot and glass and handed them round with the beer—the sailor said Come, you have not had any beer, old man, yet;" and while he was putting the pot over to call for more, the prisoner took a silk handkerchief out of his pocket and placed it under her arm or shawl—I said, "That won't do, <hi rend="italic">'stow</hi> that; if you want to rob anybody, you must rob them at home, don't rob</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184308210052"></xptr>
               <p>them here"—the landlord said, "Unless you deliver that handkerchief up, to prison you shall go," and with great reluctance she threw the handkerchief at him, when she found the landlord coming—after a bit she got it a second time from the sailor, and put it under her petticoats—I told her it would not do, she should deliver it up—Smith, the landlord, said, "Unless you deliver it up, to prison you shall go," and was coming round—she had a glass of ale and threw it in my face—I went to wipe my face, and she said "You d—d old b——r, I will bury this glass in your skull"—she threw the glass directly at my head, and cut it—the policeman was coming just at the moment, and took me to the station—they washed the blood away—they took me to the London hospital—the glass was extracted there—my head is not well yet—I was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the house—the prosecutor came there with two sailors—the prisoner threw a tumbler of beer at him, and then the tumbler itself, and cut him in the head—before that, I had seen her take the handkerchief once out of the sailor's hands—he was sober—one of them ordered her to give it up, which she did—she denied it at first—Smith, the landlord, said he would send her to prison if she did not give it up, and she returned it—she said that it was through the prosecutor, and called him robber and thief, and threw the glass at him, as he was taking his hat off to get his handkerchief to wipe his face—he was about a yard from her—she appeared to aim the blow at his head with force—she appeared in a passion—the sailors did not charge her with stealing the handkerchief, but went away—she had before that, let the glass fall—she was not intoxicated—she is in and out of our house five or six times a day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a student at the London hospital, and have been so two years—the prosecutor was brought there—he had a lacerated scalp, and was bleeding very much—the wound was not very deep—it was a kind of torn cut of the scalp, deeper than the skin—a small artery was wounded just under the cut, which caused the bleeding—there was not much mischief—there was danger of erysipelas following—there was no ap<lb></lb>pearance of erysipelas, but it was impossible to tell for a few days—about three inches of skin was broken—it was rather a clean cut—I found five very small pieces of glass in the flesh—I suppose the tumbler broke in coming in contact with the head—he has not been in any danger—it was rather a severe wound—I should suppose the glass was broken from the force of the blow—I think a glass thrown from the hand at about three feet distance would produce it—I should term it a severe laceration of the scalp—he was ill four or five weeks—the cut is not quite closed yet—his body was in a good state—the wound would have healed of its own accord with a piece of rag round it—it wanted strapping—the bleeding was the most dangerous symptom—there was no inflammation—I took off the strapping in three or four days as a little matter had formed, and cleaned the wound—Mr. Luke, one of the surgeons of the hospital, also saw him—he was kept in bed and on low diet—the wound was not more than the eighth of an inch deep—it was rather an angular form—I found five small pieces of glass in the wound—it must have been broke in coming in contract.</p>

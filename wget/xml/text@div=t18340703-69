            . I am the wife of James Colwell - the prisoner was in my service for six days - I missed half-a-crown and two sixpences from the till on the 31st of May - I had seen them safe the minute before - no one had been near the till but the prisoner - he was then gone backwards - when he came in I accused him of robbing the till - he said he had not, he had not a farthing about him - I called Mr. Palin, who found on him this half-crown and one sixpence - he said he had no more, but he found another sixpence in his pocket.</p>

            . I was in the parlour, and the prosecutrix called me - the prisoner said he had not a farthing in the world - I said I would send for an officer - he then said he had a half-crown and a sixpence, which his mother gave him to purchase a hat - I said that would not do, he had another sixpence - he then produced another sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was cleaning the bar - I went into the skittle-ground - when I came in again my mistress accused me of this money - I had not taken any out of the till - I pulled out 3s. 6d. and 1½d. - the 1½d. was my own.</p>

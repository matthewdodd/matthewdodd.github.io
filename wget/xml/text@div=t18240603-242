At the latter end of March I let the prisoner a lodging, at 6 s. a-week - she said she had a husband coming from sea - he came that night, and continued with her about three week - she quitted on the 20th of May without warning - after her husband went away she did not pay - he had left her the week after Easter - she owed for about five weeks - she said she had money from her husband monthly, and when she received her money she would pay me - the room had been locked before, but her husband burst the door open - when she went away she left it locked, and took the key - we forced the door open, and missed the articles stated in the indictment, which I have not seen since - they were in the room after her husband left - I did not see her again till about a fortnight after, when I took her at Limehouse - my husband accused her of robbing the room - she said the things were at the washer-woman's in King-street, and she would get them - I went there, but they were pawned.</p>

I spoke to my brother about it, and said Bowles is a thief. In about five minutes afterwards there were two dozen of whisk brooms thrown out; I let them all hang just as they were till eight o'clock in the evening. When he left work, he bid us good night as usual and went away; then my brother and I followed him. We found him in the court behind the water tub; we found this mat and the other things. I asked him how he could think of robbing me in this way, and what he could say for himself; he said; what can I say. I said you must go with me to the watchhouse; he begged me to let him go and he would call the next morning and settle it with me. I gave him in charge; and he without any promise or threats said he was tempted by the devil to do it. The bands I found in his pocket.</p>

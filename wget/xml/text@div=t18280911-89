On the 26th of July, about half-past one o'clock at night - I had spent the evening with a friend, and fell in with the prisoner by King's Arms-yard; she came up, took hold of my arm, and pressed me to take her home, which I said I would not do; she pressed me to walk with her a short distance, to the end of <placeName id="t18280911-89-crimeloc460">Princes-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you quite sober? A. Quite; I walked to Princes-street with her; I felt her hand in my pocket, in an instant after I felt the snatch at my watch; I seized her right arm - I suppose she must have put the money into her private pocket when she was in the watchman's charge, as I saw her hands moving; I told her she had robbed me of 5s. 6d., and told the watchman so, before she was searched - she did not call the watchman herself.</p>

            . I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in; the prosecutor charged her with robbing him of 5s. 6d. - she said she knew nothing about it, and had only 2s. about her; I found 2s. in her pocket, but felt something lumpy in the corner of her pocket, and found in a part, sewed from the rest, a half-crown and three shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The watchman who took her is not here? A. No, she said something about the prosecutor spraining her wrist - he denied it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I was going through Coleman-street, to Crooked-lane, when the prosecutor passed me - he then turned round, and followed me; he spoke of the lateness of the night; I said I had been at work all day, and was going to sit up with an elderly lady; when we turned into Princes-street he asked me to cross to the Bank side - I told him No, I would not, I liked the light side best; when he seized hold of my arm, and was guilty of the most unbecoming liberty; he sprained my wrist, I am a cripple in it at this time; I screamed out for the watchman, but he did not come to my assistance - my prosecutor called, and he came immediately, when the prosecutor accused me of robbing him of 5s.; when he came to the watch-house he said 5s. 6d. - I had 7s. 6d. in my pocket, (which was one I had not worn for many years, my other being wet) - it had been used for cleaning irons. A few years back I kept a boarding and lodging-house at Walworth, and had a lady, a niece of Lady Melbourne's, lodging with me, for whom I used to market, and had made that division in the pocket to separate her money from mine; I had that evening received 2s. 6d. for a waistcoat I had made at Hackney, and 4s. for a pair of trousers in Hoxton, and some little repairs in Paul-street, 1s. 3d., making together 7s. 9d., which accounts for the money found in my pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master chimney-sweeper, of 8, Lambeth-hill, Doctor's-commons—the prisoner was in my service as a work<lb></lb>man—on 5th September, I gave him a list, the addresses of work, in the morning; he was supposed to do that and come back again—I saw him about 11 o'clock—I asked if he had received any money, and he said, "No"—he went to other places after 5 at night; one of those places was 15, College-square, Dr. Phillimore's—the prisoner paid me a shilling in regard to that—on the following Thursday, I spoke to him about Mr. Cox, and asked him what he had done there—he said, "The kitchen"—I asked him if he was paid—he said, "No"—I asked him if he had got his <hi rend="italic">selfings</hi>—he said, "Yes, he had received twopence"—I called at Mr. Cox's for the money, and on the Saturday the prisoner went there with me—the housekeeper said she paid him, and Mr. Cox said, "I know she paid you"—the prisoner said, "Then if you paid me I paid it in"—there are no persons in my establishment to whom he can account, besides myself and my wife.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many places had he to go to on 5th September? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Seven jobs, from 4 o'clock in the morning—it was when he returned from those seven jobs that I asked him if he had been paid, and he said "No"—at 5 o'clock he was to go to 15, College-square, and he gave me shilling for that job when he came back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Newton—the prisoner never paid me any money in respect of sweeping Mr. Cox's chimney, on Friday, 5th September—he paid me tenpence in respect of sweeping a chimney it 4, Bread-street-hill, on the evening of that day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> It is all malice that has brought me here. I gave the sixpence to Mrs. Newton, and she never rubbed it off the slate.

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Gofton, a pawnbroker, in Gilbert-street, Oxford-street. -On Saturday, the 5th of November, I was in my master's shop, and saw the prisoner there, offering to pledge some table-spoons - I did not hear what he said at first; Mr. Gofton had the spoons in his hand - I heard him say he wanted to raise the money, and if he would lend him 3l. on them he would redeem them again in March; Mr. Gofton asked if they belonged to him; he said Yes, and that he had other plate at home, a small waiter and silver tea-pot - he was asked where his home was; he said in Mount-row, and mentioned a number, which I do not recollect - Mr. Gofton told me to get my hat and go with him; I then asked him if the plate was at Mount-row - he said it was not, but that a friend of his had had it at Lady Elizabeth Talbot's, No. 40, Hertford-street; I went part of the way up the street with him he then said he saw no reason why he should go with me, and he would not go - I had one spoon with me, and the rest were left at Gofton's; I then said, "We will go back to Mr. Gofton's;" he went back with me as far as the door- Mr. Gofton, seeing us coming back, asked one of the young men in the shop to fetch his hat - he went for it himself, as the young man did not bring it directly; the prisoner then walked up the street, and I by his side- be walked quietly till we got to South Moulton-street; he then said he should go down South Moulton-street; I collared him, and said he should not go - he knocked my arm from him and ran away; I ran after him, and called Stop thief! he then stopped in the middle of the road, turned round, and saw Gofton coming after us - he then walked quietly along to the station-house, and we gave him in charge; I heard him say in the shop that he was out of a situation, in very great distress, and wanted money very bad; this was just after I had got my hat in the shop, and was going to start with him - I produce the six table-spoons, which I have had ever since; I took one with me to the station-house - the other five were left at Gofton's, but when I came from the station-house they laid on the back counter, where I had left them; the six spoons would be worth about 3l.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 5th of November the prisoner came to my shop, and gave me six spoons to pledge - he said they were his own property, that he had been to sea, and mentioned the name of a captain, who, he said, had given him the spoons with other plate - he said that was three years ago, and from the apparent freshness of the spoons I suspected that could not be the case, as they were not tarnished, and I asked where he lived - he said in Mountrow; I said if I went to Mount-row with him could the person there give any satisfaction that the property was his own - he said they could not, but if I went to Hertford-street, May-fair, I might see various articles of plate that were his own; I sent Waters with him - I followed him to the station-house after they came back; I saw him searched, and six table-forks found on him - the forks are worth about 4l.; the weight of silver in the spoons is worth 3l. - they may be worth 4l.; I weighed them - I have not weighed the forks, but suppose them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010008"></xptr>at out the same value, or perhaps a few shillings more -I have not a doubt of the intrinsic value of them all being 6l.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was at the station-house on the 5th of November, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon - Mr. Gofton and his man came in with the prisoner; I searched him, and he himself handed to the clerk these six forks - I found on him 4s. 6d. in silver and 5 1/2d, in copper; as Mr. Gofton said he had varied in his account, I told him not to give us trouble, but to tell us at once where he got them from; I did not either threaten or make him any promise - he said if we would go to No. 40, Hertford-street, May-fair, we should hear of them; that he took them from his master Captain Poulett; that he wanted to try the value of them.</p>
               <p>HONORABLE CAPTAIN POULETT. These spoons and forks are all mine - there were but six of each in use.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) After the evidence adduced against me I beg your attention for a very short time, before proceeding to judge my case, while I state that I am a native of Nova Scotin, and having had an early propensity for a seafaring life I entered his Majesty's service, about twelve years ago, and continued to give every satisfaction to my various commanders untill the period I entered the service of Captain Poulett, of his Majesty's ship the Prince Regent, to whom I was recommended by Captain Southerby, of the Seringapatam. I have lived in the service of Captain Poulett upwards of three years, during which time it has been my only wish to serve him honestly and faithfully, in return for the confidence which he invariably reposed in me, and continued in his service until the fatal morning, when I am afraid that I for ever blasted my prospects in this life, and it renders me at the present time truly unhappy in my mind. Upon the forenoon of the day in question a young man, a former acquaintance, called upon me, and as he was going into the country I, much against my inclination, and totally at variance with the rules of sobriety, that I ever have practised, accompanied him to an adjoining public-house, where he called for some rum, and not being accustomed to drink spirits of any kind I was, from the effects of it, rendered quite insensible. When I returned home I had been cleaning some silver plate, and most unaccountably put some of the articles into my pocket; but from what motive I, after mature and deep reflection, cannot state. I could not have done the action from any dishonest motive, as I had a sufficiency of money in my possession, and my master, Captain Poulett, had also a sum of money of mine in his possession as wages, so that it could not proceed from want. I humble pray the leniency of the Court - I feel deeply impressed with a sense of shame for the act I have committed, which I never could have done in my sober moments, and more so, as my character, both as to honesty, attention to my master's interest in every respect, and sobriety, was formerly unimpeachable.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN POULETT. He lived with me three years - I really thought him one of the best servants I had, both on land and sea, and perfectly honest; he had every thing belonging to me in his charge, and I could leave my house with the greatest satisfaction; I never knew him drunk, water was his beverage - he was always ready to do his duty; I certainly feel much concerned to be his prosecutor, but the knowledge of the circumstance coming to me I could not do otherwise than I have - I think, if it had not been for the impulse of the moment, I should have been disposed to look it over; there were wages due to him, and I had given him money that day to pay bills, which he did pay - Lady Elizabeth Talbot rented my house before I came there.</p>
               <p>MR. GOFTON. I did not know him before; I did not observe that he was tipsy.</p>

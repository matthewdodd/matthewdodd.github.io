                  </hi>. I keep the Victory public-house in Edgware-road. On the evening of 21st Nov. the prisoner came for half a quartern of rum—I served him—he gave me a shilling—I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I marked the shilling, and put it on a shelf in the bar—this is it—next evening he came again, about half-past nine o'clock, for a pint of beer—he offered me a shilling—I said it was bad, and. I should give him in charge—he asked me why—I told him he knew the reason—he said he thought he had not been in my house the night before, but when I called it to his recollection he said he had, for some rum—I sent for the officer, and gave him into custody—I gave the second shilling to the officer.</p>

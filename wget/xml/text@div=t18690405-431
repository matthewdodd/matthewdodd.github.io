               <p>unfurnished apartments at 119, Cornwall Road, Netting Hill—my furniture came up from the country on the 22nd—I saw the prisoner that day—he gave in his card, and said that he was a carpenter, and wished to unpack my things and settle me in the rooms, if I would employ him—I did not know him before—I authorized him to assist me, and he did so on the Tuesday night, Wednesday, and Thursday—he had three men the first day and five the next, besides himself—the rooms were not large enough to hold all my furniture, and some was put in a lower room belonging to the land<lb></lb>lord till 9th January, when the prisoner took it away to warehouse it—the value of what he took away was about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were two washing stands, a table, a wooden waiter, three basins, three sets of washstand fittings, and a lamp—he offered to warehouse them for me, and give me the key, and I authorized him to do so—on 26th December he asked me to give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, and I did so—he asked me for some more the following week, and I asked him to bring me the account, for I should like to settle with him—he brought this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it amounts to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid him altogether 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that bill—about ten days before (25th January) I received a cheque from the country, but there was some informality about it, and I was about ten days before I could get it cashed—the prisoner cashed it for me on the 25th—I gave him a letter to go with it to Messrs. Coutt's, my banker, and he brought me back 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the cheque was for 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I said, "That is not the amount of the cheque"—he said that he had kept 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back for himself for work done for me—I told him I had paid off all but 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I did not know what the other 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for, that it was an illegal way of doing the thing, and I demanded the whole of my cheque—he said that if I employed a respectable solicitor he would tell me that it was all right, and the way that business was done in London—I pressed him for a long time for his account, and at last he drew this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of his waistcoat pocket, and gave it to me—it makes a balance due to him on the last account of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am sure I paid him all but 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the first bill—he had done some fresh work since, he had made a new linen press—when he handed me the bill he said, "I think we will close the account now"—after that he asked me if I would take the things out of pawn—he had pawned a great many articles of jewellery for me to raise money to pay him his bill, but no furni<lb></lb>ture—I never authorized him to part with any of my furniture; indeed, he never mentioned the word pawning to me at all; he offered to borrow some money on the things—I did not understand he was pawning, or else I should not have allowed him to keep the tickets, which I am told I should have kept myself—I afterwards communicated with Mr. McMullen, my solicitor, but before that, on the Monday, I sent for a police-inspector, as the prisoner did not bring me back the pawn tickets as he promised—on 20th February I saw some of my furniture in the shop of Mr. Alexander, which I had authorized the prisoner to warehouse for me—I had told him at one time that if he liked he might sell some of the furniture to get some more money, but I afterwards told him on no account to do so, as I should have to more into larger rooms and should want it—that was on 20th January—I sent for him on that oc<lb></lb>casion, and asked him if he had sold any, and he said "No."</p>

                  </hi>. I am gardener to Mr. Green. On Friday, 24th April, I was in the garden about 5 minutes after 3 o'clock, I cannot speak to a minute—the house stands back about ten yards from the iron gates—I was standing at the corner of the house about four yards from the hall door—I saw a man leave the hall door with a sort of carpenter's basket in his hand; he walked direct from the door to the iron gate, opened the gate, and as he was shutting it, he raised his hat, and said, "Good day," as if he was speaking to some one at the hall door—I see that man in Court, it was the shortest prisoner, Day—as he went from the hall door to the gate, I only had an opportunity of seeing his face sideways—I saw him at the gate when he shut it, and then as he turned towards the hall door, and I saw him after<lb></lb>wards in the cart—there was a cart outside, and a tall man in it; I could not swear to that man—I did not see Day get into the cart, but I saw him in it before he was well seated—I had an opportunity of seeing his face after he got into the cart, he turned and looked back towards the house, towards where I was standing in the road—immediately ascertained that a robbery had been committed—on the next Tuesday evening, the 28th, I went with Cowan, a policeman, and Hunter, a detective officer, to Bethnal Green, to the Reindeer public house—I went in with one of the officers, and saw some men there—I did not see Day there—we came out, and went across the road to the other constable, and as we stood talking there, the prisoner Devo came outside the door, and looked right and left—I spoke to the constable; Devo went back into the house again—the constable and I then went into the house, and met Devo returning, and Day along with him, down the steps into the street—I immediately recognised Day, the moment I saw him—the officers took them both into custody—neither of the officers had pointed Day out to me—I have no doubt now (<hi rend="italic">looking at Day</hi>) that he is the man I saw leaving Mr. Green's house on the occasion in question—Devo resembles the other man that I saw in the cart, in figure and appearance.</p>

               <p>Mr. Green's house—the cart was about 100 yards off when I first saw it—there is a bend in the road, and when I came round that bend I saw it standing there—I approached it, and passed close by it—I recognise the person I saw sitting in the cart, it was Devo, to the best of my belief—I had never seen him before, he was sitting quite still, and when I got within twenty or thirty yards of him, he apparently recognised me as a police officer, and dropped his head down, with the brim of his hat shading his eyes—I was on horseback—I passed very close to the cart, I was looking so intently at the man, that the mare nearly rubbed my foot against the wheel—I believe Devo to be the man—I saw nobody else.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Kynaston, who keeps the Panther public house, in Hope Town, Bethnal Green. I have known Devo for these ten years—I saw him on Friday, 24th April, from 20 minutes past I till nearly half past 1 o'clock, at our house—he deals in jewellery; you may say he is a general dealer, not exactly a hawker; he</p>

               <p>travels—he left our house about half past 1 o'clock, and I did not see him any more until he was in custody—he had a glass of ale, and went into our kitchen—we had a piece of roast beef, and he said, "I should like to have dinner off it," and he touched my servant on the shoulder, and she said, "I wish you would keep your hands off."</p>

That is about five minutes' walk from the Panther—on Friday, 24th April, I saw Devo at my bar—I had just sat down to my dinner; as near as I can say it was half past 1 o'clock—I generally sit down to dinner at 1 o'clock, but it was rather late that day, and I had just that moment sat down as he came in—he called for a glass of half and half and remained there from that time till as near 3 o'clock as I can say—he merely stood there with one or two others, drinking—one was a gentleman named Magnus, one of the officers of the Shoreditch County Court, and the other was Mr. Moulton, a butcher—I do not recollect anybody else;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185705110106"></xptr>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How do you happen to know that this was Friday, 24th April? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have a most excellent guide to go by, and that is that the Excise officer called in at my place on that day, and took my permits away, and signed the book the 24th April—that was at 2 o'clock or a little after—I do not know the Excise officer's name; he never signs his name, only just puts his initials; he is not here, I meant to bring the book—Devo was in front of the bar, not in my room—the three persons I have named were not standing with him the whole of the time—it was about half past 2 o'clock when Mr. Magnus drank with the prisoner—Mr. Magnus did not remain there any length of time, for he had an execution in a house opposite, and he was obliged to go backwards and forwards there—Moulton came in somewhere about 3 o'clock, it was just before the prisoner left—Mr. Magnus had gone then—I think he and the prisoner both went out together, but that I cannot exactly say, for I was about the place about my duty—I did not see Devo leave, but it is my usual practice to go up stairs and lie down about 3 o'clock, and I recollect going up stairs, and leaving him at the bar—Britton was standing at the bar with him; I believe they left together, but I left them at the bar when I went up stairs—I did not look at the clock when I went up stairs—I should not think I lost sight of Devo for five minutes during the whole of the time he was there—I had my dinner while he was there, but my bar parlour is almost in the bar, so that we do not lose sight of any person—I was examined before the Magistrate last Saturday week.</p>

I know Devo—I saw him at my house on 24th April—he came in about a quarter past 3 o'clock, and I left him there at 25 minutes to 4 o'clock, when I went out—I did not see any one else—there was no other customer in the house but him at that time—I did not hear of his being in custody until nearly a week after—I was then called on, and gave evidence before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>twice in a week, and sometimes not once in a month—I should think he had not called in for three months before—I cannot mention any other day on which he was there—I know the exact hour on this occasion, because I could not see Mr. Law, the head man, at Booth's after 4 o'clock, and that made me look up at the clock, and it was a quarter to 3 o'clock just before Devo came in, and as I passed Shoreditch Church it wanted 20 minutes to 4 o'clock—my house is something like 300 or 400 yards from Shoreditch Church.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's solicitor. I was not acting as such on the first examination, when a man named Bennett was produced—when I was instructed, I examined Bennett very carefully, and found he had mistaken the day, and therefore withdrew him—I was not present when he was examined—I did not attend till 2nd May—I understand he was a voluntary witness.</p>

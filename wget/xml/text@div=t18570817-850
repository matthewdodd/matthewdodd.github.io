                  </hi>. I am a water proofer. In March last I worked for the prisoner, at No. 25, Little Alie Street, Whitechapel—I was at work there on Sunday, 15th March, in the back room second floor—there are only two floors to the house—there were more workpeople in the front room belonging to Mr. Sterne—he also occupied a parlour and bedroom on the first floor—a little before 7 o'clock I went down stairs, and saw the prisoner going up stairs—I asked him for a candle to finish my work—he gave me one in one of the little ornaments that was standing on the mantelpiece—I told him the candle would not hold in that, and I did not like to take it—he said, "Never mind, you have not got much to finish," and I took it—I left him in the first floor—I went up stain into the back room again, and put the candle on the table—I went down stairs again directly to a man named Randall, who occupies a rag shop at the bottom—I found him sitting in the back room on the first floor—by the first floor I mean the ground floor—he is in the employment of a person there—as I was going down to him, I saw the prisoner going up stairs—he went up to the back room on the second floor—I did not stop down stairs above two minutes—I then went up into the front room second floor—I remained there about ten minutes—I went out with Mark Robinson, and saw that the door of the back room was shut, and we noticed a light from the bottom of the door—we opened the door, and hallooed out "Fire!" directly—I saw a lot of India rubber cuttings burning on the ground, and a solution pot, with about fifteen or twenty pounds of solution, burning as well—that is an India rubber solution for the purpose of making coats—it was standing on the ground, burning—I saw no fire in any other place—the candle was lying on the ground, <hi rend="italic">outed</hi>—I directly gave an alarm of "Fire!" and, with the assistance of Randall, it was <hi rend="italic">outed</hi>—he brought up some blankets—it was completely put out—we looked round in every corner—Robinson had been at work in the front room second floor all day—the India rubber cuttings that I saw burning were lying about the room, about half way down it, not under the table—they were lying, some pieces here and some there, over half the room—after we had put the fire out, we all went down stairs—there was Robinson, Greenbow, Randall, Mrs. Levine, and her daughter, and two sons and a young man named Goldberg—while we were there, the prisoner came into the passage from the street—he asked, "What is this smoke here for?"—we told him there had been a fire—he said, "Is there anything damaged, anything burnt?"—we said, "No; there is nothing burnt, but the pieces of cutting and the solution"—he sent for a pot of beer; and while</p>

On 15th March I was residing at No. 21, Little Alie Street, with my mother—we lived in the lower part of the house—Sterne lived on the second floor—about half past 7 o'clock in the evening, I remember hearing a cry of "Fire!"—I went up into the back room second floor—I did not go right into the room—I saw into it, and saw a large pot on fire—it was just in the room door, on the right hand side, on the floor, against the wall—it blazed up high—I went and got some blankets, and wetted them in a tank, put them over the pot, and put out the fire—there was no fire in any other part of the room—I opened the window, and let out the smoke—at the time I left the room I know and could see there was no fire whatever in it—I then went down stairs—I met Sterne coming in at the street door—I told him there had been a fire up stairs—he first of all said something in his own language to his own people, then he said that I had no business to put it out, he was insured—he sent for some beer, and several of us drank of it; that was in the first floor front room—he remained there about five minutes before he left the room—I saw him leave it; I did not notice anything in his hand—I heard him going up stairs, he was up stairs about five minutes—he called me, and I went up; he was standing against the front room door; the back room door was shut; he said his things were all spoiled—he then came down stairs again—he stayed in the front room a few minutes, and then he went up stairs again; he remained there between five or ten minutes, and then he called me up again—he said, "Let us see if the fire is all out"—I had just got to the top of the stairs, when he said that—the back room door was shut—I followed him into the front room; he had a candle in his hand, and he went in, and looked round the room—we could not see any fire in the front room—he came out, and opened the back room door, and said, "The room is all in flames"—I saw that it was so; some coats were on fire, hanging up against the fireplace—that was about a yard from the pot that I had previously seen—I immediately ran down, and fetched up the blankets again that I had previously used; when I came up again, Sterne was standing against the top of the stairs—he pushed me back, and said I should not go into the room again—I ran down stairs, and was going to Mr. Manley's, who rents the lower part of the house—an alarm was given, the engines came, and at last it was got out—the back room and part of the staircase was burnt, and the roof; the upper part of the house was seriously burnt—I met the prisoner two or three days afterwards in Church Lane, Whitechapel—he said to me, "Those d—b—s have been troubling me"—I asked who he meant—he mentioned some names that I could not under<lb></lb>stand; Robinson was one, I cannot recollect the others—he said, "Have you heard anything from the insurance company?"—I said, "No"—he said, "If you do, don't say it was the pot on fire."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman. I was called to the fire, it was in the top back room second floor, and the staircase—when I went, Sterne, who I knew before, was in the passage at the bottom of the house; he said, "Frank, for God's sake save the child, there is a child in the top front room"—he knew me very well—I have been to the house four or five times for fires, within, it may be, two years—I went up stairs, but could not get into the front room as the staircase was on fire, and the fire was going through the roof; I should have had to pass through the fire to get to it—I came down again and told him I could not get to it, and that t had not ladders on the engine sufficient to reach it; I sent for the fire escape, and put the engine to work, and put the fire out—there was no child there—the top back room was burnt, the roof was burnt through, and down the staircase as far as the first floor staircase window—after the fire was got under, I went with him to a public house, there were several persons with him. and some men with the engine; he called for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of gin, and said, "Frank, there will be a dispute with the Insurance Company, I expect, over this fire, and I shall call on you as a witness to prove that I had a good stock at the last fire"—I told him I could prove that he had a very good stock then, but I could not tell what he had now, because all that was in the room was destroyed—on the Monday I went with Mr. Perkins, the churchwarden, to examine the premises; the prisoner was there, he said that t had had him for four or five times for fires there, and he heard a cracking noise in the room, and thought the fire was all put out, but it broke out afterwards and burnt the place.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Commercial Place, and am a water proofer. I saw Sterne three or four weeks before this fire—I had bought a lot of waterproof coats that had come back from the Crimea, and he said,</p>

               <p>"I will buy twenty or thirty of you; how much do you want for them?"—I said, "One shilling a piece, I will sell them to you; but they are no good to you, it is only old rubbish"—he said, "Never mind, they will burn well"—I said, "How can you do such a thing?"—he said, "Never mind, you may burn and steal so long as you have got plenty of money in your pocket!"—I said, "I could not do such a thing as you mean to do"—he said, "Then you will be a poor man for ever."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a water proofer, of No. 111, Houndsditch, and am in the employment of Messrs. Silver—Sterne called at my place on the Thursday after the fire, between 10 and 11 o'clock, and asked for Mark Robinson, who lodged there with me—Mr. Bowman, the landlord, said he was not within—he said, "I think he is," and the landlord called me down—he said, "As Mark Robinson is not at home, if he comes home, perhaps you will be kind enough to tell him I want to. see him very particularly, I want to give him something to drink"—he wanted to give him sufficient money to go away to America, for he knew he had been to the insurance office, and that he would ruin him if he remained in London any longer—when Robinson came home, I told him—next Monday evening Sterne came again, at a little after 7 o'clock in the evening; I went down—he said, "Well, is Mark at home?"—I said, "The landlord has just sent him out for an errand"—he said, "Did you tell him?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Did he give you an answer?"—I said, "I told him you were here, and he said to me he had got no reason to wish to leave London, and he did not want any money of you to go away to America"—Sterne said, "Well, I can say if he does not want to go to America, he only wants to ruin me; but before he can get me into trouble, I will get him in sooner"—I said, "How can you get the man in trouble so easily?"—he said, "You do not know me for a day; but you have known me quite long enough, as I can get any man into trouble as easily as you can make a waterproof garment;" then he said, "Look here, one <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Sheppard is gone, and I am the second; only there is not another Jonathan Wild shall be able to beat him"—I think it was on the Friday after that that Robinson was given into custody, or the same Friday, I cannot say which.</p>

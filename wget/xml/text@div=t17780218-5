On Tuesday evening, at about six o'clock, while I was busy in my shop, I heard the cry of stop thief; I went out and followed the cry. The prisoner was taken in New-street, at about 20 rods beyond my door; I did not know at that time that I was robbed; I heard the people say the mercer's shop had been robbed; I brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180006"></xptr> the prisoner, and the person who took him to my house. The person that pursued him desired me to recollect if I had lost any thing; I could not then recollect that I had. The prisoner was taken to the Compter; in a little time my man and I recollected that we had lost a piece of silk and stuff; I have never recovered my property again.</p>

They went off on a sudden; I do not know what became of the stuff.</p>

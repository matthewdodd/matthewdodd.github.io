On the 12th of April this gold watch, gold chain, two gold seals, and gold key were in the window, exposed for sale; the lowest value of them is 15l. - I had seen them safe in the course of the day; about twenty minutes past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner striking at the window - he was a stranger: he struck three times before he broke the window, as it is plate glass; the watch hung within a few inches of the glass - he could easily take it; he appeared to be alone; there was a gentleman and lady looking at the window at the time - I ran out, and seized the prisoner the moment it was done; I seized him with the watch in his hand; he had just stolen it - he had not time to move from the window: I sent for a constable, and had him secured - I have kept the watch ever since; here it is - it has the chain, seals, and key fixed to it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You seized him before he moved - he might have got away before you got out? A. No, he had not time, for the moment I saw him striking at the window, I ran out; he appeared sober - there were two persons standing by the window at the time he did it; when I seized him I had not time to hear what he had to say, as I wished to take care of my window - I sent for a constable, and had him taken.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SAPWELL. I am a constable of the City. I was sent for, and took the prisoner on a charge of stealing the watch; I took him to the watch-house - I asked what he did it for; he turned round, and said, "I suppose it was a fit of delirium;" he appeared to me to be quite rational - I said, "What made you take such a watch as this?" he said, "Oh, I thought I might as well have that as any other - it looked a very good one;" he was quite sober; I knew him about the streets as a beggar - I found a knife in his side pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in distress; I could find no employment - I was in need of money to find bread.</p>

               <p>SIMON CULLOM. I live at Stoke Newington, I am a labouring gardener; I work or Mr. Eade in Church-street. On the 29th of September I came into town, and went into Petticoat-lane to buy some sweet meats; it was then a little after eight, after I bought the sweet meats to put in my window for my wife to sell I turned to go to Brick-lane; I turned into an alley to make water, and coming out of the alley the prisoner and another woman took hold of the basket on my arm; I asked them what they meaned by it, they said they would see what I had got in my basket, and while the other woman had hold of the basket, the prisoner let go and stripped my clothes down, and opened them; she then said to the other woman, let us go. I gave no attention to the money in my pocket; I had no suspicion that they were robbing me.</p>
               <p>Q. They were using no violence to you - A No. After I came out of the alley I went on to Brick-lane, I bethought myself of the money; I felt in my pocket, my money was gone; I then pursued after them. I overtook the prisoner, I accused her of the robbery; I am sure she is the same woman; there was another woman with her when I overtook her, but whether that was the same woman I will not say. I am sure the prisoner is the same woman that stripped my coat open; the prisoner denied robbing me; they both gave me a blow and knocked me down; I got up again and ran after the prisoner; the prisoner was secured, the other woman ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you miss from your pocket - A A dollar, a half crown, and four shillings and sixpence in silver. The prisoner was searched at the watchhouse, she laid down two crown pieces, and said she would pledge the ring off her finger to make up the other money. The officer searched her and found one shilling and sixpence more upon her; there was a sixpence among the money that I had taken in Petticoat-lane to the best of my belief.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. The prisoner was brought into the watchhouse, the prosecutor said she had robbed him of a dollar, half a crown, and four shillings and sixpence; at that time there were two dollars laying on the table, which she wished to give the prosecutor to let her go, and for the remainder part of the money she would pawn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090047"></xptr>her ring to make it up; I searched her, I found on her one shilling and sixpence in silver, and one shilling and nine pence in copper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime; I had a child laid dead at that time; I said I was very sorry it happened at the time; I offered my money to go to my home.</p>

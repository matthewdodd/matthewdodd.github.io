               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About eight o'clock at night I left my mother, she gave me four shillings to buy tea, sugar, and so forth; this boy said if I would give him change for half a crown he would give me something to drink; then he asked me to change a seven shilling piece; I told him I could not; then he said he had lost a seven shilling piece; I said go and find it. He came all that way for me to go and get a candle for him.</p>
               <p>COURT. In order to constitute this a highway robbery, it is necessary that violence should be used, that the money, or whatever it was, must be taken by violence; the lad has told you that his hand was forced open by the prisoner, she being too strong for him.</p>

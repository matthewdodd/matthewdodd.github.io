I keep an hotel in Leicester Square—the prisoner came there in December, and remained about nine days—every day he was at the hotel, he was going the next day, on the 8th day he asked me if I should be able to.' cash a cheque for him—I said yes—he said he was unable to cash it on account of its being crossed, but I could pass it through my bankers—I said "Very well, have you got the cheque"—he said "I will give it you to-morrow"—I said "If you have it, give it me now, and I will send It to my bankers and have it cashed it to-morrow—he gave me this cheque. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 25th December</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">and purported to be drawn by R.C. Wyley, on the Union Bank Princes Street, for 151. endorsed E. G. Irvine</hi>, 6, <hi rend="italic">Somerset Terrace"</hi>) He gave me the cheque on Friday the 29th—on the Saturday afternoon he came down with his portmanteau, said he was going, and handed me an address in France, his father-in-law's, where I could send the balance of the cheque—I said "I don't know that this cheque will be paid, I can't allow you to take your luggage away"—he said "It will be paid all right"—I said "But you cannot take your luggage till I get an answer from the bank"—about, an hour after the porter of the bank came back with the cheque "marked "No account"—I did not let him take his portmanteau—he went away and said "If I cannot come back I will send my messenger and you will give him my portmanteau and the balance"—he never came back or sent any messenger.</p>

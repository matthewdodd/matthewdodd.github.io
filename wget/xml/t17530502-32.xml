               <p>Q. When did you open it?</p>
               <p>Temple. On the 24th of Feb. after this I got a warrant to take up the prisoner, and he was taken up on the 27th at Hampton-court.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business ?</p>
               <p>Temple. I keep a chandler's shop in Ship-yard.</p>

               <p>Temple. He used sometimes to leave it in the key hole.</p>

               <p>Temple. That I don't know ; the prisoner had the key of the room last.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Temple. Because when we went into the room, there was no key in the door, and it was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to leave the key in his box ?</p>

            . I was at the door, opposite the prosecutor's house in the Ship-Yard, near Temple-bar, on the 24th of February; he call'd me in, and desired me to go up stairs, and see this box broke open, saying, he had a great suspicion of some of his goods being there. I, Mr. Corbet, and the constable, went with him, and with a chizel he broke open the top of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box lock'd?</p>
               <p>Jones. It was: we took a catalogue of the goods which he said was his property: it is here in my hand, the goods here produced are the very goods. I remember in particular two fine large smocks: they were packed up in the room, and the constable took the key, after which Mr. Temple went and got a warrant.</p>

            . I am a house painter, so is the prisoner, he was doing work for me at Richmond lodge, he had been at work for me the two last summers and all this spring; he has been trusted in many places of consequence at Richmond, Hampton-Court, Mr. Pel ham's, &amp;c. under me. If he had been a person of that disposition, he had it in his power to have done great mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion of him as to his honesty?</p>
               <p>Abbot. I have a very good opinion of his honesty, he is a very sober honest man, I would trust him with untold gold: the woman told justice Fielding she was sorry she should be guilty of so rash an action, to put any thing into an innocent man's box. I was bail for the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Abbot. As much as the council.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how can you come here to justify a man that can suffer a woman to put things into his box, and after that he sent for it as his property, to be delivered by her husband to him?</p>
               <p>Abbot. I believe the prisoner to be no ways guilty of the thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he never knew of the goods being put into his box.</p>
               <p>Abbot. I cannot know any thing of that, I speak of his behaviour to me, and what the woman said before justice Fielding.</p>

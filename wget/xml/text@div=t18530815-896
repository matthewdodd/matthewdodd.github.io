                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. James Humphreys and three others; they are carpet manufacturers. On the 23rd July, I was in the warehouse, and Johnston came—I did not see any one with him; he offered me this paper, which I read: "23rd July. Please send by bearer one piece of blue fawn, and one ditto claret. <hi rend="smallCaps">USHER."</hi>—Messrs. Humphreys has a customer named Usher—I told the prisoner we had not carpets of that description—he said he would take the nearest we had, as Mr. Usher had an order for nearly a whole piece—I had known Johnston before, he was in the service of Mr. Usher—when he said he would take the nearest we had, I looked them out and entered them in the show book, and gave him a show paper stating the particulars of them; it was a description of the goods he had—I gave him the goods; he took one piece from the warehouse to the truck, I took the other, and he went away with both—when he had them there was a ticket or mark on each of them, but the tickets are now off them—I saw the carpets again next morning.</p>

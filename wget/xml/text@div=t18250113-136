I know the prisoner. On the 4th of September he came, and said he wanted a carriage for a fortnight - he looked out one; I said it would be 2 l. per week; he hired it for two weeks certain, and was then to bring it back again; he told me his name was Lawrence Campbell; that he lived at Croydon, and was the son of General Campbell. I asked him if he could refer me to any one for a character - he said he used to live at Mrs. White's Margaret-street - I went there and asked if he had lived there - she said he did and paid his lodging; he came into the house in the mean time, and I asked him what he was going to do with the carriage; he said to go into the county of Kent, and to treat some ladies - I asked him if he had the means - he said he had 700 l. per year. I cautioned him not to make too free. He had the carriage out on Sunday, the 5th of September - it went away with post horses; at the end of a fortnight the carriage did not come back - I gave him another week, and then made what inquiries I could. I went to Brighton but could not hear any thing of him. I found the carriage in the fourth week at Mr. Dixon's, in Barbican - I asked for it and Mr. Dixon would not give it up; the Lord Mayor gave me a warrant and I got it back. I never saw the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130047"></xptr>again till he was brought before the Lord Mayor - it is worth 120 l. or 120 guineas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had it four wheels on when it went out? A. Yes. I have heard that the prisoner is the son of General Campbell, and I have no doubt of it. The bargain was that he might have the carriage for two weeks certain, but not beyond that. He did not say that for every week he kept it afterwards, the money was to be sent to me. He never asked me about his keeping it longer.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Dixon's. The carriage came on the 9th of September; the prisoner came with another person; the other person said</p>
               <p>"This gentleman has a carriage to sell, and he wishes an advance on it;" - he then stated that it was at Mr. Sadler's, in Goswell-street - I sent down, with a horse, for the carriage - they did not say how long it had been there - the carriage was brought round and I agreed to lend him 34 l. upon it - we advance money on carriages for sale. Mr. Messer came and claimed it afterwards - it was backed for sale at 100 l.; the prisoner gave me a receipt for the money, in the name of Lawrence Campbell. I asked who it belonged to, and he gave me a note, which purports that it belonged to Mr. Joseph Page, of Eltham. We did not make any further enquiries of any one.</p>
               <p>(Note read.)</p>
               <p>"Mr. CAMPBELL. - You will have the goodness to bring my carriage from Eltham, and leave it at a Repository, for sale; and you will do me the favour of getting as much money advanced upon it as you can till the sale takes place. I will not take less than 100 for it. By doing this you will oblige your friend</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hired this carriage of the prosecutor for a fortnight, and if I kept it longer I was to remit the money for it, (2 l. a week.) I hired it for a person of the name of Page, at Eltham; when I got down he was not there; I came to town and then saw him, and he said he did not want the carriage, I must go and get him some money upon it. I then spoke to a friend, who took me to Mr. Sadler's, and they would not take it - I then went to Mr. Dixon's - they told me to come again in about an hour - I called again and then the clerk said he could not advance the money till he had seen Mr. Dixon - I went again. and then they wished to know whose carriage it was - I shewed the note, and they agreed to allow 34 l. for six weeks, and if not redeemed then, it was to be sold.</p>

The prisoner is the son of General Campbell, who is dead - the prisoner is engaged in a Chancery suit, and if he gains the suit he will be entitled to some property, not so much as 700 l. a-year.

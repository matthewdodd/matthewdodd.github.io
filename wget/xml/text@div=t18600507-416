                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist of High-street, Islington—on 17th April the prisoner Payne came to my shop about 7 o'clock in the evening—he asked for half an ounce of tobacco; I served him—he gave me in pav<lb></lb>ment a shilling—I gave him a sixpence and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and he left—I placed that shilling in the till—there were other shillings there, but this shilling was placed apart from them—when Payne had left, the constable came in, and I took the shilling out of the till and gave it him—he marked it and returned it to me—I have no doubt it was the shilling I took from Payne.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Whitty's Defence.</hi> I was passing by the Angel.

I asked him what he wanted me for; he said, "For passing counterfeit coin;" he said, "Keep the parcel where it is," and it contained six counterfeit florins.</p>

               <p>have been and had a cup of tea;" he said, "Come on, we have got you to rights now." I want to know how a person can be accused of passing bad money when another person gives it him. Mr. Wopd says he put the shilling in the till by itself, but he had no reason for putting it by itself, because he did not know it was bad; he threw it in the, till; and why should a man who had no suspicion put it by itself, it might be bad for what I know. I had taken change for half-a-crown down in the City, and if the shilling was bad I did not know it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">England's Defence.</hi> I met this young man and he gave me a penny, and said, "Come and have a cup of tea;" we went and had it and came out, and the constable came and took us.

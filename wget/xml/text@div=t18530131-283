                  </hi>. I live in Greenman-cottages, Old Kent-road, and am a hairdresser. On Thursday, 13th Jan., I was in Angel-court, Little Bellalley, Coleman-street, about 12 o'clock at night—I went into the Angel public-house to have a glass of ginger beer—the prisoner followed me in, and asked what I was going to treat her with—(I had not seen her in the court before I went in)—I said, "Go along"—she said, "No; give me a drop of gin"—I said, "Well, if that is all you want I will give you a drop," and I did—I called for half a quartern of gin, and I paid for it—in a few minutes after she drank the gin she walked out—I do not suppose she was in the house three minutes—there was a gas light in the house—I was standing at the bar, and she was close by the side of me—I had an opportunity of seeing her—she came out of the house, and I came out not two minutes after she left—I did not go out immediately with her—when I got out in the court I saw her again—she stopped me a few yards from the door, and she struck me suddenly</p>

               <p>in the stomach with her right hand, and snatched my watch and chain from my trowsers pocket with her left hand—the chain was not round my neck at that time—I had taken it off my neck and put the watch and chain in the fob pocket of my trowsers—there was no chain hanging out that I am aware of, but I suspect there must have been, or she would not have known it—it was a silver watch with a gold chain, and was worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after she took the watch she made off to Little Bell-alley, and I made alter her, but there are so many turnings and courts that I could not find her—from that time I had been looking for her every day except Sunday, almost day and night—on Thursday 20th Jan., I went out and about 10 minutes before 7 o'clock in the evening I was at the Royal Exchange, and saw her by the statue, with a female—the prisoner is the person who struck me, and took the watch—I gave her into custody of the police—I have not the slightest doubt that she is the person.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time were you in the Angel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 12 o'clock; about the closing time—there were two females there behind the bar, and the landlord was standing there, and there were two strange men besides the prisoner—I did not observe any more—I would not undertake to swear there were no more—there were no other females but those behind the bar—I was coming from a friend's, where I had a glass of grog—I cannot say how many glasses I bad had with my friend—I had not had half a dozen—I had not had above three or four in the course of the evening—when I came out of the public house, I proceeded a few yards—there was a light in the public house—I believe there was a light outside in the alley—I will not swear whether there was a gas lamp or not—I will not swear whether there is any light, I did not take particular notice—the place was not so very dark but that I could see a person close to me—it was moonlight or starlight; that was the only light—I would not swear what bonnet the girl had on when she was in the public house—I will not swear what kind of dress she had on—I took no notice of her dress—I will not swear whether she had a shawl on, or a cloak, or a mantle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> All you swear to is, that when she asked you for gin, andyougave her the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., she had the gin, and when she had had it she went straight away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; straight out of the public house—not straight away, because she laid wait for me, and when I came out I was attacked in this way—when I saw the person by the Royal Exchange, I gave her into custody as soon as I could get the constable close—I did say I should like to hear her voice; I had no doubt at all in my mind in the first instance—I said to her I should like to hear her voice and then she spoke, and said she was not the girl—I had not charged her—I went up to her and the other female—the other female spoke to me first, and this female turned round and walked away—she walked from her friend, and I walked after her—the other female asked me where I was going, and I replied, "I do not know"—she did not ask me to go home with her—I had never seen the prisoner before the night of the robbery—I called a policeman immediately when I was robbed—I ran up a court—the policeman was standing in the court, and he came running down.</p>

               <p>—she was searched at the station—a purse and a piece of lace were found on her, but nothing connected with this watch—she said she was married but after the charge was booked against her the inspector came to her, and she said she was single—the prosecutor gave her in charge to me at the Royal Exchange.</p>

I was acquainted with Elizabeth Lawrence twenty years ago, but had not seen her for sixteen years till the 20th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, when I stood at the corner of Bath-street, City-road, talking to an old lady and she passed; I did not know her till she came back and spoke to me; we walked down the City-road together, and went into a gin shop at the end of Britannia-street, and had a glass of gin - we walked on and had a glass of gin each opposite the Laying-in Hospital - we stood at the door talking, and she asked me to go home to Britannia-street to tea with her; I did not know where she lived till I went; a woman, who she called her servant, opened the door - three or four children came into the room, and her son Joseph - we all drank tea together, and after tea she asked me if I would go to Whitecross-street, as she was going there after a woman who owed her some money, at a house which she let out in lodgings; while we were at tea she looked at her clock, and said it did not go right, and asked me what o'clock it was - I pulled my husband's watch out of my bosom, said it did not go right, and showed it to her - the glass was broken, and I said I was going to Whitecross-street to have one put in; we went out as far as Bath-street, and had a glass of gin at a public-house there - we then went on to Whitecross-street, and met a man named Crossley there; I have seen him before, but never spoke to him - he was a friend of her's - he came up to her - she told me he was the person who gave her away to her husband - he asked me to go and take something to drink - we went, and Mrs. Lawrence and I had a glass each there; I don't know what he drank; then Mrs. Lawrence asked me to stay a few minutes, while she went to speak to Mr. Crossley at the door, for she had something particular to ask him - they went to the door, and after that we three went together to Mrs. Lawrence's house in Whitecross-street, and found Joseph Lawrence standing at the door - he had got there before us - it was then night, but I cannot tell the time - I should think it was near seven o'clock; Elizabeth and Joseph Lawrence then began quarrelling; I don't know what about - Joseph ran away from her at the door - she, Crossley, and I went into the parlour - nobody else was there then, but Roach soon after came in, and Maria Johnson about the same time - they were strangers to me; Johnson went out to fetch more gin and a pot of porter; I tasted the gin - I drank very little, but no porter; Elizabeth Lawrence then went out - she told me she was going to a public-house after a person who owed her some money; Crossley went with her - I waited there; Crossley came back without her - Roach went to the public-house and brought her - the next person who came into the parlour was the witness Gearon - he asked for the key of a door - Crossley asked him if he would be a pot of beer to his pot - that was agreed to - Maria Johnson fetched a pot, and I believe some rum - I drank none; Gearon went and fetched his wife down stairs - she came and sat down with me, and soon after the prisoner Williams came in and sat down by my side, as Mrs. Gearon got up; I sat nearest to the door; some time after they began quarrelling about a bad half-crown - Mrs. Lawrence, her son, Crossley, and Johnson were quarrelling - I felt sick and called

            , and told her I was taken ill - she fetched me a candle to light me up stairs - I went with her, and when I got to the top of the stairs, I turned round and saw Williams close behind - Johnson went down with the light - I went to follow her, but Williams pushed me down directly on the top of the stairs; I was then in the dark - when Williams had pushed me down, he put his hand into my bosom to get my watch - I got hold of it, and he got fast hold of the chain; I held it as long as I could, and felt somebody take my ear-ring out of my ear - that must have been another person; he got the watch; I laid hold of the bottom of his trousers - he went down stairs and I tumbled down after him - he gave me a blow on my head with his hand three or four times up stairs, and when I had tumbled down to the bottom of the stairs, he gave me a blow to make me loose him, and ran out of the street door; I had gone up two pair of stairs with Johnson, and fell down two pair of stairs - it is a house of ill fame; when I cried murder, Johnson came, and put her hand before my mouth, and told me not to make such a noise; Gearon ran out of the room, picked me up, and when I went into the parlour, I found Elizabeth and Joseph Lawrence, Johnson, and Mrs. Gearon; Roach was gone, they were all standing together quarrelling; when I went up stairs I told Mrs. Lawrence I had been robbed of my watch - she came up to me and said if I did not hold my tongue she would give me in charge; I was screaming then; I went to the door to run out - there was two strange young men there, one of whom knocked me down - I was obliged to go back again - two watchmen came, they went up stairs, searched and found my cloak and bonnet which were torn off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a bed-room that you went up to? A. There was a bed in the room - the watchmen took every body in the house; I have not got my watch; part of my ear-ring was found at Bunhill-row watch-house. On Saturday I met a man in this Court with a silk handkerchief, on which was tied inside my cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. After taking all this gin were you sober? A. There was a great while between the times I drank - I was not exactly sober but know all I have stated to be true - I never recollect drinking so much before - I was giddy in the head when I felt sick.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sat nearest to you in the parlour? A. Williams - he was talking to me part of the time, and put his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060028"></xptr>arm on my shoulder for about half an hour, and said he had been acquainted with a son who I had lost at sea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Mr. Wright here? A. No; we were married about nineteen years ago, at St. Pancras; the son I lost at sea was not his - I was never married before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you as too familiar for this man's arm to be round your neck? A. I was in trouble about my son, or I should not have been out; his arm was only on my shoulder; I did not pass a watchmaker's shop in the way to this house. I do not recollect having any liquor at the house in Britannia-street; the house I was robbed in is in Chequer-alley; I believe I had a drop of gin there out of a horn - it went round to every body. I just tasted something sweet - I do not think it was shrub - I only put it to my lips, as I did not like the smell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you that it was time to go home to your husband? A. I ought to have gone home - I had no notion of it being a house of ill-fame when I went there - I do not know how I came to stop - I was rather tipsy - I asked Johnson three times to see me home, and said I would pay her; I only went up stairs as far as the threshold of the door - I did not go into the room till I went with the watchman; I saw no door - I had just got inside where the door ought to be - but not into the middle of the room - my cloak and bonnet were found inside the room - I screamed violently - Mrs. Lawrence came laughing and told me to hold my tongue, for I should say presently I had been robbed of every thing, and there was a bit of my chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man called Charles the baker? A. No, my brother Charles is called

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you never represent that when you got to the bottom of the stairs the sailor young man (meaning Williams) unlocked your ear-ring, then took you round your neck, pushed you down, and took your watch? A. Never; I thought at one time that he had one hand to my ear, and the other to my watch; he came up behind me - I saw no one on the top of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JOHNSON. Q. Did you not ask me to light you up to bed with Williams, and let you have the best bed? A. Never; it is false.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not stay while you took your bonnet and cloak off, and leave the light with you? A. No, my cloak was torn off - it is torn now at the strings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner WILLIAMS. Q. Did you ever go by the name of Hill? A. Yes, about three years ago; I used to work for Hill and persons have called me by that name; I was not living with Wright then - we were separated for six years, but have been together again twelve years and a half; my son was not transported; I do not keep a house of ill-fame; I had a room in Chequer-square twelve or thirteen years ago - my husband lived there with me.</p>

            . I am a journeyman carpenter. My wife was in service; I met her on the 20th of February, in the evening, and went to this house about ten or eleven o'clock; I did not know it was a bad house; I asked if we could have a lodging for the night, and was directed to an upper room; finding no key to the door I came down and found Mrs. Lawrence, Johnson, Wright, and Crossly, in the parlour; a man named Crossly came in, and soon after Joseph Lawrence came in, and, some time after, Williams - he drank some beer, and sat down by the prosecutrix - I believe they sat on one chair; he sat with his hands round her neck for half an hour; she did not object to it. Crossly proposed that I should stand a pot of beer - I fetched my wife down, sent for a glass of rum - some spirits were handed round - Johnson lighted a candle - Mrs. Wright and Williams left the room, and I thought they were going to bed together for the night; Crossly left the room in five or six minutes - Johnson came down in five minutes - I cannot say whether she brought the light - I heard nobody fall down stairs - if they had I think I must have heard it; I heard a call of murder, opened the parlour door, and found Wright on the floor; she and Williams appeared very loving together in the room.</p>

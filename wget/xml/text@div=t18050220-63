               <p>- DOYLE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Clifton.</p>
               <p>Q. You are shopman to Mr. Allenby, a linen draper in Fleet-street? - A. I am; on the 4th of February the prisoner at the bar accompanied with another person with a light countenance, and about the same size, he might be taller; they inquired if we sold silk handkerchiefs; to which I told them, no; they then said, do you sell Irish cloth; to which I answered in the affirmative, they then said they would call in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they purchase any thing then? - A. No; about six o'clock in the evening one of the men who had been with me in the morning (not the prisoner) called, and looked out a piece of Irish cloth, and fourteen yards of calico, and desired them to be sent to the Castle and Falcon, Aldersgate-street; and desired me not to be more than a quarter of an hour, for they were going away immediately in a post-chaise; I went with the goods myself, with the direction he gave, which was, Mr. Morgan, Castle and Falcon, Aldersgate-street; when I got to the Castle and Falcon, I met the prisoner at the bar in the passage; he said to me, you have got the parcel for my brother, Mr. Morgan, to which I answered, yes; he then said you must go back and fetch the other piece of Irish that he looked at, (holding out his hands to take the parcel); in consequence of that I hesitated about the delivery of the parcel; upon that he said, O you may deliver it at the bar, which I did, at the same time desiring the girl to take care of it till I returned; I then went out but I was not satisfied with the first message I had given, I returned and gave her a second caution, and I said, you are not to deliver it to any person that was with me, or any one else except myself, it is my property; I told her to keep it till I returned; in consequence of that I went home for the other piece of cloth, and on my return I found they were gone.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You left the prisoner at the Castle and Falcon, and when you returned the cloth was gone; and you did not see the prisoner? - A. No, and the parcel was gone; there were twenty-six yards of Irish cloth, at 4 s. 6 d. a yard, that makes 5 l. 17 s. and fourteen yards of printed calico, at 4 s. 6 d. a yard; it altogether came to 9 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You left that under the care of the bar-woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And under her direction? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. On the evening of the 4th of February, did you see the prisoner at the bar? - A. On the evening of the 4th of February, the prisoner at the bar and another man came up the passage, I saw them come in as I stood in the bar, they came in arm in arm between seven and eight o'clock up the passage to me, I being then in the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a face had the other man? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200052"></xptr>A light complexion, and rather a taller man than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them speak to you? - A. The man of a light complexion spoke to me, and said, Mr. Kay, there will be a parcel come for my brother (pointing to the prisoner) which you will be good enough to take care of; I answered him, it should be taken care of for him; but not being certain of the name in the first instance, I followed them, by saying, did you say Morgan? one of them answered, which I think was the prisoner; he said, yes; they were going into the coffee-room to take some brandy and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar hear what the other person said to you? - A. Yes, he must, they were close together; the prisoner at the bar shook his head in this way (describing it), as a person does when he arrives from a long journey, to adjust his hair.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have paid for the parcel? - A. I have promised to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How long has your father been out of partnership? - A. My father has never been in partnership at all.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp Q. Did you hear him speak to the chamberlain? - A. I saw him come to the chamberlain, and he appeared as if he was speaking to him, and the chamberlain came and asked me for the parcel.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body come into the bar afterwards? - A.

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. He took up the large brown paper parcel? - A. Yes; I said, sir, there is no direction on it; he said, it is my parcel, and I must have it; and he took it away and went down the passage.</p>

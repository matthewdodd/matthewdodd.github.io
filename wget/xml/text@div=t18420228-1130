                  </hi>. I live in Uxbridge-road, Newington-causeway, in the parish of Saint Mary, Newington—it is the dwelling-house of my mother, Ann Hallett—she is a widow—we sleep there—on the 8th of February, at five o'clock in the afternoon, we left the house, leaving the door double locked—I returned between eight and nine o'clock, and found the prisoner inside the house—I had left a candle on the table, and when I returned I found the candle alight and on the drawers—I pulled him out and asked what he wanted there, he said a woman left him there—I saw two others run away—the prisoner dropped a knife on the window seat as I pulled him out—that knife would enable him to break open the drawer which he was at—it would not have opened the door—he must have got in with a skeleton-key—the door was not broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived as butler to Mr. Francis Martin, of Tudor Lodge, Wimbledon-common—on Monday night, 9th October, I left the pantry safe before I went to bed—I went to bed at twenty minutes past 10—nothing disturbed me—I came down the following morning at twenty minutes past 6—the pantry was in confusion—I missed two silver tea-pots, a coffee-pot, a silver sugar-basin, a pair of sugar tongs, a silver and a plated skewer, and a silver spoon—the pantry window is secured with a latch, and has iron bars outside—it opens inwards, like a door; it does not throw up with a sash—I found the two centre bars wrenched, and one taken out—they were opened quite wide enough for a man to pass in—the glass appears to have been cut with a diamond, and then broken—a piece of brown paper was on the floor with a quantity of treacle on it—John Shaw was taken up and tried for the burglary at the December Sessions—a painter's knife and file, and a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> were found in the pantry—outside the window there was a piece of rope and a piece of baize, to prevent a noise, also a small <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was not present when they were found—the value of the property taken is 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">In custody</hi>), I am a prisoner in Millbank, undergoing penal servitude for seven years for this burglary—I know the prisoner—I received a letter from him at my lodgings, on Saturday, 30th September—I have destroyed it—it was to the effect that I was to meet him on Thurs<lb></lb>day, 3d October, at a public-house in Gracechurch-street—I did so—it is near the new building, which is being erected by Messrs. Trollope—he said, "I want some money, and you must try and lend me your aid to get some"—there was some conversation afterwards, and the result was that that night I went down to Tudor Lodge—he said I was to go down to make some observations to see really where the plate was kept—I had been keeping company with the house-keeper at Mr. Martin's, and had told him so—I went down, and made observations about Tudor Lodge—I had seen the plate repeatedly about, but did not take particular notice of it—I looked to see how the window was fastened—I went down on 22d July, the day before the review at Wimbledon, with the prisoner, and pointed out the house to him—on the following Friday, the 6th, I met him again at the station at Putney—I met him at the railway station, and left him at a public-house, opposite, kept by Clipson—I went to Tudor Lodge, and went back and said I had much rather the burglary did not take place, because I was sure to be suspected, but he said that it must be done, and on that I parted with him at Putney Station, and agreed to meet him the night following, outside the music hall in the London-road—he left this bag, with some articles in it, at the station, I do not know with who, because I did not go to the office—I remained outside while he went in—I did not know what was in it then, but after it was opened, I saw a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, a file, some rope, and one or two other articles which I do not see here—on the next Saturday, I met him at the music hall, and he said that I should have to go down on the Monday following—I did so, and met him at the Putney railway<lb></lb>station—we went into a public-house opposite, and from there up Putney-lane, then into the Green Man public-house, where I left him until I went to Tudor Lodge—after I had been there, I returned to him at the Green Man at a little before 10—we then had some refreshment, and I went with him to Tudor Lodge—he had the leather bag with him—he had called for it at the railway<lb></lb>station and got it—I assisted him over the wall, and afterwards got over myself—we remained in the summer-house till about 12 o'clock, and then, finding that all persons had gone to bed, we went round to the pantry window—Morris placed this piece of rope round the bars, and twisted it with a stick—finding we could not force the bars away by means of the rope, some brown-paper was put across the window, with some treacle, the glass was cut out with a diamond, the catch was unfastened, and Morris got in—he remained inside two hours, and I remained outside—he took</p>

               <p>this bag in with him, and afterwards gave it to me with some property in it—there were some other articles besides those, which were wrapped up in a white cloth—we both went into the summer house, and waited there till about 4 o'clock in the morning—there was only one parcel of plate—there were two other parcels, one of which contained my coat—we waited till 4 o'clock—he got over first, over the gate on the wall, and I went back again, and put the plate in the bag in the shrubbery before we had got out of the grounds—the remaining articles of silver were wrapped up in a white cloth, and he took them—I carried two parcels, one under each arm, and he carried the two others—when we got near Clapham Junction, I was walking on first, and another man joined Morris—we met policeman, King, and I believe I said, "Good morning"—we both went to the station of the Chatham and Dover line, and took the railway train, I to Victoria and he to Ludgate-hill—he agreed to meet me that evening at the Elephant and Castle, but I never saw him afterwards till I was in custody—I have not the slightest doubt that this is the coat he wore that night—it was this colour, and he wore this cap, or one exactly like it—I saw him next on 17th November—I heard his voice in the van—there are small doors in the larger doors, and they being open, I looked through, and saw him in the opposite box, as you may term it, and I asked him what he was there for—he said, "For knocking some <hi rend="italic">Moll</hi> about": that she had taken some money, and he had paid her for it—I said, "I am in custody for the burglary;" and told him there was another charge against me in reference to Lowndes-square—he said, "I am safe to get discharged for this, and I will come and see you, old fellow," but I saw nothing of him—I was convicted on Wednesday, 20th, and the day after I thought the matter well over, and communicated next morning with the Rev. Mr. Jones. <hi rend="smallCaps">

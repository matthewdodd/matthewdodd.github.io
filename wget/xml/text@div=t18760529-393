                  </hi>. I live at 2, Pleasant Row, High Street, Camden Town, and am the wife of John Maney—the prisoner lived in the same house—it was in March that this affair happened, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening; the prisoner came upstairs, he asked me for my husband to pull his b——nose, and I said "What for," and he said "I will let you know if I can get him out"—I would not allow my husband to come out, and then he seized me by the hair of the head and pulled me along the passage—his wife who was behind him said "Let me go to the beast myself," and he said "No, I can do for her without you"—she fastened my husband in the room and he could not get out to assist me, ultimately I was examined by the doctor and sent to the hospital at Highgate—I was injured in my lower parts and in the familyway at the time—I was five weeks at Highgate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> His wife was with him at the time he came upstairs—she locked the door; not after it was all over, but at first—this occurred on the 16th March—I went on the following Wednesday to the hospital—I was summoned to a 'police-court, previously to the alleged assault, but I do not remember the date—plenty of people in the house know my husband does not illtreat me—I did not complain of his doing so—I did not speak to a policeman and say my husband was killing me and the children—my husband did not illtreat me when he heard I was summonsed—it was not the prisoner's wife who threw me down—I was taken the same evening to the hospital, at about 10 o'clock—it was a fortnight after that I went to the police-court—I went back to the hospital afterwards; not that day—I did uot tell the Magistrate that I had come from the hospital for two hours, and stay awry for two or three days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the University College Hospital—six weeks before the complainant was taken to the hospital, I saw her—she was very severely bruised in different parts of the body, the arms, back, and especially about the private parts—she seemed to be suffering a great deal of pain, and was in a state of collapse—I saw her the same night and three or four days afterwards, but not after that; she was not in the hospital at all—she went home, she says she was in the Highgate Infirmary for a month.</p>

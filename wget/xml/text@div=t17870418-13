               <p>I was employed as watchman on Sommer's Quay to take care of Court's goods; on Thursday night, the 1st of March, I was on my duty, and I saw this prisoner and another man about eight; they were coming towards the waterside, where the goods lay; I asked them what business they had there; the prisoner said he was going down to Gravesend, on board a Greenland vessel; he went away, and shortly after I saw the same man and another come down, and sit on the bench; he said they were waiting for a Gravesend boat; I told the King's watchman of it, and about ten o'clock I saw the prisoner and the same man go into the Queen's Head; they had a pint of beer, and drank to each other; the prisoner left the house, I followed him; he pretended to be drunk, he made a fall on the basket; about one, I saw the prisoner go on board, and he put his hand and took out the almonds; I ran after him, and he let the almonds fall overboard; he took them after the Gravesend boats had failed; he was on a deck ladder close<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180017"></xptr>to the Quay; we could see them the next morning laying in the mud; the constable has the handkerchief, with part of the almonds; I saw him let the almonds fall; I caught the prisoner by the breast; the other man got clear off.</p>

               <p>The said Jameson is a seaman, and shipped himself on board the Chacer, Captain Lawson, found to Greenland; and that as he the said Jameson was going on board, and crossing the lighter, he had occasion to stop, between twelve and one; a man seeing him stop, came to him and said, what do you do there? he replied, nothing but what is necessary; with that, he said he was a thief, and took him in custody, and sent him to the Poultry Compter merely on suspicion; he has a wife, and three children, who depend upon him; he being deprived of proceeding on his voyage, he therefore humbly submits and solicits the interference of your Lordship in his behalf, and that your worships will take his case into consideration.</p>

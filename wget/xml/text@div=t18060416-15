               <p>Q. Just a little describe that, you say he rushed against you. - A. He gave me a violent push, his breast hit against mine; at the same moment I felt my watch go away, because my pocket is so narrow.</p>
               <p>Court. You perceived it come out. - A. Yes, directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing was said, but you perceived your watch go out. - A. Yes, then he took to his heels directly, and ran down Bedford-street: I ran after him, and cried out Stop thief, stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loose sight of him. - A. No, he went no farther off than this room; he was stopped by a man and I came up to him; he called out I am not the man, the gentleman let him go again; he crossed over the street, and took to his heels again, I cried out again, and he was taken again.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was stopped the second time, was it by the same person, - Q. I do not know who the first person was that stopped him; when I come up to him I asked him where my watch was, he said what do you mean by your watch, I am an honest man, I have no watch; then says I if you are an honest man you shall go to Bow-street, he says very well, I will; he then walked off directly, and the people that stood about him left him; he had not been gone half the length of this room, a gentleman came and says, he has your watch in his hand; I then said to him where is my watch, he said, you blackguard, I have no watch; he crossed upon his heels and ran down Bedford-street; I called out the third time Stop thief, when I came up to him again; that gentleman wrenched the watch out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that gentleman. - A. Mr. Taylor, he is an engraver, his hand was all cut with the glass of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the gentleman wrenched his hands, was it some time before he parted with it. - A. Yes, ten minutes, he would not part with it, till at last the glass cut his hands, and then he parted with it; then the prisoner was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. When you took the watch from him, the glass was broke. - A. I had it not in my hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. The prisoner's hand was cut. - A. The man who tried to get the watch from him, his hand was bloody; when the prisoner was at Bow-street he let one hand be seen and not the other.</p>
               <p>Court. I understood you to say that he run against you, and gave you a violent blow on your breast. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that instant you perceived your watch go, did you see him take it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody saw him take it. - A. Only one witness, he saw him take it.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr Watson. On the 21st of February did you see the prisoner at the bar. - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. You are an engraver, Mr. Taylor. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see him. - A. In Bedford-street in the Strand, towards the bottom of it, he was then running violently.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any cry of Stop thief at that time. - A. Yes, which first attracted my attention towards him; seeing the prisoner I apprehended him to be the thief; at the instant of time that he came up I should have stopped him, but being fearful there might be a gang, and the prosecutor talking so unintelligibly, I took but very little notice of it, but turned on my heel and left them; a minute had not elapsed before I heard the cry of Stop thief, reiterated with the addition that he had got the watch in his hand; I have seen it, I looked round, he then might be about twenty yards from me, and then he was running down the street which he before had ran up, seeing that I was then decided what course I should pursue, and as he approached me I knocked him down and kneeled upon him, and after a severe struggle I took the watch from him, and kept it till I went to Bow-street; and had I not done it another witness would have done it, as he had hold of the chain, and I had a more powerful grasp, having hold of the body of the watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was your hand cut. - A. No, my glove was tore, I believe with the chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing. - A. Not a syllable.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the watch to Bow-street and the prisoner also was taken by you to Bow-street. - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man that you stopped. - A. I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long was you and me struggling before you got the watch out of my possession. - A. It was so small a portion of time it is imposible to divide it, I may safely say it was a minute before I could get a good grasp.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your hand in a gore of blood. - A. I could not tell, I had my glove on, when my glove was off there was no blood on it then.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long had you him down before you got the watch from him. - A. About a minute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. You said there was two endeavouing to take the watch from him, did you observe whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160017"></xptr>the other man's hand was cut. - A. It might have been possible, he having hold of the chain, and in addition to his having hold of the chain the watch glass was broke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you say at Bow-street that you wrenched the watch out of my hands. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the other gentleman say that you took it from under me, and then you said we must keep in one story. - A. Upon my oath as a man I never did, I disdain it.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Watson. Q. You are a plaisterer. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 21st of February, did you see the prisoner and where. - A. I met the prisoner in Bedford-street in the Strand, in my way home, as I was coming from my work; I saw the prisoner standing in a drunken position, I saw him reel against the prosecutor, and he almost knocked him off the curb stone into the road; the old gentleman ran after him up Bedford-street, I could not well make out what he said; the prisoner said he was an honest man, what did they mean by stopping of him; he said he had a wife and children, they directly told him to take the old gentleman to Bow-street for having his character taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. The mob was disposed to believe the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes, soon after the alarm was given again, stop thief, Mr. Taylor happened to stop him; if he had missed, Mr. Taylor he could not have missed me, as I was not above two yards from him when he fell, or not so far as that, he stopped him in such a way that the prisoner fell at a door, when I suppose the watch fell and the glass was broken; the watch was taken out of his hand by Mr. Taylor, I had got hold of the chain, and Mr. Taylor had got hold of the body of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body's hand cut. - A. My hand was cut just here.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the glass of the watch. - A. It was broken upon the stones; the prisoner was taken to Bow-street and the watch also.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you take the watch out of my hands. - A. I had part of the watch out of your hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the watch out of my possession. - A. I can hardly say.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you saw the watch upon the ground. - A. I saw the watch on the ground, and then he catched it in his hand directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you recollect when you was at the public house at Bow-street, that the gentleman said he took the watch out of my hands; you said no it was taken from under me. - A. I said the watch was on the ground, and you took it up again, but from which hand it was taken from I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>- LAVENDER sworn. Examined by Mr. Watson. I am a patrole belonging to Bow-street; I was present when the prisoner was brought to Bow-street, I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the watch which was brought with that prisoner to Bow-street. - A. Yes, I received it from Mr. Taylor, I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) Look at that watch. - A. This is my watch, chain, and seal, the glass is out, I have had it five or six years; it is an odd sort of a thing, it opens behind, I know the chain and seal and the whole of it to be mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a market-gardener at Tottenham, Middlesex. The prisoner was in my service in November last. On the 5th of November I had lost 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I had lost money before, but did not distrust the prisoner—I cannot exactly say how much I lost altogether—in consequence of suspicion, I examined her clothes after she was gone to bed, between ten and eleven o'clock on the 5th of November—(we had no regular agreement for any wages)—I found £7 or £8 in her pocket—the money was in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, and there was some silver—she was asleep—I awoke her, and told her I felt very uncomfortable, that I missed the money, and I said, "There is only you and your brother in my house"—(his name is Walker, he is a half-brother)—she said, "I hope you do not distrust me, Mrs. Cambridge"—my answer was there was only her and her brother in the house—I said, "Do you think your brother's key opens my box?"—she said, "I do not know, his key is in the box, and you can try it"—I did so, and it would not fit it—I told her I was defici<lb></lb>ent in my payments; I was going to take the money to London with me next morning, and did not know what I should do for want of it, and asked if she had any she could lend me—she said, "How much do you want?"—I said, "Three or four sovereigns"—I had not at that time told her I had discovered the money in her pocket—I asked her if I should hand her pocket to her—she said yes, if I pleased—I handed her her pocket—she took out a purse, and wished to give me what I had asked for, but she wished to keep the remainder, as I thought, out of my sight; it appeared so—she gave me four sovereigns—I save she had more, and said to her, "It is well for you, Isabella, that you have got more money than you knew of; I am</p>

               <p>afraid this is all my money which I have lost at different times"—she said, "It is, Mrs. Cambridge, I am sorry for it, but it is your money: if you will promise you will never tell any one of it, I will never repeat the offence again"—she bore a most excellent character before, and I told her I would forgive her, I never would tell any body of it, nor would I ever tell her herself of it, provided she never would repeat the offence again—the money was restored to me, and there the matter ended—I left my house next morning (the 6th) between one and two o'clock, and went to Covent-garden—I left her in bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before you left the house, had you any conversation with her, or any intimation, from which you could collect that it was her intention to leave you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever—I used to keep the money which I lost in a small box, which was locked inside a larger box, which stood in my bed-room—I kept my tea in a canister on the chimney-piece in the kitchen—she knew I kept it there—I always kept it there—it was unlocked—I had taken tea out of that canister on the 5th—I had bought the tea on Tuesday, the 4th—I had not felt any inconvenience or sickness after taking tea on the 5th—I returned to my house about one o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th—the prisoner was then gone—I took tea about six o'clock that afternoon—as near as I can say, we commenced taking tea about six o'clock—John Walker, her half-brother, took tea with me—he had not been to market with me—I had left him at home when I went, and found him there when I returned—I took the tea out of this canister, which was in the place where it was accustomed to be—I took the tea from the canister myself, and made it myself—about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after taking it, I felt a violent sickness—I felt no pain only from the violent retching—I sent Walker to my neighbour's, to go for the doctor, as I thought he would not be able to go so far himself—he was ill too—I com<lb></lb>plained first, and be complained in not more than two or three minutes—nobody took tea but him and myself—Mr. Moon if my medical man—he lives about a quarter of a mile from my house—Mr. Moon was not able to come himself, but sent his assistant, who came in about half an hour, I should think—I was getting worse before he arrived—the sickness was not accompanied with much pain—the assistant gave me warm water—I went to bed, and after twelve or one o'clock, I began to get better—the warm water threw off from my stomach what was there—Mrs. Budd, who worked on my ground, sat up with me that night—I saw the prisoner again on the Sunday following—she came to my house—I did not expect her—I asked her if she could tell me any thing of the circumstance which had takes place—if she knew any thing of what had been put in the tea—she said she did not—I cannot exactly say whether I began with that, or whether I spoke to her about her absence—I asked if she knew any thing of what had been put in the tea—she said, she did not know any thing about it—I asked her what was her reason for leaving my house—she said she could not account for it—I asked her if she thought I had used her ill—she said, "No"—Mrs. Budd's name was not mentioned at that time—she did not con<lb></lb>tinue in my service after she came back on Sunday—the reason she came was, I had got a neighbour of mine to say I wished to speak to her—I did not know where she was to be found—I sent her a message, and she came—she staid about a quarter of an hour—I cannot recollect when I saw her next—I should think it was in about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she come to you, or you go to her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Her brother had a letter—she came to my house—I asked her if she had any thing more to say, if</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183502020007"></xptr>
               <p>she knew any thing about it; and she said she really did not know any thing about it—I saw her again a month ago last Monday—she came to my house of her own accord, and said, she came to speak to me—that she had something to say to me, as she felt very uncomfortable—she said, "I met Mrs. Budd to-day, and she told me all about respecting the poison"—she said, on the morning when you left my house, Mrs. Budd was working in the fields taking up potatoes—she had to come home for some sacks, and in coming home for them, she took the key from a certain place where we leave it—she opened the door, came in, and got the arsenic—she had it all ready in her pocket, and that she mixed it along with the tea—she said, Mrs. Budd did that, (Mrs. Budd had attended me on the night of my sickness,) and she was sorry she had not got more to finish me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before she made this statement, had you expressed any suspicion to her about Mrs. Budd being likely to have done such a thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had had no quarrel or difference with Mrs. Budd of any sort—I do not re<lb></lb>member her saying any thing more—I did not say any thing to the prisoner about this statement—she went away to her lodging, I believe—I do not remember that I saw her again till she was taken into custody—I had a man-servant, named Shepherd, sleeping in my house formerly, while the prisoner was in my service, and before November, I directed him not to sleep in the house any longer, from observations I had made of his and the prisoner's conduct—I was very much troubled with rats at the time—I had corn in the house—I discharged Shepherd from sleeping in the house, about a month before this happened—I had purchased some arsenic to destroy the rats, which I placed between the joists and boards of the upper room in the washhouse—it was concealed between the joists and rafters of the wash-house, in three different papers—the prisoner knew I had it there—I told her as a caution, at any time if she was cleaning, if she should meet with this small parcel, to be sure and not meddle with it, for it was poison—I showed it to her in that place—the room was not locked—any one who knew where it was could get at it. My medical gentleman took a portion of the tea out of the canister—a neighbour took another portion of it, and the rest was thrown into the fire—I am sure it was the remainder of the same tea as I had taken that afternoon—Mr. Delanor, a farmer, took the other portion—when Mr. Moon came, I looked at the tea in the canister, and saw it was quite white with something—if my attention had been called to the tea before I had made it, I should have discovered it in a moment—I had no suspicion when I made the tea, and no reason to look at it par<lb></lb>ticularly, when I put it in the pot.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What quantity of tea might there be in the canister when you bought it on the 4th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a quarter of a pound which I put in on the Tuesday—I purchased it at a shop close by Spitalfields—I do not know the name—I have bought my tea there for twelve months be<lb></lb>fore—I bought it on the 4th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Tottenham. I was sent for to Mrs. Cambridge on the night of the 6th of November, but I did not see her myself till the 7th—my assistant went—there was very slight general indisposition on the 7th—I saw her between five and six o'clock in the afternoon—she gave me a description of what her sensations had been—I should think she was not at all recovered from the symptoms she described to me—she never suffered pain, from what I understood—but the vomiting continued—she complained much of sickness—that still continued when I saw her, and the vomiting—she also complained of lassitude—the pulse was rather lower than usual—her tongue very dry, and a little furred—I questioned her particularly as to the commencement of her illness—she stated she was taken ill soon after swallowing some tea—the first symp<lb></lb>tom she felt was sickness—my assistant is not here—she gave me a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183502020014"></xptr>
               <p>description of her sensations from the time she was first attacked; I should say she was labouring under irritation of the stomach—I am acquainted with the action of arsenic—the symptoms she described, and those I observed, were such as I should expect from a person having im<lb></lb>bibed arsenic—one symptom would be to lower the pulse—the heat of the skin and fur on the tongue arose from irritation of the stomach—it is the ac<lb></lb>tion of the stomach—the symptoms were so slight when I saw her, that had hers been an individual case, and I had seen nobody else labouring under similar symptoms, and not heard the history of it, I should not have sup<lb></lb>posed her to have taken arsenic—I heard the history of it from herself—and from the account she gave, and the observations I made, I am still of opinion that the symptoms are to be accounted for by her taking arsenic—the symptoms she described might have been produced by taking arsenic—con<lb></lb>fining myself merely to the symptoms, I should not have been able clearly to have detected arsenic—they were not to that degree that are usually seen—that would depend on how soon the offending matter would be thrown from the stomach; it being taken in solution, and sickness following immediately, I have no doubt the whole of it was thrown off her sto<lb></lb>mach, it would leave such symptoms as I found when I saw her—the whole of the ejections from the stomach had been thrown away when I saw her—the sickness being continued, but being unaccompanied with pain, and twenty-four hours having passed, I conclude no arsenic could have remained—I took about two ounces of tea from the tea-canister myself—the tea in the canister was covered with something—I could not positively say by looking at it what it was that was mixed with it, nor by the taste of it; I had very little doubt of it, but could not speak positively—arsenic has no smell—I believe it is also tasteless—I took it home to my house to send it to town by my brother, who is a professional man, was going to town the following day—he went, but forgot it—I then requested my assistant to forward it to a gentleman in town, to have it tested, which he did—he is not here—I have no doubt that the portion which was after<lb></lb>wards analyzed was the portion I got from the canister—I cannot identify it as the same—a portion was preserved, but afterwards thrown away, as I understood no prosecution was to follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What proportion, in your judgment, did the matter which was mixed with the tea in the canister, bear to the tea itself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps about one-sixteenth in weight—arsenic is very heavy—I should think there were five or six ounces of tea in the canister—twenty grains of arsenic are sufficient to produce death—that depends on the constitution—I believe four and a half grains have been known to do it—I observed, perhaps, forty grains on the surface of the tea.</p>

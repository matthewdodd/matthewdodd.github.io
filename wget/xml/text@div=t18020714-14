               <p>Hayward. This is a dress which I lost out of my shop, I know it by the mark; I had seen it at the latter end of May, or beginning of June; it must have been taken from the counter; the prisoner was frequently left there for half an hour together, and sometimes an hour.</p>

               <p>"My Lord, I very much lament my inability, and my extreme poverty to procure legal assistance; but I trust to the humanity of your Lordship to supply that defect; I humbly take the liberty of informing your Lordship, I have worked for the prosecutor upwards of five years, without any impeachment of character, and I most solemnly assure your Lordship the property pledged was my own, and was bought by me in remnants, and made up for sale at my leisure intervals; I shall have the honour of producing witnesses to your Lordship, to whom I have been known for years, and for whom I have worked, who will say what character I have always borne, and what my character really is."</p>

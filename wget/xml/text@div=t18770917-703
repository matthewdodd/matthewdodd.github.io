                  </hi>. I live at 97, East Laue, and am a lighterman—between 12 and 1 o'clock on the night of the 14th August, I was in Turner Street, Whitechapel, when Baker came up to me two or three times and wanted to get into conversation—I told her to go away as I didn't want to have anything to do with her—she went away for a little while and just as I was going along, I felt an arm put to my neck to stop me, and, the other hand dragged my watch from my pocket and snapped my watch guard; no sooner was the chain snapped than I felt a blow between my shoulders and I was knocked into the road—the blow could not have been done by the woman; she was in front of me—she ran across the road and a man sprang past me and they both ran away together—I did not lose sight of either of them—I did not recognise him at that time—he ran from behind—I called to the police "Stop thief," and a policeman came up and stopped them in the same street, and I pointed them out—I never saw another soul in the street until I saw the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 280). I was on duty in Rutland Street, and beard a cry of "Police!" and saw the prosecutor at the corner of Turner Street—I ran up to him and asked him what was the matter, and he said "I have been robbed of my watch"—I said "Who robbed you of it"—he said "A woman just gone up there; Rutland Street"—I gave chase and run up Rutland Street and saw the prisoners together—I passed nobody what<lb></lb>ever—I took them into custody and took' them back to the prosecutor—I searched the man on the spot, he had nothing about him—I said "You had better come down to the station as well," not meaning to lose sight of him—he said "Very well, I will go down"—he said he knew nothing about it, he was quite willing to be searched—the female prisoner said she knew nothing about it—I afterwards returned to the outside of 7, Rutland Street, and found a watch behind the door scraper, where I stopped the prisoners—when I got the prisoners back to the prosecutor two young men and a young women came up from behind me—they could not by any possibility have been between where the prosecutor was robbed and where I took the prisoners into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Darvil.</hi> You were not half a yard in front of the woman when I touched her on the shoulder and said "You have robbed a gentleman of his watch, and I must take you back"—I said at the station that the prosecutor was drunk—the prosecutor said he had been pushed down by a man and could not say whether it was you or not—he couldn't see your face—you where as close to Baker as two persons could walk to<lb></lb>gether—the prosecutor could scarcely stand, he was drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Darvil's Defence</hi>, I never saw the woman nor the prosecutor before that night. The prosecutor was drunk and incapable, and could scarcely stand. It is the first time I have ever been in trouble.</p>

               <p>The prisoner lodged in the next room to me—on 29th July, about half past 2 o'clock, he came home drunk, came into my room, and kept continually annoying me, until half-past 4 o'clock—he then appeared to have got sober, and I went to sleep—I awoke about 20 minutes to 6 o'clock, and found him cutting the breast of the flannel shirt which I had on, and taking out my money, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was in a piece of flannel—I caught at his hand, and he threw it down stairs—I took it up, went for a policeman, and gave him in charge.</p>

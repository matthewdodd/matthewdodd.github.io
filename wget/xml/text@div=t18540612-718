                  </hi>. I was barmaid at the Crooked Billet, on 7th April. On that day the prisoner came in the afternoon for half a quartern of gin—she gave me a shilling, and I gave her 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I put the shilling into the till, where there was no other money—in a few minutes I went to the till, and found the shilling was bad—I broke a bit off the edge of it, and put it on one side—on the 2nd May, the prisoner came again in the evening—I recognized her the moment she came in at the door—she asked for a pint of ale and a short pipe; she brought a jug with her—she gave me a half crown—I thought it was bad, and tried it—I said, "Do you know what you gave me?"—she said, "a half crown"—I said it was bad, and asked her where she lived—she said, in East-street, with a person named Harris, but she did not know the number—I said, "Come with me, and show me"—I went with her to the top of the street, and she then said, "Here I left the gentle<lb></lb>man"—I said, "What gentleman?" she said, "Mr. Harris"—I odd, "You told me you lived in this street"—she said she did not live thereabouts—I gave her in charge—I told the constable about the shilling—I could not find a Mr. or a Mrs. Harris.</p>

I received the prisoner in charge, and got this half crown from Barker—I asked the prisoner where she got it; she told me Mr. Harris gave it her—I asked where he lived; she said she did not know, and she did not know where she lived—Barker said that she had passed a shilling there about three weeks before—the prisoner said she must be mistaken, it was not her—I got this shilling the same evening.</p>

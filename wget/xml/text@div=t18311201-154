             I am servant to Mr. Ferguson, of Old Broad-street; Mr. Remington has a counting-house, and sleeping-room there. On the 24th of October I received the key from him; I went the same evening, about a quarter past five o'clock, to sweep out the counting house, and found the door unlocked - I went in and swept the rooms, came out, locked the door, and took the key up stairs; I went again at half-past seven, and made a fire in the bed-room - I then left the door of the room unlocked, the street door was locked then, but between my receiving the key from the prosecutor, and my sweeping the room, the street door had been open; I went into the counting-house the next morning, and missed the clock and barometer.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 24th of October, a little before six o'clock in the evening, I was at the Crispiana, in Golden-lane, looking for a person, whom I could not find, in the tap-room; I went to the back parlour, and knocked at the door - I found it fast, I went to the back part of the premises; I returned to the door, and knocked again - some one inside said, "Who is there?" I said Attfield; I then stood back; Crowder, the landlord, and another man came out of the room - I went in, and saw this clock on the table, and the prisoner standing near it; I said, "What is all this, does this clock belong to you?" he said No, but a man who came there, had taken it out of the cupboard for Charley Crowder to buy; I said, "I would take him into custody - he was shifting, and wanted to go out; I said I would search him," and I found at the bottom of his trousers two skeleton-keys - he said he had picked them up in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010083"></xptr>Aldersgate-street; a lock was produced at the office, and I tried one of these keys to it, which turned the bolt of the lock, as well as its own key - Crowder shut the house up, ran away, and has not been heard of since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Then the landlord and another man ran away, and you took the prisoner, who said he knew nothing about the clock? A. Yes; a small skeleton-key will open a large lock, if it is the same length.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you do with the lock? A. I took it to my house, then to my employers, and he sent it to the office; it was out of my possession, but I know this is the lock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Bobbit, of Bryan-street, Cale<lb></lb>donian-road. I produce a certificate of Valladier's marriage with the pri<lb></lb>soner (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I got it from a church in the Minories.</p>

Since the beginning of 1849, when he came to lodge at my house, with the prisoner—they lived there about four months, as man and wife—I bad known the pri<lb></lb>soner soner about twelve months, and understood she had been married to Mr. Weymouth; they dined at my house with Mr. Weymouth's father once, as man and wife—Mr. Weymouth went to live at Dover-street, Kennington—I never saw Weymouth and Valladier together.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Northumberland-street, Strand. In Nov. 1848, I was married to the prisoner, at Trinity Church in the Minories—I had known her for a year, and bad lived with her before I married her—she represented that she was the Countess De Sauverells, that Viscount Beresford was her guardian, and that she had never been married—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from her—I know it to be her writing—I lived with her only a few months, and have ceased to do so eighteen or twenty months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did you first become acquainted with her? At a house of accommodation, in July 1847—I could not speak a word of English then—she is an English woman—I was not very intimate with Mr. Weymouth, I have been to the theatre with him—I was abroad with the prisoner from Oct. 1847, till Feb. 1848—I did not receive a letter from Mr. Weymouth while away, I am quite certain of that—I did not, while I was abroad with the prisoner, hear that Weymouth was dead—I know Mrs. Bobbit</p>

               <p>—I did not bear till March, 1849, that Weymouth was married to the pri<lb></lb>soner; and I left her two or three days after, at Mrs. Bobbit's house—I did not know, in 1847, that she was Weymouth's wife—I charge her now, after knowing for eighteen months that she was married before, because she had gone from place to place in my name—she was not in the habit of earning money by teaching music—I never saw that she had a pianoforte—she had a guitar, but she was not able to teach it—I do not know what has become of it—I did not leave her any money when I left her—I went to France, and remained there eighteen month.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, G</hi> 217). I took the prisoner, and told her the charge—I asked her where Mr. Weymouth was, and she said in heaven, she hoped—(<hi rend="italic">The letter produced was here read—"Aug.</hi> 25th, 1847: Dear Mr. Valladier—I have told Frederick to ask you to come to my lodgings to supper to-night: pray come, as I always feel happier when you come there. Why have you remained away so long? you appear to have avoided me; if you have avoided me by thinking I am Frederick's wife, I can assure you I am not; Frederick says I am not to tell you; I know well why he does not wish you to know it; he believes you rich,' and he thinks if he can get you to intrigue with me, he shall get money from you: pray be on your guard against these Weymouths, they are a bad family, all of them; their friend<lb></lb>ship for you is to get as much money from you as they possibly can, but I will yet foil them; I will watch over you with the greatest care; yes, Mr. Valladier, I love you; your quiet and gentlemanly manners have made an impression upon my mind never to be erased, it is so long since I have seen anything approaching to kindness until I knew you; I hope you will not be offended at my telling you I love you; I am soon going into the country; will you accompany me? If you will, meet me at 8 o'clock on Sunday evening next, at the end of the Camberweli New-road, by the Green, I will explain all to you,—but test assured that I am not Mr. Frederick Weymouth's wife; I will prove it to you by taking you to a friend of mine, who will tell you the same; I hope you will not despise me for not being his wife; uncle will leave this at your lodgings; do not let <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> see it—I hope to see you at supper to-night.

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and furniture-dealer, at Putney. About the 14th of Aug. I was employed by Mr. Lyne Stephens, to sell a house full of furniture, in Roehampton-lane—I sold them on the 21st—I got possession of the house in which the furniture was on the 14th of Aug.—I know the prisoners—Mead was generally in my employment, and the others occasionally, only for this sale—I placed them all in the house to take care of the furniture—Mead was put in on the 14th of August, and Pond and Henry on the 19th—I paid them 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day—in consequence of something I heard on the day of the sale, I went to the Sun public-house, on the morning after the sale—I had missed a mattress—I saw two hall lamps at the Sun—in consequence of something the landlord told me, I went to Rollins, a broker in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood, and there saw two sets of fire-iron, and part of another set on the floor—I took them up—he went with me to the place where the sale was held—we met Henry on the road—I had the fire-irons in my hand, and said, "Henry, do you know anything of these?"—he said, "I do not"—I said, "Well," come back with me to the sale "—he did so, and Rollins also—when we got to the house, the other two prisoners were there—I brought Rollins into their presence, and said, "Rollins, which of these did you buy the fire-irons and the lamps of?"—he said they were all together—I said, "You have no au<lb></lb>thority to buy these;" and said I should give them into custody for stealing them—he said he had bought them that same morning, that he had paid 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, that he gave part of the money to Mead and part to Pond, and they were all present when he paid the money—he said he paid 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to each of the two—the prisoners made no answer to that—I sent another man I had there for a policeman, who came and took them into custody—there were two sets of fire-irons, and part of another set, produced—the table was not pro<lb></lb>duced then—it was afterwards, before the Magistrate—it had been sold by Rollins to some one in the village—I cannot identify any of these goods as belonging to the furniture in the house—I do not think I can identify the</p>

               <p>table—I was at the house on the morning of the 21st, about half-past eleven o'clock—the sale commenced at half-past twelve—I found a shade on the premises that fitted these lamps now produced—they are the lamps I saw at the Sun, which Rollins said he had bought from the prisoners—I had sold the shades the day before in a lot, to a lady named Sowster—I afterwards pro<lb></lb>cured one of the shades from the lady who bought them—it is here—this is the shade I sold—it has been off the premises—to the best of my belief it is the same shade I sold to Mrs. Sowster—she is not here—it is the property of Mr. Stephens—I could not find the lamps they belonged to—the table is here—I had seen a similar table the day previous—I cannot take on myself to swear to it—it is like it—I missed a table of a similar description—there were a good many tables sold, but not many like that—there was no property in the house that the prisoners had a right to sell—there was no pro<lb></lb>perty in the house but what belonged to me or Mr. Stephens—they had no means of having property, or any right to sell any in that house—my orders were, that nothing should be delivered from the house till I or the clerk arrived—nothing had been delivered by my orders before that time.</p>

               <p>Q. In what manner?</p>
               <p>F. Turner. I have seen him beat her. On Sunday the 30th of July, about ten o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise, and I went out to his door, and saw him knock her down in the passage with his hand: I cannot say whether it was open or not. I went home, and in about five minutes after she came out in a very bloody condition, and sat under my window. The blood issued out from under her left eye, and she cryed.

             and I washed her, and got her into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a wound was it?</p>
               <p>F. Turner. The wound was not very large. I cannot say what it seemed to be given with. The blow was under her eye, and her eye was black presently. We put a piece of raw beef to it, to prevent the blackness. She staid no longer than she had the beef put to it, and her maid bound it on. She then went out of my place. I saw her no more till about half an hour past twelve. Then her maid came and desired I would go to her mistress's house, to see what money she had in her pocket. I went, and her husband bid her give Mrs. Turner what money she had. She said she would, but he should not see it. He bid her give it me immediately, but she did not. He knocked her down by a blow on the left side of her head, and she fell on her right side. This was with his fist. Her fall knocked my child, which followed me, into the fire-place. When she was down, he kicked her in the face, and several parts of her body, and called her b - h and w - e, and a great many names. I saw him kick her in the belly, but I do not know how many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>F. Turner. She was sober, to the best of my knowledge. He then swore he would see her heart. She said, Jemmy, you will kill, or have killed me, I am not certain which.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she given him any other provocation, besides that of refusing to give you the money?</p>
               <p>F. Turner. She had not given him any other, nor no ill language. I was frighted at my child's falling, so I took her up and got away. I never saw her afterwards, till I saw her dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she subject to fits?</p>
               <p>F. Turner. I never knew that she was. What he did, was with his feet and fist.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she her clothes on?</p>
               <p>F. Turner. She had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stamp upon her?</p>
               <p>F. Turner. I did not see him stamp upon her. I left her upon the ground. I commonly saw her two or three times a day. She had not been in liquor, to the best of my knowledge, for a fortnight before.</p>

I went directly to Mrs. Turner's, and returned in about a quarter of an hour; then I heard her cry out. Whether she said he would murder her, or cried out for help, I do not know. I went immediately to her window, there was none but those two in the house, where I saw he had her by the hair, beating her head against the ground, or bedstead, I know not which. I said, Have you a mind to kill your wife? Then he loosed her. She came out immediately, and sat under Mrs. Turner's window, all of a gore blood. I held a bason, while Mrs. Turner washed her face. I observed a wound under her left eye. After she was washed, she went in again; then I went out, and never saw her till after she was dead.</p>

            . I am husband to the last evidence. I lodged in the prisoner's house, and am a lathrender. When they were sober, they lived well enough, but when she was drunk, they did not; and they might be both drunk sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they use to fight?</p>
               <p>T. Dodd. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which do you think had the best of it?</p>
               <p>T. Dodd. I believe the man had of the two. On the 30th of July I lay in bed till almost ten o'clock, and when I came down they were quarreling and making a noise. They were not fighting, but I suppose he had been beating her. I went through the passage, and went out about my business. I saw nothing more that day.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he generally beat her with?</p>
               <p>T. Dodd. He generally beat her with his hands. I never saw him use any thing but his hands. When they were both sober, they lived tolerably civil together. I never saw her strike, only struggle.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what do you mean by fighting?</p>
               <p>T. Dodd. He struck her. She might strike him for what I know. The woman was a very industrious woman, and always at work, either drunk or sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner's business?</p>

            . I live in Berwick-court. On Sunday the 30th of July, I think between three and four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come in with his hands on his wife's shoulders, at the upper end of the Court, to suppor her, she having the yoak and pails on her shoulders with milk in them. It appeared she could not very well walk, and she seemed like in a dying condition. They were going to Mrs. Jones's, where I live. He brought her in at the door, and he laid her down on the bed in the fore-parlour. She said, Mrs. Bliss, come and speak to me. I went to her. She said, Put your hand into my bosom. I did, and found her of a cold sweat. I said, Mary, has your husband beat you to-day? because I knew he used to beat her. She said, He has beat me, has stamped upon me, and he has killed me to-day. The prisoner said, Mary, shall I sell the milk? She said, Yes. He went out; then I called him back, and said, You have killed your wife to-day, and you shall not go, for she is dying. He came back; then he went for an apothecary, but was stopt, and I sent a boy. She did not lie above a quarter of an hour. I said to Mrs. Jones, Mary is dying; do not let her die upon the bed. She was taken from the bed, and set on a chair near the door. Her husband brought her in his arms. An apothecary came, who bled her at the door, and I pulled the ribbon from my head to tie her arm up. I believe she might live an hour and a half, or two hours, after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak after?</p>
               <p>S. Bliss. I heard her say, after she was bleeding, Let me go home and die. The prisoner took her up in his arms and carried her two or three doors farther in the court. She was set upon a chair, and there she died. I saw a great many bruises. I saw a place under her throat, that seemed to have been nipped; it was black and blue, and as big as a five-shilling piece. I saw also another near her left temple. There was likewise a little hole where a little singer might be put in, and the blood ran out of it. The prisoner fetched a pennyworth of beer, and went to give her some, but she could not take it. There was a coach came, then the beadle and another man took her out of the court. The prisoner staid by her till after she was dead, when they took him to the round-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen her in liquor lately?</p>
               <p>S. Bliss. I have seen her in liquor, but not lately; for the last fortnight or three weeks she came home at her time to a quarter of an hour.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060031"></xptr>Q. Did you say before the coroner, you saw her child move in her belly?</p>
               <p>S. Bliss. I saw a working and heaving in her belly, so I thought she was with child.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in liquor the day she died?</p>
               <p>S. Bliss. No, she was not. She did not smell of liquor.</p>

            . I lived servant with the prisoner. On Sunday, the 30th of July, his wife desired I would send him to meet her, to help her home with her milk. He said he could not go. She came home in a very great passion, and aggravated him to strike her; that began the first fray. It being a usual thing, I took no notice of it. That was the time she got the blow on her temple. I did not see it given, because I had the child. I tied up her head with a handkerchief at Mrs. Turner's window. She came in again, and my master was then out. She went to her chest and took out the money; he was afraid she would spend it, so he came in, and insisted on seeing it, when blows began again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any blows?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. She would if she could. I said, Will you trust me to see the money? she said, No. Then I went and called Mrs. Turner to be a witness. She fell down, when Mrs. Turner's child was at the fire-place; but I cannot say whether he knocked her down or not: he kicked her on her side two or three times, and beat her over her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the kicks violent or not?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. I cannot say, because I did not feel them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she down, receiving those kicks?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. It might be a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes. The whole beating continued about that time. She might be that time, or more, upon the ground. He got the money from her about ten minutes after she was upon the ground. She endeavoured to prevent him from getting the money, by keeping her hands close.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let him beat her?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. I could not help it. If I had happened to get a blow, it would have knocked my old carcase to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she attempt to fight again?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. She had no strength; she fell over the chairs, or something or other, a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say, upon your oath, she attempted to strike her husband that day?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. I believe she did, as near as I remember, after the kicking and beating on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. During the first beating did she?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. No, she did not attempt to strike at all then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she sober?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. She was pretty well. She could go about her business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Turner in the house at the time of his kicking and beating?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear such an expression as this, That he would see the heart of her?</p>
               <p>B. Aston. I do not remember that. God help me, it might be said, and I not mind it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say, Jemmy, you have killed me, or you will kill me?</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was sent for the 2d of August, to see the body of the deceased. Upon examining the body, I found several external marks of violence; one on the right side of her belly, another on her right arm, and another on her left. The body was putrid, and the face quite black. I imagine the blackness of the face was owing to her having been so long dead.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you imagine the mark on the right side might proceed from?</p>
               <p>Mr. Foot. It might proceed from blows, or the putridness of the body. There was a small puncture on the right groin, through the skin and fat, above half an inch deep. I opened the body, and found in the cavity of the belly a large quantity of extravasated blood; some in a coagulated state, and some in a fluid state; which must proceed from some external violence, or from the rupture of some vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it proceed from blows or kicks on the out-side?</p>
               <p>Mr. Foot. Undoubtedly it might. The rest of the viscera was all in a sound state. The whole contents of the belly appeared to be in a sound state. We then proceeded to open the head, which was quite found.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole, what in your opinion was the cause of her death?</p>
               <p>Mr. Foot. Upon the whole, my opinion is, that her death was owing to the extravasation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060032"></xptr> of blood, which might happen by some external violence. The body seemed to be exceedingly in health.</p>
               <p>Q. As she had been three days dead, might not her agonies and struggling in her last moments break some of the vessels, and occasion that extravasation?</p>
               <p>Mr. Foot. It is possible, but not probable.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form a judgment whether this was occasioned by a fall, or a violent blow?</p>
               <p>Mr. Foot. I have no criterion to judge, whether the breaking the vessel was occasioned by a fall, or a violent blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the deceased was with child or not?</p>
               <p>Mr. Foot. She was not with child.</p>
               <p>Mr. Spence. I was with Mr. Foot in inspecting the body of the deceased. There were many parts of the body where I suspected there had been bruises, but I could hardly distinguish them, from the body being putrid. There was a place on the right side, that I am satisfied proceeded from the external violence of a blow or a fall. The extravasation I imagine to be the cause of her death, which might be by a fall against any hard substance, as well as by a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she with child?</p>
               <p>Mr. Spence. She was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went out, and met my wife coming home that day about eleven o'clock; I had the child in my arms. She asked me, why I did not follow her and help her home with the milk; My dear, I said, the child is cross, and I thought you would scold me among the customers, and I did not choose to be scolded. When she came up to me at the door, Give me the child, said she. I said, Perhaps you will hurt the child. She said, What is that to you? it is none of your child. Mary, said I, if you was sober, you would not say so. I do not care, drunk or sober, said she, I have got somebody to go to, besides you. I delivered the child to her, and then she tore the shirt off my back. Mary, I said, I will go to prayers; here is half a guinea for you to make you quiet and easy; and, if you do not be quiet, the lodgers will not pay me any money to-day. They most commonly paid every Sunday. She took the child, and went to a public-house, but she got no liquor there, because she was drunk; then she went to another, and had a glass of gin there; and she then made towards home. I was afraid she would drop the child. (She had once before dropped it in the street, and I picked it up.) When she came to Hanover Yard, she laid the child down by an apple woman; I followed her, and took care of the child, which was all I minded. I took the child up, and carried it home. Where did you get that child? said she. I said, from an applewoman. She said, It was not my child. I have taken all the money out of the box, said she, and shall not come home till next week. Then we had words. She would have the child. I said, Perhaps you will drop the child, and kill it. She said, I don't care, it is none of your's. (This was between twelve and one o'clock.) She struck me on one side of my head. It vexed me, to be sure. Then she told me to give her the child. I said, To make every thing easy, I will give you the child. What do you strike me for, Mary? I gave her the child, went out, and advised her to go to bed, and get sober. She told me she would do as she pleased. She would go out and spend five pounds before she came home. About two months before, she took seven pounds from me, all in silver, and staid out three days and three nights. I never could find her till she came home in a coach. I was obliged to give the coachman two shillings. She has been drunk three weeks together before that. She told me she would bring a broker, and sell all the things in the house, and put the money in her pocket to spend; adding, she had others to go to besides me.</p>

When I would not serve her, she went to the Two Brewers, in the same street, and had a quartern of gin. She had her baby under her arms, and I was afraid she would drop it. I never heard of any misbehaviour in regard to the prisoner in my life; he was always good-natur'd, and quite tender of her, when she has been in liquor; but she was always for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060033"></xptr> gin way.

            . I have known the deceased thirteen years. She came to my house very much in liquor the same day, between ten and eleven o'clock; she had her child upon her arm. She said she had been at her sister-in-laws, and said, if Jemmy calls for twenty pots of beer, they will draw it for him, but they will not let me have any. My daughter gave her a dram of gin. I said, Mary, sit down, and have some tea. No, said she, I will have no tea. I replied, Do, Mary, my dear, have some tea, and go and lie down on my bed, for you are in liquor, and perhaps, by so doing, Jemmy will not discover it. No, said she, I will not, for I have an old woman at home, perhaps she will sell my milk. I wanted to take the child, but she would not let me. She went away, and I followed her as far as Mr. Murphy's door; there she fell to scolding Mrs. Murphy, and calling her names. She went away, and I saw no more of her till about five o'clock, when I was inform'd she was dead. I ran to her house, and saw her sitting in a chair dead.</p>

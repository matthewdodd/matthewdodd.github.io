I staid there till almost one o'clock: when I was coming away, I said I was going into the city; the prisoner and the other offered their service to go along with me: one said, he lived in the city, by Fenchurch street; and the other said he lived in Filpot-lane, and had an uncle there: we walked down Bunhill-row, talking about this knack of the pewter dish, and other things, till we came to Chiswell-street: when we came to the end which opens into <placeName id="t17650116-12-crimeloc64">Moorfields</placeName>

We walked talking in the fields, till we came about the middle of the walk; when, all on a sudden, with a most violent motion, I was knocked down, and one of them lay upon me, while the other drew my watch (a metal watch) out of my pocket, and my hat from my head: I can't pretend to say which lay on me, or which took my watch and hat; but I am sure no creature was near me, but them two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Williams. I never saw him before that night, to my knowledge. I went the next morning to that alehouse, but the landlord was not up; so I went away, and came there again, about twelve o'clock. I enquired of the landlord, if he knew them two men that went out with me last night; he told me he had seen them but a few times in his house, but he said he knew a man that knew them very well, and directed me to him. By that man, I found the prisoner lived by Old-street-square, and the other likewise: I went and found the prisoner at the sign of the Angler, just by Old-street-square: I got a constable, and charged him with the prisoner; I sent for a coach to the house, in order to carry him to New Prison, for the constable's security, till I could be heard before a magistrate. On taking him out of the coach, he made his escape: upon this, I went to Sir

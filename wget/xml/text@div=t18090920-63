               <p>Q. Did you stop talking with her - A. I stopped some time, she wished me to persuade me to go home with her, I did not wish to go any farther; the watchman was coming by at the time, I gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose - A. I lost two one pound notes, they were loose in my breeches pocket, in Chancery-lane; I went with her as far as fifty yards, perhaps; if you were to go from here it is on the left hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the county. The other young woman was with you - A. She left me instantaneously when I accosted the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Were you sober - A. I do not think I was inebriated; I had taken one glass of brandy and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number of the notes that you lost - A. No; I knew I lost two one pound notes, I am sure that I had them there, I felt them about a quarter of an hour before.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 10th of this month I was going round with another constable to see that the watchmen were doing their duty, I saw a mob in Chancery-lane, Mr. Brown said he had been robbed by the prisoner; I took the prisoner of one side, I told her she had better give them up, she then gave up two one pound notes; I told the prosecutor I believed I had the notes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Look at that pawnbrokers ticket, perhaps you know that - A. I saw no ticket, I had only two notes.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at them notes and tell me which of them is my note - A. I do not know the number of them.</p>

On 3rd June the prisoner came to the shop—the shop-walker told me to watch her—she bought some stockings—she asked to look at some handkerchiefs—after looking at them for a considerable time, I saw her draw a large parcel of handkerchiefs towards her, close to the edge of the counter—(there is a rim to the counter, about three inches high, to prevent things dropping off)—she threw a handkerchief over one hand, con<lb></lb>cealing the other handkerchiefs with it, which she drew away with the other hand, and concealed them in her lap—I was in the window, which is a little elevated, and had a full view of the counter—Davis was serving her—I informed the shop-walker—he went up to her, and said, "What do you want here? what are you after?"—she drew her chair, and the handkerchiefs dropped on the floor—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were folded, and in a wrapper, which did not come into her lap—they are worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

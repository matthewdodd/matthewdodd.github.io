                  </hi>. I am the wife of Adam Delamore, of Chapel-street, Tottenham Court-road. I put these things out to dry on the leads between ten and eleven o'clock on the morning of the 5th of October—the police<lb></lb>man came afterwards, and I found they were gone—these are them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in China-mews, and am a carman. I was coming along Chapel-street about seven o'clock that evening, and saw the prisoner with two others cross the road—one of them went into the pro<lb></lb>secotor's</p>

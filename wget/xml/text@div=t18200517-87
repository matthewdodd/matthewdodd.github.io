On the 10th of May, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing in the parlour, which commands a full view of the shop, reading the paper, just turned my eye up, and saw the prisoner going out of the shop with my show-glass; I went after him, and he was stopped about 150 yards from the shop. I lost sight of him, but believe him to be the same person - it contained the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth above 4 l. 2 s. He was a stranger to me.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live next door to Mr. Francis. I saw him run by, calling Stop thief! I ran out, went through the court, and saw the glass showcase lying in the street, and the prisoner running up the court, about fifty yards off. He ran into a house in Ray-street, the people turned him out, and as he came out I saw a pocket-book sticking out of his pocket; I laid hold of him, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you been doing?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Nothing, I am a respectable man." I said,</p>
               <p>"Then you can have no objection to go with me to Mr. Francis;" he said he had not, and went back with me. Francis claimed the pocket-book, and said he could almost positively swear he was the man.</p>

            . I am thirteen years old. I saw the prisoner running in Coppice-row, as fast as he could, about a hundred yards from the prosecutor's - he had a looking-glass, which he threw down - I picked it up, and took it to Mr. Francis. I saw the prisoner stopped, and saw a pocket-book sticking out of his waistcoat; I saw him throw it away, picked it up, and gave it to Mr. Francis, who claimed it. I picked up a pencil-case in the direction he ran. I do not know that he threw that away.</p>

            , JUN. I am an officer of Hatton-garden. I was sent for, and took the prisoner into custody. I found nothing on him. Francis delivered me the pencil-case, with its contents, a knife, and the show-glass.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have lived in St. Andrew's and Clerkenwell parishes, four years. I had occasion to go to Mr. Baker's, in Margaret-street, Spafields, I went down Coppice-row, and might have run, as I had a person waiting for me. I also had occasion to go to Bartlett's in Ray-street, on business, I had not been in the parlour five minutes, when Mrs. Bartlett said a number of people at the door wished to speak to me - I went to the door, and in about five minutes the boy said</p>
               <p>"that is the man." I asked what was the matter, they said Mr. Francis had been robbed, and I went back with them.</p>

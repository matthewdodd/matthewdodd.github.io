I live in Jamaica Place, Limehouse—on 13th January I was at the house—my sister lives there—the prisoner came and asked me about a hat that was upstairs; I told her she could not go upstairs, that my sister was out—she asked me what it was to do with me, and said "You have no business in this house at all, because you don't live here"—she called me most dreadful names, and took a glass off the chest of drawers and said "What would you say if I smashed your face with this?"—she went away, and I went over the road to a neighbour—I was in Gill Street shortly after—I saw the prisoner and a policeman pushing her along—about 12.30, at night, she came and knocked at the door—I opened the door, and the knife came right down in my face, and she said "I meant stabbing"—my sister was in the room—there was no one else outside but the prisoner—I got medical assistance.</p>

On the morning of 17th April, I went into the shop of Mr. Wittingham, a marine store dealer, at Deptford—the prisoner was there; I said in his hearing, "Wittingham, what metal have you in the house?" he replied, "Here is some, look at it, this man brought it," pointing to the prisoner (I was in uniform)—he said, "You are not going to say that I brought it"—Wittingham replied, You know you did, you have just put it down"—I said to the prisoner, "come this way with me, let us look at it"—he did so'; and I said, "I will take you into cus<lb></lb>tody for having this in your possession, as I believe, knowing it to be stolen"—he said, "I did not bring it, and I know nothing about it; it was ano<lb></lb>ther man brought it"—I took him into custody—on the way to the station he said that a man on Deptford-green asked him to carry it to the shop, and said he would pay him, and that he should know him if he saw him, but did not know his name—I took the lead to the station; this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—Mr. Clinton saw it there—it is the whole covering of a roof; I have compared it, and it fits—it appears to have been cut with a chisel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a marine store dealer, of Deptford, and know the prisoner. On 17th April, he came twice to my shop, and brought two lots of lead, but he did not offer it for sale—just as I came down stairs a policeman came into the shop and took the prisoner—this is the same lead—my wife was in the shop when he came the first time.</p>

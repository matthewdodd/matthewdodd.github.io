            </rs>. It appeared that they did meet together at the Golden Posts in Mitre-Court, and at the King's Arms Tavern in Catherine-street, where the Prisoner did say, That he did believe that Captain Porter could not live very easie under this Government, and that if he would go to France he would procure King James's Pardon for him, and that he did give him 300 Guinea's, and that he should have 300 l. more when he should land in France, and be allowed 300 l. a year for his subsistence: Then they met afterwards at the Dog and Partridge in Wild-street, where the Prisoner told him he must be gone before Cook's Tryal came on. Then he did provide him 3 Bills for the payment of the Monies. It further appeared, That the Prisoner did show him a Letter, and stealed it in his presence, which was subscribed by a strange Name, and said, That K. James did know the Letter by the Name that it was subscribed by. Then Captain Porter acquainted Mr. Vernon with the whole matter, who did order him to proceed further in it for to find the whole truth of the matter, which was accordingly effected; and when the Prisoner was taken and searcht, they did find a blank Paper in his pocket, made up exactly like the said Letter, and Sealed with the same Seal. It was fully proved against him; and the Jury found him guilty of the said Misdemeanor.</p>

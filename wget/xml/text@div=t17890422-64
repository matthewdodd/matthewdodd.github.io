               <p>I am a labourer, I was employed by the prisoner to take the horse to a Repository, I live in Holborn, I never knew the prisoner before he applied to me, which was on Wednesday about 8 in the morning, this day month, the prisoner came to the Swan at Holborn-bridge, and brought a letter in his hand to the inn-gate; and asked me, if I knew St. Martin's-lane? I said yes, very well; he said he had a horse to go there to the Repository, and he bade me carry it there; the ostler of the Swan Inn delivered the horse to me in the presence of the prisoner, and if he was sold I was to bring the money; I took the horse there, and delivered it to the servant at the repository, and the letter likewise, that was about nine in the morning; I asked the servant what time they would begin to sell; he said about eleven? I said, I have no occasion to wait, I will go back, so I left the letter and the horse; and I came back again, and found the prisoner there; says he, what are you to have for your trouble? I said a shilling; and he said he would give it me; but he did not: he bade me go back and come again at one, for he was going; he went to the repository, and I ran after him seeking for my money; says he, if the horse is sold I will pay you the money; and if not sold you shall take him back again to the inn; the same night I waited there, the horse was put up at 3 l. and each bidder rose him at 10 s. each time 'till he came to 5 l. 10 s. and then he was knocked down; there was no money paid; then the prisoner came back, near to the inn, when all was over, and bade me stop at the gate, which I did 'till about four o'clock, then he took me down Holborn again, pretending he was to lay at the Swan in Holborn, and then he ran away; I am sure the prisoner is the man, but he was dressed better a great deal then, and his hair was powdered a little, but that is the man; I went to the repository the next morning after he flung me; and I asked, what time he was to be paid? the man asked me, if it was me that brought a letter and the horse? says I, I am afraid he has bilked me; the man told me to come between 9 and 10, and I might see him; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220058"></xptr>never heard any more of this matter 'till I was at the justice's.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Aldridge, that keeps the repository in St. Martin's-lane; I remember the last witness coming, he brought this letter which I have in my pocket, upon opening it, it mentioned the horse was to be sold for what he would fetch, and to pay the bearer; then the porter went away; he came again in the afternoon, and likewise the prisoner came; he asked me, what time he could receive his money? I told him not before Friday, that was Wednesday morning the 18th of February, when he brought the horse to our house, the prisoner staid at the next door, a publick-house, on the Friday morning, I told him he might come for the money, the clerk was there, I had a mistrust the horse was stolen by the writing of the letter, and I apprehended him on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost my gelding out of a straw-yard, the horse was there at eight at night, and was gone in the morning at six, it was the 16th of February; I knew the prisoner very well, he was bred and born in the parish, he has not lived there for some years, I had the horse for four or five years, the horse was 11 or 12 years old, he was a dark bay-gelding, a blemish in the off-eye, a little lame on the shoulder, he was a very remarkable horse; I have no doubt he was my horse; the prisoner had been a gentleman's servant.</p>

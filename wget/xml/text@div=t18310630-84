A.From his own confession, and from its not appearing on our books; I went to him on the night of the 16th of May, with his father, as he had absented himself - I asked him what he had done with the money, and he said he had appropriated it to his own use; I do not know that I mentioned these sums of money, but I considered that he understood it.</p>

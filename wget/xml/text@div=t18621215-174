                  </hi>. I am potman at the Dock-house hotel—I knew the deceased—I saw him, Low, and Dyson go out on this night—a few minutes afterwards I heard a disturbance—I looked out of the window, and saw the deceased running towards the lamp-post—I did not see anybody strike him—I saw the deceased running towards the lamp-post, and when I looked out of the window again I saw him lying on his back—I afterwards went out—I saw Mitchell strike Dyson in the face, and heard him say, "I have settled one b—, and I may as well settle another"—I found the deceased perfectly insensible on the pavement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in the Barking-road, West Ham—On the morning of 25th November, about a quarter to I, shortly after the occurrence, I was called to see Melton—I found him perfectly uncon<lb></lb>scious, breathing very heavily, with all the symptoms of concussion of the brain—I examined his head, and found a puffy tumour, extending from the back of his head to the right side, over the right parietal bone—I adopted all the usual remedies, without success—I remained with him three or four hours, and saw him again about 8 o'clock—he was then in a dying state, and in the afternoon I found him dead—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was fracture of the skull, extending about nine inches, involving the right parietal, part of the occipital, and part of the left parietal bone—there was laceration of the large vessels of the brain, and extravasation all over the surface—the vessels were very much gorged with blood—on the outer surface of the scalp I found two or three distinct</p>

               <p>bruises along the course of the fracture—the scar of the fracture had a star-like appearance, as if a more violent blow had been struck on that part than the other—I have no doubt that his death was caused by violence of some kind—the injuries could be caused by kicks as well as a fall.</p>

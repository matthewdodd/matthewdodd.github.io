                  </hi> (a blind man). I live in Maynard-street. About six o'clock in the evening of Saturday, the 31st of July, I was going to my room up stairs—I found a hand in my trowsers' pocket—I could not tell whose hand it was at the time, but I laid hold of it, and put my hand down, and found three sovereigns in the person's hand—I pushed one down—she took up my hand, and put ray finger into her mouth, and bit it in four places—I kept her, and held her till the witness and the policeman came—I had four sovereigns in my pocket.</p>

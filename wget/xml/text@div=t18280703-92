               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your daughter here? A. No; she is ten years of age; she saw them on the prisoner's child's neck, and came and told me; I believe the prisoner has three children.</p>

I had a search-warrant from Mr. Scott, to search the prisoner's premises; I went after him; and found him about four or five o'clock in the evening; Mr. Sayer's evidence is quite correct; I told the prisoner I had come to him about some things found at his house; he said he had found them on the roof of his house, but I do not recollect what he said when I told him they were the prosecutor's, and had been stolen; some of the articles had been marked - he lives about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Sayers; there was a great deal of talk about the robbery.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I live at the back of the prisoner's house. On Saturday evening, the 14th of June, he came home about nine o'clock in the evening, with his wife and child in a cart; he got on the house and said he saw a bundle there; a woman named Hatton was there and saw it; Mr. Pendrell is a neighbour; I saw the prisoner throw the bundle down from the roof - it was in an old shawl or apron, and seemed to contain a bundle of something; they are low cottages, about seven feet high; he asked me if they belonged to me - I said they did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Does Pendrell live in the same house with you? A. Yes; there are two rooms in it; I am single; I never was in trouble for stealing a watch; I was once in trouble for being out late; I was in prison two months - I have been in prison for a day or so several times - I never knew Pendrell to be in any bother about thieving; he used to go about with a horse and cart, and now he has a donkey; he has worked for Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. By being out late, do you mean being disorderly? A. Yes.</p>

            . I live near the prisoner; Berry lives in the house with me. On the evening of the 14th of June I saw the bundles; the prisoner said, "I have found some things - I will take them in, and I dare say we shall find an owner;" he keeps a horse and cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you ever in trouble? A. Never, except for being in liquor, or anything of that - I never was in prison for any sort of felony; the constable met me one night, and took a shawl from me, and because I would not be content to have my money taken out of my pocket they struck me, and said I hit them; they put me into the cage, and took me before a Magistrate; they said if I would give 15s. 6d. they would make it up, and then they got a bill against me; it cost me about 8l. in all; I keep a donkey - I go out gathering hones, iron and rags, and such things. I did not take particular notice whether there were two or three bundles - I think there was more than one. I do not recollect the 28th of April, but I remember I was at home on the 14th; I did not go before the Magistrate: I remember, when I came home, hearing that the prisoner was taken.</p>

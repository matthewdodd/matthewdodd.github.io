                  </hi>. I am cook and housekeeper at No. 39, Upper Brook-street. On the morning of 24th June, after 9 o'clock, I left my room door open for five minutes; it is at the bottom of the area steps—I was absent five minutes, or a little more, and then went into the area, and saw somebody lying on the hearth rug in my room—I went in and saw the prisoner—I said, "What brought you here, you wretch?"—he said, "I came to buy bottles," and wanted to go from the door, but I would not let him go out—I lost my senses—the servant came, and I sent her for the footman—I then examined</p>

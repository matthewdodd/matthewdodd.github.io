               <p>The Prosecutor depos'd, That Mr. Chawkley came to him on the 11th of August, and enquired if he had not lost a Coach Glass, which he had stopp'd, and describing it the Prosecutor knew it to be his own.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chawkley further depos'd, That when the Prisoner Benjamin Hall, alias Clark came to him and offered a Glass to Sale, he said he lived in Moorfields, and was a Cabinet-Maker by Trade, and hearing that he, this Deponent gave extraordinary Prices for such Glasses, he had took the Pains to bring it to him before another; but Mr. Chawkley suspecting it to be stolen, very wisely stopp'd him and the Porter who brought it, and applied himself to a Justice of the Peace for further Directions, who ordered him to bring them to him to be examined, upon which Examination he found them in so many different Stories and Contradictions he thought proper to commit them to a Place of Confinement, till Mr. Chawkley found out the Prosecutor. Benjamin Hall said in his Defence, That he bought the Glass of a Man in the Street, and not having Money enough to pay for it he pawn'd his Coat for 10 s. and borrowed 20 s. more of an old Woman who was then in Court to prove it; but she telling nothing but an old Woman's Story, and he not being able to give a good Account how he came by it, the Jury found him <rs id="t17270830-38-verdict179" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Except the moon, was it otherwise dark - A. Yes, quite dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise - A. Yes, by the breaking of the window; I was behind the counter, just by it, when I heard the window break; it was the shop window; I was within a yard and a half of the place; I heard the noise, and then turned round to see what it was, and I discovered the prisoner attempting to take out two counterpanes; they were within the shop, on the inside of the window that was broken; he could not get at them without breaking the window; he had hold of them when I saw him; I had something on the counter, and ran round, and at the time I came round, he thought he had secured the two counterpanes, and he was pulling the other articles off the lines; I laid hold of these articles that he was forcing out of the shop; there was a piece of corded muslin; his strength was superior to mine, and he forced me against the broken glass; I called stop thief two or three times through the broken hole; he had these articles which he got from the lines; he forced them out of my hands, and he then ran away; he had-tied the door; but I opened it, so that I forced my way through, and pursued him; I cried stop thief! and I think he got the distance of about one hundred and fifty yards, when a person came up, and laid hold of him; this person came up, and attempted to stop him, and he dropped the goods, and then ran off, and I picked up the articles.</p>

               <p>Q. From the time you saw him in struggling with you, until he was stopped, was he out of your sight - A. There is just going out of the house a bin, and I did not see him for that; but I got sight of him before he was stopped. I picked up the things; the things I picked up, where the things I lost out of my shop.</p>
               <p>(Property produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the kind of muslin that I lost, and I believe this is it; it was muddy when I picked it up; I can swear to it from the manner it was cut out. There is nothing in the counterpane that I could swear to; but a counterpane was missing, and he took away a counterpane.</p>

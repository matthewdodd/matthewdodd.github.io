                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Richard Atkinson and another, oilmen, of Red Lion-street. On 14th Nov. Benjamin Masters came and asked for half an ounce of tobacco—while I was weighing it Mary Masters came in—I gave Benjamin Masters the tobacco—he tendered me half-a-crown, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—the tobacco came to 1¾<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when I put down the change, Mary Masters endeavoured to attract my attention, by asking if I would give her a sixpence for six pennyworth of halfpence—I told her we had a till-full of halfpence, and did not want any more—I saw Benjamin pick up the two shillings I had laid down with the coppers, and put them into his mouth—Mary said, "You might as well oblige me"—I said we could give her halfpence for a sixpence—I saw Benjamin Masters put a sixpence to the 4¼<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was on the counter, and he said, "Halloo, master, this change is not right, is it? I gave you half-a-crown"—I said, "I am well aware, my man, what you gave me, and what change I gave you"—I left the counter and walked round, and the moment I moved he went out—he did not get anything from me—when he got two or three yards from the shop I got up to him—the moment I got up to him he made a snatch at my watch—I held him two or three minutes, and Mary Masters came out and endeavoured to rescue him—she said, what did I want with the man, he bad done nothing, and so on—she took hold of him, and endeavoured to pull him away—the money in the shop was Mr. Richard Atkinson's and his partner's.</p>

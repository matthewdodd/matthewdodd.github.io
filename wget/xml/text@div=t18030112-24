             sworn. - I live in Whitecross-street, near Cripplegate, in the county of Middlesex: On the 30th of December, I saw the two prisoners with a coal-waggon; they stopped opposite a hair-dresser's door, in Whitecross-street; the prisoner, Worbys, came up the court, and asked the people in my own house where the cooper lived; I told him he lived there; I was in the court at that time; he knocked at the cooper's room, and the door was opened; I saw Worbys bring a sack of coals out of the waggon, and take them up stairs; I went over to a public-house, and then I saw Worbys come back; the old man, Daniels, untied the cord, and then Worbys took another sack out, and carried it to the same place; I went over the way, and looked at the waggon; I found it was a coal-merchant's waggon; I could not read, and got my wife to read it, but I do not recollect the name; I followed the waggon to Mr. Leveck's; it stopped there ten minutes, or better; I informed Mr. Leveck of what I had seen; the two prisoners were there; they threw two empty sacks on the ground; then Mr. Leveck came out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. They emptied all the sacks at Mr. Leveck's, did they not? - A. All but the two that I saw emptied at my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to distinguish one sack from another? - A. I saw them shoot the sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to say those were the same sacks that were emptied at your house? - A. Yes, I followed them close.</p>

             sworn. - I am a brewer, in Old-street: On the 30th of December, I received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120011"></xptr>some coals from Mr. Ward; the last witness gave me some information, in consequence of which I went upon the waggon, and endeavoured to tell the full sacks in the waggon; the two prisoners at the bar were with it; I found only thirty-four full sacks, and two empty sacks lay at the tail of the waggon, on the ground; I should have received thirty-six sacks, and I sent for Mr. Ward.</p>
               <p>ROBERT WARD sworn. - I am a coal-merchant; the prisoner, Worbys, was my servant; the prisoner, Daniels, I had discharged about a week before; Mr. Leveck informed me of this transaction, and I went to the yard while the prisoners were there, and I took them into custody.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are answerable for the coals till they are delivered? - A.Certainly, I have to make up two sacks; they were in my own waggon; I gave no orders for any delivery in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Worby's defence. Mr. Ward's clerk was on the craft when I went out of the yard, and how is it possible he can swear there were thirty-six sacks loaded.</p>
               <p>Daniel's defence. I was hired by the waggoner to help him that day, and there were thirty-six sacks delivered at Mr. Leveck's that evening.</p>
               <p>The prisoners each called two witnesses, who gave them good characters.</p>

               <p>On Friday was a week I was robbed, the 17th of February, I think it was a quarter past twelve at noon; it was within about ten yards of my <placeName id="t17860222-55-crimeloc303">Lord Mansfield's garden-gate</placeName>

I immediately turned back, and the pistol was within six inches of my ear; he said, I am a gentleman in distress, please to deliver your watch and your money instantly; I looked at him, and I saw he was the same person I had passed before, which surprized me a good deal, and I was getting off my glove, but I did not pull it off fast enough, and he began to use bad language; I took off my glove as quick as I could, and gave him my gold watch and seal, and a guinea and eighteen pence; he said, this is not all the money; I told him it was all that I had; he then rode off a few yards, and I saw him, when he was five or six yards from me, look at the watch, and put it into his coat pocket; then he began to flog his horse very much, and rode up the hill; I immediately lost sight of him, but I ran up the hill as fast as I could, and I met a gentleman, whose name is North, and some other people, in a minute or two; I asked him if he had been disturbed by a fellow that rode up that minute upon a grey horse; I told them I had been robbed, and he and a lady, and a gentleman that was with him, immediately turned and went with me to the Spaniards, and there they met with a person who lives in the neighbourhood, and he went to town as fast as he could, and went to the office, and gave information.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of the person of the man that stopped you? - Yes, I am sure of his person, perfectly sure of him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that that is the man that robbed you? - Yes, that was the man; but he is not in the dress now he was then; he had an olive-green great coat on; my watch has never been found, the seal has and the string, the seal was found that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. The person that robbed you had an olive-green great coat on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation on the number of capes that coat had? - I knew it when it was shewn to me; I was not particular whether it had two or three when I gave the description at Bow-street, where I have heard that I might say there were three capes.</p>
               <p>I am told you did? - It certainly has three capes, there are two that laid down, and one that is the cellar, that stands up.</p>
               <p>That is a very distinct thing; what sort of hat? - A round hat, down on the face, and down all round. </p>
               <p>The person that robbed you, told you he was a gentleman in distress, and therefore asked for your money? - Yes.</p>

               <p>On Friday the 17th of February, I saw Mr. Grey at a public house in Bow-street; I heard him saying he had been robbed by a highwayman near Lord Mansfield's house; as some of our people had been out that day, they had heard of it before me, but I heard from Mr. Grey that some of our people were waiting at the Catherine-wheel-yard, in Windmill-street; I believe it was about half after three when I went up, and I waited there in company with Atkins and Sayre, and Shallard, I believe till about half past eight, and at about half past eight, Sayre, who was standing at the window, tapped at the window; there came in a grey horse, the prisoner came on it, and turned into the yard; I was then in the road just as he came in, and he says to me, halloo, hostler; I said, halloo, Atkins and Snallard, and at the moment he got off the horse, from his left-hand great coat pocket I pulled out this pistol, and called them to assist me; we searched him further, and in his right-side breeches pocket I pulled out a guinea, eighteen pence, and a half guinea, and this seal that was in his breeches pocket; he said, what do you want with me? I hope you will use me well; and we said we meant to take him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have been now a good number of years in apprehending offenders? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have a pretty accurate knowledge of old offenders? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Had you ever this prisoner in your custody before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Had you the smallest complaint against him? - Never in custody clearly.</p>
               <p>He is not an old offender? - Certainly not; if he had, I must have known him.</p>

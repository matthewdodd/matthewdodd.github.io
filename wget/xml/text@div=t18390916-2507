                  </hi>—(<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) I am a journeyman skin<lb></lb>dyer. and live in Spicer-street, Brick-lane. On the 27th of July, I was at the Catherine Wheel public-house, in Essex-street, Whitechapel—as I came in there was a disturbance commencing in the tap-room, and I was trying to tranquillize it—I saw the prisoner there, but did not attempt to do any thing to him—as I was trying to pacify them in the tap-room, the prisoner struck me twice on the head—I found myself cut under the cheek-bone, but I did not feel it at the time—a policeman came in, and took me to the station-house—they bound up my wounds and took roe to the hospital—I did not see that the prisoner had any thing in his hand—I am quite certain it was him that struck me—I was not struck by any body besides him—I knew him before—we had worked together a long time—I did not follow him to strike him when he struck me, nor offer to throttle him and knock him down—I did not attempt to strike him—I had not said or done any thing to provoke him—I gave him kind words, and held him back that he should not make any disturbance—I was quite sober at the time—the house is kept by my employer, and we go there every Saturday to receive our money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor. I was at the Catherine Wheel public-house, on Saturday the 27th of August, at twelve o'clock at night—I was outside the tap-room before the bar—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in the tap-room—the prisoner was wanting to go in—his wife said, "Don't go in, if any body touches you it will serve you right"—he said, "I don't care, I will take, my comrade's part"—just as he was going in the prosecutor came out, pushing two or three drunken men out of the tap-room—he wanted to fight the people, and said, "What do you kick up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> for?"—he did not speak to any person in particular—I saw the prisoner behind him with something in his hand—I could not see what it was—he aimed a blow at the prosecutor, but it hit me, and knocked my pipe out of my band—they then all went out into the street, and the prisoner and prosecutor among them—the prosecutor came in again in two or three minutes, and was cut and bleeding—I did not see him do any thing to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a skin-dyer, and live in Plough-street, White<lb></lb>chapel. I remember the disturbance at the Catherine Wheel—I saw the prisoner there, and saw a knife in his hand—I could only see the blade of it—he hit the prosecutor on the head twice—I am sure he had the knife in his hand when he struck the blows—I do not know why he did it—the prosecutor had done nothing to him, he wished to keep quietness—the prisoner was just coming in from the street at the door at the time—the prosecutor was inside in the passage—he was trying to put the prisoner out—he did not strike him—he caught hold of him by his jacket—the pri<lb></lb>soner struck him on the head both times—I observed the blood in two or three minutes—the prisoner was drunk—this is not the prisoner's knife—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—it is something like the knife he had in his hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner deny it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said some<lb></lb>thing in his own language, which I could not understand—a person who interpreted said that he denied knowing any thing about it.</p>

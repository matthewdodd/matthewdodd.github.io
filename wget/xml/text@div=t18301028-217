On the 18th of October I received information that I had lost a table - I did not see it taken; I first thought the prisoner had taken it to the person I had it to repair for, and did not at that time take any steps to recover it - I found the prisoner Cartwright very drunk in a public-house in Cow-cross; he said he knew nothing of it - Ganly then came in, and said."Is it not all right? I took the table for Cartwright, and he sold it for 2l.;" I had them taken, and from Ganly's information I recovered the table, about six o'clock.</p>

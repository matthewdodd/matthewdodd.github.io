                  </hi> I am the wife of William Clementson, a mason, of No. 4, Duck-lane, Westminster. I have known the prisoner by sight above two years, but have known nothing more of him—he came to my house last Sunday morning, between one and two o'clock, early in the morning—last Saturday was my youngest brother's birth-day—we were up—we had a few friends keeping the birth-day—the prisoner came and sat down in the back parlour—I asked what he wanted—he said, "Some beer"—I said it was public place to have beer or anything of that kind, and said, "You had better go out, my friend"—he called me several names—he went outside the door, and a young man named Hogan followed out after him—he was one of the party I had told to put him out—I shut the side door—the prisoner knocked the panel of the door through with a shovel while I was in the act of it, and after the panel came through he struck me with the shovel through the panel—I saw him strike me—the hole in the panel was about four inches wide or more—I saw him through the panel—he struck me with the shovel over the left temple—he made another attempt—Hogan took me into say shop—my head bled very much—the prisoner's brother and three or four more came in with him—I heard his brother say, "Here is the shovel, <hi rend="italic">Denny</hi>, and give it to her,"using a very bad expression—I was taken to the West<lb></lb>minster Hospital—my head was dressed—I have been in very great pain—I can scarcely speak at times for the pain.</p>

I am a wood-turner and live at 15, Great Arthur-street, Goswell-street—I was out in the neighbourhood of Goswell-street on Saturday night, 30th October, at past 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner before me—there were other persons behind me—she came up and spoke to me—I had had two or three pints of beer, but that was all—before I was accosted by the prisoner I knew perfectly what I was about—she spoke to me—I did not understand her and I made no reply—I was shoved back after she spoke to me, and had a blow there and then, and I was struck into the road—it was the prisoner who struck me first, and she was the only one I saw; there were others—she struck me on the upper lip—it bled—my</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 24, Bridgewater-place, Aldersgate-street. On Saturday night, 30th October, about 12 o'clock, I was in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood of Goswell-street—I saw the prosecutor walking up Goswell-street quite fast—the prisoner went up to him and asked him where he was going to—he made her no answet—she <hi rend="italic">backered</hi> him, and put her hands into his pocket at the same time—she pulled her hands out quick, and then she shoved him down in the road, turned back, and ran up a court.</p>

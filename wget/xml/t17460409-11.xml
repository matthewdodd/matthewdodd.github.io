               <p>Rawlins. My Lord, no farther than I saw him on the 11th of March last, at Botolph Wharf. I saw him take several Hands of Tobacco. I told him to go away, but in the Afternoon he came again: I said Friend, I would have you go away, for I shall certainly secure you. I did not see him go, but the other Evidence, May, stopp'd him at the Corner of Darken-Lane; he took from him two Hands of Tobacco; I told May to let him go, what signified a Couple of Hands of Tobacco; but he said that was not all, for there was more with that; we took more out of his Breeches, which is in all 3 lb.</p>

               <p>Rawlins. I am Watchman to several Merchants.</p>

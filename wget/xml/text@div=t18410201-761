                  </hi>. I am a cravat-maker, and live in Park-street, Camden-town. On the 11th of January, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to my house to take a lodging—my wife showed him the apartment—he saw me—he agreed to take it, and to give 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, without asking any price—he said he had come from France, and he had some boxes which had come by the railroad, and were at the railroad station, Euston-square—(that is the Birmingham railroad station)—he said he had 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for carriage, or something to that effect, and he had paid 15 1/2 <hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and wanted to know what would make up the remainder—I said 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he wanted me to advance it him on some shawls and a watch which be pulled out, and put on the table—I said I had no money in the house, I could not do it, but he offered me very fair promises, and said he would pay me three or four months in advance, and offered 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the room—we bor<lb></lb>rowed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of a lodger, and made up the rest in silver, one half-crown, two shillings, and one sixpence, to help to redeem the boxes and trunks he had at the railroad—he left the shawls, but wished to take the watch to make up the remainder of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he was going to pledge it—I said our servant should take it, if it would be any convenience to him—he said he knew a place where he could pawn it for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he wished me or some person to accompany him to the railroad—I said I would go myself—he produced these shawls on the table—he said they were camel's hair, and were worth five guineas each—I lent him the money to secure him as a lodger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had not said any thing to you about his trunks at the railway, and if he had not produced the shawls and the watch, should you have lent him the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not, unless I was to accompany him for the trunks—we went together as far as the Birmingham station, and he wished me to go into a public-house in Whittlebury-street, to take something before we went after the boxes and trunks—he called for a glass of brandy and water, and while we were drinking, he wished to go out to pledge this watch to make up the remainder of the money—I asked him how long he would be, he said "About a quarter of an hour"—I would not have con<lb></lb>sented to his going, unless these shawls of camel's hair, worth five guineas a-piece, had been left at my house—he went, and did not return.</p>

               <p>more than the lodgings were worth I should not have refused it—if he had offered but 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the lodging I would not have had him—my chief inducement was to secure a good lodger, and likewise to accommodate him—I have not been a loser by this—I got my 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if I had not expected him as a lodger at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week I certainly would not have advanced him the money at all.</p>

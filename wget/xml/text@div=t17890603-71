She took the watch and buckles, and put into her pocket, and said she would take care of them till morning. I never saw them since; I was undressed and in bed; I did not know she took them down; she had been undressed and dressed again. We had both been in bed; we went to-bed between twelve and one, as near as I can guess; the prisoner Woodroffe told me she belonged to the house; the prisoner Williams said she sold the buckles, I told her if she would only let me know where the property was, I would not hurt her.</p>

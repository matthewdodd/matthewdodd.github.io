I produce this duplicate, which I received from the prosecutor—it corresponds with the one produced by the pawnbroker—I have several other duplicates, which I found on the shelf, on Sunday morning, where I took the prisoner—I found some other duplicates under some wet ashes in the fire-place—Charles Otter way was bound over to appear, but he is not here.</p>

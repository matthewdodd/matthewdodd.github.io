                  </hi>. I am still carrying on business as an indiarubber merchant, at 79, Upper Thames Street, City—in April, 1876, I saw an advertisement from a person requiring a partner, in consequence of which I communicated with George Pomeroy Dodge, 79, Upper Thames Street—I afterwards had a conversation with him—I received this letter of 18th April, 1876—in the result a partnership deed was drawn up—before signings the deed, Dodge showed me this letter: "Bermondsey Rubber Works, 79, Upper Thames Street, June 27th, 1876. Dear Mr. Dodge,—If you pay me interest by half-yearly payments on the money in your hands I engage not to apply for principal during the next 10 years unless I should in the meantime leave your employ. I write this letter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805270050"></xptr>
               <p>in order to enable you to conclude your arrangements for a partnership with George Lewis. Yours, &amp;c., L. J. Stonard."The deed was signed a few days after June 26th—the bankers were to be Smith, Payne, and Smith—Dodge said Stonard had been in his and his father's employment 20 years, and he continued in the firm as confidential clerk and book<lb></lb>keeper—he kept the cash-book and the ledger, a rough cash-book, and the travellers' commission book—he had to post from the journal and clean cash-book to the ledger and check the bankers' pass-book—I produce a counterpart he kept of the pass-book—upon receiving orders they were entered on one side of this book and posted to the journal—a Mr. Daniels did that—there is also a bought invoice book kept in the same way—this was kept by Stonard—upon entering the partnership Dodge gave me a balance<lb></lb>sheet and statement of affairs of Dodge in June, 1876—this is the letter in which it was enclosed—it is written by a clerk and signed by Dodge—the statement shows creditors 1, 610<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., then there is interest at 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, making total indebtedness 2, 936<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., good debtors 1, 186<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., lease and other assets 2, 936<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., stock in trade 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., fixtures 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., bad debts 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the balance in favour of Dodge being 1, 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received this detailed list of debtors in Oram, a clerk's, writing—in it there is 188<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company—I sat at a desk with Dodge and did the correspondence mostly—I knew nothing of the detail of the business before; I found the money—Dodge was to conduct the active part of buying, &amp;c.—on 6th July, 1876, in pursuance of the deed of partnership, I gave Dodge a cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—before that I had given him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to realise a charge on the lease—that was to be taken as part of my capital—on 13th September, 1876, I paid into Smith, Payne, and Co. 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 30th September, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10th October, 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., let November, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 24th November, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 27th November, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10th January, 1877, 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 17th January, 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 1st April, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in all 2, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I ordered new books, "G. P. Dodge and Co." to be printed on them—the printers left out "and Co."—one incorrect book was used by adding "and Co."in ink—two fresh books, were ordered—"and Co." was also left out of a considerable number of invoices, and others were ordered—these are some of the old ones—two are made out by Dodge and one by Oram, of goods sent to the Vauxhall Water Company—I find no trace of them in my invoice book, nor in the bought book, nor journal—I had no knowledge that such goods had been sold until December, 1877—there is no entry of it in the ledger—there is no record at all of the goods being sold, nor from whom they were purchased—I did not know this cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been discharged, until the termination of the partnership—there is no record of it in any of the books (<hi rend="italic">This cheque was made payable to G. P. Dodge or order, endorsed G.P. Dodge and Co., and was paid to Stonard's account at the London and West<lb></lb>minster Bank</hi>)—I did not know of the payment of the other cheque by the Vauxhall Company for 188<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. until some time after 7th July, 1876—it is Dodge's writing on the receipt for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and in the total on the invoice—this is an order from our order-book—it is in Dodge's writing—the red ink number corresponds with a blank counterfoil at the end of the book—about 100 orders have been taken out of the end of the book leaving the counterfoils blank—I did not know of this till I discovered other matters (<hi rend="italic">The order was for nine lengths of indiarubber from the India Rubber Company</hi>.) This is one of our old invoices—it is in Oram's</p>

               <p>writing, and made out to Messrs. Samuel and Co.—the receipt is in Dodge's writing. (<hi rend="italic">The amount was</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">less discount—it was dated</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1877.) I find no record of it in our books—there is no entry of this cheque 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which is made payable to G.P. Dodge or order, and endorsed G.P. Dodge—the transaction ought to have appeared in the ledger, most likely under "Sundries," and the amount of cheque in the cash-book, and the details should have been given in the journal—we supplied our travellers with books, and the enclosed orders to us, keeping the counterfoil of each order—this is a sample of such book, and this is an order from Messrs. Samuels to our traveller Oakshott—it is Oakshott's writing—it was Stonard's duty to enter it into the commission-book, and finally pay it—there is no entry of it—the account was kept by Stonard—this is a similar order, dated 16th July, 1877, of goods from Pellatt and Co., there is no entry of that—I had no knowledge of such order until I received a writ alter the ter<lb></lb>mination of the partnership, in November—under advice I satisfied the writ—the amount is 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there is no entry of any sum of money received from Messrs. Negri and Co., of Liverpool, and I knew nothing of it till these matters came about. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>

This is one of our invoices, and is in Stonard's writing—the heading is altered to 130, Queen Victoria Street. (<hi rend="italic">This was to T. and C.

Ingrams are taken from the order-book, and are in Dodge's writing—Ingrams supplied the goods subsequently sent to Letts—there is no entry of invoice, and the counterfoils are blank—I find an entry in the cash-book, folio 120, on 7th October, Ingram and Son, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that is paid—that is the sale record—these three letters are in Stonard's writing.

(<hi rend="italic">This showed</hi> 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">due to Dodge and Co</hi>.) The heading is "130, Queen Victoria Street"—a claim has been made upon me by the Liverpool Rubber Company, and I have satisfied their claim—I do not recollect the amount—the red ink crossing, "Brooks and Co.," on this cheque is Stonard's writing—the cheque is from the East London Water<lb></lb>works upon Fuller, Hanbury, and Co. for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and dated 29th November, 1877—this order of 9th October is Stonard's writing—part of this entry for sales to the East London Waterworks Company is in Dodge's and part in Stonard's writing—Stonard's commission is under<lb></lb>neath and others follow—the book was found in Stonard's presence at 130, Queen Victoria Street, under a search warrant granted by the Lord Mayor, also one of the misprinted order-books, which corresponds in every detail with this book—a number of orders are torn out—I find an entry of goods sold to Messrs.

               <p>mission on East London Waterworks Company's order is receipted in Stonard's writing—the letter acknowledging the receipt of the 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque is Stonard's writing—the cheque was collected after the dissolu<lb></lb>tion of the partnership—by the terms of the dissolution all debts due to the firm to 9th October were assigned to me—the deed of dissolution is dated 9th October, 1877—this is it—I received this list of debts from Turquand's—I have compared it with the ledger—it is signed by Dodge and myself—I find no entry either of Lett's debt of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nor of the East London Waterworks Company's for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the list—the liabilities of the firm were to be taken by me up to 8th September—I had not found out on 9th October that all the money I paid into the firm had gone, nor did I know of the other discrepancies—in my mind that list is part of the fraud—about three days before 9th October Mr. Dodge took our legiti<lb></lb>mate journal and turned it over, and said, "These are all our transac<lb></lb>tions; you see the business is going away from us"—that was at 79, Upper Thames Street—Mr. Stonard performed his usual duties till about 6 P.m. on 13th October—Dodge and myself attended—we went to Queen Victoria Street between 9th and 13th October—I gave no permission for the order-book to be taken there—shortly subsequent to 9th October a cheque-book was missing, the one we commenced with—I mentioned it to Mr. Dodge, and a second cheque-book was commenced—I first asked Stonard whether he had had it—he said he had given it to Mr. Dodge—I went to Mr. Dodge and said Stonard said he had given it to him—Mr. Dodge was angry, and said he hadn't got it—I suggested that we should advertise, and said I was willing to offer 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward—Dodge's solicitor said he had written to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> telling them not to insert it—the cheque<lb></lb>book was never found—at page 603 of the journal there is an entry of 1, 184 francs 5 centimes carried out in another column to 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. against Messrs. Mouliers fils—this was one of the debts assigned to me—the entry was made by Mr. Meyer, a clerk—I know of no other record of the transaction—Stonard used to come to Thames Street after the 13th October—he frequently referred to this journal—this invoice is in Stonard's writing—79, Upper Thames Street is crossed out and 130, Queen Victoria Street put on it—I have compared that invoice item by item with the entry in the journal at page 603; they are the same—this document without date is our claim against them—I received this letter from abroad; it is in Stonard's writing—I believe at that time it was correct and in accordance with the book—it refers to the first balance<lb></lb>sheet of 26th December, 1876, and the balance-sheet of 26th June, 1877, which are both in Stonard's writing and signed by Dodge—I believed they were correct—I have since examined them and found them other<lb></lb>wise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Before coming into this business I had been trading in China and Japan, And two years prior to entering into this partnership I was a man at large, with no occupation—I employed Mr. John Trurin, an accountant, of Ironmonger Lane, to investigate the accounts before going into the business—also examined it myself—I attended daily, except Saturdays—in five or six cases I wrote orders from the order-book, and filled up the counterfoil—the first one is dated 25th November in this book. but there is an earlier book, and probably I gave some from that—these orders wore also written by me, 21st and 22nd February, and 10th August, 1877—some orders were improperly taken out of this book</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805270053"></xptr>
               <p>I believe before August, 1877—I didn't notice they were gone—I knew of two cases in which orders were taken out to supply some spoiled earlier in the book—I often had the book—the first time I noticed the orders were out was when one was brought by a dealer in October or November, 1877—I instructed Turquand's in September, 1877—I sat at the same table as Mr. Dodge—the table is 3 feet by 2 1/2; feet—Stonard sat behind me at a desk—I opened letters and answered them—so did Dodge—we advised together as to answers, and consulted the books—I believe Dodge is a very clever man—Daniels was the clerk who entered from the counterfoil into the journal—Mr. Hunter attested the deed, which was made in duplicate—I didn't ascertain whether the debts were paid or not till November, 1876—I made inquiries—I won't swear I asked Stonard about them—I consulted the books—I have traced the Vauxhall Water Company's cheque to Stonard's account, but no further—I have not tried—I didn't know of it till after the dissolution of partner<lb></lb>ship—I didn't at that time—448<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was placed to Dodge's credit—the 3,715<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was placed to my account, instead of 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took it for granted it was right—if there was any discrepancy I know it now for the first time—I cannot say that I noticed that the creditors had diminished from 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 367<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had perfect faith in Dodge and Stonard at those times—I noticed that by the June 1876 balance-sheet the firm owed me 4,574<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I have not discovered any error—I noticed Dodge had nothing to his credit by the June 1877 balance-sheet till August, and then I had an accountant in—we condoned the fact when we discovered Dodge did not bring in the 188<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from the Vauxhall Water Company—Mr. Dodge said to my solicitor "I am sorry about these debts, but the Mid<lb></lb>summer balance-sheet will tell a different tale," and my solicitor was satisfied with the remark—I knew that amounts were being paid to Dodge's private account, instead of to Smith Payne's, the bankers of the firm—the amounts in this book were entered by my instructions—it is in Stonard's writing—if it did not go to the partnership I do not know where it went—finding the debts did not come in three or four months after I entered the partnership I inquired and found some were paid—I said to Stonard "I must have these particulars," and he gave me a list—I said after that "I will have it in the book"—some pages were left blank for entering debts collected without my knowledge prior to November, 1876—Mr. Oram dealt with the ready-money transactions—the prisoner was given into custody on 29th March—I applied for a warrant at the Mansion House in November—an injunction was obtained against Dodge to prevent his opening letters—I opened letters in his presence, and he got an order to look at the books—I gave the prisoner a copy of what we call the secret journal, the one 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. reward is offered in if lost—the instructions from one brother to the other he never applied for—the prisoner's writing is in every page of this book—this is his writing, "Query: Wm. Scotchman had got this"—I think Dodge has defrauded me of over 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On Tuesday the 4th of April last, he went to Bed before me, and as soon as I came to Bed to him, he caught me in his Arms and kiss'd me. I desired him to desist, for I did not like such Behaviour. I turn'd about, and went to sleep, and by-and-by he thrust his Y - d so hard against my Fun - t, that it waked me. I told him I would bear such Usage no longer, his Inclinations were not for my liking, nor never would; and if he made any farther Offers that Way, I would immediately complain, and expose him to the whole House. He swore, if I spoke of it, he would do me a private Mischief. He had made some such Offers before, and talk'd to me in the most vile Way; and therefore I had desired the Chamberlain to let me be removed, but the House was then so full that I could not be chum'd elsewhere. At last I resolved to discover his Behaviour, notwithstanding his threatning to do me a Mischief, and so I sent to ask an Attorney's Advice how I should proceed, and then on the Sunday following I disclosed it.</p>

               <p>Council. Did not you owe him 18 s. before you charged him with this? Krik. No.</p>

            . As I was drinking in the Coffee-Room 2 or 3 Months ago, the Prosecutor seem'd uneasy with his Chum, and said, he wanted another. I asked him why? Because, says he, this would have B - d me. I told Sylvester of it. He said, that the other was a lying Rascal, and would have served him so. A Day or two after they both met in the Publick Room, and charged one another, and gave one another the Lye, so that the House had a Suspicion of them both, and the Prosecutor, as well as the other, got the Name of a lying, sodomytical Fellow, and it was thought scandalous to keep Company with either of 'em. <rs id="t17320705-42-verdict194" type="verdictDescription">

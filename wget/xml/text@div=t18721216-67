                  </hi>. I live in Charlton Crescent, Islington—on 22nd Novem<lb></lb>ber I came out of the Royal Mint Refinery in the afternoon, and saw the prisoners coming by the Clock House immediately opposite—one of them said "Now, <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi>, do what I tell you," and he made a motion with his fingers—I saw them take hold of a sailor; but thinking it was a joke, I passed on—one of them struck the sailor three times in the stomach—I went down to Dock Street to purchase some oranges, and Driscoll passed me—Sullivan came in front of me, and snatched my watch from the guard, and dashed it into the road—he endeavoured to stop me, but I picked it up—my first impulse was to chase Sullivan, but the prisoners ranged themselves on each side, and I thought they would close in behind me—there were 100 people, but not a soul would lend me a hand—Sullivan ran up the yard, and I turned round and said "I will mark the lot of you"—one of them said "Drop it," and I immediately received a blow on my right arm, in which hand the watch was—Shea withdrew his hand from his pockets, and said "Take that," and I saw something glittering—I cannot say what it was, but I received a cut in my eye and a severe wound on my leg by being pushed against the wall—I went to the police and gave information, and afterwards went to the hospital—I saw the whole of the prisoners—Shea is the one who struck me in the eye; I stated on the first occasion that it was Murphy—on the Thursday afterwards I went before the Magistrate for the first time, and identified Driscoll and Shea out of seven or eight others—I was then asked to go over to a public-house opposite, where they said there were several of them; I went there and looked round, and behind several others I identified Murphy and Foy—I took one in each hand, and said to the detective "Take them; that is two more"—I then went over to the Police Court and charged them, and they were committed for trial—the Magis<lb></lb>trate</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187212160023"></xptr>
               <p>asked me if I would swear to Murphy as the man who struck me—I said "Not positively"—I did not call to mind the position in which the men placed themselves—after they were committed I was asked to go to the police-station, and in a few minutes I was asked to go into a room—I saw eight or ten men, among whom I identified Shea—I told the Magistrate I was in error in stating that it was Murphy, and that I was confident it was Shea—you might put him among 1000, and I could identify him.</p>

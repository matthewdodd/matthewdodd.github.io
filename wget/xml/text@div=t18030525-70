               <p>Q. Did you see him searched at the watch-house? - A. Yes, there were three shillings and half-a-crown in silver, and some halfpence found upon him; the Queen Ann's shilling I lost was among them.</p>

             sworn. - On the 15th instant, I was constable of the night; about half past twelve o'clock, between the 15th and 16th, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house by the prosecutrix, and a watchman, and Lord Macdonald's servant; Mary Jones charged him with robbing her of three shillings in silver, and sixpence halfpenny in copper; I asked her if there was any of the money she could swear to; she said, there was a Queen Ann's shillings, with a small scratch on the head, and the head was rather plain; and instead of giving her a shilling, he had given her two tin sixpences; the prisoner denied the charge; he said, he neither had shillings, nor had he any tin about him, he never made use of tin; I searched him, and found three shillings in silver, a half-crown, and eight-pence halfpenny in copper; I also found three pieces of tin, and a bad sixpence, and a pair of new shoes; one of the shilling is a Queen Ann's shilling.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutrix.) What was he to give you a shilling for - had he any connection with you? - A. No; he said he would give it me to get me something to drink as I was going home.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he give you the two sixpences? - A.Under the arch way of Gardener's-lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, to-morrow will be a fortnight, between eleven and twelve o'clock, coming home to my lodging, I met this woman coming over Westminster-bridge; I was very drunk, I made a stumble; she said, she would take care of me; I did not know she was a woman of the town; I said, I would give her something to drink; we went to a house, it was not open; I said, I would give her a glass at my lodging; she took me to an obscure place, and began sumbling my pocket, and my face, and wanted me to do what is common to man and woman, and I would not; I had a shilling in my hand, she took it from me, and then I bid her good night; we had not been parted long before she came back, and charged me with taking her money; I was stupidly drunk; she afterwards came to Tothill-fields, and wanted to extort money from me to keep out of the way, and not appear at my second examination.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutrix.) What time was it you met this man? - A. Near twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking? - A. No, not at all, I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. He says you snatched some money out of his hand, is that true? - A. No, he had none in his hand but the two pieces of tin he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prison? - A. Yes, he sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer to make it up with him? - A. Yes, for my own money, I wanted nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first meet with this man? - A. Just as I came down the steps out of Bridge-court.</p>

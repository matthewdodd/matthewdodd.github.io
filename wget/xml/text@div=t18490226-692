John Clark delivered fourteen sheep to me from Mr. Wilson—I drove them to Kilburn, and put them into Mr. Weal's drove field, about half-past one o'clock—I went to the field about half-past four, and they had got out into the adjoining field—I could only find thirteen—I did not sell a sheep to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> I keep a beer-shop in Kilburn-lane; the prisoner came to lodge there on the second week in Nov." About a fortnight before the sheep was stolen he said he should kill another sheep before he left my house for the country—he had killed two sheep at my house before—on 3d Feb; he brought a flock of sheep in front of my door—I opened the back gate, and he brought a sheep into the skittle-ground, and said, "Turner, if you like you may stick that sheep"—I said I would—he went away—I killed it, cut it up into joints, and hung the skin over the rails of the skittle-gound, and on 5th Feb. gave it to a policeman—I had part of the sheep, and paid for it.</p>

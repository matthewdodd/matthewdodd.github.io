I live at No. 3, Wood Street, and am sexton and parish clerk of Christ Church, Middlesex—I have charge of the church,—about 6.45 on the evening of the 28th October, Nevitt came to me and told me the church had been entered—I returned with him and went up the chancel, and, on the communion table, I found two bottles of wine and a decanter partly filled with wine—they had been taken out of the church<lb></lb>wardens' room, from the locker, which had been broken open—all the offering boxes, seven in number, had also been broken open—they were all empty—the window on the south side aisle was open, and there was space enough for a person to creep through—it was closed on Wednesday evening—I had to prepare for the evening service—after the service the choir practices, and when they had gone, I made thorough search in the church but could find nobody there—I left at 10.15—before doing so I saw the place securely fastened—soon after 4 the next morning I was called by the police—I went with them to the church—we entered by the north-eastern door—I examined the middle window and found the place had been made larger, and there were a few burnt matches there which were not there the previous evening, and also some pieces of glass that had been broken off—the com<lb></lb>minion table-cloth was gone, and the velvet had been taken off two pillows—this is the velvet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was shown to me by the police—the reading desk cupboard had been broken open, and I missed five keys from various locks—the churchwardens are Mr. Samuel Mully and Mr. Richard Bunsfield.</p>

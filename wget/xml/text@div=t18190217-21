            . I am constable of Aldgate. On Sunday morning, about seven o'clock, I was standing in Hartshorn-alley, Fenchurch-street, and saw the prisoner at the corner of Northumberland-alley, and a little girl following him with a basket; she returned soon after, and I followed her into Leadenhall-street, took hold of her arm, and asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170016"></xptr>her what she had got in the basket; she screamed out,</p>
               <p>"You must not look here, Sir." I found it contained five bundles of candles. I took her across to the watch-house, and asked her if it was her father that she followed down the alley? she said Yes. I went down the alley, and found the prisoner in the prosecutor's stable, cleaning the horse. I collared him, and said I had just stopped his daughter with five bundles of candles in a basket; he said,</p>
               <p>"For G-d's sake, have mercy, I have a wife and a large family." I said his master must know of it; I took him to the watch-house, his daughter began crying. I went to his house, and found a basket containing eight parcels of candles, some boxes, broken up, and the other articles, which the prosecutor claimed,</p>

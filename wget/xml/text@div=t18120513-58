               <p>Q. Did you lose two screens at any time - A. I did. I missed them on the 3rd of May, on Sunday morning. I saw them on the prisoner's premises at half after ten, on Sunday morning, May the 3rd. I was called up by the watchman. He told me, that he stopped a man that had been robbing my shop. I dressed myself, and went with the watchman to St. Giles's watchhouse. He said, he stopped the prisoner with a basket of tools. (Pointing to a basket of tools, at the watchhouse.) On the next day I found my workshop had been untiled, big enough for a man to get in. The prisoner had worked in my shop untill I turned him out.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any suspicion did you go to Langford's premises - A. I did He lived in Plumb-tree-street, St. Giles's. He occupied the first floor. And as I went in at the door, by the side of the door I saw two screens, that I used to keep the sun off the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took part of the shop of him, and I bought the screens of him, and many other things.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to prosecutor. Had the prisoner ever taken part of the shop of you - A. No. He was there on sufferance, until he got another place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep his tools there - A. He did. I turned him out on the 1st of May, with his tools in the shop. I catched him cutting up a stretching-frame, for a picture-frame, for a customer of his.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say when you charged him with untiling your shop; did he say that he untiled the roof of your shop to get his things - A. I did not hear him say that. He shook his fist at me, and threatened me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was stopped with my tools I sent the watchman to tell him of it.</p>

             saw the legs off the folding screen. I took one of the screens to Langford's apartment, by his desire, a week before he was taken up. He said, it would be very handy to put at his bedside of a cold night.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take it - A. I did not know but it was Mr. Langford's property. I told Linnard of it before Langford was taken up.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard somebody taking the lock off inside of the shop. I called another watchman; and when the other watchman came up the prisoner was coming out of the mews. I stopped him. He told me they were his own tools. He said, one half of the shop belonged to Mr. Linnard, and the other half to him. Mr. Linnard came down to the watchhouse. The prisoner told him, he had a right to take his tools out of the shop.</p>

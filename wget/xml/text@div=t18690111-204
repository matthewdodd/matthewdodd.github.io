                  </hi>. I live at Manor House, Camden Road, at Mr. David Ulman's—these two or three flannel undervests, and this petticoat, are Mrs. Ulman's, the marks have been picked out, but you can see plainly where the letters were—these four scarfs, pair of gloves, and writing case belonged to a little boy in the house—the property lost was worth nearly 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—there were watches, diamond rings, and other articles—I was not in the house, I merely speak to their identity.</p>

I am a servant at Manor House—on 20th November, about 7.30 p.m., I went up to Mrs. Ulman's room, in front of the house—there is a portico at the side of the window—I had not been in that room before that day—I found it very much disturbed, the bed clothes pulled up, the drawers and wardrobe open, and a shawl spread out on the floor—the window was open, I do not know whether it had been left open—there is a fastening to it—I missed dresses, jackets, and other articles—I saw this desk safe on the drawers the day before.</p>

I have known both the prisoners many years, and have repeatedly seen them together—the first time was perhaps ten years ago—a day or two before 20th November I saw them together in Church Street, Shoreditch, talking to two others, and between that time and their apprehension I saw them together about five times, and there were always two men with them—I also saw them the night previous—on the night of 21st December I followed one of them from the Adelphi, and on the morning of the 22nd I went to Shoreditch, to the house of two other men, and I went to their lodging, 2, Vincent-street, Shoreditch, about 7 in the morning—I went to the ground floor room, knocked several times, and they asked who was there—I said "Police"—I put my foot against the door, and it was open—I found the prisoners in bed, and told them my name—they knew me very well—I told them I should apprehend them for stealing a diamond bracelet, value 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I searched the place, and found these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> by the side of the fire-place—I called their at<lb></lb>tention to the articles—they said nothing.</p>

            . I am 'prentice to Mr. Smith. On Saturday, August 24, between the hours of twelve and one, the young lad and two more stood at the window while I was putting a watch together: when I had put it together, I wound it up, and went behind the door where our regulator stands, to time it; a tall genteel young man came into the shop, and stood between the window and me, so that I could not see a great deal of the shop; he took a woman's watch chain out of his pocket, and asked me the value of the chain and seal? I told him the chain was worth very little, as it was not compleat, but the seal might serve himself. Just as I mentioned these words, the prisoner came in as quick as possible, and took this watch out of a drawer that lay upon the board; there were two in the drawer: he went out again immediately: he went to the farther part of the shop, to go to the drawer; he passed by me again to go out, and I pursued him, and took him before he had got a dozen yards. I brought him back into the shop, and asked him what he had got of ours? (I did not see him take the watch, but I was sure he had taken something) he made no answer: I went to search him, and he took it out of his pocket, and threw it upon the ground at about a yard distance. My master saw it upon the floor before I took it up: I took the drawer out not three hours before, for a tool I wanted; the young man stayed in the shop till I came back: we did not know then that he was any confederate with the boy: a neighbour asked him if he knew the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion at that time that the man was concerned with the boys?</p>
               <p>Waddington. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other two?</p>
               <p>Waddington. He that came into the shop about the chain was one of them; the other ran away.</p>

               <p>I never saw the watch till it was shewn me by the man in the shop; I live in Liquorpond-street; my father is a mathematical instrument maker; I belonged to St. Giles's free-school; I have left school about nine months, and have drawn beer since at the Blakeney's Head in St. Giles's, and at

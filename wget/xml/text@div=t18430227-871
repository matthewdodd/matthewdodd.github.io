On Thursday morning, the 23rd of February, a little before ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming down my stairs, with a large bundle of clothes—I said, "Oh, you are a thief!"—he passed by me down the stairs, opened the street-door, turned round, threw the bundle in my face, and went out—he did not say anything about a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—the bundle con<lb></lb>tained the articles stated, which were taken from a box in my mother's bed-room—the bed-room had been fastened—I also missed some silver spoons, some gold seals, and trinkets, which I have never got back—I never saw the prisoner before—I am surf he is the man.</p>

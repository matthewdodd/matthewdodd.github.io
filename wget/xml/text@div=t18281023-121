               <p>BULLOCK's Defence. I met Atkins, who is my sister, and asked her if she would go to sell the pigeons with me; she said Yes, and we came to Smith's, and sold ten of them - I asked 1s. a piece for them, he said he would give me 8d. - I said No, but at last I let him have them; my sister knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>ATKINS' Defence. I was coming from the shop just as my brother said he was going to sell some pigeons - I went with him; he said he was going to buy a bushel of apples with the money - I went, as a sister would do, to see he made no bad use of it - there was not enough money in the house, and the man gave 6s. 8d. for them; my brother has never been into my house since last Christmas - I did not know where he got them, he said he bought them.</p>
               <p>COURT to LOT FLETCHER. Q. Did you tell the prisoner to go and fetch the owner? A. Yes; and Atkins said to him, "Go fetch the man you bought them off" - they both went away, and never returned.</p>

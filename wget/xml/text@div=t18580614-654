I was in the shop, on 20th May, when my sister served the prisoner—I saw the prisoner put down a half crown and a farthing—after she left, I took it up and found it was bad, wrapped it in paper, and put it in the cash box by itself—it remained in the till till Satur<lb></lb>day night, when the prisoner came again, but I did not serve her—I took it out of the cash box, and the policeman marked it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather seller, of Commercial-place, City-road. On Friday evening last, about 8 o'clock, the prisoner came to me, and told me he knew a party who had five hides to sell, which he wished me to purchase—I told him he might bring them—I knew him, and made a communication to his employers—on Saturday evening he came, and brought five hides—he expected payment for them, but I put him off, and told him to come on Monday evening; they were worth 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 42<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, which excited my suspicion—these are the hides (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—I can swear to one of them.</p>

I am clerk to William Shore, a leather manufacturer, of No. 40, King William-street The prisoner was his warehouseman—here is my writing on the back of one of these hides, written on 4th Oct.; it is the property of my master, and had not been parted with before Friday last to my knowledge—the others resemble my employer's property.</p>

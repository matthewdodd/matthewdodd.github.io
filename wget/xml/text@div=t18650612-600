                  </hi>. I am senior partner in the firm of David Hyam and Co., foreign warehousemen—the prisoner was in our service—he collected money when requested—the gentlemen whose names are mentioned in these three receipts were indebted to our firm—I see the name "Henry Huitson "to all of them, it is in the prisoner's writing—on 25th May I called the prisoner into my private room—I told him we had reason to believe that he had re<lb></lb>ceived an amount from Messrs. Grays'—he said that he had—I said, "What have you done with it?"—he said, "I have lost it out of my pocket"—I said I did not believe him—he begged very bard that I would look over it and he would get the money in the afternoon from his sister, but I was deter<lb></lb>mined and took him to the station—I said, "You may as well say whether there is any other money you have taken, "and he said, "Only two"—he mentioned the name of Prior, and another name which I don't recollect—I never receive money—I have not received either of these sums.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic"> Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had he been in your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think some four or five years—I don't think he is eighteen yet—I don't know any<lb></lb>thing of his father, I saw him some years since—the prisoner received 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year from me, 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, he was paid weekly—he has lost his mother, his father re-married, and he has been living away from home—I did not tell him it would be better for him if he told me—I told him we had been robbed to a great extent—our chief clerk was there, the cashier was not; the chief clerk is not here—I said, "I can't overlook this, we have been robbed to a very large extent"—it was occasionally the prisoner's duty to go out on Saturdays to collect the money due on that day; not every Saturday; sometimes another might have gone—I think the cashier gave him the accounts to collect—he would sometimes call at one place and sometimes four or five, never a dozen I should say—he should have entered the accounts in the books on the Monday, he would not return on the Saturday; our business is entirely closed on the Saturday—his duty was to pay it into the bankers on the Saturday—he might have collected on Wednesday, but not to my knowledge—he could go out collecting when he pleased on the Saturday—we don't see him from Friday night till Monday morning—if he collected too late to pay money in on the Saturday, he would pay it in on the Monday.</p>

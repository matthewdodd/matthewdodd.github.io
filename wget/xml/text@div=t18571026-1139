                  </hi>. I am secretary and clerk to the trustees of the Borough Market. We have, under our Act of Parliament, to collect the tolls from persons coming to the market—up to 1855, we had been in the habit of letting the tolls—at that time the trustees took them into their own hands, and the prisoner was appointed collector of the tolls—he went on acting as collector for the next twelve months—it was his duty to enter the tolls as he received them, in a book, and from week to week to produce that book to a local committee, and at the end of the month to produce that book to me, in order that I might enter the proceeds in the cash book of the trustees, and produce the book at the monthly meeting of the trustees, held on the first Friday in every month—it was his duty to pay the money into the bank weekly, and to produce that book also to the local committee, to show that the money had been paid in—this is the book in which he made the entries of money received, and this is the bankers' book—the prisoner commenced collecting in June, 1856, and he went on collecting till June 24th, 1857.</p>

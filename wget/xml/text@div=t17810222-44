I went to the woman and asked her how she was? she said she was full of pain all over; I said if she would turn on the other side I would examine her and tell her it she was in labour. She turned round, I examined her, and I then told the woman who fetched me that she was neither in labour nor with child. When I said so they all began to abuse me; then little Jenny said, she had a favour to ask me, that was to rub a spot on the face of the tall one (

After they had thrown me down two of them fell upon me and throttled me; I did once cry out murder! they stopped my mouth with their hands and throttled me. They pulled my shoes off and took my silver buckles out; then they all put their hands into my bosom and up my petticoats and shook me, and untied my top petticoat to see if I had any other pocket on; they got the guinea; they took my housewife and took out of it a pair of gold ear-rings, value 4 s. and an half crown; there was nothing else of value in it. I scrambled up off the floor as well as I could; as I got up one of them laid hold of me by one arm and little Jenny by the other; they pulled off my two gold rings, they were very hard to get off; Jenny swore a sad oath and said, if they could not get it off they would cut my finger off. She got one off and put on her finger; then they pulled the other off and made a scramble for that, but I do not know who got it; then they all three ran out.</p>
               <p>What became of the woman who was in bed? - When I said she was not with child she got up and sat on the side of the bed. When the other three ran out a man and a boy came in and pushed me out.</p>

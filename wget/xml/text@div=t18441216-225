                  </hi>. I am a private watchman in the Old Jewry. Be<lb></lb>tween five and six at night, on the 9th of Dec., I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's warehouse, and he brought out a roll of something white with him—I saw him put it into the dust-hole, behind the warehouse door—I then saw his wife come out of the warehouse, and go down into the cellar to the warehouseman—the prisoner came over and spoke to me, and said it was a cold night—he then walked back to the dust-hole, and took out this parcel, which is like the one he brought out of the warehouse, and it was taken from the place where he put that—he put it into some bags which his wife had to make—he was going to put it on his shoulder, and to carry it away; I stopped him, and called the warehouseman—this linen rolled out of the bags.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was the dust-hole covered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Part of it was—you laid the remains of a parcel of bags on the part of the dust-hole which was covered—when you brought something out, you attempted to place it by the side of the bags, and one end of it fell into the dust-hole—I did not see your wife speak to you—she came out and went towards the cellar—I had an opportunity of seeing you when you came out with something white—I was not talking to my wife—she was not near me—she was on the step above—she was there before you moved the article from the dust-hole, and before you attempted to go out of the gate—I have not said it was my wife saw you put the article in the dust-hole—I had no conversation with my wife about it in the yard—I stopped you under the gateway—I spoke, and you stopped—you carried the things in your arms, and wanted to go into the warehouse, but the door was shut—you then went further on, and was going to the cellar—your wife wanted to take these things out of your arms, and out dropped this parcel on the cellar steps—you had the bags</p>

               <p>rolled up in your arms—they were not tied, and this parcel was in them—I saw it, because it rolled out—I did not handle it before Mr. Trewin gave it me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. George Watt, a linen factor, at No. 8, Old Jewry—we employed the prisoner's wife to make guano bags—I know this piece of linen is Mr. Watt's property—we have had it in the warehouse six months—it is the only piece of the sort we had—I know it by the mark on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you find it on me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; I saw it roll out of the parcel which you was carrying at the time—I am not aware whether the bags were tied up or not—I believe they were tied afterwards—I believe you tied them, if they were tied—we give threepence a dozen for making the bags—a good hand can make ten dozen in a day by working ten or twelve hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this the same sort of material that bags are made from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they are made of coarse wrapper, very different to this—the prisoner's wife made the bags at home—he generally came to bring them for his wife—he came for them, I delivered them to him, but this came from a different warehouse—he had to pass across the yard to fetch this—I believe I sent his wife up to the counting-house to get the goods entered while he was packing up—she came and told me I was wanted, and I went back into the cellar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went with my wife with a gross of bags, and she was forced to work not only Saturday night, but all day on Sunday; on Monday we carried them home, and he said, "There are only five dozen more ready for you; you had better go and speak to the clerk;" my wife went up, and came and said he was wanted; he went, and in the mean<lb></lb>time I laid the bags on the dust-hole; I then went and found this bundle in the dark, (there was no light in the warehouse, only in the counting-house,) and not knowing any difference, to make up the gross which we usually receive, I put this on the dust-hole, and the place being too narrow it fell in; the witness stated that I put it in the dust-hole, which made it look more criminal; then again he stated that it was his wife saw me and told him, and he watched me; the other witness states the bags were tied up; I had left them tied up, and when the watchman spoke to me I turned round and was going back to the counting-house.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

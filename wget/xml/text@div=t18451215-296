                  </hi>. I live in Hartshorn-court, Golden-lane, and keep a fish-stall in the street. On the evening of the 12th of Dec. the prisoner came to my stall and asked me for a pennyworth of eels, with which I supplied him—after he had eaten them he put his hands into his pocket and said, "Now I'll go"—I said, "I hope you will pay for what you have had before yotf go"—he said, "I am off"—I caught hold of his coat, and said, "Pay me," he said he would not—some gentleman said, "Make him pay you, mistress"—he said, "I can pay you, I have got half-a-crown"—I said, "Give it me and I will get it changed"—he said be would not trust me with it, or change it himself—he did not pay me but <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me down on the pavement, and I gave him in charge of Neville.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in James-street, Old-street, St. Lake's, and am a hackney coach driver. On the evening of the 12th of Dec. I was in Old—street, and saw the prisoner opposite Welter's gin shop with a policeman, I heard him say to the policeman, "Let me go"—he said, "No, I can't, you are in my custody; it is not my fault, if you will go like a man I will loose you"—he had hold of him—the prisoner said, a second time, "Let me go"—the policeman said, "As I said before, if you will go like a man I will, you shall walk by my side"—the prisoner said, "If you don't let me go I have something in my pocket that will b—y soon make you let me go"—he put his hand into his left waistcoat pocket, but could not find it there—he then put his hand to his right pocket, and took out this knife—I could not see whether it was shut or open then, but when he had it in his hand I saw it was open—he said, "I will b—y quick make you let go"—I was fearful of something more serious happening, and I went and seized him by the hand—directly I did so I was thrown down, I cannot say by whom, for the mob was all against the officer—as I fell, the prisoner drew his hand back, and in doing so pretty nearly severed my thumb from my hand—I went to a doctor, and have not been able to do anything since—it was done while I was falling—the blood spirted all over my face, and over the persons round me—I seised his hand with my right hand, and the policeman threw him down—he was certainly very tipsy.</p>

I saw the prisoner push the woman down, and he was given in my charge—as I was going with him towards the station-house, he caught hold of my collar, and asked me to let him go—I said if he would walk quietly like a man I would let him walk by the side of me—he asked me a second time, and said, "I have something in my pocket that will b—y soon make you"—he pulled out this knife—I would not swear whether it was open when he pulled it out, but when I saw it it was open—he held it towards me—Maggs saw the danger and caught hold of both his hands—they had a little struggle, the prisoner snatched his hand back—some one threw Maggs down—I threw the prisoner down and he was taken to the station—I took the knife from him after we got to the station-house.</p>

I thought she was a customer's maid, one Mr. Hall in Duke street ; I said to her, what did she there at this time of night, she said, what will you please to have? I went up to the Plough, a publick house, she said, she would not go there, but to her mistress's house; I went there, she asked, what I would give her to drink, there was another woman with her : Then I said, what you will, she called for the Mistress of the house, but would have 6 d. for it before hand: She desired me to make a glass, and forced me to take it ; she desired me to sit down, I did, she came to my knee, and said she was going to buss me, I push'd her from me, she got hold of my watch and pull'd it out; I got hold of her arm, the other woman behind took it, and run away with it : I ran by her to catch the other, the prisoner push'd me back, either with her fast or head, and said, what did I want? the other ran quite off with it, I was not above 4 or 5 minutes in the house ; she was taken up on Monday, and committed by justice Fielding. I did not know who she was till I got into that house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hay salesman, and live in Cumberland-market. The prisoner was in my employ for about four months—I was with him when he sold this hay and straw to Perkins—the prisoner never brought me either of these sums—on Saturday, the 20th of March, when I paid him, I said, "The coachman has not been up to pay for the hay and straw"—he said, "Has not he?" or something of that kind—he did not return to me after the 20th of March—I did not send him for this money—he ran away from his home altogether, without notice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He had no authority to get this money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not this in particular, but he had received money before several times, and brought it to me—he was my servant and carter—Perkins was one of his customers before he came to me—he brought me three or four customers—he did not have a commission on what he sold, nor sell this on his own account—I did not then know he was making out the bills in his own name—Perkim✗s bought the hay and straw of me, and asked if I could not take less—I did not offer to take a picture for the money—the prisoner's wife said she would bring one if I would not take him into custody—he has been in business for himself as a hay salesman—I did not take him on account of his connection with salesmen—I never gave him a commission.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you pay him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the week, but sometimes I had no work for him—he had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., according to what he earned—he was not sent to collect any specific sums—I have my book here, in which I have debited Perkins for the hay and straw.</p>

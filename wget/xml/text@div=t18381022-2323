                  </hi>. I live with Mr. James Martin, a draper, at Limehouse. On the 22nd of September, between five and six o'clock, a person came into the shop, and said a person had run away with a piece of cloth—I went out, and, seeing the people running, I went with them—I turned down a street, and saw the prisoner running—he ran some time, and was stopped till I came up—he then dropped upon his knees, and asked me to forgive him, and said it was from distress he did it—this cloth is my master's.</p>

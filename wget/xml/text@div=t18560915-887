                  </hi>. I live at No. 40, Webber-street, Old-street-road, and am foreman of the works to Mr. George Myers, of Lambeth. The three prisoners were in his employ, Clark and Brown as plumbers' labourers, and Perry as plumber—on 13th Sept. Mr. Myers was engaged in building the Oriental Bank, in Broad-street—the three prisoners were employed there—they were all the men that were employed about plumbing—I was on the watch, and saw them cut off some lead pipe—I could not see which of them it was, but it was one of the three, and the other two must have seen it; they were not above a yard from each other—I then saw them cutting it up into lengths nine inches or a foot long, but could not see which it was of the three—it was new pipe, and those lengths could not be used in the building—Clark beat the pipe with what is called a <hi rend="italic">dresser</hi>, which is used in the trade—they next rolled out part of a sheet of lead, which was sent to be fitted to the gutter and flat—I saw them all three rolling it; I am sure of that—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150058"></xptr>
               <p>they were in the basement, and I was under the stairs, observing them, pro<lb></lb>posely—Perry, the plumber, cut the lead, and after it was cut Brown went to see what o'clock it was, and came back and said, "It wants 6 minutes to 12"—I could not observe which of them cut the lead off, as the cellar was very dark, but I saw them unroll it and cut it, and I found the knife after<lb></lb>wards—I saw Perry cut the sheet of lead; he and Clark rolled it up, and, when Brown came and said that it was 6 minutes to 12, Perry and Clark fastened the lead round Clark's body, while Brown kept watch, with the door of the basement in his hand, which leads towards the stairs where I was—they could not see me from that door; I was at the side of the stairs, about ten feet from where they had the lead—Clark and Perry put all the length of pipe they had cut up into the sheet lead; and when they had fastened it round Clark's body, and the bell rang 12 o'clock, Perry walked out—Clark walked after him, and put the key into his pocket—I followed them, and detained Clark and Brown till a policeman was sent for—Perry stood by—I took Clark to the station, and saw the lead found on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they opposite the door, or at the further end of the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two feet from the door, which opens inwards—I peeped over the sides of the banisters—I was in a very dark place; they could not see me—I will take my oath that I saw Perry cut the sheet lead—the pipe was cut first, and, the sheet ten or twelve minutes afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you seen the lead before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, both the sheet and the pipe, in their proper state, a day or two before—the pipe was not required to be cut for anything, it was to lay on to a cistern—cutting it would make it unfit for that purpose.</p>

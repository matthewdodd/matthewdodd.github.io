When I came down the next morning at a little before seven, I found the door of the tap-room, which goes into the passage, standing open. I found my bar open, and I saw a pane of glass was broke, so that a hand might have been put through to open the bar. Then I found that the halfpence, which were kept in a basket in the bar, and which I had seen there the preceding day, were gone. I did not know exactly how much there was, but I suppose there might be about forty shillings worth. I had barred and locked both the doors over night; I found them open in the morning when I came down. A person told me, two or three days after, of a boy's having been stopped with some half-pence; that led to a discovery.</p>

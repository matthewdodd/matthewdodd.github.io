               <p>I am a lodger, I went to work and locked the door, and left the key with my landlord, one Turnstile, he is not here; I was fetched from the place where I worked about four, on account of some of my things being taken, when I came home, I found the door open and the things gone that are mentioned in the indictment. I left the sheets on the bed, and the two spoons in the tea chest on the drawers; I saw the things at the constable's, one of the tea spoons is marked with a P. and the other with an I.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner in Thames-street, in company with another man, on Friday the 28th of May between three and four, I watched them loitering about sometime, I saw them go along the street with a bundle under their arm, I do not know where they got it, I took notice of them they had nothing before, and I saw them after with a bundle, they were out of my sight about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070100"></xptr> ten minutes; I called to him and he ran away and the other ran after him, I pursued him and cried stop thief! when he was stopped he had no bundle, he was out of my sight turning the corner; I am sure he was the same man I saw with the bundle.</p>

               <p>On Friday the 28th of May, I was standing at my door in Distaff-lane, I saw two men pass, and soon after heard the cry of stop thief, and I caught the prisoner by his side at the corner of Distaff-lane, he then made a fall down down in the kennel, and I saw in his hand a key without a ward, which I am informed was a picklock key, he leaned down and put his hand in the kennel.</p>

               <p>Did you see him have any bundle at all? - No, a number of people came up, and Mr. Spawton came up; there was a bundle found at a house in Friday-street, but who found it I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you pick up the key? - I did not, I was engaged in taking care of you.</p>

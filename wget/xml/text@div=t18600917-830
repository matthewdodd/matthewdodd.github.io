               <p>live at Woolwich—I am a miner—about 2 o'elock on the morning of 12th August, I missed my way—I met the prisoner in Rotherhithe-street, he was dressed as a policeman—I told him I was very tired and sleepy and had missed my way, and asked him if I could go and lie down anywhere for an hour or two—he said the likeliest place he knew was in one of the boats against the water-side—he pointed out a boat to me and I went there and went to sleep; the prisoner left me—when I went to sleep I had a watch and chain—the watch was in my fob and the guard round my neck—I awoke about 4 o'clock—I felt for my watch and it was gone—I walked up the street when I came out of the boat—it was five or ten minutes before I missed my watch—I had not seen or spoken to anybody from the time I left the boat till I missed the watch—as soon as I missed it I turned back and met the prisoner; we bade each other good morning, and he asked me how I had slept—I said I had slept very well, but I had lost my watch—he wanted me to go to the police-station with him, but said he could not go till he had done his duty—we walked up the street together and met a dock-watchman—that was about 5 o'clock—we were talking together a little while, and the prisoner said he wanted to go to a place to case himself—he went away about thirty yards to an old building—I followed him—I asked him if there was a water-closet about there—he said, "No; but I could go anywhere there"—he was buttoning his coat at the time—I walked to the corner of the stable and there saw my watch and guard lying on the ground, about three or four yards from where the prisoner was—I picked it up and said to the prisoner, "I have got the watch, I know your number, and I will go and report you now"—he said nothing to that—I went back to the watchman; while I was with him the prisoner came up—he said he was very sorry for what he had done—I said yes; but I could not look over it; I would go and report him—he begged very hard that I would forgive him and at last I said I would—I told him I had been out all night and I felt cold and wanted a cup of coffee—he asked me to go along with him—I went, but I would not stop to have any coffee, and he directed me to a coffee-house—I went there and he came to me with the watchman—the prisoner paid for three cups of coffee, one for me, one for the watchman, and one for himself, and he went and got some money and gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took it—ten days or a fortnight afterwards I saw the prisoner again—I went to the station house and asked for him, and went with him to a public-house and he gave me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had forgiven him two hours before he gave me the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am watchman to the Commercial Dock Company—on 12th August, about 5 in the morning, I met the prisoner and prosecutor in Rotherhithe-street—the prisoner asked me if I had seen his mate—I told him that I had not—he said, "This is a strange affair; this man has lost his watch and guard, last night"—we fell into discourse as to the value of it, and after a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, he asked if he could go round into my premises to ease himself—I said, "Yes;" and pointed out the way—while he was gone the prosecutor spoke to me and then followed him and came back in about five minutes with the watch and guard in his hand—the prisoner followed him, and Wooffinden, in the heat of passion, said that he would go to the station and report him—the prisoner said, "I hope not"—he said that he would, and wanted me to go with him—I said that I had to change my clothes and would meet him, which I did—I went with the prosecutor to a coffee-house—the prisoner came there about ten minutes afterwards, and I saw him pay for some coffee for us—after some little agitation he said that he had got no money, but I saw him give Wooffin<lb></lb>den 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never heard Wooffinden tell the prisoner that he was unjustly accused of taking the watch.</p>

On the 21st of January, about a quarter past ten o'clock in the morning, I went to Cornhill, the watches were then all safe. I returned in about an hour, and missed three off the board, which was near the window, they were worth about 18 l. I went round to the different pawnbrokers, and found the prisoner at Sowerby's, in Chiswell-street, where he had been detained; he asked me to be as merciful as I could. I said, I would on account of his wife and family. I did not know him before.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. When he went out, I went down stairs into the kitchen, which is under the shop, and had been there but a few minutes, when I heard a foot-step across the shop, which I had locked before I went down; I sent a little girl up, she called out; I ran up and found the middle door forced open - the box of the lock was forced off; it was safe just before, that door leads from the shop to the bed-room, that and the bed-room door were open. I went into the shop, and missed some watches, but could not tell how many, till my husband came home. The lodgers were up stairs, and my children were in the house.</p>

I went to No. 25, Bunhill-row, but could find no such person. I returned and told him, I would not be trifled with; he then said he had it from his mother, who lived in the Hackney-road, and if I went there I should be satisfied. I went and found her, but had no reason (from what I heard there), to believe his account was correct. I returned and gave him in charge. I had locked him in the parlour, while I went, and the other two watches were found just where he sat, among a bundle of clothes, we knew nothing of them, he was not present when they were found. Marsden came in and claimed the one offered in pawn. We had not then found the others, but when he saw them, he claimed them. I produce the one he offered me.</p>

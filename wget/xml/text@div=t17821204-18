               <p>Court. I want to ask you how long you have know that lad? - About two years, Sir.</p>
               <p>Where does he come from? - Winchester.</p>
               <p>Do you come from Winchester? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been in service with him? - Yes, I lived with him about half a year at Winchester.</p>
               <p>Have you heard about this spoon that he is taken up for? - I never heard of it till my master told me of it the next morning.</p>
               <p>Did he come to see you at your master's? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>What I am going to ask you, you will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040020"></xptr> understand, will not affect you, it is nothing at all to you now, therefore only give me an answer as to him; did you see any thing of a spoon that was broke by him? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>While he was with you? - No, my Lord, I never did.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of a spoon that was bent, while he was with you? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any thing about it? - No, nor he never mentioned any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any thing about a spoon being broke, or bent, or missing? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not I there that night, and was not I bending the spoon? can you deny it? - There was never a spoon mentioned while I was in the kitchen; I had a red cloak of his sister's, and he called on me to carry it to her; he took it to her; I do not know how long he had been in town.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you been in town? - I came the 14th of August.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of him from the time he came to town till this happened? - I have seen him, he lived with Mrs. Smith in Suffolk-street.</p>
               <p>Jury to Heather. What state was the spoon in when it was brought to you? - In the same state it is in now, broken in two, which gave me a suspicion that it was not honestly come by; I have had many applications on his behalf; his friends are country people, and live in great credit.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 13, in Field-lane, Holborn-bridge. I was robbed on the Thursday in Easter week, my brother, myself, and little boy, were coming from <placeName id="t17800510-33-crimeloc178">Hampstead</placeName>

I had gone but a few steps before I was seised by my collar, on the right-hand side by the prisoner Humphreys, he demanded my watch and money or my life, or to that purpose. I was much frightened; I looked him in the face the whole time, and told him I had no money.</p>
               <p>Was it a dark or light night? - As fine a star-light night as ever was without a moon.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish his person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you tell whether he had his own hair or a wig? - He wore his own hair tied behind. In the interim that he took my watch, another man came up, put his head in my breast, and struck me in the groin. The first person still had hold of me. I could have been certain of Humphreys by his voice, if I had not seen him. I suppose the other man did that to look at my buckles; as I was in mourning, they were black. I said I had no money and my watch was gone. After they had searched my pockets, they both went away; I turned round and looked at them, and saw my brother at about the distance of three yards, seised hold of by another man, the two prisoners went to him; I heard him say I have only a guinea and three or four shillings, or to that purpose. The short man came back again, and then the prisoner, Humphreys, collared me again; they searched my pockets, and the short man took some halfpence out, they both went back again to my brother the second time; the man who had hold of me at that time, I suppose to be Johns, but I cannot swear to him. They went back again to my brother, and beat him about the head and breast with a bludgeon. I called to him and bid him give them what he had; he still persisting to save his property, was either tumbled down or knocked down, and then they burst his breeches open to seek for his watch. They were with him five minutes, I dare say, which makes me so positive to the prisoner, Humphreys. I looked at him the whole time; I had an opportunity to go away which I should have done had it not been for leaving my brother in that situation.</p>
               <p>You take upon you to swear positively to his person? - Yes, and his voice. I knew him directly as I saw him at Sir

            's and described the three men. At the same time I advertised my watch with the particulars; I never heard any thing more of them till last Friday night.</p>
               <p>What sort of a watch was it? - A<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100044"></xptr>silver watch with a double case, it had a silver seal upon a swivel, with the initials of my name on one side, and a woman's head on the other. It had a base metal key, gilt, and a steal chain. I have never seen my watch since. I picked Humphreys out as soon as I saw him; I knew him by his person immediately. When he spoke I knew him by his voice.</p>
               <p>Was the third man a tall or a short man? - There were two tail men and one short one, about my size but lustier; one of the tall men was with my brother, and did not come to me.</p>
               <p>Was not you in such confusion as not to be able to make much observation upon their persons? - I was much confused at first; I looked the man full in the face. I could not think how he could get between my brother and me.</p>
               <p>What became of the little boy all this time? - He ran away immediately to the Adam and Eve.</p>
               <p>How old is he? - About ten I believe.</p>
               <p>Is your brother here? - No, he is not, he was held down by them and did not take notice sufficient to speak to the persons of any of them.</p>
               <p>Humphreys. He knows I lived within three doors of him for six weeks after this? - I never heard of it till after he was taken. I never knew that such a man lived there.</p>
               <p>Court. Had they regimentals on when they robbed you? - No; they were all very genteelly dressed; I took them for gentlemen when they passed us on the grass.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the colour of their clothes?</p>
               <p>Humphreys had a large fashionable flapped hat, a little turned up, a fort of a drab coloured coat pretty large, whether a great coat or a close-bodied coat I cannot say, but it was a light or a quaker's colour, white stockings, and a pair of white metal or silver buckles.</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I have been at his shop twenty times since the time he says I robbed him, to buy hearts, and kidneys, and things.</p>
               <p>Court. What shop do you keep? - A tripe and offal shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever seen Humphreys in your shop? - No.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prosecutor? - I do.</p>
               <p>He lives near you? - About half a dozen doors off.</p>
               <p>Can you tell any thing of Humphreys, on the 16th of March, which was of a Thursday? - I cannot tell, I never heard any thing to his prejudice till this affair.</p>
               <p>What was his general behaviour during the time he lodged with you, was he regular? - He always behaved exceeding civil and kind to every body in the place.</p>
               <p>Was he regular in his hours of coming home? - Pretty well; he generally used to come home about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he used to go to the prosecutor's house to buy tripe or any thing? - They used to buy tripe and things but I do not know where they used to go.</p>
               <p>Did they use to dress tripe at your house? - They had a room up stairs.</p>
               <p>Did he pay you regularly for his lodging? - Yes; half a crown a week.</p>
               <p>Did he lay constantly in your house? - I do not know that; he was never out of a night, except once he was in the country to see his friends.</p>
               <p>Jury. What business did he follow while he lived with you? - He was a soldier, and the other was a tailor; I never went up into the room to see what they did; Brown lodged in my house, not the prisoner Johns.</p>
               <p>Jury. How did he use to appear in his apparel? - He always appeared very decent.</p>
               <p>Had he very genteel apparel? - Yes; he appeared rather genteel.</p>

               <p>What were they? - The clothes he has on now (a kind of claret colour.)</p>
               <p>Had he any other clothes besides them? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Was it his practice in the afternoon to take off his regimentals and put on these clothes or not? - I cannot recollect; I did not use to take much notice of them.</p>

The prisoner came into my employ about the 29th of March - he boarded and lodged with me; he had for a few nights slept in an adjoining house which was empty - he came in on Monday in the evening, about eight o'clock - he had been out with a parcel; I said, "You have been a long while gone, I want you to go out with another parcel immediately;" I took hold of his coat, and felt something hard in his pocket; I said, "Anthony, what have you here?" he said Nothing; I said, "Yes you have, I feel something hard;" he again said Nothing, and went towards the counting-house; I said, "Don't go, Sir, I want you to go with another parcel;" he said, "I won't go;" but moved on towards the counting-house - he went in and turned round; I said, "What have you got?" he said Nothing - I put my hand into his pocket, and took out a length of black ribbon on a block; I said, "Where had you this from?" he said, "I called on my sister this morning, and she gave it me to take to my brother's wife's sister;" I asked how often he had called on his sister, and on his brother's wife's sister - he said he had occasionally called and taken parcels; I said, "Have you never met her in the street by appointment?" he said, "Yes, when I have had parcels for her;" I then asked if he was not accustomed to call generally; he said generally, and had given her parcels which he had from his brother, who lived in a respectable house in Bridge-street, Blackfriars; I then asked when he was at his sister's before that morning - he said the Thursday or Friday before; I said "This may be all right, but it will require some explanation; I will go and look into your boxes" - I asked which was his box; he pointed it out, and opened it with a key - I found in it two fans, which he said he had brought from his sister to take to his brother's wife's sister; I then said, "Are you aware that these fans and ribbon have my private mark on them?" he said they were not mine, he had them from his sister, who lived in Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell - I went there next day with a warrant, but found nothing - she keeps a green-grocer's shop, and her husband is a patten-maker; this ribbon is worth 1s. 10d. and the fans 4d. - the prisoner afterwards said he had taken nothing before, but something came over him all on a sudden, and he took this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Had you threatened him, or said it would be better for him? A. No; he had been a good while out; I cannot tell when this mark was made on the ribbon, but it is my own writing - I had a good character with him from a wine-merchant; I cannot say how long before I found them on the prisoner I had seen the mark - I will not swear I had had it in my hand within a week; we have a pile of goods of the same sort.</p>

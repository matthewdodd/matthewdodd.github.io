               <p>Q. What time in the day had you seen it - A. I saw the silver in the bag ten minutes before the prisoner went out of my house. It was in a small chest of drawers, in the bar. The drawer was not locked. The prisoner had been sitting in the bar. He came to ask me how I did. I knew him four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left the prisoner alone while the prisoner was sitting in the bar - A. Yes, I went over the way once.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the prisoner was gone was it that you missed it - A. I missed it before he went out of the house. He got up, and said, he had got three friends that had gone round to see the Tower; he would go and see the Tower with them, and he would return with them in a few minutes. As he stepped from the bar I perceived that his pocket hanged heavy I saw a glimpse of the bag in his pocket. I turned round and looked in the drawer, and the bag of silver was gone. I ran out of the house after him, to see if I could see him. I could not find him. I did not see him until the officer brought him, about seven days after I lost the silver. The bag was brought to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much money was in the bag - A. There were seven pounds in the bag, eight dollars, about five three-shilling pieces, about six eighteen penny pieces, and six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time when you saw him come in until the time you saw him go out, had there been any person in the bar that could have got to that drawer - A. Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said, the prisoner said he would come back again - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever come back - A. No. The prisoner had two glasses of gin and water, and as he went out he threw down a shilling. I said no, Charles, I shall not take any thing. He was then stepping out of the bar. I saw his right hand coat pocket hang heavy. After he went out of the house I pursued him directly to a corner house; where there were several ways. I could not see him, nor which way he took. That is all I know.</p>

            . I am a storehouse-man belonging to the Tower. On Monday the 13th of July, I had been into the stone kitchen to drink a pint of porter, and between three and four o'clock, on my going out, I saw this man go behind a centry-box; he stooped down and dropped this bag. The centry-box was close by the Spur gate.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the Spur gate from the public-house that Mr. Bailey keeps - A. Not many yards. I do not know the length.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it in sight of Mr. Bailey's house, or not - No, it is not He stooped behind the centry-box, and put something down. He went out of the Spur gate, and went over the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you know what it was that he put down there - A. I went immediately and picked up this bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. I had seen him some years ago, when he lived at the Cross Keys, Gracechurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sufficient knowledge of the prisoner's person, so as to be sure it was the prisoner that put that thing behind the centry-box - A. Yes. I took the bag home to my lodging that same afternoon, and left it at home that night. The next morning I was informed that Mr. Bailey had been robbed. On Wednesday morning I carried it to Mr. Bailey, and shewed it him. He took it in his hand, and returned it to me again, and I have kept it in my possession until this present time. This is the bag; there was no money in it when I found it; it was just as it is now.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know the bag to be mine; there is a small hole at the bottom; and I know it by that opening, just as if it was a double bag.</p>

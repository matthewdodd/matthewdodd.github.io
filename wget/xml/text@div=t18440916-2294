                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Rodney-terrace, Mile-end. Matthews was my servant, and Harford has been in the service of Mr. Hall, next door to me, for three or four years—I have lost wine from my cellar, from time to time—I had the bottles of wine counted, and laid in rows; and on the 28th of Aug. I missed one bottle—the cellar-door is kept locked, and the key of it is kept in a drawer—I called Matthews into the parlour, and told her she had been into the cellar, and had got wine—she told me that Mr. Hall's servant gave her a key to get into the cellar, which she had got from my last servant, who had given her wine, and different things before; and the bottle of wine which she took that day they drank part of over the wall, and the remainder they put into a pint bottle, and took it into Mr. Hall's—she said she had not had above a couple of glasses of it, and the rest Mr. Hall's servant had over the wall—it was port wine—I kept the key of the cellar in a drawer—I found a key in the servant's room, which I brought down, and tried to the cellar-door, and it opened it directly—I found it in a pocket belonging to Matthews.</p>

               <p>out of the cellar—those were the words I used, and then this conversation took place—I did not tell her I had counted my wine—no one lives in the house with me—I have a son, who is a stationer—he is with me of an even<lb></lb>ing—I do not know a person named Christopher—I cannot tell how many bottles of wine I had, but they were laid fifteen in a row—they were all right at twelve o'clock one day, and the next morning one of them was missing—it was my own wine, purchased and paid for by me—I cannot tell whether any part of it was in the house before my husband died—we had some in the house then—I cannot tell whether this bottle was one of the older or the newer wine—Christopher was a person connected with the Custom-house—I believe he is now at Calais—I heard there was a charge against him—I can<lb></lb>not tell whether any of this wine came from him—I had half a pipe at two different times—I paid the man who sold the wine—I believe Mr. Chandler was the last who got wine for me—I cannot say whether this was any that Mr. Chandler got—I cannot say how much wine I have now—my son has not access to my cellar—very likely some of this wine was brought into my cellars by Christopher—I do not know that he was the person who put the wine into the cellar, nor whether it was from him or not—he was paid for some wine some years ago—I have not had dealings with him for wine with<lb></lb>in these two years—I never dealt with him at all, nor paid him at all—my son paid him, as he has other persons—I am not keeping any wine for Chris<lb></lb>topher—he is not a wine-merchant.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 208.) I took the prisoners into cus<lb></lb>tody, and searched their boxes—when I was searching a drawer in the kitchen at Mr. Hall's, Harford brought me this pint bottle—she said, "Here is the bottle, I had the wine"—the bottle smelt of wine—I took the bottle and Harford to the prosecutrix's—Matthews said, "That is not the bottle, it was a quart bottle"—Harford said, "This is the bottle"—neither of them de<lb></lb>nied that Harford had had wine of Matthews.</p>

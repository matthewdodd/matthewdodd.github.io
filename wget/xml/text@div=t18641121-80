I am a corn-dealer, of 4, Kennington-lane—I have known the prisoner about four or five years—I have had business transactions with him a good deal in that time—I have discounted bills—in August last, he brought me this bill (<hi rend="italic">this was a bill for</hi> 01. 7<hi rend="italic">s. at two month, drawn by the prisoner, and accepted by John Gibson, Ely-place, Dulwich</hi>)—he brought it, and had the money for it—nothing particular was said about it—I have made inquiries about Dulwich, and neither place or name is known.</p>

Payne," is his—I do not know where the uncle is now—I am informed he is out of the way on account of these charges of forgery—I have been all over Dulwich to find Mr. Gibson; I went to the best authorities—I gave money for the bill—I don't think it was the renewal of an old one—I cannot say it was not, because the accounts have been so mixed up.</p>

             - I had some nuts in my hand - she asked me to give her one, which I did - she then asked for another - I gave her that - she then asked me to give her some beer, which I refused - she then asked if I would go with her - I asked where she lived - she said, "Not two minutes' walk" - I went to a house with her, and went upstairs - I sat down on the side of the bed along with her, and she picked my pocket of 5 1/2 sovereigns, in a purse - I tried to stop her, but she ran down stairs, and Townsend stood at the bottom of the stairs, and threatened to beat my b-y brains out - I got out and got an officer - we found the prisoner in about twenty minutes - my master's name is Wilcox - I had sold a bull of his on the road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPPS. Q. What time of the day was this? A. Between three and four o'clock- I had had my dinner, but nothing after it - I was quite sober - I had never seen Gray before - I went about two hundred yards to where she lived - I was sitting on the bed about a minute - the door was not shut - I said nothing at all to her while I sat on the bed, nor she to me - this money was in my watch-pocket - it was my master's - upon my oath, I did not spend it - my waistcoat was not buttoned, when I was on the bed - my fob is about six inches deep - I had a watch and chain in my fob under it - she got her hand into my fob, and took my money, and I could not prevent her - she pulled me about, and felt where the money was - she put her hand against me - there was no purse found on her - I described her as having thin shoes and a black gown on - she has the gown on now - I gave her the nuts very near the lane - her house was 200 yards up the lane - no one let us into the house - I was not asked for any money to pay for the room - I saw Gray searched - she denied all knowledge of me - there were two or three other women in the house - when I got into the room, I put my hand into my fob, and pushed the purse further down - she took me there to pick my pocket - I thought so then, when I was going up-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why did you not go down again, in place of going into the room? A. Because she took hold of me, and led me in - she had not hold of me in the street - I did not think in the street that she was going to pick my pocket - I am twenty-five years old - I am in the habit of coming to town to sell cattle, and am intrusted with money to buy and sell - I had left a lot of cattle at Windsor - I was going to Romford to fetch a lot of cattle - I got off the coach in Piccadilly, and only walked through London.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say that you think now, that she took you there to rob you? A. Yes - and I thought so then, when she took hold of my coat - she took the money out of my pocket, and was gone in an instant - she felt my pocket, and put her hand in.</p>

             (police-constable H 122). The prosecutor came to me - I went with him to several places, but could not find the prisoner - we then went to Heneage-street, and I saw Ann Garner, the prisoner who goes by the name of

            , at a house - the prosecutor said that she was the girl who stole his purse - she denied any knowledge of him - I then took the other prisoner - I found nothing on them but a small penknife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor take you to the house where he said he had been robbed? A. Yes - the prisoners did not live there - I knew they frequented that house - I asked the prosecutor if he saw Townsend - he said, "Yes - she stood at the bottom of the stairs, and threatened to do me some bodily harm."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the phrase he made use of, that she threatened to do him some bodily harm? A. I cannot exactly say he used those words - he used several phrases tantamount to that - I thought it was a more soft way of expressing it, than to say she would knock his b-y brains out - he made use of several other words.</p>

                  </hi>. My father is a dairyman and farmer at Wolston, near Coventry—in February last we had a cow which calved, she fell sick, was attended by a veterinary surgeon, and soon afterwards died, we sent for the defendant to skin her, my father met him in the street—he is a jobbing butcher—he came on 27th February and offered to buy the cow, my father sold the carcase and the calf to him for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he skinned it on our premises—I saw it after it was skinned, it looked a dark colour, and smelt bad—two days afterwards, it was removed by the defendant in a wheelbarrow—it smelt worse then—the calf lived.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a meat salesman in Newgate-market—on the morning of 3d March a packet of 3 quarters of beef arrived at my estab<lb></lb>lishment by the London and North-Western Railway, it was labelled and directed to me, this is the label, (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Timothy Hancox, Wolston, War<lb></lb>wickshire, to Edward Matthews")—I believe it was dressed in the ordinary way in which meat sent up for human food is dressed, and packed in the usual way in cloths—it had a peculiar appearance, but I could not decidedly say it was totally unfit, of course if we have anything doubtful we call the attention of the inspectors to it—Mr. Newman had been to me about the beef two or three times that morning in consequence of a telegram he had received—I received this note (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Sir, I have sent you some beef, I</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of the Corporation, ap<lb></lb>pointed by the Commissioners of Sewers—my attention was called on 3d March to three quarters of beef—I received a telegram on the evening before and waited at Mr. Matthews' till it came—I saw the label; I saw the hamper opened, I examined the meat, it was dressed in the usual manner as beef is, it was very red and inflamed, I could see that it was part of a cow that had died: to an experienced eye it was decidedly obvious that the meat was diseased and unfit for human food—I afterwards went down to Wolston and saw the defendant, he is a jobbing butcher there—I took the sergeant of police with me to his house—I told him I had come down to make some enquiries about three quarters of beef he had sent to London, that I was an officer and what he told me I should have to repeat to the authorities—he said he had sent three quarters of beef to Mr. Matthews—I asked him if that was the meat he had from Mr. Cate, he said, "Yes"—I asked him if this note was his writing, he said yes, but he had not sent it up for human food—he said he had boiled the other quarter down and given it to his pigs—I showed him the label and he said it was in his writing.</p>

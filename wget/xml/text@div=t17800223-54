Then immediately another gun went off, that gun was pointed rather upwards; I stood in such a surprise, I did not know how to contain myself. I have been drowning and catching for life, and I never was so frightened before. I said, What are you? Who are you? One Mr.

I believe I said I would take them into custody, they were fit to serve the king. They said they had a right to fire their guns, and they would do as they liked, they bid the law defiance, and bid me defiance. I said to Kelly, I charge you to aid and assist in the king's name, for I would have taken them all to gaol that night. The women cried out, Do not take them! do not take them! They persuaded me not, because they knew them; as Bower was going along, he still abused me; afterwards I went to the bench of justices.</p>

               <p>We had been to dine at Hammersmith; just after we had passed by Mr. Serjeant Davy's house, I heard a scream, like that of a woman; the women with us were frightened a good deal; Mr. Brooks said, Mr. Lewis let us walk on and see who these people are; soon after that I heard two guns fired. I saw the second gun; Mr. Brooks said you shall go to the cage or are fit to serve the king. I went over the rail to Mr. Bower, and said Mr. Bower you are a man that pretends to know yourself very well, I am surprised you should fire a gun at this unseasonable time of night, on purpose to frighten us; he said, is not this a proper place to fire a gun? No; said I, I do not think it is a proper place just by a nobleman's window, and in the footpath by the king's highway. Bower said, you are all very red indeed. Mr. Brooks was in a sad passion, he charged us to aid and assist in the king's name, and he would have them in the cage. I saw the gun which was fired second up at Bower's shoulder. I saw by the flash it was pointed in the air.</p>

On Saturday night, 13th Sept, I went to bed about 12 o'clock—before I went to bed I went round the house, and fastened every door and window—I was the last person up—I was called up next morning, about half past 5 o'clock, by a neighbour, seeing my door open—I found the side door open, and there was an entrance to my back yard—I missed a copper tea kettle, some cheroots, some halfpence, farthings, and some other things—this is my kettle; I can swear to it; I soldered this handle on the lid seven years ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brandon-road. On Sunday, 14th Sept., I was living at Timothy Carter's house, in Sutton-gardens—there were only two rooms in the house—the prisoner lived there at that time—I cannot tell how long I had been staying in the house—I think the prisoner had been there about a fortnight—on that Sunday morning I saw this tea kettle in Carter's house, and some cheese, candles, moist and lump sugar, and some farthings—this was between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning—the prisoner and Carter were then in the house—I saw the prisoner take this tea kettle out of Timothy Carter's house to a house up higher, to Joseph Barnard's, who is a sweep.</p>

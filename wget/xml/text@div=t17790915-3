A gentleman and lady lodged in my house, who missed a great number of things. I got a constable and ordered him to search the garret, and in the prisoner's box he found ten shifts, which had been cut out of my holland sheets, as she herself acknowledged, and eight tuckers which had been cut out of my cambrick handkerchiefs. I can swear to them and a fine white holland gown. I had a suspicion of her sister, and took the constable to her sister's. We found a number of things there in a box. The prisoner acknowledged that the things found at her sister's were my property; there was a gown and some caps that were cut out of a tambour cloak.</p>

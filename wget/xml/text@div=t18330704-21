I never saw the prisoner till the 21st of May, when he came and asked for Mr. Smith - I said Mr. Smith had been gone for four years, but Mr. Fuller was master now - I said "Do you want a job;" he said, Yes- I said I "don't think it is any use for we are very slack, but you may call in the morning" - he went up the yard- I thought him a long while; I looked and saw him with one lamp in his hand; he then lifted up a cloth, and took another - I went into the street and took hold of him; I said "This wont do" - he put down the lamps and I kept him till the officer took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask you who was the maker of them? A. Yes, I said it wont do - he was between two carriages when I saw him; he took the lamps from a chaise seven yards from where I stopped him; he had one in his hand, and then took another from the near side of a gig with his right hand.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you see it safe last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I had used it, I put it down—there might be a dozen or more persons with me—I did not get at all drunk—we did not agree that the saw should be pawned for a shilling, and that we should have a whack of drink out of it—It was pawned two or three hundred yards from the shop—I did not drink with the prisoner at all.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM TILLEY. I live at No. 90, West Smithfield. On Saturday, the 9th of November, I was in <placeName id="t18331128-51-crimeloc305">Cheapside</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Was there not a very great crowd? A. There was; the person was behind me, and the prisoner was close to me - I turned round instantly; there were several persons behind me - the prisoner had on a jacket; the pocket of it was outside; I saw a very small part of it sticking out of his pocket - he said, "Let me go, I have not taken your handkerchief, some person took it and put it into my pocket;" that was impossible - a woman saw him take it.</p>

            . I am the son of the prosecutor. I was standing by my father's side; he felt a tug at his pocket - I turned round instantly and saw the handkerchief in the prisoner's jacket pocket; I took it out, and took him by the collar.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Part of it was sticking out of his pocket? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When the gentleman caught hold of me the handkerchief was in my hand - he said I was to go with him; I said I would.</p>
               <p>MR. CARRINGTON to BRADLEY. Q. Was he ever in your charge before? A. I never had him in custody before myself; he is known but not on this side of the water; I believe he has been at Maidstone once or twice.</p>

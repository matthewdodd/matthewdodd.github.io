            . I am a publican, and live in Margaret-street. I was in the skittle-ground on the 5th of May; Daniels played one game, the other prisoner did not play; Melson was very tipsy, and was showing his watch in the ground; I told him to put it into his pocket, or to give it to me; he said he could take care of it himself - I soon afterwards saw Magrath setting close by him; his hand was near his breeches pocket; and at the same time I saw Daniels take hold of the prosecutor's hand, and shake it heartily; at that moment Magrath left the ground - I followed him, and when he got outside the door he ran; I called out Stop him! he stopped, came back, and asked what I wanted him for; I said I believed he had got something that did not belong to him; I sent for an officer, and sent for Melson; I asked if he had got his watch - he said No; the officer then came, and soon after I saw Daniels coming in out of the ground; he was stopped, and the two prisoners were both searched, but nothing found on them; a witness brought the watch into my house about ten minutes after I went out after Magrath; the prisoners had been in company, and had spoken, but I had not seen them drinking together.</p>

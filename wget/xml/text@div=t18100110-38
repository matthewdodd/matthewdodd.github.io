On Saturday last, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in the shop, he asked to look at some ribbons. I was the only person in the shop. I shewed him the drawer of ribbons, he bought a yard of black ribbon at five-pence, and a yard of red ribbon at eight-pence, he paid me for them and went out of the shop. The moment he was gone I missed a piece of blue ribbon. I immediately went out and followed him, he was not out of sight; he went into a public-house in Orange-street, I followed him into the house; as he was going into the tap-room, I said you have taken some ribbons from me, he immediately threw two pieces at me; I caught them in my hand. He went out of the house into King's-gate-street, some gentlemen in the tap-room ran after him, he was brought back, a constable was sent for, he searched the prisoner, there were three more pieces belonging to my sister found on him.</p>

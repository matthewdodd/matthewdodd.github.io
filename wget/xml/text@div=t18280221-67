               <p>Q. If it had lifted its head up, it would have been loose? A. It was a quiet horse; I was absent about twenty minutes; I then found it loose, and standing about twenty yards off; I cannot say whether it had got loose, but the bridle was entangled round its fore-feet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you not believe the prisoner was taking it to the Green-yard? - A. It probably might be the case - I have every reason to think so.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the horse at the rails - I was standing in Mr. Rees' shop; I received information, went out, and saw the prisoner and a sailor in conversation; I went and stood in a door-way, which was dark- the sailor left the prisoner, and went along Bartholomew-terrace into York-street, then came back to the prisoner, and both went into Cross-street, and returned: the prisoner crossed over towards the horse; some persons came by; he came back, and, in a minute or two, went towards the horse again; the third time he went, he appeared to be stooping under the horse's neck, but whether he untied it or not I cannot say; the door opened, and two ladies came out; he left the door, and went to a baker's-shop window; I went to Mr. Briggs, and in five minutes a cart came by, which darkened the window, and I saw him take the horse from the door-way where it stood - he led it about thirty yards, and just as he stooped down to extricate the bridle or something, I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often have you been with the prosecutor to persuade him to prosecute? A. I never persuaded him - I have called on him four or five times; he was not an acquaintance of mine, but I called when I was going his way - I had no motive in calling; he said, "If you come my way, look in."</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not say in one Petit's presence, when the prosecutor expressed his conviction of the prisoner's innocence, "If you don't prosecute, I will?" A. I did; there were some letters on the prosecutor's table; he said they gave him such a character, he had altered his mind; I said if the table was full of gold, I should not alter mine; that I should speak the truth, and if he did not prosecute, I should, to save my recognizance: I do not say he loosened the horse; he stopped, but whether to disentangle the feet I cannot say - it was in the dark.</p>

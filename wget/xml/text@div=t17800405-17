For a great while I thought her exceeding honest; she left my service on the 12th of June, at that time we had lost a vast number of things of value; my wife looked in her box and found a number of things; upon which I sent her about her business; that was on the 12th of June; none of those things are mentioned in this indictment. When I heard she was taken up for Mr. Walker's affair, I went and looked in her box and found the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) that was the 28th of February; she had been in Bridewell some time before I heard of it; I did not know where to find her before. My wife knows the things better than I do; there is a waistcoat of mine.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How long has that waistcoat been lost? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>It may have been lost two or three years? - It may be two years, I believe; this waistcoat is mine, but I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>You do not know that this waistcoat was in your possession any part of the time she was in your service? - I do not.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050028"></xptr>Do you know of any quarrel between her and your wife? - None at all; she shewed the greatest lenity to her, or I should have prosecuted her at that time.</p>
               <p>When she left your house you did not mean to prosecute her? - Not at that time; not till afterwards, when I missed a great number of things, and of great value.</p>

               <p>I lost the things, at different times, that were found in the prisoner's box; I do not know as to the day or the week when I lost them.</p>
               <p>Are there any marks on them? - I do not know that there are any particular marks, only they are things that I made and used and had in my possession; there is a tucker that I cut out of a sprig muslin apron. I missed them during the time she was with me; this dimity waistcoat, to the best of my knowledge, I lost the beginning of last summer; I missed it before she left my service; to the best of my knowledge it is my husband's; he told me it was his; he had not worn it for many years; I brought it down to make a bed-gown of it, that makes me remember it (looks over all the things) I lost such things as these, I believe them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>All these things were missed while she was in your service? - They were.</p>
               <p>As she remained in your service after these things were missed, why did not you take her up? - I was a long while before I suspected her.</p>
               <p>Why did not you prosecute her? - Because I was a great fool.</p>
               <p>Then eight months after you were grown a great deal wiser. Upon your oath have you ever had a quarrel with her? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did not she say something that affected your reputation? - Never to me, of me, nor in our house, while she was with us; she said something that I heard of a day or two before she was taken up.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to hear where she was? - By means of a coachman, who was husband to a person in Mr. Walker's house, and had been coachman to a person in our house, who came to enquire if we had given this woman a character to Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>Court. Should you have prosecuted her if you had not heard that she had said something disrespectful of you? - I believe I should not.</p>

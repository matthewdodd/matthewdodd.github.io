             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Are you acquainted with with Dempsey, the prisoner. - A. Yes, I have known him little better than three years, I lodged at his house, I believe it was from the 10th of March to the 26th of April, about three years ago; I am not a scholar, I can neither read nor write, I am an American.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner, Browner. - A. I never saw him in my life till I saw him at the police office, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Dempsey procure you a birth on board the Europe. - A. He sent for me on Sunday evening, I was not in health at the time; I went to his house, he told me he thought he had a good birth for me on board the Europe, providing I would go on board, I told him as I was not in health, I did not think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210030"></xptr>I was fit to go, he said there was a very good doctor on board, it was better to go there than to be on shore, he got me a birth on board the Europe.</p>
               <p>Q. What was due on account of board or any thing else from you to Dempsey, before you went on board the Europe. - A. There was nothing due at that time for board; I told him the night I agreed to go, between ten and eleven o'clock, I must go to the washerwoman's, and when the washerwoman brought my clothes, I told him to pay the bill, he said he would, the washing bill amounted to seven shillings, I gave him the seven shillings on board the ship; after we had settled that, he asked me if I would leave an absent bond for a woman that I lived with, I told him I would not, Coleman was present and said you are very right, do not leave none to no person; I then gave him one guinea and two seven shilling pieces to pay one Macdonald, there was nothing else due then after that was settled.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went from Dempsey's house to go to Gravesend, had Dempsey made any application to you for any power. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon your oath execute any power of attorney at Dempsey's house in St. George's in the East. - A. No, nor no where else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on board the ship at Gravesend, or before you failed, execute any power of attorney. - A. I did not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that you never saw Browner before you failed. - A. I never had seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you failed for India I suppose. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you returned to England. - A. I came home this winter in the Lord Hawkesbury; after I failed in the Indiaman, I was on board a man of war, the Russel, and I was invalided; I returned in the Hawkesbury a little while after Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you made application to the magistrate at the Thames police office. - A. Nearly six weeks, I went after the man to get the money from him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you apply to the India house. - A. The second day after I arrived at London, I applied to Mr. Steward at the India house to get my money, they refused payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply for your wages or any thing else. - A. For my wages of the Europe, the ship that I went out in; they told me that Dempsey had got the money. The next day after I was at the India house, I went to Dempsey, I found him in Newgate; I asked him how he came to get my money at the India house; he told me then he did not know he had got it rightly, but says he, it was either upon an absent bond or a power of attorney, I do not know which; I told him, you know I never empowered you to get any money, he told me to make myself easy, he expected to be out of Newgate in a few days, but in fact, says he, I do not know whether I have got your money or not, but if I have, when I come out I will make a settlement with you; about a week or two I think I waited upon Dempsey at his house in Dock-street, St. George's in the East; there he said he did not know but I was indebted to him; I never could get him to do any thing with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any power of attorney produced to you on your return to his house. - A. No, never; afterwards there was one brought to the Thames police office by Dempsey.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember that power of attorney. - A. No, (a paper handed to him). I think that is the one I saw at the Thames police office which Dempsey produced to Mr. Harriot the magistrate; it was afterwards shewn to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this being shewn to you you were quite satisfied that you never executed it. - A. I was, I never gave a power, I never saw Browner till he came a witness against me at the Thames police office; Dempsey called him, Dempsey had two or three examinations before this Browner could be found; since that time Dempsey and Browner were committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Since that time have you received from the India house your wages. - A. Yes, every farthing that is due to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you claim no wages at all from any one. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. From what ship had you come from at the time you lodged at the house of Dempsey. - A. From the Three Sisters of Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>Q. I think that you stated at the police office that you had received your wages from the captain of the Three Sisters in the presence of Mr. Hull of Virginia street, Wapping. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But Mr. Hull was not present. - A. He saw the money as soon as I saw it, Mr. Hull went down to the coffee house where the captain was; when I came into the office to be paid Mr. Hull was there waiting for me till I came out, and when I came out I shewed it him.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you did not state that your wages were paid you by the captain in the presence of Mr. Hull. - A. I am not certain whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. According to your account you was on shore only about six weeks, you boarded at Dempsey's house all that time. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You chuse to state now that at the time you quitted Dempsey's house you paid him every thing. - A. He had my money in his hands, I gave him my money, and I could never get my money out of his hands, I brought a great many Spanish dollars.</p>
               <p>Q. We must take your word for that, he cannot be examined as a witness; when you came back this last winter you went to him, he told you you were indebted to him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when he had looked among the papers he did not at all deny that he had received three pound ten shillings, but still said there was money due to him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the police office for an order for the magistrate to make him pay the money. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your application he came there and produced the paper to which you have been speaking. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The magistrate asked him if he had any thing of that sort to shew, he said he had, he would bring it, and upon that he went home, and did bring it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210031"></xptr>the next day of meeting. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The enquiry was then made whether they could or could not find Browner, who was a witness to it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Dempsey said he would endeavour to find him, upon which he was allowed to go home again. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And after some days he brought him to the office. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Browner came there he stated to your face that he had witnessed that bond. - A. Yes, and he told me that he saw me sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that the magistrate committed him as well as Dempsey. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have since got all the money from the East India house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know except that you sware that you had not executed that absent bond, that you could never get that money. - A. I did not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know this, that provided you had signed that paper, that Dempsey was well warranted to receive that money at the India house. - A. If I had left him one; I knew perfectly well that I had not left him no absent bond; I said to him I will try by the laws of your country; I thought to have got the money from him.</p>

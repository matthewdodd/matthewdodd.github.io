               <p>I know Mr. Clay from this circumstance, my father keeps a wharf for drawing timber and deals; on the 8th of July Mr. Blake the prisoner applied for a carriage to draw some timber from our wharf, on the following flood; I arose between five and six in the morning; I saw the timber on the dock; while I was setting the people to work Mr. Blake came on the wharf, and told me it was the timber, and requested me to draw it; I ordered it to be loaded; he asked me the expence; I told him I could not inform him, as we draw by the load; I charged him seven and sixpence, and asked him where it was to be drawn; he said, to Thomas-street, Tottenham-court-road; he paid for it, and I sent the carriage off; on the 9th Mr. Clay came on our wharf, and enquired after the timber; I informed him where it was; I went with him to Thomas-street; I saw the timber lay there; I knew it again immediately; I shewed it to him; I know it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Counsel. How often did Mr. Blake attend at the magistrates with you, on this subject? - I believe it was twice.</p>
               <p>Was it not oftener? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Did he attend in custody, or voluntarily? - Voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Did you take any part with him to discover a person of the name of Smith? - I did.</p>
               <p>Smith was mentioned by him as the person that sold the timber to him? - He was so.</p>
               <p>When you saw them with Blake, they were not cut up, or altered, but in the same state? - Yes, they were laying in the open street.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Blake has now surrendered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not he take pains, like an honest man who wished to find that person Smith? In answer to that, I am of opinion he did take infinite pains; Blake called on me once or twice; at another time he met me in St. Martin's-lane, he asked my advice; says he, I am taking pains night and day to find the man; could you direct me to find him; why, says I, advertising him will make him keep out of the way; if you can go down below; I never saw him otherwise, but very anxious on the business; Morgan was the waterman who towed these deals; I never saw him before I saw him at the justice's; I am told he is the waterman; I saw Morgan at Sir Sampson's; and he was at liberty to go away; that was the first examination.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any ground upon which you can form any belief, as to the time, since you went before the magistrate? - Between the 10th and 13th of July.</p>

            ; on Wednesday the 8th of July, I saw the timber all very safe; there were four floats; it was in Church-walk, Rotherhithe; it was late in the evening, between eight and nine; I did not miss them, till I received information, which was the next day, in the afternoon; when I had information, I went down and looked myself, and I saw they had been stolen, from the rope being cut that fastened them; we went to Thomas street, and found it there; it was my timber.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe afterwards this man, Blake, attended several times at Bow-street? - Two or three times.</p>
               <p>He came voluntarily? - I will tell you how far; he was not in custody; but I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090185"></xptr>a warrant out, and had taken some pains.</p>
               <p>At last he was admitted to bail, and has surrendered here; and I believe from first to last, he told you he had purchased this timber, of a man, whose name was Smith? - He did.</p>
               <p>I believe the other prisoner, Morgan, attended, and confirmed that story? - He did.</p>
               <p>Was not Morgan discharged at the very first? - I do not know that he ever was taken up; at least it was a very considerable time before he was taken up; two months, at least.</p>
               <p>I believe Mr. Blake was bound over, not as the receiver, but as the thief? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not this man take a great deal of fair pains to examine Smith? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. This man came at the regular time of the tide, with his float? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he left it there without any concealment? - He brought it in the usual way all timber is brought.</p>
               <p>What is Morgan? - He is a waterman, and his father is a pilot; I never heard any thing, before this, against his character.</p>
               <p>Did he continue in his business, publickly working in the Thames, from the time he was in Bow-street? - I have no doubt but he did; I had not an opportunity of seeing him.</p>
               <p>He came to the same wharf in the afternoon? - I believe he did; he was employed as the waterman, towing; otherwise they would have taken him into custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Blake. I wish to leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Morgan called three captains of ships, whom he had sailed with, who all gave him a very good character; and Mr. Garrow said he had above twenty witnesses, of the same description, who would all say the same.</p>

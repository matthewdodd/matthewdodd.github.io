On the 7th of Jan., about nine o'clock in the evening, I went to Nevill's-court, Fetter-lane, with the prisoner's father—Mrs. Skey opened the first floor front room with a key—there was nobody in the room—on searching I found this cash-box between the bed and sacking—the lock was broken—these papers were in the box, but no money.</p>

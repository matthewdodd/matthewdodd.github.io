On the morning of Christmas-day I lost five or six hind-quarters of mutton, and two or three shoulders - it was about ten minutes before six o'clock; I was in bed at the time, but I got up, and went down; I had a large dog, but he was killed; I found one loin of my mutton, about nine o'clock, at the prisoner's house, which is not a quarter of a mile from mine - I swear to that as mine, for I had chopped it off the night before, which I never do; I generally saw them, but my saw had been stolen - he had cut the score out with a knife, which my foreman could have sworn to: there was a certain score on the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean outside the back of the sheep? A. No; in the meat, on the back of the meat; it was in at a quarter-past twelve o'clock that morning - the prisoner does not keep a shop; <rs id="t18290115-145-deflabel763" type="occupation">he carries fish about the street, and meat as a hawking butcher</rs>

               <p>Q. When you entered this man's place, did you not point out another reason why you knew the mutton to be yours? A. I said the suet was taken out of one loin, and not out of the other, which I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, upon your oath, did not the man point out the suet that had come from that loin of mutton? A. Yes, he did shew it to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you said, "That is my loin of mutton, because the suet is taken out"? A. Yes; he said, "Here's the suet," and showed me some which was broken into twenty pieces, but there may be twenty pieces of suet which appear the same.</p>
               <p>Q. But now you swear to it by something else? A. I missed two, and I thought this had been the other, but I found it was the one which I had chopped off, and I said to my boy, "I think I have chopped it off as clean as if I had sawed it:" I missed two loins of mutton - one was of a wether sheep, and this was it; the other was a ewe one, which I have not seen - there are strings to a wether sheep, but not to a ewe.</p>

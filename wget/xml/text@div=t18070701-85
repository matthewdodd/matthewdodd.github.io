               <p>Q. Did you lose a pair of shoes from your shop at any time. - A. Yes On the 21st of May, about nine in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop to change a pair of shoes that she had not bought at the shop: I at last agreed to change them; she fitted on a pair; I papered them uy for her, and she gave me nine pence, which was the difference; she said her garter was down, she did not mind me, I was a married man; she went on the stairs to tie it up, I missed a pair of shoes from the place where she had sat, she came and sat down again and there seemed to be a riot in the street; she got up and was going out. I then said to her, I think you have got more about you than you should have; I asked her to go into the back room and deliver them up to my wife; she denied it; I sent for a constable; the shoes were found in her pocket. When the shoes were found upon her she said that she did not know she had them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was a little in liquor, I did not know that I had the shoes; I insisted upon having the constable sent for; he offered to let me go if I would pay for them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She was a little in liquor; she denied having them, and insisted upon the constable being sent for.</p>

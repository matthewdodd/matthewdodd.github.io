                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Upper Charles-street. I have known the prisoner twelve or fourteen years—when I first knew him, he was a chemist in Regent-street—about July he came to my house in Charles-street, and brought a bill of exchange—this is the bill—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at one produced by Pearce</hi>)—he wished me to get it discounted for him—I had never got any discounted for him before—I had told him previously, if he brought me a bill on a respectable party I could get it discounted for him—I asked him if this bill was genuine—he said he saw Mr. Gunter accept it—he said it was Mr. Gunter, of Berkeley-square—he said he did business with him, and could do more if he had larger means—I got the bill discounted for him in the City—he went with me—I went to a friend of mine, named Bannister, who lives at Islington—he has no office, but I frequently meet him at a coffee-house in the City—I took his check for it, went to the Union Bank, received the money, and gave it to the prisoner.</p>

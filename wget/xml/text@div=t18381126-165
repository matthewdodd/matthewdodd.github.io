                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live in Fulwood's-rents, Holborn—I received a promissory note of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. signed by Green, Lewis, and Young, from Wm.

               <p>Green, Lewis, and Young—I got nothing for it—it was dishonoured—this was on Saturday, and on Monday I went to Walker and told him of it—I then gave the note to my foreman Wright, to be ready to be taken up by the parties, supposing the money to be paid on it.</p>

PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What consideration did you give for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had a bill of 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., part of it was for printing—Mr. Walker had a mechanical exhibition—about two years ago I printed some bills for him—the exhibition continued till about Christmas last—he walked about the country with it—I never went to see it—that printing was part of my bill, and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I paid to my coal-merchant for coals for him—I received another bill from Walker at the same time that I received this for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not received many bills from Walker—I received, perhaps, one before these, but I do not recollect what it was for—it is a long time ago—I have my account on a paper—I copied it out of a book—I have not received other bills from Walker within the last two years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If any body has stated that you gave no consideration for this bill, but took it as Walker's agent, to circulate it, is that a falsehood or truth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a falsehood—I am quite sure of that-Walker paid me at the time 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to balance the account—I took the bills at the amount that ap<lb></lb>peared on them—I took this bill on Walker's responsibility—he said they were good people—I had applied to Walker for money on account, and I considered this bill as good as money—it had only seven or eight days to run, I think—I had it only eight days—I will not swear to a day—I gave Walker a receipt—I do not know that I made an entry of the settlement in my book—I have got a memorandum of the settlement at home on a paper, and have a copy of it here—it is only a rough memorandum—this is a bill to Mr. Walker—he has got a memorandum—I do not know that it is an exact copy of this—atthe time Walker paid me the bills I gave him a memorandum of it on a bill-head—I believe the document I deli<lb></lb>vered to him contains the same items that this does, but I do not know that it is precisely the same—I gave him a document of the amount of the bills, and the payment of the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it may be shorter than this, I cannot tell—I did not know any thing about the persons who executed this note—I thought it rather an unusual one—I never had a note like it before—I thought it a good and correct document—I went about six o'clock in the evening to Young's address, and the house was shut up—I asked some neighbours, and they said that Young had gone away, but they did not say where—I inquired of Green where Young had gone to, and he told me some other place, but I did not go there—I never had any conversa<lb></lb>tion about it—I believe Walker lives on his property, but I printed bills for his mechanical exhibition—he parted with it about last Christmas, and it is now at Leicester-square—I have been to the Eagle Tavern once or twice, but I do not frequent the Grecian Saloon—Mr. Walker has been there when I have—one of the bills I had of him was on Mr. Transfield, who is a waiter at the Eagle Tavern, City-road—I never transacted any business at the Eagle—I never saw Young there, or any where, till I saw him in custody—I think Walker invited me to go to the Eagle—I may have been there once without Walker, but I have been there with him—I have gone there on some few occasions, not for business—I do not know that Mr. Walker's bill transactions take place there—I have heard that he has some connexion with the Eagle Tavern, and that he discounts bills and lends money.</p>

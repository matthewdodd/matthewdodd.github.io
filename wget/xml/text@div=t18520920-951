                  </hi>. I am servant to Dr. Bunce, who lives at Woodford. On Sunday evening, 12th Sept., about half-past 6 o'clock I was passing through the hall and saw a man's shoulder in the pantry—I went back and looked, and saw the prisoner there—he put two forks in the breast of his jacket—I cannot say whether they were silver, as there were some plated in the box—I closed the pantry door—it had been open before—I saw him through the open part—he was trying to conceal himself behind the door which opened inwards into the pantry—I closed the door, and rang the dining room bell—it was a hand bell, which was standing close by the pantry door—on my ringing it Dr. Bunce came to my assistance—I told him there was a man in the pantry, and he held the door—a policeman came and took the prisoner into custody—I counted the forks in the box after the prisoner had left the house, and found I had the right number there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Woodford, in Essex. On 12th Sept., about half past 6 o'clock in the evening, I heard the dinner bell ring violently—I went down, and saw Lawrence holding the pantry door—she said there was a man there—I held the pantry door by the handle, and looked in at the glass part of the frame—I saw the prisoner inside—he was drinking a glass of beer—I opened the door to look at him; I then shut the door and sent for a policeman, who came and took him—to the best of my knowledge, the front and back doors of my house were shut at the time, but I cannot swear it—they might have been opened five minutes before—I cannot say whether the pantry door was open, but a window in the back drawing room was found open—I cannot swear that it was not open before, but the ladies said it was not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Globe-crescent, Forest-lane, West Ham, and am a charwoman—I rented a room in that house, which is unoccupied—on the morning of Tuesday, 18th February last, about 8 o'clock I went out, locking my room door, and the street door also—on my return about 6 o'clock, I found the street door open, and my room door also—I got a light and found that I had lost a table, chair, washhand stand, some plates, and a carpet, some cups and saucers, a mug, and some pawnbroker's duplicates—I then went to Mr. Bragshaw, the pawnbroker, and mentioned my loss to him, and, in consequence of what I heard, I went the next morning for a policeman, and accompanied him to the prisoner's house, which was next door to me—I knew her, but was not particularly acquainted with her—the first thing I saw when I got to her house was a dress of mine that I had pawned at Mr. Bragshaw's—I also saw a shawl and a hymn-book on the table, and, in, the cupboard, my cups and saucers, and the pint mug—I gave her into custody—15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is the value I put on those articles.</p>

On Saturday morning, 22d Feb<lb></lb>ruary, from information I received, I went to the house of the prisoner's husband, next door to the prosecutrix—I asked her if she had redeemed a dress from Mr. Bragshaw's—she at first said she had not; she then said she had redeemed one of her own—I asked her to let me see it—she went up stairs and brought it down, and I showed it to the prosecutrix, and she identified it as being a dress of her's that she had pledged, and the ticket had ben stolen from her room at No. 7—on searching I found a shawl, a hymn-book, and some cups and saucers—the prosecutrix identified the things that I found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith, and live at No. 21, Dock-street, On the 4th of July, I was going down Ratcliffe Highway—the prisoner asked me for charity, and told me of the great distress he was in, being out of a ship, and said he had a prospect of getting a ship the next morning—I gave him some bread and beer—he then asked me to give him lodgings—I said I could not give him a bed, but I would give him shelter—I let him into my bed-room, and placed him into a chair—I went to bed, and left the clothes stated on the chair—I awoke in the morning—the prisoner and things were gone—these are the articles; I know them to be mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was better than half drunk—I went and turned in with this gentleman—I got up, put the clothes on me, and walked away. Witness. I do not know that he was drunk—he produced me a character, which made me take more pity on him.</p>

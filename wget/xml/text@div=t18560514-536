                  </hi>. I reside with my brother, Humphrey Clare, at No. 38, Buttesland-street, Hoxton. Early on Sunday morning, 20th April, I was disturbed by a man opening my bedroom door—I saw his arm, that was all—supposing it to be my brother, I called to ask if it was, but having no answer, I hastened to the door, and the light was extinguished—I went to my brother's bedroom and found him asleep, and rang the bell to give an alarm—Mr. Hayward saw the window open—it had been closed at 20 minutes before 1 o'clock in the morning, but it was not fastened—the back door was bolted.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the house of Mr. clare. I was alarmed on that Sunday morning—I heard the bell ring—I saw Mrs. Clare—I went down into the passage—I saw the back door open, and the window was wide open—I went into the yard, and saw some footmarks—I gave infor<lb></lb>mation to the policeman—I went into the back yard, and saw the prisoner jumping over the wall—he jumped over four or five walls before we got him—we followed him, and did not lose sight of him—the walls were very low—he was taken in about a quarter of an hour.</p>

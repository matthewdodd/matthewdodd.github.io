             sworn. - On the 20th of May, about three o'clock, I went with Rudd for some grains; we were both carters to Mr. Cloment, a cow-farmer; we got the grains from Mr. Charrington's brewhouse, at Mile End; we stopped at the bottom of the lane; Mr. Willis's house is at the corner of the lane; I was going up the lane, and Mr. Willis's gates were open; it was then past nine o'clock; Rudd was behind me, and as I was going past Mr. Willis's gates, they threw a basket up; I cannot say who it was; there was Mr. Willis and another man.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner? - A. I cannot say whether he is the man or not, I was in liquor, but I am almost certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before? - A. I had seen him once before with Rudd, behind the cart; they called to me to stop, and they asked me for a few grains, and I gave them two or three shovels full, and Mr. Willis gave us sixpence a-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark at that time? - A. No, it was day-light; that is the gentleman, (pointing to the prisoner, Willis.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any money pass? - A. Yes, there was some money passed; as I was getting out of the cart, Mr. Willis holloaed out there were two shillings, and Rudd took the money from Mr. Willis's hands; Rudd gave me one shilling; I asked him what it was for, he gave me no answer, but laughed at me; he afterwards said it was for some grains.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were not quite sober? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What ale-house had you been at? - A. None; we had some beer at the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q.When your master asked you if you had sold any grains, you told him, no? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master thought you ought to have given it him, instead of putting it in your own pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was better, when you were taken up, to be a witness than a prisoner? - A. The whole was laid upon me at first, till Mr. Willis told the right of it; he said it was not me that had the money.</p>

               <p>Mr. Clement. Mr. Willis came to my house on the Saturday, the day after we had seen the grains on his premises, and said he was very sorry for what he had done, in buying the grains of the man; I asked him what quantity he had, and he said six baskets that night, and some one or two nights before; he asked me if I could settle the difference between the officers and him, and I told him I could not, the law must take its course; I was very short upon the business; I was not in his company above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Willis? - A. He has some birth in the Bank, and lets out horses and chaises; Mr. Willis went to the Magistrates, and they would not grant a warrant; the Magistrate said, Mr. Willis had been there, and settled the business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe he came and told you of the transaction between him and your men? - A. He told me part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he thought he was doing right? - A. Yes, he said he thought the man belonged to the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q.When was that? - A. At the time he came to my house, the next day.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many horses were there to the waggon? - A. Four, I think; I told him they did not look like masters of waggons or carts either.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your name upon the waggon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he say then? - A. He said he had done wrong; he was very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did he say that? - A. After I had told him I should punish him.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street; I went to Mr. Willis's with the prosecutor; he was not at home; I saw the grains in a little room parted off from the stable; we told Mrs. Willis we would call again; there was no refusal of a warrant, only he came late at night; he had a warrant to apprehend his person on Monday.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Rudd, did not say any thing in his defence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Willis, put in a written defence, which was read as follows:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I have for some time past, for amusement when at home, kept a few rabbits, and some pigs, and have been in the habit of purchasing grains for them of Mr. Lee, a cow-keeper in my neighbourhood, till a week previous to this transaction, when Mr. Lee was without grains; I made enquiries to get them elsewhere, and I therefore acknowledge, without hesitation, that upon the prosecutor's men calling at my house to know if I wanted any grains, I bought those in question, under an idea that they had power to sell them; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250034"></xptr>gave them the same price I had always paid Mr. Lee, and which I thought was the full value.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The moment I was informed that some of the officers belonging to Worship-street had been searching my house, I went and informed the Magistrate who I was, and every particular respecting the transaction; and that, if there was any charge against me, I was anxious to meet it, and explain my conduct, that not the slightest suspicion might attach upon my character; but the Magistrate said there was nothing against me, and I went home perfectly satisfied that I should hear no more of it; a few days after I was, to my great astonishment, taken from my own house by a warrant, and in a few hours afterwards examined, and committed as a felon.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, 
               <persName id="t18030525-38-person300">Till</persName>
             this unfortunate occurrence, I have not had the smallest imputation; on the contrary, I have been nearly eight years in a confidential situation in the Bank, and, as I shall prove by gentlemen of the greatest respectability, have always borne the character of an honest man; independent of the heavy punishment which the law has provided to deter from the commission of this crime, my situation in life puts me far above the imputation of so mean and contemptible, as well as guilty an act, as that with which I am charged.(For the prisoner, Willis.)</p>

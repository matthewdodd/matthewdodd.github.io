On the 23d of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at our counting-house - he produced this letter to me - I think it was wafered; I took this bill out of the letter, asked him to leave the bill, and call again in a quarter or half an hour - I saw him about that time, and told him it was too late in the day to do any thing with the bill, but if he would bring it in the morning, I would see what could be done - he came next morning (there were two bills in the letter), and I asked him to leave the bills; when he came the next morning, he was asked who Pinder was - he said he was a seedsman, and at first said he lived where the letter was dated from; I asked if he had not a place in the City - he said, Yes, in the Borough; I asked if that was Mr. Pinder's writing, and he said it was, and said he was his clerk, or in his employ, and that he came from Mr. Pinder - he called two or three times in the course of that day, and in consequence of inquiry I made, the last time he came for an answer I called him into a private room, and told him I should detain the bills till Mr. Pinder came to fetch them - this is one of the bills that was enclosed in the letter - I wrote the word "forged" on it - the name of Pinder is not on it; this is the other bill that came in the letter: I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it after he was in custody that you wrote "forged" on the bill? A. No, before - it was on the return of post; I knew nothing of the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q.What do you mean by return of post? A. I wrote to Yorkshire about the bills, and in consequence of the answer, I wrote "forged." (Letter read.)</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, - I called on Mr. Williams for the purpose of getting the enclosed bills cashed; he has recommended me to you: I should feel obliged if you will get the same cashed for me,</p>

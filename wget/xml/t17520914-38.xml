            . Saturday the 4th of July, about 5 in the morning, I intended to take a walk by the way of Kentish Town; in <placeName id="t17520914-38-crimeloc186">a field on the other side of Pancras church</placeName>

I went past him, and observed him so as to know him again. When I was gone about half way of the field, walking very slowly along, I heard a pattering of feet behind me: I turned myself round, and saw the prisoner and another man with him about 5 or 6 yards from me; they seemed to be in haste, I went on one side to let them come by; the prisoner pulled out a pistol with a brass barrel, clapped it to my breast, and desired me to deliver my money, or I was a dead man if I made any words. I told him I had but a very little, and if they were in earnest they should have a share of it. I put my hand in my pocket and took out about six peny worth of halfpence, which they refused. I put it in my pocket agai n; the prisoner lifted up the flap of my waistcoat and pulled out my watch and put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What watch was it?</p>
               <p>Chalmers. It was a silver one. The other man stood over me with a large stick, and put his hand in my breeches pocket. I had thirteen guineas in one pocket, and about 14 s. in the other. I had two pockets on one side; he took his hand out of my pocket; I was afraid he had got hold of my gold. I took hold of his hand and desired him to let me see what he had got, saying, he must not have all, he must give me a part; he opened his hand, and I saw it was silver, which made me quite easy. Then the prisoner was for going, but the other seeing the gold of some bulk in my other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175209140017"></xptr> pocket, he put his finger to it and swore it was gold, and he would have it; the prisoner was then gone I believe five or six yards from me. This man put his hand to my pocket, I catched his other arm, and took him by the collar with my right hand, and told him he should have no more. He then desired me to let him go and he would give me no farther disturbance. I said, if they did not deliver back my watch I would follow them. They immediately ran off, I followed them. The prisoner turned round and said if I followed him he would do for me. I still followed them, and saw a man on horseback, upon which I waved my hat to him and he came up, then we chased them through the fields towards Islington. The man on horseback passed by me and drove one of them into a boghouse at Islington, the other we lost in the fields, I should know him again could I see him.

            , who was on horseback, left the prisoner in custody of some persons, and returned to see for the other person, but we could not find him; then we went to Islington, there I saw the prisoner in an alehouse, I knew him again. I asked him for my watch, he said he had no watch. Some of the company went into the bog-house and there found it. I told them the name was

He desired I'd be favourable to him, and seemed pretty much concerned, and owned the taking of the watch, and said it was the first fact.</p>

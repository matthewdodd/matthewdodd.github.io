                  </hi> I am apprenticed to the prisoner, who is a shoemaker. On Monday morning, 8th May, I found two or three pieces of something that looked like pewter in the coal scuttle, and showed them to the other apprentice—my mistress happened to see it, and told my master—he tole me to go and shake a piece of carpet—I did so, and when I came in he had a cane in his hand, and caught hold of my collar, and hit me with it, and said, "Have I been melting pots?"—I said, "No, sir, I did not say such a thing as that; I said that it looked like pewter"—he only struck me once them—he told me to go and clean the outside windows—I did so, and then asked him what I should do—he told me to sit down, and make a ten-cord thread—I sat down to make it, and he then told me to wipe up some water—I went to get something to do it with, and he said I had got the hemp entangled on purpose, and began to cane me—I cannot say how many times he struck me; he kept on a good time—I struggled, and kicked him twice—he said he</p>

               <p>would learn me to kick—I then sat down, and went on again making the thread—I felt the blood running down, and when the other apprentice, Hine, went out with a pair to shoes to the Blackfriars-road, I told my haster of it—I had not mentioned it to Hine—I said, "You have cut my side open, Sir; "and he said, "It served you right, and I wish it was worse"—I did not show him the blood—the blood had been running half an hour when Hine went out—my master was in the room while I was working, before Hine went out; it was in the shop—my master was there all the time—there was a knife lying on the cutting-board, about a yard from my master—he stood up when he caned me—I did not see the knife while he was caning me; I saw it in his hand about ten minutes before—I did not see it again that day that I recollect—I do not know the moment when I was cut.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, in High-street, Borough. About two o'clock, on 8th May, I examined the boy—I found a wound about an inch and a half above the hip joint—I did not probe it—it had the appearance of a stab—it went through the lining of the trowsers and shirt—I should say this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is very likely to produce such a wound—it must have been dine with considerable force to penetrate the lining and shirt—such a wound might be produced from various causes—it is quite possible if the knife had been lying on the bench, and the boy had stumbled against it, it would have produced it—it is not of any importance—it was a clean cut.</p>

I was present on 8th May, between ten and eleven o'clock, when he was caning Jobling—I did not see any knife in his hand—I did not see where the knife was at the time, but I found it afterwards, about a quarter past twelve, on my master's seat, its usual place—I saw Jobling kick him twice, and master said, "I Will</p>

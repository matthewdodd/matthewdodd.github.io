                  </hi>. I live with my father at the Bell at Edmon<lb></lb>ton. On the 6th of Oct. the prisoner applied for a lodging for the night—I went into my bed-room between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and left my watch in my drawer—my wife was in the room—I went to bed at eleven o'clock and found some water spilled outside the room door, and the door left open—I missed my watch—I went with a policeman to a room where the prisoner was in bed—there was no one else in the room—I found the door fastened—I knocked and got no answer at first—the prisoner in eight or ten minutes opened the door—I saw the policeman search the room and find this watch in a bed—it is my watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—I saw the watch safe in the drawer when I left the room at nine o'clock—I closed the door, and left a jug of water at the door—I went up with my husband at eleven o'clock, and found the jug upset, the door open, and the watch gone—there was no stranger in the house that night, except the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 374.) I was stationed at Edmonton. On the 6th of Oct I went with Gardener and knocked at the prisoner's door several times—he gave no answer—we knocked loudly with the heel of a shoe—Mr. Gardener went down stairs, and while he was down I heard the prisoner making a noise in the room, moving about, but he would give no answer—at last he opened the door—I searched his clothes and two beds but found nothing—at last I found the watch in some bedding which was tied up in the room—he said he was intoxicated, but he was quite sober—I found on him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a comb, and a knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bar-maid at the house. The prisoner came to the bar at ten o'clock, and asked for a bed—I showed him to the bed about ten or twenty minutes after ten—it was a double-bedded room—in going up we passed Mr. hardener's room, which was one flight of stairs lower—the door was then shut,</p>

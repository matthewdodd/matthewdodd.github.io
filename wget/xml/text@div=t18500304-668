                  </hi>. I live in St. Saviour's, in the Borough—on the afternoon of 18th Feb., about quarter to four o'clock, I left my shop, being called away for an hour—I latched the door, and forgot to lock it—the window was down—I was told something, went home, and found the door as I had left it—from a box in my bed-room I missed this suit of clothes I have on. another coat, four gowns, four handkerchiefs, and a velvet visite—I saw them safe at twelve, and missed them at six—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had been out three or four times before—I left the door latched, but I had not been out of the court—I left nobody in the house.</p>

I am barman at the Black Horse, which is about thirty yards from Magennis's—the prisoner had not been more than five minutes in the house when the policeman came by—he had been in and out nearly all day—in the middle of the day he had something to drink with Magennis—he came in with a bundle of clothes, not tied up, but quite loose, and threw them all over me, saying, "Take this," as I stood on the other side of the counter—I threw them back, and said I would not have them—there were some people there—he took up a shawl, made them up in a bundle, and threw them over the counter again—the people saw all this—Magennis came every day for his dinner-beer, not to stand at the bar—I knew he lived near—I kept the clothes the lust time he came, the policeman told me to do so—the prisoner did not tell me they were Mr. Magennis's clothes, and he had got them from the thief—I should not have taken them if he had, on account of his being in liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Lieutenant Frederick Charles Standish, of the Royal Artillery, at Woolwich; he entrusted to my care a paper-knife, another knife, and a box, on 15th March—between that and the 26th, I saw the prisoner in the kitchen of the barracks, and showed them to him—I kept the box on a shelf in my room—I missed it about 29th March—I charged the prisoner with having it—he said he would go and try to find the things—in about half an hour, he said he had been to look for them, and could not find them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He came up to me, and asked where the articles were that I had taken out of his kitchen; I said I had not taken anything; I would go and see where I was drinking last night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corporal in the Royal Artillery. On 10th April I was in my room at the barracks—the prisoner called me outside, and took from under his waistcoat a dark-coloured case—he opened it, and showed me a paper-knife, with a blood-stone handle, and the blade gold; and a penknife, with a blood-stone handle—he said they belonged to his master, Mr. Davies, and he had been outside with them to a Jew to get them repaired—he after<lb></lb>wards said he found them in front of the barracks on Good Friday night—I told him to report the circumstance to his master—he said he would not do so that night—I saw him next morning, and asked him whether he had done so—he told me he had not, but had got drunk, and lost them—the lining of the case was white satin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery. I was on guard on the night of 12th April—the prisoner told me he expected to be taken off guard, and said something about a box which he found on Good Friday night—he said in case there was a written agreement drawn up, and signed by the Colonel and the prosecutor, he would see about it.</p>
               <p>

             depos'd, That she, upon the Information of the former Evidence, sent for a Midwife, that upon being examin'd, she confess'd she had had a Child, and had put it in the Vault. The Midwife depos'd, That she saw the Child after it was taken out of the Vault, but perceiv'd no Marks of Violence upon it, that she readily confest her having a Child, said that she was very ill in the Night, in a Fit, and the Child came from her the mean Time, and when she found it was dead, that she kept it three Days in the Bed, and design'd to have carried it and left it in some Church-Yard, and did bring it down on the Sunday, but the Family coming home, she was prevented, and then threw it down the Vault.

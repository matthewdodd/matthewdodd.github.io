                  </hi>. I am a policeman—I know the prisoners—I saw them at six o'clock on Thursday morning, the 25th of March, on the high road between Camberwell and Peckham, within two or three hundred yards of Mr. Gray's house—I went a few yards up my beat, and missed them out of the road—I went to the next policeman and spoke to him—I borrowed his light, returned, and went on Mr. Pope's premises, adjoining Mr. Gray's—I got upon the fence, and saw the two prisoners coming from Mr. Gray's hen-house—I had the light full on their faces—I saw Sherwin with some fowls in each hand—I called to them to stop, but they ran away from me—Sherwin dropped the fowls as he ran—I sprang my rattle, and gave infor<lb></lb>mation of what had happened—I picked up the fowls and took them to the station-house—I went back to Mr. Gray's and examined the heu-house—I found the door broken open, and the bolt of the lock lying by the side of it—I went at seven o'clock in the morning to the residence of Sherwin, I opened the door, went into the passage, and saw his father there—I told him I wanted his son Robert—his father fetched him down stairs—I took him to the station-house at Camberwell—when I got him there, I told him what I took him for—he denied all knowledge of the robbery—I knew both prisoners for ten or twelve years—I am confident they are the men.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective E</hi>). On 2nd May, about 8.30, I was in Saville Street, and saw the prisoner; carrying a bag on his back, contain<lb></lb>ing something heavy—I followed him to a marine store shop, 27, Saville Street—he went in, and put the bag and its contents in a scale (I did not know then that he was in Messrs. Dodson's employ)—I went in with Wheatley, and asked him what was in the bag—he said that he did not bring a bag in—the marine store dealer, John Chalton, was attending to him, but he did not say a word—I opened the bag; it contained 361b. of new pipe lead, and some old sheet lead, 64lb. altogether—I ordered Wheatly to take him in custody—he said, in the passage leading to the police-court, "The pipe lead belongs to my master, and the other be<lb></lb>longs to me," and gave his master's name Mr. Dodson, 29, Fetter Lane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. That was the correct address where he worked—he made the same statement in the dock—the pipe lead was cut in lengths of 9 inches or a foot—I said nothing on my first examination about the prisoner's statement—Wheatley was present then, but was not called, so that there was no evidence of that statement, except what the prisoner said to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The Magistrate did not fully examine me—he remanded the case in order that the master might be brought up—the prisoner's statement was identical with what he said to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi>). On 2nd May I was with Brown, and saw the prisoner in Saville Street with a bag—he went to a marine store shop, 27, Saville Street, and placed the bag in the scale—we went in, and Brown asked him what he had in the bag—he said that he did not bring it in—he was close to the scale, which was on the counter—Brown examined the bag, and found it contained lead—I took him in custody—one day he said in the passage of the police-court "Part of the lead is mine, the lead pipe is my master's," and that his master's address was 29, Fetter Lane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He volunteered that statement without anything being said by either of us—that was in the passage from the gaoler's room, where he was waiting for his turn to be brought up—I had not asked him anything about the lead—I did not suggest that he ought to plead guilty, nor did I hear Brown do so—I never made such a suggestion.</p>

Pipe lead is like other pipe lead, and I cannot say that this belongs to us—we have not missed any—we had a two or three years' character with the prisoner, and as far as I know he maintained that character.

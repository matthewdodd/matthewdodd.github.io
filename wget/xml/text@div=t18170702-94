Charing-cross, he sends the hay to the different stations, for the horses on the road. On the 4th of June last, I loaded the caravan with hay and twenty-seven sacks of mixed corn, beans and chaff, and saw it packed up tight with a tarpaulin over it; it was corded down, and half a truss of clover was put on the top for the horses on the road; the twenty-seven sacks were for the horses on the stage, to be delivered at Slough and Hounslow-it was Mr. Horne's corn-it was delivered to the prisoner, Barrs, to take to Slough.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. There are different proprietors of the coaches-Mr. Horne pays me-it is his corn, and only his.</p>

            . I am the constable of Hammersmith. On the 5th of June, I was desired to watch for the caravan, and saw it come up to the three Pigeons at Hammersmith, about three o'clock in the morning. Barrs went into the tap-room, and Loader came out and untied the cords and tarpauling, and took out a bundle of hay from the hinder part, and put it into the hay-place by the door; he went in again, and in about ten minutes Barrs came out and got on the shafts, and untied the front cords of the tarpaulin, and threw it back, and pulled a sack out from under it, Loader came and took it into the public-house; in about ten minutes after this, they both came out and made all fast again. I stopped a few minutes, they went in doors and I followed them, and saw the prisoners and the landlord together, in the back private room; Loader had a little basket of corn in his hand, when he saw me, he threw it under the seat; I found the sack of corn in the stable, I asked the landlord who put it in the stable, he said there had been nobody there to his knowledge; I think he must have seen it go through, the prisoners heard what the landlord said, they made no reply; I secured them, and asked Barrs what he left corn there for, he said, he left it to get a few shillings for himself. It was mixed oats, beans and chaff.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. The master was not giving Loader any directions. I did not see him till after it was taken in.</p>

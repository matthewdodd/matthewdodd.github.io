                  </hi>. I am. a cab-driver, residing at 28, Wellesley Street, Euston Square—while walking along the Marylebone Road on Wednesday night, April 2nd, about 12 o'clock, I met the female prisoner—she was alone—she spoke to me, and I stood at the corner about two minutes—I had walked with her a few yards, and while standing talking to her I was knocked down from behind by the male prisoner—he walked away sharply across the road as soon as he had done it—the blow was in front of the left ear—he said nothing when he struck me, and I had not seen him at all—as I fell I found my watch and chain had gone, and the chain was broken—I saw the female prisoner snatch it, and then run away—I staggered against a wall, and a constable came up—he ran after the woman, and caught her—this is my watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was wearing it through the button-hole</p>

               <p>of the waistcoat; the two keys and a coin have been broken off—I lost sight of the man, but I was sent for the same day to the police-station and identified him immediately—he was not placed with others—I am quite sure he is the man who knocked me down—the blow pained me a little, and ached the next day, that was all.</p>

I was fetched by the police at about 2 o'clock in the morning, and saw the male prisoner sitting in the charge-room—I had been home, and was in bed when called up—it was about 12 o'clock when I met the girl—I was talking to her opposite the Globe in Marylebone Road about two minutes—I had not been into the Globe—I was in a public-house at the corner of Great James Street from about 11 till 11.30 with a man who tried to sell a horse—I do not recollect saying at the police-court "I was with two persons in the public-house, one was a stranger to me, the other deals in horses"—there were only two of us—I was on night-work, but did not go on duty that night—I have not been in any public-house in Earl Street to my recollection—I know Chapel Street, but not the Chapel Arms or the Gloucester Arms—I met the man who tried to sell a horse a few minutes past nine, and went with him to the public-house I have mentioned, and he left me there—I did not go to any other public-house with him—he had left me about half an hour when I was knocked down—Marylebone Lane is the nearest police-station—it is close by; the name is altered now to Seymour Place.</p>

I was on duty in York Place, Mary<lb></lb>lebone Road, on the night of April 2nd, about 11.15, and saw a crowd in the road near York Street—I ran up, and saw the prosecutor holding the female prisoner—I saw some one knock the prosecutor down, but could not see who struck him—he fell down when struck—he said "She has got my watch"—the female prisoner was running away—I ran after her, and caught her at Baker Street, about 50 yards away—she said "I have not got the man's watch," and at the same time I saw the watch fall from her hand on to the pavement, and I picked it up—the prosecutor came up and said "She has got my watch," and pointed the male prisoner out to me, and said "That man with a white smock struck me," and the man ran away—he was about three or four yards from me, and I could see his face—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man—I lost sight of him—I had got hold of the female prisoner; she threw herself on her back and kicked and tried to bite me, and said she would not go to the station; that prevented me from going to the man—on the way to the station she said "The prosecutor dropped the watch, and I ran away with it"—at the station she said "It is quite right, I did drop the watch, and Jack Connell struck the prosecutor."</p>

In consequence of infor<lb></lb>mation received, I went to a common lodging-house at 3, Little Grove Street, Marylebone, at about 1.45 a.m. on the 3rd, about two hours after the female prisoner was charged—it is about half a mile from where this robbery took place—the prisoner Connell was in a large bedroom upstairs—there were about seventy others in bed in the same room—I said, "I want you"—he replied, "All right"—he was not undressed, but was sitting at the side of his bed with a white slop on, and stooping to untie his boot—a fellow-lodger who came in and heard me speak to him said, "Jack, where are you going to?"—I was in uniform—the prisoner replied, "I am going to the Marylebone Lane Police-station to be locked up; go and tell the old woman"—I had not told him the charge then—I said, "You seem to know where you are going"—he replied, "Yes"—I then said, "You will be charged with being concerned with another in custody with highway robbery with violence"—those are the exact words; I did not mention a man or a woman—he said, "All right; I'll tell you the truth, I was along with her; we were all together in the Globe public-house drinking, but I didn't take the watch and chain—I had not mentioned what was stolen—I took him to the station—the prosecutor was fetched to the station, and immediately he entered the charge-room he pointed the prisoner out and said, "That's the man"—the prisoner made no reply.</p>

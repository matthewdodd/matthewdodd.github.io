               <p>I am a weaver, No. 15, Addle-street; on Saturday the 19th of February, about a quarter past ten at night, I was coming down Houndsditch, and the corner of the street leading to Duke's-Place, I saw three men, two of them are at the bar now, Bushell and Jacknell; Jacknell had a sack on his shoulder, with a saddle and bridle; they both made a stop, as if they were not determined which way to go; they spoke together, but I was not high enough to hear; the sack was not changed from one to the other while I saw them; Bushnell, I believe, went to Duke's-Place, I saw no more of him; I went and told the watchman; and we went and took Jacknell and the sack to the watch-house; the other was twenty yards before, when I first saw them; but whether it was Bushnell or no, I cannot say; Jacknell said at the watch-house, he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230145"></xptr> the things from Mr. Clarke, at Shoreditch Church; I told him it would be very hard he should be detained till Monday; I would give a man a shilling to go to Mr. Clarke's, and if they were his, he should be discharged; he said, no, I should not, he would stay there; about ten minutes after Bushnell came in, and said, he was come to release him; he took a key out of his pocket, and said it was the key of the stable; and he was detained.</p>

               <p>I had been at Mr. Clarke's, but not with that bridle and saddle; and I was going home, and I met Bushnell, he said he was going to the Turk's-Head in Whitechapel, with some things; he asked me to go home with him, and we would go home together; we live facing one another, in Rupert-street; and I turned round, and walked with him, and he asked me to carry them a little for him, so I took them on my back, and I stopped to make water in Butcher-row, and he walked on before me about twenty yards, and the watchman came and stopped me, I called to him; I said, if they chose to send to Rupert-street, they might find where we lived.</p>
               <p>Court to Bond. Did he say any thing about Rupert-street, do you remember? - He mentioned something about Rupert-street in the watch-house, but I did not stop to hear it; I am sure he said he came from one Mr. Clarke's at Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Levy. He told me he came from Shoreditch, from one Mr. Clarke's; I asked him where he was going; he said to Rupert-street; I told him, it was a very comical way to go.</p>

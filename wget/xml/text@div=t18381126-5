                  </hi>. I am a widow. My husband died on the 26th of October, 1837—he carried on the business of a cheesemonger, in Ship-tavern-passage, Leadenhall-market, till his death—I have continued it since—the prisoner was in his employ, previous to his death, for nearly four years, I think, and he continued in my employ after my husband died—he bought and sold nearly all the goods—I dated some tickets, threaded</p>

               <p>them, and hung them on nails, in different parts of the shop, for conve<lb></lb>nience—the shopmen were to take these tickets down, and put on them the article sold, the weight, and the price received, and then they were taken the last thing at night, or the first in the morning, and compared with the till money, to see that it was right—on the 27th of October, I gave Mr. Osborne 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in half-sovereigns, half-crowns, two shillings, and one sixpence, but I do not know what number of half-crowns—I did not see him mark it—on the Saturday following I saw him come into my shop—after he made his purchase I went round to the tills, I looked into the first, and there were not any half-crowns in it, I opened the second till, and saw four half-crowns—I knew they were four of those that I had given to Mr. Osborne, because they were of one coinage—I put these four half-crowns into my pocket, which was empty—I then went to the prisoner—he was behind the counter making out the ticket—he was writing when he was called away to serve another customer—when he went away he left the ticket on the counter, which he had begun to make out—I looked at it, and read it for 11 shillings—I shortly afterwards took it up, and delivered it to the officer, and it was the weight, not the price—it was 11 ¾ lb.—I delivered the same to the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City officer. I was in attendance near Mrs. Batten's, and was taken in—I called the prisoner to the back-parlour, and told him he was suspected of embezzling money from Mrs. Batten's—she came in—I asked her what charge she preferred against him—she said "Stealing a half-crown"—he said he had a half-crown, and said he had received a half-sovereign in the middle of the week at Mrs. Batten's,</p>

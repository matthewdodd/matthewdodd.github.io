The prisoner's mother dealt with me, she lived in Bedford-street, Liquorpond-street - she left off dealing with me in May last; about ten days after the prisoner came and asked if I would trust her mother with a pint of beer - she had the beer, came several times after, and ran up a score of about 5 s., which, I believe, she paid in silver. She afterwards ran up another score of 7 s. or 8 s. and tendered a 1 l. note for it, either to me or my wife - change was given to her. About a week after she came and asked me to change her mother a 1 l. note, which I did. I omitted to mark one of them. This note (looking at it), No. 1250, is one of them I am certain. She afterwards came again, asked what her mother's scores were, and said her mother would either come or send in the evening. I told her what it was, she came that day and gave me a note. I gave her change - (looking at it) - this is it, No. 12134. I wrote Mrs. Burnham on it. I paid it away that night to Messrs. Barclays' clerk - it was afterwards returned to me as forged. I went to her mother, but could not find the prisoner. About three days after she came again, asked what her mother's score was, and said her mother would either send or come herself. I asked if she recollected changing a note at my house a few days ago, and asked if it was her note or her mother's - she said her mother's, and that it was her mother's score that was on my book. I asked what she meant by telling me such a lie, and took her to Hatton-garden.</p>

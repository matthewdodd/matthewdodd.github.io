            . I am porter to Messrs. Wilson and Co. On the 15th of May, I was in the warehouse, which is under the same roof as the dwelling-house; I had seen this silk about five minutes before it was taken - the door was kept on the latch: the goods lay on a pile on the counter, about a yard or a yard and a half from the street-door - I was gone into the back warehouse and heard the door open: I immediatly ran forward, and saw the prisoner inside the warehouse, in the act of putting something under his coat - he immediatly ran out and shut the door after him; I ran after him, and caught sight of him within ten steps - I saw he had something under his coat, and did not lose sight of him; he was stopped within twenty yards, as I cried Stop thief! - he had got out of my sight before that, but not before he dropped the goods - when he found me so near him, I saw him drop the goods, and he was stopped not more than three minutes after that; I am quite positive he is the person who dropped the goods - I had turned back with the goods; he was brought back by Gibson, and I was quite confident of him, and of the goods (only one person came into the warehouse) the silk was above ninety yards of gros de Naples, worth 3s. or 3s. 6d. a yard - I am confident the door was shut when he came in - I heard the latch go.</p>

            . I am a ticket-porter, and live at Mile-end; my business is in Honey-lane-market. I was in the market when the prisoner was crossing Milk-street; I heard a cry of Stop thief! which drew my attention to Milk-street, and saw him running into the market - several people were behind him, at a distance, pursuing him; I stopped him - he had nothing then; I took him back to Mr. Wilson's house, as the people in pursuit, said he had come from there - Cole spoke positivly to him; he said distress drove him to do it.</p>

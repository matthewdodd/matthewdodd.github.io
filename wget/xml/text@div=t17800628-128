Danson came up, and gave me two bottles of wine, and desired me to carry them to his house; this was a quarter of an hour after I had first parted with him. I left the two bottles at the Coach and Horses; two or three days after I took one to Danson, and the other I have myself at this time; when I went down to Danson's I gave the bottle to him; when I returned to the square I observed the prisoner there with Mr. and Mrs. Moore. I was not taken up upon this affair. I was last in the square, and set out from Danson's in Clare-market, and not from Moore's. I did not see the prisoner do any act while I was there.</p>

I said be so kind as to take the hose and assist all you can; he did take it, and did as I desired him to the fire-plug; he screwed them on, and carried them to Lord Mansfield's house, to go down into the area for the water to pour in. We were not permitted to play the engine. We put the engine into the carriage by the fireman's order, and drew it round the next street. This was, I believe, about half after four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did he appear there as a person active in doing mischief, or as one very desirous to prevent it? - He prevented it as far as I saw; when we had orders to put the engine into the carriage he assisted us to lift it in; after that he and I went into a publick-house, and had each a glass of Pepperment a piece; then he shook hands with me and departed.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. All was done before that time; the house was then on fire, was it not? - Yes it was, before we had the alarm. I have known him thirteen or fourteen years; he kept a publick-house in the Borough-market before he removed to this end of the town. I never heard any thing against his character.</p>
               <p>How long did you see the prisoner before you parted with him? - He was with me an hour and an half.</p>

               <p>I went with Mr. Danson to Bloomsbury-square; it was near two when I got there.</p>
               <p>And with Moore? - No; I do not know any other person that I went with but Mr. Danson; we staid there a considerable time; at last an engine came. Mr. Danson said, there is a man come with an engine, who I know well; I wish it was in my power to assist him; this is the man that came with the engine (Longbottom.)</p>
               <p>Had Danson before that done any act whatsoever to encourage the mob? - I saw none.</p>
               <p>And you was with him? - I might be five or ten minutes now and then from him. I saw him go up to his acquaintance, and endeavour to assist him; the mob did not seem as if they would let the engine go to work. I drew back, and did not see Danson any more till after the engine was going to be put upon a carriage, then I saw him assisting Mr. Longbottom to put it on. We went from thence; we had not got far from the house before we met a man who looked like a porter with some wine; he had, I suppose, four bottles in each hand, and one tucked under each arm; he said, will you relieve me from my burthen, if not I must break a bottle; he had not got the word out of his mouth before he dropped one. I believe Mr. Danson did release him from the two bottles under his arm. The man said I will come back in a very few minutes and fetch them; this was between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body else in Danson's company? - No; not that I know of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>From the time he came into the square you came in with him, and staid till he went away, did you ever see him pulling at the rails of Lord Mansfield's house, with an intent to pull them down? - No, never; whenever I saw him he never attempted such a thing as that.</p>
               <p>If he had been so active you must have seen it? - I think I must.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you take any of this load of wine from the poor man that was so encumbered? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Then he did it as a serv ice to the man to take two bottles from him? - He asked him to do it.</p>
               <p>Did he put them into his pocket? - I cannot say, I left him behind me there.</p>
               <p>Were the iron palliadoes pulled down while you staid there? - I head a snapping and cracking, whilst I was there, like something of the kind.</p>

               <p>Because the last time I had the honour to see you, you was clerk to an attorney. You are the same man that came to be bail in the King's Bench for 3000 l. and was rejected? - I was.</p>
               <p>Was not you clerk to an attorney then? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not you clerk to Mr. Bowstead? - No.</p>
               <p>You served notices and writs for him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long? - Not since last November, then I left Mr. Bowstead.</p>
               <p>The long vacation is a dead time, and you amused yourself with serving writs? - I never served writs, I carried notices of bail.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bowstead has a great deal of business in the bail way. You used to carry notices for bail, and offer yourself for bail perhaps? - Offer myself for bail?</p>
               <p>When the bail did not appear perhaps? - I beg no such reference may be made.</p>
               <p>You did that for nothing, merely for amusement? - I intended to have served a clerkship to an attorney.</p>
               <p>What, at your time of life? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What, is a clerk to an attorney so much preferable to the wharfinger business? Why did you not prosecute it? - I found my abilities were not sufficient to carry it on.</p>
               <p>Had you, before you was rejected as bail, determined not to be clerk to an attorney?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280283"></xptr> - The rejection made no kind of difference to me.</p>
               <p>I only ask you the question about the time when you determined not to be clerk? - Before then.</p>
               <p>Then you was not with Mr. Bowstead at that time? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>And not clerk to him in any respect then?</p>
               <p>In no respect whatever.</p>
               <p>When did you offer to be bail? - In the last term.</p>
               <p>And you are now clerk to a wharfinger, are you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I have known Danson about seven years; he has as honest a character as any I ever heard in my life. I was at his house the Monday after Lord Mansfield's house was destroyed. Some officers came to enquire after him; he was not at home. When they first came he was informed of it by his wife. He said,</p>
               <p>"Now I am come home I will stay and see what these people want with me."</p>

We slept in one room, with another shipmate, and a young man. I had a chest in my bed-room there. I had a 5l. and a 1l. note, and a Spanish dollar, at the bottom of my chest, under my clothes-it was locked. The prisoner saw me put the money there. I asked him if he thought it would be safe there? he said it would be as safe there as in my pocket. I did not sleep there that night. I returned next day at ten o'clock, found my box broken open, and my notes and dollar gone. All the things had been moved to get at them-the 5l. note had my captain's name on it. On the 4th of October, we found the prisoner in Sunalley. I saw Lines find the Spanish dollar and 3l. 13s. on him. I think the dollar is mine. I had no mark on it.</p>

            . I am a widow, and keep a lodging-house, in the parish of All Saints, Poplar. On the 3d of October, the prosecutor, prisoner and two others, came to lodge with me; all four slept in the same room; I told the prosecutor he had better leave his chest down stairs; he took them up; there were three chests; none of them slept in that room that night; the next morning the prosecutor came and said his box was broke open, and his-money gone; the prisoner, prosecutor and the other man came from one ship; Ramsden came from another ship. He slept in the room that night.</p>

            . I am the beadle of Limehouse. I apprehended the prisoner, searched him and found two 1l. notes and 1l. 13s., in silver on him, and a Spanish dollar; I went to the lodgings and found the box broke open; I found a poker in the room, which fitted the marks in it, exactly.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM RAMSDEN. I lodged with him that night; I had lodged there eight weeks before. On the 3d of October, another man slept in the room - He was asleep when I went to bed; he had been at the house as long as I had. I went to bed at eleven o'clock, and about twelve a coach drove to the door - I heard a knock at the door, somebody got out; the man who sleeps below let him in; it was the prisoner, he came up, got a light, and came into the bed-room; he took a small chissel to force the box open-it would not do, and he forced it open with the poker. I had seen him before that time; he brought his own chest up; I could see plainly, and am positive he is the man; when he came into the room, I asked him who it was that came in the coach - He said it was him, and that he came from East Smithfield; this was while he was breaking the box open; he opened it and took something out and went down stairs, I bid him good-night; he came up again in the dark. I do not know what he took out of the box the second time.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to be quiet all the time? - A. I thought it was his own box; I am sure he is the man - I had a great deal of conversation with him in the morning.</p>

            . I opened the door and let the prisoner in about twelve o'clock. I am certain he is the man; he came in a coach; he asked for a light, which I gave him; he said he wanted to go to his box for some money. I heard him moving about; he asked the coachman what the fare was-the man said, "I thought you was going back," he said he was; he went out, saying, he should return to breakfast.</p>

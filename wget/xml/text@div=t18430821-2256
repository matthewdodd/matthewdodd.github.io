                  </hi>. I was in the employ of Mr. Cates, a livery stable keeper, in the New-road, Chelsea—On Saturday morning, the 1st of July, I went out early with a carriage of my master's, and went to No. 188, Sloane-street, about a quarter to four o'clock, and took up a gentleman who I believe to be Colonel Fawcett—I had seen a gentleman at my master's the night he—before who ordered a carriage—I believe it was the same gentleman that I took up—he ordered the cab at that hour—it was a brougham—when I took up the gentleman, I was ordered to drive to the Haymarket—I did so—I believe it was to No. 21, it was a shop with a private door—Colonel Fawcett got out there, went into the house, and remained there half an hour or more—a gentleman came out with him—I don't know whether the prisoner is that gentleman—I could not swear to the gentleman—he looks very much like him—I think he is the gentleman—he got into the brougham, and I drove to Great Portland-street and up to a house there—the gen<lb></lb>tleman that came from the Haymarket got out there, and went into No. 27, I think, Great Portland-street—I think he rang the bell—he remained in the house some time, and then came out with another gentleman—a hired cab then came up, the cabman gave the last gentleman a card, and told him he was the one that was hired the night before—I then went to the Brecknock Arms—I took Colonel Fawcett and the gentleman from the Haymarket, in the brougham, and the other gentleman went in the cab—the cab led the way—when we got to the Brecknock Arms the gentlemen all got out—the cab was sent away—I saw another carriage there—an open one—I believe it was a gentleman's carriage, a sort of britska—I saw two other gentlemen there, standing near the Brecknock Arms—I do not know their names—one of them came and spoke to the gentleman that got out of the cab who had been taken up in Portland-street—the two gentlemen that got out of my brougham, went along the road through the toll gate, from London—the other three gentlemen walked into the field together—they went along the road some distance first—they went into a field close by the Brecknock Arms—the two gentlemen then came through the gate again and went into the field after them—it was the same field, through a gate—they went up to the other three gentlemen—they all five met there together—they then went away in a di<lb></lb>rection from the Brecknock Arms, and across the field—I there lost sight of them—I did not see them go over another field—I staid near the Brecknock Arms with my carriage—in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes I heard a report of fire-arms, which appeared as if it came from the rifle or target ground behind the field in which I had seen the gentlemen—I believe it was one report that I heard—I can't say that I heard any more—on hearing the report, I went to look in the direction of the rifle ground—I saw two gentle<lb></lb>men coming from towards that direction in a sort of hurried state—they were two of the gentlemen I had seen at the Brecknock Arms—one was the gentleman who was taken up in Portland-street, and the other was a stoutish gentleman—he was one I found waiting with the carriage at the Brecknock Arms—they came and desired the coachman to drive them to the barracks, otherwise they should be too late for the march—the coachman drove them away—after they went away, one of the other three gentlemen came to me, and told me that he wanted some assistance—I was then at the Breck<lb></lb>nock</p>

I heard the report of what I considered to be one pistol, one report, and I heard the call "Doctor" immediately afterwards—in fact instantaneously—I turned round, and ran up to Colonel Fawcett who was lying wounded on the ground—Mr. Cuddy was standing near him—at least the gentleman that I consider to be Mr. Cuddy from report—the gentleman that had come down with Colonel Fawcett—he was standing with one of those thin upper coats on—it was the same gentleman that I mentioned before—Mr. Monro had at that time just run up to Colonel Fawcett—there was something said about levelling—levelling a pistol—Colonel Fawcett said that—he said he was not levelling at him, or was not covering him—I do not know which words—it was a word to that effect—Mr. Monro said, "Oh, Fawcett, I thought you were levelling at me, or I thought you were covering at me," or words to that effect—for my attention was so exclusively devoted to the wounded man, that I am not very positive, but they were words to that effect—they meant that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a toll collector at the Maiden-lane gate, near the Brecknock Arms, Camden-town. On Saturday morning, the 1st of July, between four and five o'clock, I saw an open carriage with one horse come from Camden-town towards my gate, and pull up at the Brecknock Arms, and then a brougham with one horse—I did not notice any more—I did not see any persons in the brougham—I saw two gentlemen get out of the first carriage—I did not notice how many got out of the brougham—I saw five gentlemen altogether at the Brecknock Arms—the prisoner was one of them—I am positive of that—this gentleman and another walked a little way down the road, and then returned—I did not see where the five gentlemen went—I did not notice them afterwards—I did not hear any thing—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I saw two gentlemen returning from across the field—they got into the open carriage, and drove off—I then saw another gentleman coming across the field—I think the prisoner is that gentleman—he was beckoning the coachman to follow him—the coachman went off after this gentleman, and then the coachman and he both went across the field—I stopped till the coachman returned again—I afterwards saw the prisoner in the field along with Mr. Gulliver, close to the wounded gentleman, looking over him—I am positive of that—I heard Colonel Fawcett say to the prisoner that he wished his wife to be sent for, he should like to see his wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 5, Clifford-street, Bond-street. I saw Colonel Fawcett, on Saturday the 1st of July, I suppose between nine and ten o'clock, at the Camden Arms, Camden-town—he was wounded in the right side, a little below the arm pit—I examined the wound—I judged from the symptoms that it was a serious wound—a mortal wound I should say—I saw Colonel Fawcett from that time till near his death, within an hour of his death I suppose—the last time I saw him was I think about four o'clock on the Monday—I think he died about five, or between five and six—I made a post mortem examination on the Monday evening—it was a very small wound externally—ragged, and had penetrated one of the ribs—I think the seventh rib—it had wounded the back part of his lungs, and the ball was found in the spine—the nineteenth vertebra I think—it was a pistol bullet—the cause of death was the effusion of blood into his chest, and the shock altogether—it was a serious wound—the spinal chord was not</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook in the family of Mrs. Norton, of No. 188, Sloane-street. Colonel Fawcett lodged there—Mrs. Fawcett lodged there about three weeks before the Colonel came home—he came home about a fortnight before the 1st of July—I know Mr. Munro—I remember his being there several times—I saw him there last on the Wednesday or Thursday be<lb></lb>fore Colonel Fawcett left Sloane-street—they had words, and quarrelled—next morning a gentleman called on Colonel Fawcett while he was at break<lb></lb>fast—I believe his name was Grant—I saw the card lying on the breakfast table that morning—I am not certain it was the card he sent in—I did not see a card there before—I let the gentleman in, he gave me his card, which I took in to Colonel Fawcett—the gentleman then went into the back dining-room, and Colonel Fawcett went in and spoke to him.</p>

On the 26th he was brought to me by Caines, and I asked him what he had done with my property? Some duplicates were found on him.</p>

            . I live in Lower West-street, Smithfield; the prisoner and his father lodged with me. On the 26th of January the prosecutor came to inquire for him - he had not been home all night; he came home between ten and eleven o'clock that morning. I told him his master had been for him, and he had better go to him; he cried very much, and said he had got duplicates of the greatest part of the property. I took him to his master, and as we went up Shoe-lane he gave me eight duplicates in a piece of paper - they referred to Cotterrell's in Shoe-lane.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Cotterrell, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in Shoe-lane. On the 17th of January a garnet locket and pearl cross were pledged with me by the prisoner, in the name of Jones - the apprentice took them in in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any questions asked him - A. The first time he came was the first of January; he said he came from his master, Mr. Featherstone, New-street - I made no inquiry; I have known the boy four years. I told the apprentice to take no more, as I thought they were made up to cheat us.</p>

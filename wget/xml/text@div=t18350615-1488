                  </hi>. I am an accountant, and live in Cheapside. I missed these books on the 28th or 29th of May—I had not seen them for a month or six weeks—William Hughes had been my errand-boy for four or five months; but he had lived in my house much longer, as his father and mother occupied the upper part—I missed sixty or seventy very large ledgers—my boy made a confession, and I discovered that a quantity had been sold at a book-shop, in Moorfields—the boy then told me he had sold some to another person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Cripplegate-within. I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Hoyle's passage, on the 28th of May, about half-past seven in the morning with the boy—he was there about two minutes—he then came out—I was watching on the opposite side, and took him but found nothing on him—he took his bag with him to the Compter—he said he bought the books for waste paper of the boy—he said that without my asking him—he ran from me, but was stopped before he got to Honey-lane-market.</p>

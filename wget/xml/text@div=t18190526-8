            . I live at Barnstead, in Surry. On Saturday, the 1st of May, about half-past<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181905260006"></xptr>two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in town with my sister, and went to Mr. Garton's shop in Cheapside; he deals in cotton. I paid a 5 l. note there, and received four 1 l. notes and some silver in change. I put the notes into my pocket-book, with two 10 l. notes, which I had brought from home - they were marked on the back with the word</p>

               <p>"Bank," and my own name. Soon after we left Garton's, we crossed over on the Bow-church side, and were going towards Bread-street - I held my pocket-book in my hand. Very soon after we passed Bow church, some person caught at my pocket-book - I held it fast; they did not succeed for sometime. I held it fast for a small space of time; it was then taken from me by pulling and twisting it from me - I was nearly turned round before I let it go. I made all the resistance I could, and held it with both hands - it was taken forcibly from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner - A. Yes; the instant he took it from me, I saw him, and followed him with my eye. I saw him take the pocket-book out of my hand - he ran towards Bow church, then crossed, and dodged between the coaches. I pointed him out to a gentleman who passed me, and he followed him. I saw my pocket-book and notes again at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He struggled with you to get it - A. Yes; I saw the prisoner the moment he got it. He is the person who took it - I have not the least doubt of it.</p>

            . I am a carrier. On the 1st of May I was going along Cheapside, a gentleman passed me, crying</p>
               <p>"Stop thief! the fellow has taken the lady's pocketbook from her!" I observed the gentleman look across the way towards the coaches, by which I supposed the prisoner had run through the coaches. I ran across the road, and saw the prisoner making towards Lawrence-lane. I overtook him in Lawrence-lane, and said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose you are the person who has taken the pocket-book from the lady." He said he would strike me if I came near him. Two or three young men came up at the time. I ran to the Castle, public-house, expecting to find an officer, but did not. I ran back, and found the young men still following him. I came up - he threatened to strike me again, and said he would fight me; I did not choose to fight. I followed him to the corner of Aldermanbury, and there collared him. He struck me in the face - the others assisted in securing him, and we delivered him to Nickson at St. Lawrence bench. I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, he came to lodge with my mother in law on the 15th of August, 1808, the lives at 28, Sidney-street, Goswell-street road, he came with the name of Mr. Cook when he took the lodgings, he was to pay twelve shillings a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100022"></xptr>Q. Do you remember, on the 9th of September, 1808 the prisoner making any application to you - A. On the 9th of September, 1808, he called me up into his apartment, and asked me if I thought I could get a draft changed for twelve pounds; I told him I did not know, I would try. I went and tried. He wrote the draft in my presence. This is not the first draft.</p>
               <p>Q. He wrote a draft in your presence for twelve pounds, you saw that - A. Yes, that was upon the banker, Mr. Praed, he gave it me, I went to try to get change at a publican in the same street, I could not get change, I returned and my mother gave me some information that she had got a fifteen pound bank note; I went up to the prisoner's apartment, I told him my mother had a note of fifteen pound, if he would give me the difference: he said, yes; he then asked me if it would make any difference if he gave me a draft of fifteen pounds instead of that; I gave him the first note, he tore it, and then he wrote another, he gave me the other, I took it to my mother, and gave it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at that draft - A. Yes, that was also a draft of Praed's.</p>
               <p>Q. You took it to your mother - A. Yes, she had occasion to put it away that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of that draft so as to be able to say it is the same - A. Yes, I did. This is the same draft that he wrote, and it is the same that I gave to my mother, and she paid it away in my presence to Mr. Haynes, he brought it back again.</p>

               <p>COURT. When the prisoner gave you the other draft that he drew did he receive from your mother the fifteen pound bank note - A. He received from me the fifteen pound bank note which my mother had given me to give to him; she paid the draft in my presence to Mr. Haynes, he had it about an hour and an half; he brought back the draft, saying that he had no money there. I took the draft up to the prisoner, I told him that we had occasion to pay it away to a tradesman, the tradesman had been, and the answer was, that there was no money there; he took it out of my hand and read it over; after he read it he said he saw his mistake; for his father formerly had money at that house, but had not now; he had forgot to put the word junior; he took it out of my hand, and wrote the word junior to the name of Cook; he told me then that I should find that it would be right. I carried it down stairs and gave it to Mr. Haynes again; he went back the next morning with it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go with him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Haynes after he had been there come to you the next morning - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Between that night that you had so given it Mr. Haynes, and when Mr. Haynes came to you the next morning what became of the prisoner - A. While Mr. Haynes remained in the house Cook left the house saying that he should return again to tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know that Mr. Haynes was in the house - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. But during the time that he was in the house giving the draft to you so altered the prisoner went out of the house saying that he should return to tea - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. After the prisoner had altered the bill you gave the bill to Mr. Haynes after it had been so altered, and you had so given it to Mr. Haynes the prisoner went out of the house, while the prisoner was there did he ever return - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say that Mr. Haynes returned the next morning, and returned you the draft - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give it to you - A. I do not remember whether he gave it to me or to my mother; we were both present.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the draft that was brought back the second time by Mr. Haynes the same draft you had given Mr. Haynes with the name of Cook, without the alteration - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18110710-36-person343">Q. </persName>
            Your mother had the draft - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you hear of the prisoner again - A When he was taken I saw him at Hatton Garden. I do not know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did see him at Hatton Garden had you any doubt that he was the same person that had been your mothers lodger, and who wrote the draft of which you have been speaking of - A. I had no doubt he was the same person. It was in June, the last month, that he was apprehended, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. That draft that you have now produced is the same draft - A. It is my draft, having my own name, which I put at the back of it before it ever went out of the house, and before I delivered it to Mr. Haynes by his desire; he is a very particular man. I have no doubt of the draft.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The witness says that the money was paid on receiving the second draft I understand.</p>

               <p>COURT, to witness. Was the fifteen pound paid at the time when you received the first draft without the word, junior - A. He had the money then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I mean to say that the money was paid for the draft that was destroyed.</p>
               <p>Witness. He gave me that for the fifteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You did not give the fifteen pounds for the twelve pounds draft - A. I gave him the note, saying if he would give me the difference. I thought he would give me the change of the difference.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 9th of September, 1808, had you an application from your daughter, at the instance of the prisoner for change of a draft for twelve pounds - A. Yes, sir, I had, upon that I gave her a fifteen pound bank note to take to him, then she brought down a check for fifteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the check for twelve pound - A. I heard it was broke to pieces, I never saw it again.</p>
               <p>Q. You had brought back a draft upon Praed and Co for fifteen pound - A. Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100023"></xptr>Q. Did you look at that draft - A. No, not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any other draft than that of fifteen pounds as coming from the prisoner or any body else on that day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When your daughter brought back this draft of fifteen pound what did you do with the draft - A. I gave it Mr. Haynes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the draft again - A. In about half an hour after it was produced by Mr. Haynes he said it was not a good one, and it had not been paid; I gave it to my daughter again, then when she brought it back to me again it had the word junior wrote upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the draft that was brought back to you was the same as the first, except the alteration of that word, junior - A. Yes, Mr. Haynes was waiting I paid it to him again.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the draft again - A. The next morning, in the forepart of the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same draft that you had given him in the two instances - A. The very same.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that draft that was so returned - A. My daughter took it in her care. We are all as one.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any draft of the same value from any other person, had you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner - A. He left the house while Mr. Haynes was in the house the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he saw Mr. Haynes - A. I do not know that he did; he left word that he would come home to tea, he never returned any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that draft and tell me whether that is the draft that you saw in the first state without the word junior to it - A. I never observed it at first, I afterwards did; I have no doubt it is the same draft. I saw my daughter write her name on it in the presence of Mr. Haynes and myself.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HAYNES. Q. I believe you live in Union-street, Whitechapel - A. I do.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live at 20, Dean-street, Shad<lb></lb>well—on 25th March last, about half-past 4 o'clock, I was going down High-street, Shadwell—people were travelling backwards and forwards at the time—the prisoner came up, knocked me down, and pulled my watch right off—I fell—I got up again, and made a blow with this stick, but missed him, and fell down again on my face—he then ran away—I followed right up as far as Shadwell docks—the prisoner went among some small houses—there were some people standing there—I lost sight of him there—I felt my watch go as I fell down—he nipped the swivel of the watch—I am certain he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at High-street, Shadwell—on 25th March last I saw the prosecutor there—I saw the prisoner run against him with great force, and the old gentleman fell down—he got up again, followed after him, made a blow at him with his stick, and he came down again with very great force—the prisoner ran down towards the docks, and the prosecutor followed him—I knew the prisoner before—I have not the least doubt that he is the man.</p>

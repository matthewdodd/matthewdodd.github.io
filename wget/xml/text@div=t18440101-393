I am a silver-spoon finer and polisher, and have been three months in the employ of John Lyas and Son, and live in Lower Symmond's-street, Sloane-square, Chelsea. The prisoner was also employed to polish plate—he worked in the same shop with me—on the 23rd of Dec, about nine o'clock in the morning, several persons, including myself and the prisoner, were at work in the shop—I saw the prisoner go from where he was at work over to the fining skins, which were in charge of another workman, where he had no right to go—I suspected and watched him—he took a spoon,</p>

               <p>passed it into the skin, took from there some silver, and put it into a piece of brown paper—I turned my head, so that he might not think I was watching him—he passed from there to his wheel, where he was at work, and then put it into his pocket—the skins are used to preserve the fine filings from the metal from falling on the ground—they are used in the polishing and shaping of spoons and forks—this skin belonged to a man who was gone to his breakfast—I went into the counting-house, gave information, a policeman was sent for, and he was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Lyas and Son. The prisoner was employed as plate-polisher—he had no right to have filings—there are skins for receiving the filings underneath each man's board—Sturges gave me information—I immediately informed Mr. Lyas, who sent me for a policeman—the prisoner has been some time in the employ—latterly his wages have averaged 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a week.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic"> police-constable G</hi> 16.) On the morning of the 23rd, about half-past nine o'clock, I went to the shop of Messrs. Lyas—I searched the prisoner in the shop—in his pocket there was a very small remainder of fine grains of silver, and just above the wheel where he should be at work, in the corner of a shelf, I found this silver—he was very near the wheel at the time, looking at me when I was searching—I said, "I believe this is the silver; this is a very bad job"—Mr. Bateman said, "Yes"—the prisoner said nothing—he knew of the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a harness-maker, of Park Cottages, Old Ford, Hackney-wick—on 12th September, about 6 in the morning, as I was dressing, I heard one of my horses call out as it was coming along the road—I looked out and saw a chestnut gelding being led by the prisoner—it was my gelding—I asked the prisoner where he was going to with it—he said he was going to put it on the Marsh—he was coming from the Marsh—it had been on the Marsh for some weeks past, and I had seen it there two days previous—I asked the prisoner to wait a minute—I ran downstairs half dressed, took him by the collar and said, "What are you going to do with this horse?"—he appeared quite confused—I said, "You had better wait a moment or two and we will have this matter settled respectably; I have lost one before"—I gave him in charge to a constable—I observed that the prisoner's boots were wet as if he had just come out of the grass, and there were short pieces of grass upon them—I valued the horse at 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 191). The prisoner was given into my custody by the last witness—I asked where he got the horse from—he said he picked it up opposite the White Lion at Hackney-wick—I asked him where he lived and what he had been employed at—he said he had no employment, that he had been some time knocking about in Kingston and some time at Bristol—I asked him where he was last night—he said at a coffee-shop in Shoreditch; that he called for a cup of coffee and remained till daylight—that he then took a walk across the park, and in coming out of the park gates he saw the hone and picked it up, and was going to take it to the Marsh, but he supposed he took the wrong turning—I asked who put the halter on it—he said he knew nothing about the halter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I picked the hone up down Wick-lane; I was coming across the Park, and saw the horse coming down Wick-lane from the Marsh; I caught hold of it, thinking it had got away from some one, and was taking it towards the Marsh; when I came to the prosecutor's window the horse neighed, and the gentleman came to the window and asked where I got it, which I told him.</p>

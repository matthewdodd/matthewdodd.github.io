            . The prisoner was at Mrs. Rogers's house very drunk; she asked me for a pint of beer; I desired her to go home and get a sleep before her husband came home: she insisted on some beer first: we sent for some: after she had drank, she said she would have a pipe of tobacco, before she went home. We observed a shirt hanging down. I met Mrs. Whitford in the passage: I brought her in: the prisoner was then lying on the bed, and the things by her.</p>

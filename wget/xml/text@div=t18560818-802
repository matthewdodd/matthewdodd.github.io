                  </hi>. I am a reporter, but not specifically engaged on any paper. I attend at the County Courts, and hold authority to attend Mr. Wakley's inquests, and have done so ever since he received his appointment—on 2nd Aug. I had been spending the evening with a few reporters, and was in Crown-street, Soho, on my way home from the Strand to Rathbone-place, where I live—I went into a public house for the purpose of having a glass of stout, seeing the house open, and being rather elevated—I think it was in Crown-street, at the end of Crown-street, but I do not know what it is called—it is at the Seven Dials end—I had in my pocket half a sovereign, and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in shillings, sixpences, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces, and in my coat tail pocket 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I saw the prisoners there—I do not know whether they were there when I went in—I was only at the bar, and did not notice whether the tap room was open—the prisoners said, "Shall we drink your health, Sir?" seeing that I was elevated—(we meet on Friday nights to have something; I had gone first to Shoe-lane, then to Bouverie-street, and then we adjourned to the Coach and Horses, opposite Somerset House)—I said, "Yes," put down a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and some drink, I believe, was given—I got change out of what I paid for myself, and put it into my coat tail pocket (that made 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there altogether)—I went out, and when I had got near Denmark-street I was sud<lb></lb>denly attacked by a violent blow with, I think, a bludgeon on my left hip, and at the same moment my throat was grasped from behind—I was dis<lb></lb>abled by the blow on my side, but cannot say whether I fell—I felt my waistcoat and coat pockets being emptied, and had no power to prevent it—at the moment I was about to lose my senses, I saw the prisoners, and recognised them as the men that I had treated—they were going away towards Seven Dials—their backs were not towards me, one was before me, and one behind me—I saw their faces; one was feeling my coat tail pocket, and the other the front—I did not see their faces while they were feeling my pocket, but when they had left me, they both joined to go away—the; did not pass me, so as to put their backs to me—a constable came up, and I gave him a description of them—I said that one wore a <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> hat, a <hi rend="italic">wide awake</hi>, and one wore a moustache—the further prisoner wore the wide <hi rend="italic">awake</hi> (<hi rend="smallCaps">STAGEY</hi>, M.)—I am confident they are the persons I saw at the public house—next evening I went with the constable to Marlborough-street police office—I was taken into a room where a number of persons were assembled, and as soon as I entered I said, "Those are the men."</p>

               <p>went and had a cigar and strolled about—the next house I found myself in was the public house where I met the prisoners—I found myself in St. Martin's-lane about 12 o'clock—I have not sworn that this happened at 1 o'clock—I say between 1 and 2 o'clock—I took a circuitous route—it was a very hot night, and I had no great desire to get into bed soon—I next went across Leicester-square, and up Windmill-street into a sporting house there, of which I know the landlord—I dare say I had something to drink there—I left there and went towards home—I went into no house afterwards before the house where I met the prisoners—I presume that is a night house—I cannot point it out—the neighbourhood of the Seven Dials is so studded with houses that it is impossible to describe it, and in consequence of threats I have avoided Crown-street since—there were not many in the house—I had got into Sutton-street, which is more than forty or fifty yards, before I was attacked—I did not hear footsteps approaching before I got the blow—the blow produced a sort of paralysis on me, and the effect of the throat added to it—I was just losing my consciousness when I recognised the prisoners leaving me—I had been labouring under bilious fever and diarrhœa just before—I was not very well—it was as consciousness was leaving me that I saw them, just as I was about falling back—as I fell back I ob<lb></lb>served them leaving me at a very fast pace—a sort of half run and half walk—a policeman came up to me—I had then partially recovered—I gave him a description of the men who had attacked me—I was not un<lb></lb>steady on my feet—the impression made on me was so great that it drove away the effect—when the policeman came to me in the morning he had arrested the prisoners—I was in bed, and word was left for me to be down at the police court at a quarter to 11 o'clock to identify if I could some men who were in custody—I met the policeman at the police office, (I did not go to the station in Vine-street,) he said, "Now, Mr. Bearer, you were rather elevated last night," or something to that effect, "can you identify these men 1"—I said, "Yes, in a moment"—we had no conver<lb></lb>sation besides that—the dock was full of prisoners—the prisoners were not standing exactly together, but I picked them out and said, "Those are the two"—my recollection of them was strengthened by having seen them under the light of a public house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a lamp where you were robbed, so that you had a pretty fair sight of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, within two or three yards of the corner—I am sure that I felt convinced at that time that they were the two men I saw at the public house—I gave a description of them to the officer, and from that description their apprehension took place—I told him that the two men who assaulted me were the men I had seen in the public house.</p>

I was on duty in Crown-street, on 2nd Aug. about half-past 1 o'clock—I found the prosecutor in the street, lying against a shutter quite senseless—I could not get anything from him, he complained that he had been struck and was paralysed, and that he had been almost choked—he could hardly speak—there was a lamp I think nearly twenty yards off, at the corner of Dudley-court, which leads into High-street—as you go from St. Martin's-lane towards Oxford-street, up Crown-street, Sutton-street is on the left hand side—the prosecutor was on the left hand side, but Dudley-court is on the right—he was on the other side of the way, and half way between Sutton-street and George-yard—he recovered in a short time, and gave me a description of the men—I assisted him home, and then returned to my beat—I had seen two men pass me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185608180086"></xptr>
               <p>about half-past 1 o'clock on the left hand side, going towards Oxford-street at the corner of George-yard, which is no thoroughfare—that was about two minutes before I found the prosecutor, and they were going in a direction from the spot where he was found, towards St Martin's-lane—one had a black hat and the other a brown felt hat—I am quite certain that the prisoners are the men—the prosecutor was not very drunk—I saw him ten minutes previous to this occurrence, and he was capable of taking care of himself then; he passed me in Crown-street—he had been drinking, but was not drunk—I have seen him about the courts, but have never spoken to him—when I returned to my beat I made a communication to constable Gray—in the morning Gray came to me, and I went with him to Cottage-court, Strutton-ground, Westminster, about half-past five o'clock, and found Clifton in bed with his trowsers on; Stacey opened the door in his trowsers and waistcoat—I told them that we took them on suspicion of a garotte robbery in Crown-street—I have not the least doubt that they are the two men I saw going from the place where I found the prose<lb></lb>cutor—I knew them before—I saw a <hi rend="italic">wide awake</hi> on a chair—I searched them at the station, but fonnd no money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long was the prosecutor before he recovered his sensibility? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three minutes—he did not mention his having seen two men in a public house—I remained with him about five minutes, but it took me longer to get him home—I mentioned to him my having seen these two men, but did not tell him how they were dressed—I asked him to describe them—I never mentioned the public house, nor did he—he men<lb></lb>tioned it at the court for the first time—I went with Gray to take the pri<lb></lb>soners—he knew where they lived, but I did not—they were searched at the station, but they only had a few halfpence.</p>

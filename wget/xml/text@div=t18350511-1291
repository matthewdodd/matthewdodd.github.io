                  </hi>. I am a timber-merchant and was proprietor of saw<lb></lb>mills, at Hackney, but they have since been burnt down. The prisoner was in my service about twelve months—his duty was to take orders, and receive cash—it was his duty to pay over every evening the cash received of London customers—Kewell was my principal clerk—the prisoner used to give me the amounts he received, and I used to enter them in the cash-book in his presence, on the day on which he received them from the customers—I gave the customers credit for the amounts—Thompson, of Carnaby-street, was a customer—on the 26th of March, the prisoner did not account to me for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from Thompson—he has never accounted for it—he did not account to me for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on the 9th of April, from Batista, Moltine, and Co., of Baldwin's-gardens—he has never accounted for it—he never ac<lb></lb>counted for 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Trayler, of Bloomsbury-market—in con<lb></lb>sequence of certain discoveries which I made, I charged him with this—he was afterwards taken into custody—I have my books here.</p>

            , they are all the partners in that firm. I produce the book with the entry of the coals; the carman took out eighteen sacks to the stable-yard, St. James's, and twelve sacks to Burr-street; I have also it signed by Maybank, as the carman, his charge is eighteen-pence for shooting; he worked until the 22nd, and then he absconded. On the day the coals were taken out, they were five shillings and sixpence a sack; this sort of coals were sixty-six shillings a chaldron; they were the best coals the carman's name is signed on the ticket, he afterwards signs the book; we send one man, he may take another. Fox was a backer; we owed the prisoner one pound for shooting when he absconded; he never called for it.</p>

            . I have an apartment in St. James's Palace; Mr. Marrabone lives next door to me. On the evening of the 19th of April, I recollect seeing a coal waggon come into the stable-yard, it was near six o'clock; I happened to be looking out of the window; I saw the coals unloading; there were two or three sacks emptied; I saw the man moving the sacks from the front to the tail, he knocked two sacks down, and the coals fell into the street; he put some empty sacks down in the street; I cannot say how many; I then thought there was something wrong, and I watched the counting of the sacks; they counted eighteen, part of them were empty; I watched the waggon; they drove to Maddox-street, they stopped at Mr. Hill's door, in Maddox-street, it is a cook's shop, in Maddox-street, and a private house in Swallow-street, it is a corner house; the waggon pulled up to the private door; I thought the man in the waggon suspected me, I went two or three doors further; they went into the house with two sacks; I saw them come out as if they had taken more; the waggon moved on towards Burr-street, Golden-square; on my seeing Hill in his house. I went, and asked Mr. Hill if Messrs. Wood, were his coal-merchants; he said, no. I said you have had some coals in; he said, he had four sacks out of the waggon, Mr. Wood was not his coal-merchant; he said, the man came into his shop, and said he had some coals to sell, he bought four sacks of him. I told him he had done a wrong act, and he would get into trouble about it. The next day I told Mr. Marrabone of it, and afterwards Mr. Wood was acquainted with it; Mr. Wood sent the metre to measure them; they measured only fourteen sacks, instead of eighteen; they were four sacks deficient, including them that had been burned. I cannot tell who the carman was, whether it was the prisoner or any other man; this happened on the 19th of April.</p>
               <p>MR. M'CALLAH. I am one of the Westminster coal-metres. In April last, I measured some coals in Mr. Marrabone's apartments. I saw his servant, she told me how many she had used; they turned out to be fourteen sacks, and no more.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutors. On the evening of the 11th of October, I fastened up the house myself at about half past seven. It was then dark; I fastened it by putting the door too. I double locked it; I put the padlock on; I locked the padlock, and tried if it was fast. At the time I locked up the premises, every thing was safe. I saw in the warehouse the article called say. I had occasion to cut a pattern off it, which I have in my pocket. I have since been shewn a piece of say, which is of the same pattern. I came by the premises about nine o'clock, and every thing was then safe. In the morning before seven I heard that the premises had been broken open, and I examined the door to see how it had been broke open. There were great dents made in the door-post before they could break the padlock; they must have been made with a crow, or something of that kind; these dents were by the side of the place of the padlock. I did not perceive any more violence; the padlock had been broken by violence; all the property was gone; I mean the property named in the indictment.</p>

I perceived that the bed had been tumbled, as if a person had been in bed. It was a little before ten in the morning; it had the appearance of one person having been in the bed; it was not cold, but little warm. I saw a watch lying in a chair with a gold chain and two gold seals, and a pair of small clothes lying by the bed-side. I then looked on the top of the bedstead and found this black say, (producing it); I then searched the cup-board in the bed-room, and there was a number of pick-lock keys, and many pieces of new sponge. After that I went down stairs and searched the lower part of the house, where I found a bunch of keys in a cup-board there; they were not picklock keys. I then searched under the stairs, where I found a bundle of these keys of all descriptions. I found a pistol on the mantle-piece; that is all that took place; I left my brother officer,

            . I know nothing more than the last witness has said. I produce the key, and here is the pistol.</p>
               <p>John Upton. Cross-examined. I took another man, and we found two pieces of irish linen upon him; he had the irish linen; that was on Monday, 16th; three days before I went to Faneutt's house; besides the irish linen we found in Hayward's house, thirteen different pieces of canvass, and several other articles that were stolen.</p>

            . Re-examined. After the coach was down, and after we got into another, the prisoner said, if the b-y Sheriff hangs me above an hour, I will indict him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say you took me for bad money?</p>

            . I look at the say found in the prisoner's house; I have no hesitation in saying that I firmly believe that to be my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There are no marks; they have taken very good care to cut both the head and the fag-end off. This order has been nearly one year under hand; it is made at Sudbury, in Essex; I don't mean to swear that we have all the say manufactured at Sudbury; there are about twenty-six packers, who can all export it, if they are ordered. I only speak to the best of my knowledge. The maker who makes it, makes other of the same kind. Here is the pattern of what we had in the warehouse, and they match.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I have no doubt that they were originally one, and the same piece; this say is never in wear in this country; we had been about a year procuring the quantity which we wanted; here are about seven or eight yards, and it is a thirty-yard say.</p>
               <p>JURY. Is it ever retailed - A. No, never; we had ordered twelve pieces, which were three hundred and sixty yards. From my knowledge of the manufacture, I don't believe it would take a year to make that quantity; but we are obliged to look over every piece with the greatest accuracy, and perhaps out of thirty pieces, we could only get twelve that would suit us; we are obliged to look them over from end to end.</p>
               <p>JURY. What do you do with the pieces you don't export - A. They export them about St. Mary Axe, at about fifty per cent under our price.</p>

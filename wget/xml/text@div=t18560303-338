                  </hi>. I am a broker's clerk, and live at No. 12, Bell's-build<lb></lb>ings, Salisbury-square. On 1st March, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I was walking along Cheapside with a friend, and met the prisoner—we walked together to Paternoster-row—I bad been drinking, but not to excess; I was perfectly sober—the prisoner left me after a time, and I missed my handkerchief and purse, containing 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which had been safe five minutes before—I and my friend ran after her, found her in Warwick-lane, and said, "You have robbed me of my purse"—a policeman came up, she said, "Here it is," and gave it to me with only 20. in it—I saw something in the shape of money in her mouth—a policeman came up and took her in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I met the young man with a female, and another friend of hers; he asked me to accompany him up the court; I asked him what he would make me a present of; he said 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and his pocket handker-chief, as he had nothing more in his purse than the price of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; I would not give him the handkerchief, and he charged me with robbing him of the purse; I never saw it till it was in the policeman's hands at the station.</p>

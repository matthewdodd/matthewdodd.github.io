                  </hi>I am twenty years old, and live with my parents at Saffron-hill—my father is a fur-dresser—I had known the prisoner a long time, seeing him pass backwards and forwards—I only knew him by sight—we did not keep company—about a fortnight before this happened he spoke to me for the first time—he spoke to two young girls who were with me first—on Tuesday the 8th of June, I met him in Charles-street—I had an umbrella with me—he did not pay any attention to me—he took my umbrella from me, and went away with it—I asked him to give it me back—he asked me to walk to the end of the street with him, and said if I did he would return it to me, and when I got to the end of the street he gave it to me—he then said he thought he should never see me again—I said I did not care whether he did or not, and he put his arm round my neck, and held the knife in his hand—he had it in his hand all the time, I believe—he did not put it to my neck—he held it to my neck with one arm round my neck—he did not touch me with the knife—I screamed out, and the people came up.</p>

                  </hi>I am a policeman. I heard the alarm about half<lb></lb>past nine o'clock, as if it was a female's voice screaming—I hastened to the spot, and saw the prosecutrix leaning against the wall in a fainting state—I pushed through the crowd, and the prisoner had run away with the knife—after she came to herself, the prisoner was coming up the street on the opposite aide of the way—I went over, took him, and asked him what he meant by acting in this sort of manner—he said though he had not murdered her, he would do it if he saw her in any other person's com<lb></lb>"pany or speaking to any body—I said he must give me the knife, which he did, and in going to the station-house he repeated he would murder her if he saw her with any body else—next morning I asked him how be came to do it—he said if he had not committed suicide he should have made a job for Mr. Calcrafe.</p>

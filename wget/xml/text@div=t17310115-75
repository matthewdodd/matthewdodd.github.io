That thereupon he demanded what Authority he had to ask him; he told him, he would make him give an Account; that then the Prisoner said, he had been at Piss; that then he and others went to the Post with a Lanthern, and there was no wet there, or thereabouts; that then the Prisoner said, that he had an Inflammation in his Bladder, and could not make Water.</p>

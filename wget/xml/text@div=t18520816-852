On Wednesday, 11th August, I went to Walters's house, in Lamb-lane, Greenwich—I saw Walters there—I told him he was charged with being concerned with Marchman in stealing a quantity of articles from Mr. Snazell, at Sydenham—he said, "I stole nothing, you may search my house, I have got nothing"—I searched the room, and found this little box, containing two shaving boxes, two shaving brushes, and a razor—I asked him whose they were—he said, Everything in this room belongs to the landlord"—I called the landlord and landlady into the room, and asked them if the property in the room belonged to them—they examined it, and said yes, everything in the room was theirs, except this one box and brush, and the razor—I then turned to Walters and said, "These are articles that I am looking for"—(I had a list of articles in my</p>

               <p>hand at the time)—Walters said, "I know nothing about it, I was not in Mr. Snazell's house, only to get my meals"—I told him he would have to go to the station, as these things belonged to Mr. Snazell—he then said, "Oh, I recollect now, Marchman gave me that box, brush, and razor, and told me they might be serviceable to me"—I found three duplicates, one of them was of a shirt pawned on 9th Aug.—this is it—I asked Walters about the three duplicates—he said, "They were our own things"—I said", Here is one for a shirt, pawned 9th Aug."—he said, "They all belong to us, they were our own things"—the next day I accompanied the prosecutor to Mr. Smith's, the pawnbroker, at Greenwich, where the shirt was pawned—I asked the pawnbroker to produce this shirt, and he produced it, with a corresponding ticket on it—I went to Walters's house, and found on the sideboard this chain, and this little lock and key—they were there when I was there before, but I did not notice them, as they were not in the list of articles that I had—in a cupboard under the sideboard I found some envelopes, and four sheets of paper, and on a chair I found this Doyley—the prosecutor identified them, and I took them away—I went to the station, and told Walters I had found these things, and I showed them to him—he said he had found the chain in a drawer, but whether he said in the washhouse or the outhouse I will not say, but it was one of the two—he said it was very dirty and green, and he had cleaned it and made it bright—he said the lock was his own—I showed him the lock and chain, and this flannel shirt and the envelopes, and told him the prosecutor had identified them, and that the envelopes had "Sydenham" on them—he said, "Very well, I must put up with the consequences."</p>

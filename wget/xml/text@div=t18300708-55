On the 1st of June the prisoner came into a house where I was, in Bainbridge-street, St. Giles' - I was with another woman; I afterwards went to search for that other woman, and saw the prisoner again at a potatoe-shop; she asked me for some gin - I put my hand into my pocket, and had all this property safe; I put it into my left hand - I was feeling for some money in my other pocket, and the prisoner took these from my left hand: the handkerchief was in my bosom - I cannot swear whether she took that, but I am positive she took the other; I had never seen her before -I was looking after the other woman; she had taken something from me - I did not see the prisoner again till she was in custody.</p>

            . I have the coins, which the prisoner brought to me on the 1st of June; I weighed them, and thought she wanted to sell them; she then produced the seal- I said, "I would not advise you to sell that, as it may be of use to some person;" I stood some time, and then asked her what she was waiting for; she said for the ticket - I said, "I cannot lend that money on them which I gave you; but take the money, and if the person don't like it, bring it back;" this was about five o'clock, and the next morning she came with the officer.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you heard Mr. Philpott's opinion about your borrowing money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I never heard that he strongly objected to this system of borrowing and lending—I did not know that he was aware of it—I did not want to conceal it from any one—Mr. Hockley the accountant is here, he has gone right through the books.</p>

                  </hi> I and my mother, Martha Wray, are the proprietors of Downe's Wharf.

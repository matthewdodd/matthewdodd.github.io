            . I am waterman at the coach-stand in Cheapside. On Sunday morning, the 28th of September, between four and five o'clock, the prisoner, Thomas, drew his coach to the stand, between King-street and Bucklersbury; in about half an hour, the prisoner, Hamilton, came up and spoke to him. As he went away, I heard one of them say, "All is right." I went to get some liquor at the corner of Budge-row, and saw Hamilton walking down Walbrook; he stopped at Mr. Alderman Atkin's door, and scraped his shoes. As I returned, I saw him walking round the back of the Mansion-house - He was within twelve yards of the prosecutor's door. About half-past six o'clock he came up to the stand to Thomas again - He drew his coach up to the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this, had you made any application to Thomas - A. Yes; I told him I had a job for him - He said, he believed he had one already, and I had better take the coach behind him. When Hamilton came up I opened the coach door, he came from Bucklersbury. Thomas said he was the man who spoke to him - He got in; Thomas was going to drive down Bucklersbury-Hamilton put his head out and said, "I told you to go down Pancras-lane"-that would lead them to Bucklersbury. I afterwards saw the coach in Charlotte-row; the glass was up-there appeared to be two men in it, and something like a bag.</p>

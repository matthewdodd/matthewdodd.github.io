On the 29th of April I met a gentleman in the street, whom I had lived with, who ruined me; he said he was sorry to see me in such a miserable condition, and he gave me three guines to buy me some clothes, that I might get into service. When I went home I showed them the money; they handed it about from one to another, and at last the prisoner took it, and she would never give it me again. I am sure she had it.</p>

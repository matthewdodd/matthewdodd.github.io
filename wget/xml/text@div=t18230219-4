On the 13th of February, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in the parlour - a girl came into the shop, and gave me information. I ran out, and saw two young men standing at the door - I found a pane of glass broken, and missed some shoes, I cannot tell how many. The pane was not quite out; it was a piece cut out at the corner; they had then put a hand through and opened the casement, which was fastened with a wire. I found the window about two inches open; a person could put his hand in, and take the shoes. I had seen it about half an hour before; I did not examine the pane then; I could see that the window was not unfastened then. I asked the two young men if they had seen anybody near, for somebody had been robbing me - they said they saw two boys; they went away on saying so, but one of them returned in about a minute, and said there were some very suspicious boys round the corner - I ran over towards the boys, One of the young men said,</p>
               <p>"That is him, catch him." The two prisoners were then together, I went to take Fairer, he ran off as hard as he could, I secured him, and gave him in charge.</p>

            . On the 13th of February, I was going up Henrietta-street, and saw the prisoner Harding, and Penford talking to him. I stopped about half a minute; there was a cry of Stop thief! I saw Harding run across the road, and throw something down an area; he was secured. I went to the house, and the landlady brought me up a pair shoes, out of the area - I gave them to the constable of the night at the watch-house. I am positive that Harding ran by the area, and threw something down, but what I do not know.</p>

            . On the 13th of February, I was in James-street, going with a friend, who called on an acquaintance of his, at the prosecutor's house, about half-past nine o'clock; I stood at the door waiting for him, and the prosecutor came out, and said he had been robbed, and asked if I had seen anybody passing; I said, No. It was a very dark night. My friend came out, we went on, and as we turned into Henrietta-street, at the corner of the street and Bird-street, we observed the two prisoner's as if looking for something; we passed them about five yards - Harding ran after us, and asked if we had picked up a shoe; we said, No. It immediately struck me they were the theives - I sent my friend to the prosecutor's house, and while he was gone they kept looking for the shoe. Fairer said they had bought a pair of shoes, and shewed me one, saying it was the fellow to that they lost. The prosecutor came up - I said,</p>
               <p>"That is he, mark him," pointing to Fairer; he immediately took to his heels, and Harding walked leisurely across the road, turned round, and seeing me following him, he unbuttoned his coat, threw something down the area, and then ran off - I followed and took him at the corner of James-street, and gave him to the watchman. I went to the prosecutor's, and went with Evans to the area, which was searched, and the woman brought the shoes up.</p>

                  </hi>. I was ledger-keeper in the Commercial Bank of London, at the Henrietta-street Branch—I have been at the ledgers nearly ten yean—the prisoner Durdin, was a ledger-keeper at the same Bank—there were five current account ledgers latterly—they were divided from A to C, from D to H, from I to M, from N to Sl, and from Sl Z—the ledger D to H was kept by Durdin—it contained the Balances of the current accounts of customers whose names begin with D, and ending with H—it contains their accounts altogether—I know Holcroft by sight, as a customer of the Bank—I have seen him there generally two or three times a day, and on those occasions, he nearly always spoke to Durdin, either a note, or by word of mouth—they generally talked in the first portion of the Bank, away from the cashiers' desks—I have very frequently seen Holcroft's wife come to the Bank—she generally had a letter for Durdin, or spoke to him—I was not near enough to hear what was said, and I should say the other clerks were not—when I have seen Holcroft there, I have put many questions to Durdin at different times, and he always evaded it—I did not put any direct questions to him, as to his connexion with Holcroft; but I used to call him his man of business, which he did not seem at all times to approve of—six of the clerks used to take it in turns to remain till 9 at night—I remember one Saturday when it was my turn to remain till 9—I am not quite certain whether it was the Saturday, or Saturday week previous to the discovery of the fraud; but think it was the Saturday previous—Durdin had not been to the Bank since the Thursday—he left on the Thursday, and sent for me on the following Saturday—he had been away from illness; an attack of paralysis, I believe—he sent a ca B for me while I was at the Bank, saying that he should very much like to see me—I got somebody to remain at the Bank for me—I knew one of the parties who used to stop at</p>

               <p>the Bank for Durdin; but Mr. Beal, one of the senior ledger-keepers, was there, and he offered to remain for me—I went in the cab to Durdin's house at 7, or half-past 7, and found him in bed—he said that he merely wished to ask me how his portion of the work at the Bank was getting on—I thought it was only natural, as I presumed he felt an interest in the concern—I think he detained me full an hour—I made several attempts to leave; but he requested me not to hurry away—when I got back to the Bank, it was about half-past 7—if I had remained at the Bank, I should have bad access to Durdin's books—Durdin returned to the Bank to do duty, I think, on the following Wednesday—he worked at his calendars to see that the balances were correct—they would contain the balances from the different ledgers—he was decidedly very ill—he worked at his calendars for a day or two the Bank, and I offered to come and help him in the evening, as I did not like to see him getting so much behind—he said that he thought he should soon have them up by himself again, as he was only able to post—I considered his remark was very natural; and said, "I shall see how you get on"—I believe I spoke to him one Saturday, about coming to work at night, as he told me that Mr. Beadon had told him I was coming to help him with his work of a night, to make his work right—he said that he would not allow any one to touch his work for anything—I said, that I had told the men that I was coming in, and therefore I should come—he said, "Well, if you are coming, I shall stop, and I shall stop as long as you stop"—he pushed himself back in his chair, and said to the porter, "Here, help me to the desk; it seems as if I could not get on fast enough for them"—I left at 5, returned at 7, and found Durdin there at his old post—(about 5 o'clock was his average time to leave); he asked me to take the ledgers, and he would keep the calendar and go through it, and tell me which accounts were altered, as every account does not alter during the day; it is merely those who draw money out or pay money in—I took the ledger, and Durdin kept the calendar—we continued to work till about 9 o'clock, when Durdin appeared ill; he looked excited, and said that he should give up, and lock up his papers—I said that he could do as he pleased, the papers were of no value, and it would take me some time to get the particulars again—we were very busy, as we had lost one of our clerks—he locked up the papers—he left first; I then assisted the other ledger-keeper, and left between 9 and 10—I came next morning, Friday 15th, at my usual time, 9 o'clock—Durdin was not in the habit of coming before 11 or 12—I examined the calendar which Durdin had had the previous night; he had not locked it up, but merely the papers—I found that he had taken the amounts correctly into the other calendar which I re-cast, and found it differed 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the three calendars—there is not. one calendar to each ledger; two calendars contain two ledgers each, and the other but one—they are A to C, D to M, and N to Z—the D to M calendar was kept by Durdin, the balance of the three calendars would be posted up and the first calendar A to C would contain the balance of the three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this a calendar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; these are the dates of balances—we have not to write the names every day, they last three weeks; they last as many days as there are columns, eighteen days—these figures represent the balance of the A to B ledger, these the D to M, and these N to Z—this is his casting; it is 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. exactly—these are his figures these two rows, and these are the senior ledger-keeper's.</p>

               <p>merely the pounds, not the shillings and pence, and found that it had been mis-cast about 36,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the balance truly corresponded with the ledger, but it had been mis-cast—when I found that large deficiency I did not speak to the manager immediately, not during the morning—that same morning Durdin came to the bank; Holcroft came during the day and was asked into the back room to see Durdin—he remained with him alone a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—after banking hours I left at my usual time, leaving Durdin there—I went to Mr. Chancey, the manager of the bank, that night, and communicated with him—I was afraid to communicate it to him during the day, fearing some serious consequences might arise—he and I returned to the bank and examined the books—we got there about 8 o'clock or a little after; we found Durdin there in his usual place with some books before him, his calendars, I believe—Mr. Chancey told him that he wished to speak to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If I understand you right, every night after the drawings out and payings in are put into the ledger, it is the duty of the ledger-clerk to put down in the calendar the actual balances as they appear in the ledger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; those that have altered—those that did not alter he would merely repeat—we turned them over by the papers; wherever there is any paper, we know it is the same, and that facilitates it; all those that do not alter we enter as the same—that is done after the last possible paying in or drawing out.</p>

               <p>rather speak in the absence of Mr. Slann, who then with drew; and on his withdrawal I believe he said, "I see by your face that there is something wrong, how much is it?"—he had a pencil in his hand, and he wrote on a small piece of paper the sum of 66, 992<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have it here; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was very much agitated and amazed when I saw that, and I did not know what to say for a moment or two—I then inquired how it was done, and he said, "It was done through Mr. Holcroft's account"—I asked him how it had been done, and he said it had been done by posting sums which had been received to some one else's account, to the account, not only of the owners of the sums, but Mr. Holcroft as well—I believe, but I am not certain, that he said he had operated through his own account as well—I am not quite certain whether he said that account was closed—he also informed me that Mr. Holcroft was not cognisant of the transaction in any sort or kind of way—very little more was said, and I left the bank—he told me he had some promissory notes of Mr. Holcroft's to the extent of 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that he thought they would be ultimately good—I believe he alleged that Holcroft's father or a relative died shortly before, and that, through him, he was likely to receive a certain sum of money—I think he said something to the effect that he hoped the Bank would make him a loan of the money, and take his promissory note, or some such proposition at that—he said he had house property to the amount of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which he promised to give me particulars—he asked what my intentions were—I said I could not tell; I might probably have said, "I shall feel it my duty to consult others"—I knew Holcroft by sight, and knew that he had an account at the bank.</p>

I am one of the firm of Paul and Turner, accountants, of Coleman-street—I know Holcroft—he was introduced to me by a person named Ramsay—I went through his books; but never heard by that, or by his statement, of a creditor named Durdin—Holcroft told me that it was necessary to trace certain bills which had been discounted, and were in the hands of third parties—I asked him for the names of the holders; he said that they were in the hands of a particular friend of his, who held a high commercial position, and he had rather his name was not mentioned—I saw the creditors, and obtained their consent for the composition—I afterwards went to the clerk to Messrs. Lawrence and Plews, and paid the composition—the bills of which he was holder amounted to about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., among which was one for 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn by Holcroft and Millard, on 29th October—I got that partially from Holcroft's statement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier in the Henrietta-street branch of the Commercial Bank—I know both the prisoners—I have known Durdin twelve or thirteen years, ever since he has been in the bank—I have been in the habit of seeing Holcroft there, for some years—during October, November, and December last, he has come to get his pass-book himself three or four times a week—the Bank returns the cheques in the pocket in the usual way—these six promissory notes are in Holcroft's writing, and these fourteen cheques also—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the ledger containing Holcroft's account in 1860 and 1861—it was opened on 1st October, 1860, with what is credited as "Cash, 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that entry is in Durdin's writing—it is carried over from the apparent balance of Holcroft and Co.—here is 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." entered on 1st October, and 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. October, in Durdin's writing—all the entries on that page are Durdin's, and up to the 29th—on the debit side, I find 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 18th, and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 19th—they are in the same writing—all the debits are in Durdin's writing—I should say that this amount to the account of Holcroft and Co., from which the 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been brought forward as a credit, is in Durden's writing; but it is a little different—the credits entered from time to time for several pages appear to be in Durdin's writing—he was ledger-keeper, and would, in the ordinary course of business, be the keeper of that particular account—I have got the paying cash-book here, in which we keep an account of those customers who bring cheques to the bank—it is partially kept by me—they are cheques presented at the counter, and bills—the greater part of it is in my writing; I think nearly all—I find, from an entry in this book, that on 18th October, I cashed a cheque for 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by James Holcroft—I paid him in bank<lb></lb>notes; a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the number of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was 34,318—we have not the dates in this book, merely the numbers—I can get the dates by the waste-book—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was No. 16,126; the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 00,530; the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. No. 91,405; and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. No. 16,794—on 19th October, I also cashed a cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Holcroft—I want another book for that this is it—the paying books are alternate days—I paid with a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 25,482, and a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., No. 57,836—on 29th October, I cashed a cheque, drawn by Holcroft, for 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was paid short, with a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Note, No. 51,136; a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 99,590; a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 70,918; and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., No. 00,027—they are looking for the book by which I can tell the dates—I have seen Holoroft's pass-book—as far as credits go they are copied from the ledger—the debits are copied from the cheques themselves—they are written in from the vouchers then, unless there is some entry in the cash-book, or a paying slip—a person cannot get the fact anywhere but from the cash-book—the ledger-keeper never sees the paying-in slip at all—I have got some of the dates here—the note 34,318, is dated 19th May, 1860—there is a witness here who can give you the numbers better than I can; I mean Mr. Glegg, the accountant.</p>

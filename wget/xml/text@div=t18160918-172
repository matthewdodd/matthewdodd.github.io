            , On the night of the 10th of August, before I went to bed. I put my brooch and breast pin in a cushion on my dressing table. They were both gold. About ten o'clock, Mr. Armstrong told me a person wanted to see me on very particular business. In consequence of that, I ordered that the person might he shewn up stairs, It was the prisoner. He begged my pardon for disturbing me; but said he was going out of town, and had not sufcient money to pay for his stage. He said he had not any one to resort to but me, and in consequence of that, I lent him one pound. He then went away. When I got up the next morning I missed the property in question. It was then about eight o'clock, and there had been nobody in the room all night but the prisoner. I communicated what bad happened to Mr. Tuck, and about a week after I had the prisoner apprehended.</p>

            . I keep the cock in the Haymarket, In consequence of something Mr. Ward communicated to me, I apprehended the prisoner at the Feathers public-house; I thought the prisoner was charged with a capital felony, for obtaining money under a threat of an unnatural offence. The prisoner said I was no officer, and I said, I was not; but I considered that I had a right to take him on such a charge. I understood that charge to be from Mr. Ward, that the prisoner had insinuated to him a charge of a certain nature, and thereby induced him to give him money. We sent for an officer. The prosecuter never mentioned any thing about the pin or brooch then. He afterwards did in the afternoon. The prisoner struggled to get away. I said he should not go; and I said I would put him into a hackney coach, and take him to Bow-street. While the coach was gone for, he broadly charged Mr. Ward with the grossest of offences, and said that this money was the wages of it. Mr. Ward did not then say any thing about the pin or brooch. Afterwards when the coach came, the prisoner begged Mr. Ward's pardon, and stated that all he had urged was false; there were a number of persons of the Prince's household in my house at the time and they all concided in my idea that the prisoner ought to go to Bow-street. The charge was positively that of extorting money, and that was the only charge which was then made against the prisoner. We then took him to Bow-street, and there the brooch came out. On relating the time to the magistrate about the money being procured, he considered from what the prosecutor said, that it was lent, and the magistrate considered that the capital charge would fail.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ARMSTRONG. I am landlord of the house in which the prosecutor lodged. I recollect the prisoner coming to my house on the night of the day in the indictment, at about ten o'clock; he said he wanted to see the prosecutor on very urgent business, and wished to see him; I told him the prosecutor was in bed. He then said, be must see him if possible. I went up, and told Mr. Ward that Mr. Bold wanted him; at first Mr. Ward did not seem to know him; but at last he said, if he wanted any thing in particular, he must come up he supposed. I shewed him up accordingly; I went away immediately, leaving him in Ward's bed-room; it might be three quarters of an hour that he was there. He did not go until I called out that I wanted to go to bed, and I wished the gentleman to go. Mr. Ward then answered and said he is going immediately; and immediately after that he did go. Mr. Ward went out of Town the next morning after breakfast. The prisoner called twice after that; he called on the Tuesday; and on the Sunday; when he called on the Sunday he was extremely insolent, and insisted upon seeing Mr. Ward, through I told him he was not at home; he insisted that he was at home; in point of fact he was not. At last, I sent for a constable, and then the prisoner left. Before Mr. Ward went out of Town in the morning, he did not say any thing about having lost a brooch or a pin. I told him on his return, how insolently the prisoner had behaved on the Sunday. Mr. Ward did not then say that he had lost any brooch or pin. He seemed very much agitated, and said he would have him taken up.</p>
               <p>MARY BYRNE. The prisoner lodged in my house for three weeks. He brought me a pin and a ring and said they had been made a present to him by a gentleman; he said he did not want such things, and I might have them for a pound; I told him I had a friend who might like to buy them; I would shew them to her, and if she did not like them, I would return them to him. I afterwards delivered the property to Mr. Smith, at the police office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ward. Re-examined. Q. Upon your oath, did the prisoner take it without your knowledge - A.Upon my oath he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you not to mention it - A. I did not mention it.</p>
               <p>Q. And how came you to tell us that which is totally inconsistent that you lent this man twenty shillings - A. I did lend him twenty shillings, with a promise that he would pay me again.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mrs. Taylor, I am about fourteen or fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever taken an oath before? - Never before this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the nature of an oath? What will become of you if you speak false? Have you ever learned your catechism? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never learned where lyars go? - They go to Hell.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you expect punishment in another world if you don't speak the truth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Now mind and speak the truth. You say you are an apprentice to Mrs. Taylor? - I am; Bromfield was a journeyman there; the prisoner he asked me for some hair, I believe it was one Tuesday night, a month or two ago, to make a brush; I told my mistress of it, that Bromfeild had asked me, and my mistress told me to give him some; I gave them to him, and I saw him put the hairs under his apron about a pound.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Taylor. What is a pound worth? - Two shillings and six-pence.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100013"></xptr>Thompson. He offered me a penny for my trouble for giving him these hairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to ask you? - He could not get at them cleverly himself, he wanted the little lilly white.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Taylor. This boy is committed to your care, and I think you are extremely wanting in the duty you owe to him, and the public, not to have taught him the first rudiments of religion. If this boy should fail in his future passages through life, I think a great deal will be imputable to you.</p>

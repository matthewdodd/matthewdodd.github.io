               <p>and said to the policeman, "I charge this man with felony"—the prisoner then said, "I did not steal your chest of tea"—I had said nothing about tea, I could hardly identify him, as he was in a different garb to when in my employ, but I have no doubt now that he is the man—since he left me I have paid Clark and Roe the value of the chest of tea, by a running ac<lb></lb>count of more than treble the value—I have debited myself to the amount of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is the general custom of the trade to be responsible for the value of the goods which carmen have to deliver.</p>

Oliver, Baldock, a box, and two small boxes—I directed him to deliver them at the Horse-shoe, Goswell-street—that made three packages to be delivered there, a chest of congou, a box of twankey, and two caddies containing tea, which were corded together—he was to book them as three packages—I agreed with him as to the number of packages before he took them away—he said there were twenty-three after counting them, distinctly.</p>

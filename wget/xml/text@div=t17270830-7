             thus depos'd, About six Weeks since I was standing by Charing-Cross, and the Prisoners came up to me and asked if I would go with them to steal some Fowls, to which I soon consented, but before we went about it, we, though we had no no Money went to an Alehouse and drank heartily, and crept out of a back Door to be clear of the Reckoning: After this we went to the White-House at Marybone, where Boother said they had Fowls for she had made Hay there but there was furniz'd,  a Servant calling out from the House to Boother by his Name; from thence we went to the Prosecutor's, which is not far from thence, and took some Fowls: Before we broke open the House we began upon the Windows; for finding a Stool we broke off the Feet, and with them made the Glass fly about heartily; after this we soon got in, and I beat the Maid because she had no Money, and an old Woman I beat who gave me a Shilling, which was all I had out of the Room, only a Shirt I took out of a Box: In the mean Time the Prisoners at the Bar were rifling the Rooms below Stairs, and taking the Goods mentioned in the Indictment.</p>

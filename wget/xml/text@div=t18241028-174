The prisoner was employed by me on the 12th of July, to collect some small accounts; I paid him a commission on the accounts which he collected - but no weekly salary; he was not employed by any other person at that time; he had 5 per cent. for some sums, and 2 1/2 per cent, for others - he did not take orders. I had a customer of the name of Woodward; the prisoner was to bring the amounts to me as soon as he received them - it was so understood - but there was no regular agreement.</p>

               <p>MR. DAWSON re-examined. I heard about a week or ten days afterwards that this money had been paid, and asked the prisoner about it; he said he had received it, but had had a misfortune in the street, and fell down in a fit and lost it.</p>

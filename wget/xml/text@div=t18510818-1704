                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother Francis, a jeweller, of 40, Cornhill. On 14th June the prisoner came to our shop about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and asked to see some gold bracelets—he selected one at 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and requested me to send it to his office, 8, White Lion-court, Cornhill, as he said he had to go on Change—he said he knew my brother, that he had been a customer of ours, and he would either return me the bracelet on Monday morning or give me a check for the amount—on the following Thursday I called on him at his office for the amount—he said the bracelet was very much approved of, and be would give me a check on Saturday for it—I heard nothing of him on the Saturday—on Monday I called on him again, and he said he would send me a check over directly, but I must let him have an invoice of the article—he followed me home—I was engaged with some customers, and to get rid of him I gave him an invoice—I should not have parted with the bracelet if he had not represented that my brother knew him, and that he had been a customer before.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

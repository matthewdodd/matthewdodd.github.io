Thompson" and "Jacob Elwood," said "Do you know anything of these?"—he said "Yes, that is my writing," pointing to the endorsement—he also said "Mead gave them to me and told me what names and addresses to write upon them. He sometimes used to give me half a sovereign. I understood they were proceeds of a betting transaction." He also said that Mead told him to get them changed at the Bank of England, and what names and addresses to write upon them—I then asked him if Mead had ever given him any other notes to get changed at the Bank of England—he replied "Yes, and he told me what names and addresses to write upon them"—I asked him if a portmanteau which was in the room was Mead's—he said "Yes, he sent it to my house"—I said, "Did you know it was coming?"—he replied, "Yes, he sent me a telegram to say that it was coming"—Mead was then in another room.</p>

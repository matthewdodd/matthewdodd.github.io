On the night of 29th July, I was at the Dolphin, at Sydenham, and saw the prisoner there—she followed me out, and asked if I was going to have anything to drink at the Bell—I refused—she said she would stand a quartern of gin and cloves; I went in with her, and we had some—when I left the Dolphin I had one sovereign and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a bag in my waistcoat pocket—the prisoner was with me when I put it into my pocket, in front of the bar—I was not the worse for liquor when I left the Dolphin, but I was before I left the Bell—when I left the Bell I immediately fell down outside the door—I came to myself in about an hour, and missed my money—this is my bag—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On 29th July, I was on duty at Bell-green, and saw Miller lying on his back drunk, with his head on the prisoner's lap—there was a little girl with her, who she said was her daughter—I asked who he was; the prisoner said he was a friend of her's, and she was trying to get him home—I said I would assist in getting him up—she said there was no occasion for that, and put 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my hand, which I re<lb></lb>fused taking—I helped to get him up, and asked if he had a watch or any money—he said "Money"—he looked, said he was robbed, and said he had been picked up by the prisoner—I asked him if he knew her; he said, "No."—he told me not to let her go—I took her to the station, and as we were going, she said, "Policeman, I do not know what money I have on me; I have two sovereigns of Mrs. Dickens my sister"—next day, as I was taking her before the Magistrate, she asked what I was taking her for—I said for stealing a bag and money—she said it was false—I produce a canvass bag which I received from Mrs. Amer, and one sovereign and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Philcox.</p>

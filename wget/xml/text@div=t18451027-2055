                  </hi>. I am a sculptor, and partially employed for Mr. Pietro Pizzala, who is also a sculptor, and dealer in Italian alabaster, living at No. 91, Quadrant—it is his dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. James, Westminster. I know this engraving and frame to be his—I brought it from Rome for him fifteen months ago—I saw it safe on the 1st of Oct., about eleven o'clock in the morning, at the end of the passage—it is worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I saw the prisoner in Whitcomb-street, Hay-market, with this engraving—I followed, and stopped him—I asked where he got it from—he said, "At No. 91 in the Quadrant"—I took him into custody, and afterwards found the owner.</p>

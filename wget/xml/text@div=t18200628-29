            . I live in Leather-sellers'-buildings, London-wall. On the 22d of May, about half-past one o'clock at night, I was rather intoxicated, and met the prisoner on the Pavement in Moorfields. I walked to <placeName id="t18200628-29-crimeloc164">Golden-lane</placeName>

She asked me for money for gin, I gave her 6 d. and a few halfpence. Immediately she left I missed my money from breeches-pocket. I followed and asked her for my money, she said she had none - the watchman then came up, I gave her in charge, and described the money before they searched her. She said she had no crown piece - she pulled a crown piece from her pocket, and then said it was a bad one.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard a noise up Lion-court, and went up, the prosecutor said the prisoner had stolen his money, she said she had none of his money. I took her to the watch-house. He said,</p>
               <p>"Before you search her I will tell you what I lost," and described the money. I took a crown piece out of her lap; she produced a half-crown, three shillings, and three sixpences.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BALL. I am a servant to Mr. Austin. On the 9th of April Mr Austin gave me orders to watch the prisoner; about five o'clock the prisoner went out at the back gates, I followed him into Ray-street. Clerkenwell; I saw him come out of an old iron shop; I went in and demanded the metal which he had sold; the woman said she had not bought the metal. that he had it in his hand; I went out of the shop and laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the metal in his hand - A. Yes, wrapped up in brown paper; I collared him and brought him a few yards off the door, Mortimer throwed him and I took part of the metal from him; he said it was his metal; he did not fear going back to Mr. Austin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took this metal by the pound, whatever was wasted I was to make it good when we came to a settlement.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He was to account to me for the waste; this is not waste, I know it by the shape of the ingot.</p>

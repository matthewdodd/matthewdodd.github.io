            , junior.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in your shop in the month of December last - A. On the 9th of December in the evening, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner came in the shop; when he first came in I was not in the place; I was called into the shop, and then I saw the prisoner in the shop: I am perfectly certain the prisoner is the person, though he is differently dressed now; he said he wanted something of a diamond broach and a ring; I then showed him the assortment we had; he could not suit himself, and said he was going out of town; I said if he would call again in about forty minutes I would endeavour to shew him some more; he then went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your son continue all the time the prisoner was in the shop - A. Not the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any of the goods after the prisoner went away - A. Not at this time; we missed them the next morning. The prisoner returned in about forty minutes, I was in the shop; he then looked at several articles that I procured, there was none that quite suited his mind, he wanted something of a cluster of diamonds; there were none that suited him; my son made a drawing of one that he thought would suit him; he then went away without purchasing of any thing. The next morning we missed a double row diamond half hoop ring, a pearl and amethyst broach, an amethyst and serpent ring, a diamond and chased, and a diamond ring; that was for hair; that is four articles; we advertised them by hand bills. I did not see them till the prisoner was taken to Bow street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the articles you have mentioned were in the shop at the time the prisoner was there - A. Yes. When he came into our shop he had his hair very neatly powdered, and appeared very much like a gentleman; wore an eye glass; he was vastly clean; I never suspected a person less than him, and he wore whiskers then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Have you any other partner besides your son - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any other name besides Matthias - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150022"></xptr>Q. A considerable part of the time the prisoner was in your shop, Mrs. Bilger was there - A. The first time she was in the shop, but when my son came down she went away.</p>
               <p>Q. She was there at the time the prisoner was there a second time - A. She was in the parlour behind the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Which room is all open to the shop - A. Yes, there is only a curtain.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any shopman besides - A. We have a porter, he was in the shop, the furthest part off.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your son here - A. He is.</p>

               <p>Q. What articles are here that you know are yours - A. There are two rings; I missed them the next morning; that was at the time my son was going to return the articles that we had borrowed. When he came in the last time and saw the articles that we had borrowed, then them rings were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. The rings that were missed the next morning, were they missed by your son or by you - A. By us both. When we found one article missing, then we searched over the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon did you miss any of your goods - A. On the next morning we missed a pearl amethyst broach, a double row brilliant half hoop ring, a rose diamond, and amethyst cluster ring, a ring for hair, with brilliants round.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. I live in Brydges' street, Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the man at the bar - A. I do. On the 15th of December he left a ring with a coloured stone, I advanced him three guineas upon it. On the next day, a hand bill from Bow street came in, I carried them forward. I have a double cluster ring that I took in of a female, on the 10th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner at any time about that ring that was brought by the woman - A. I had. On the 14th of December I had a conversation with the prisoner about this ring; I then asked him whether his lady, a few days before (I supposed the woman to be his wife) had not pledged a ring for five guineas; I supposed him to be the husband of the female who left the ring; to which he seemed surprized.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was that ring pledged for five guineas - A. It was; the prisoner, I think, came the next day, at the time he left this ring with me; he then said that he had made enquiries at home, and learned that the ring which I had mentioned the day before, was left by his wife, and enquired the reason for my asking the question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Did he describe the ring - A. No, he did not; he only said the other ring. I lent three guineas on the ring the prisoner brought; I suppose that is near the value of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bilger, senior. Look at that ring, and tell me whether that is your property - A. I am quite certain of this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It is one of the rings that you borrowed - A. No, I have had it a considerable time; it is an article that was bought, and then I had it altered; it was done to my own fancy; I could almost venture to say there could not be another like it</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews, to Bilger junior. Look at that ring, and say whether it is your property - A. I a can venture to say, I am positive that it is my father's property. It is an amethyst and rose diamond ring.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You did not work upon it, did you - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>MR. BRUCHART. I am a working jeweller and diamond merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that ring that is produced - A. I do; I made it for my own stock, as I supply shopkeepers. It is a double row brilliant half hoop ring; I manufactured it. On the 9th of December Mr. Bilger, the elder, called on me between six and seven o'clock; he borrowed that ring of me with several others.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Bilger, the elder, has swore that he saw no more of me after I was in the shop that night, till I was apprehended. He swore at Bow street, that I came again on the Monday night, which was the 12th of December, to look at some articles.</p>
               <p>COURT. No such thing - I have got the examination.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I said, I did not see the articles till I saw them at Bow street; I saw the prisoner; he came again on the Tuesday afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it he came first - A. It was on a Friday, and he came on the Tuesday after; he wanted to know the estimate of the ring; that a drawing of was shewed him; however he wanted to see some watches, and he wished also to see some loose diamonds, not set. I have another son, that son went out because he know of the robbery; I thought that my son went for a constable in order to stop him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send him - A. No; then he had measure taken of his finger, and left directions; he called himself Mr. Deacon, No. 13, Cursell street, May fair; that is the direction I took from his own mouth; he left us without purchasing any thing; giving the order I went to the house, it proved to be an empty house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to stop him - A. I had a doubt in my own mind what to do; my son went out and observed an accomplice; that son is not here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

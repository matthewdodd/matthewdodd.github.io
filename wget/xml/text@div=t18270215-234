Last Friday evening I was returning to my shop, and saw the prisoner going out with a pair of boots; I asked what he wanted - he said he came from Mr. Brown, of Windmill-street; I let him go, and then spoke to my lad, who missed something; I gave an alarm, and the prisoner ran away, through a passage which leads into the Strand - I saw him in the custody of Miles in three minutes; the boots were dropped in the court - I heard them fall just as he turned into the court - I picked up one.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner running down the court, and several people pursuing; I took him, and Jenkins said he was the man, and produced one of the boots; I had not seen him drop them - Mr. Jenkins came up directly - he was running from the cry.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

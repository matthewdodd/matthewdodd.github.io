On the 1st of August I saw the prisoner come from a silversmith's shop in High-street, Marylebone—in consequence of what the silversmith told me I followed the prisoner to Tottenham-court-road—he stopped at four or five silversmiths' shops and pawnbroker's—I stopped him, and asked where he had got those spectacles which he had been offering for sale—he said he found them in Oxford-street—he drew them from his pocket and showed them to me—I requested him to come to the station-house, and he went willingly—he was asked where he lived—he said, "At Mr. Mangles, in Wimpole-street"—I went there, but he had left there about three weeks—I took him again on the Tuesday following, and told him the spectacles were stolen from Mrs. Mangles—he said it was not true, he had found them, but it was ail right, for Mrs. Mangles would not appear against him.</p>

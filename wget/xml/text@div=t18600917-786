               <p>—he crossed over the road to Simpson, who was standing there, and gave it I to her—they both walked on together, turned into Jewin-street, and then into Wells-street, where they stopped, and Simpson gare Spiller some money—he then took this parcel from his pocket and handed it to her—I followed them to a public-house—they came out, went into St. Martin's-le-grand, and I separated—Simpson ran across the street into Little Britain—I stopped her there with the parcel under her left arm—I said, "I am an officer; you I received that parcel from a young man"—she said, "I have not"—I said, "What is in the parcel?"—she laid, a dozen pairs of stockings, which were for her own use, and that she had given 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—she appeared very much agitated, turned very pale, and could hardly speak—she said, "I have I been led into this; I am very sorry for it"—I said, "You have given some money for it?"—she said, "I gave him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I made it up with halfpence"—I said, "You have received also another parcel?" and she produced this other parcel from under her shawl, containing two pairs of ladies' gloves and a piece of silk braid—she said she was very-sorry at being placed in this position, but she had been led into it—I took her to the station and found in the bundle twelve pairs of stockings and five pairs of socks—she was searched by the female searcher'—I then went to Messrs. Bagallays and gave information, and took Spiller—Simpson gave her address, 4, John's-lane, Smithfield-bars, and said she was a widow—I went there and made a search—no one occupied the room but hersalf her husband, and the sister.</p>

I am a partner in the firm of John Bagallay and others of Aldermanbury—Spiller was our porter—I believe I these stockings, socks, and braid produced to be our's—we have goods precisely similar in stock, and I have no doubt they form part of it—this piece of paper with the manufacturer's mark upon it is exactly the same as we keep—we occasionally have packets of less than half a dozen goods—I can say that this single pair of sucks and the five pairs in the paper came from the same paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I was servant to Sir Jonathan Wathen Waller. On the 25th of September I saw all the fowls alive in the yard—there were some chickens in a house there—there were nine found on the prisoner, and one killed, and left on the premises—I saw them safe on Sunday after<lb></lb>noon, the 25th of September.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police sergeant. On the night of the 25th of September, I was on duty at Sir Jonathan Wathen Waller's—I saw four men on the premises—they went into the rick-yard—I heard a fowl make a noise—I saw two men come out, and pace backwards and forwards, then go into the yard again—I then heard a dog make a noise, and saw four men come out, and run down a meadow till they came to some walnut trees—I ran down another meadow till I came near where they were—one went up the tree, and began to shake down the walnuts—the other three began to pick them up—I got to a gate, about forty yards from them—the prisoner and another ran away—I pursued, and took the prisoner, and took him back to the walnut tree, and in his jacket pocket, which was lying under the tree, I found nine fowls—he claimed the jacket, and wore it afterwards before the Magistrate.</p>

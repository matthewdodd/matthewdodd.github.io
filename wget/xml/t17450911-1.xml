               <p>Mary Pound. The Prisoner lodged in the next room to me in Mr. Walker's house, about four nights; when she was going away from her lodging, she asked me leave to go into my room for a handkerchief, and then she robbed me of these things and money. I found her in London with my stockings and shift on; I pressed her to confess, but she would not own any thing, but before the Justice she owned the taking of the goods and money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I submit myself to the mercy of the Court. The pawnbroker wronged me of 3 l. 12 s. in the money, or it would all have been made up.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The pawnbroker gave me but 36 s. for each of the 3 l. 12 s. pieces.</p>

She said, she had pawned these two rings to Mr. Tucker, and there was a dispute between him and her, as if she had not pawned them at all: there was Mrs. Pound's silk purse with about twenty guineas in it; and Mrs. Pound said, she had two three pound twelve shilling pieces in it: said I to Mr. Tucker, Did you ever see this purse? Yes, he said; said, I, Did you ever see this leathern purse? Yes, he said, and he believed there were about 17 guineas in it. Mrs Pound said, she had two three pound twelve shilling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174509110003"></xptr> pieces in the purse; said I to the pawnbroker , How could you take these two gold rings in to pawn, when you saw this purse, and so much money in it?</p>

               <p>Wright. Yes. When I asked him about the Rings, he said he had none, till he saw the Prisoner, and she said she had given him a three pound twelve shilling piece to take twenty six shillings and four pence out of, which was owing for things the Prisoner had in pawn. She said he weighed the piece against another piece, and said it was a thirty six shilling piece, and that he said it was very pretty money, and said, have you got any more of them; and she said she had another.

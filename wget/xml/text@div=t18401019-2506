                  </hi>. I am a ship-chandler, and five in Lime-house. I was going my nearest way home from Tower-hill—I was a little the worse for liquor, but I could take care of myself—these women accosted me in the street, and got into conversation—they came out of a house, and said they had been very ill-used, and begged I would treat them—I said I would do so if I could find a house open—they directed me to the house of a Mr. Hall, in Rosemary-lane—I treated them to a few glasses of wine—I staid about three quarters of an hour—I asked a policeman which was the best way home—he directed me—the prisoners followed me, took hold of my arm, they insisted on seeing me part of the way, and wanted me to go somewhere with them—I said, "I will not, I am captain of a ship, and want to sail to-morrow morning"—I said that for the purpose of getting rid of them—I had a yellow canvas bag, containing a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and eleven sovereigns, in my right-side breeches' pocket—when I came towards Can<lb></lb>non-street road they endeavoured to take liberties with me—I resisted it—they were one on each side of me when the robbery was committed—I am almost positive that Box put her hand into my pocket, and took the bag, and handed it to Hennessey—Box said directly, "Will you go with me?"—I said, "No"—they went away, and I was glad to get rid of them—I put my hands in my pockets to walk, as I usually do, and missed my money—I called out "Police," and the policeman came—I am quite sure the prisoners are the girls—I have not recovered my money.</p>

               <p>much—I had been in very respectable company—we had had a few bottles of wine in a company of seven—I cannot state the quantity—it was nothing but wine—there might be some beer at meals—I had not drank any thing after dinner—I do not know what time I dined—I drank no spirits at supper—nor punch—I had supper at a public-house—I was in the public-house about three quarters of an hour—I drank about three glasses of sherry there, and a bottle of ginger beer, nothing else—I gave the women the same, except the ginger-beer, but I do not know what I paid—I did not describe to any body what these young women had on their heads, be<lb></lb>cause I was not asked—Kidner told the Magistrate one had a bonnet on, and the other a cap with a shawl—if the policeman says I was drunk he must be wrong—I have not said that I believe Box put her hand into my pocket—I do not know where Pell-street is—I did not call for three glasses of wine in a house where the lady had no wine to give me—I did not call for three glasses of brandy—I was quite sober when I told them that I have been a captain.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Hampshire Hog public-house, Rosemary-lane. Mr. Olander came to my house with the prisoners—he had four glasses of wine—he treated them—he remained there ten minutes and then went out again—he took out a canvas bag, and I saw a quantity of sove<lb></lb>reigns and a Bank note—they then all went out together, came in a second time, and had a glass of wine each—the prosecutor paid half a crown each time—the third time he gave me a sovereign—I gave him four half-crowns and eight shillings, which he put into the bag in his pocket.</p>

On the night of the 25th of September, I saw the two prisoners walking with the prosecutor in Cable-street—they went towards the Commercial-road—the next time I saw the prisoners was about half-past one o'clock—they were then kicking up a row at Mr. Hall's doors—I asked what was the matter—they said that the landlord had a sovereign of a gentleman—the landlord came out, and while the prisoners were wrangling with him the prosecutor came up—the pri<lb></lb>mers said, "Here is the gentleman, he will tell you all about it"—I said to the prosecutor, "Are you satisfied that this publican has not got a sove<lb></lb>reign of yours?"—he said, "I am, it is all right"—he then asked the way to Limehouse—I directed him, and drove the prisoners on the other side of the way—they then crossed and followed him.</p>

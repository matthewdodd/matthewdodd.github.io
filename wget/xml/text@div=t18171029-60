On the 8th of October, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the parlour behind the shop-the street - door is kept open; I thought I heard somebody fall on the bed-room floor, which is up stairs; the key of the bed-room hung in the parlour. In about ten minutes after I heard somebody come down stairs - I opened the parlour-door and saw the back of a man going out - I immediately ran out, and saw the prisoner, two doors off, with two large bundles; I ran up to the bed-room and found it unlocked, apparently with a key, and one of my drawers, which had been locked before, was open and quite empty; I ran out and saw the prisoner in the middle of Gray's-Inn-square with the bundles, and secured him immediately; they contained the articles stated in the indictment. My husband was out at the time-the things are worth more than 6l.</p>

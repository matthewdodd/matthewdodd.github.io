            . I am an unfortunate girl. On the 24th of April I was in Albany-street, Regent's-park, between one and two in the morning, with a companion - the prisoner spoke to my companion in Portland-place, and he walked from there up to the New-road with us both, but he did not say anything to me till he got to Albany-street; he then spoke to me, and my companion went home - he engaged to go home with me, and we walked together towards my house in Clarence-gardens - when we got to <placeName id="t18330516-23-crimeloc113">Frederick-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18330516-23-crimeloc113" type="placeName" value="Frederick-street"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What kind of a night was it? A. It was a fair morning - I am quite positive the prisoner is the man; he was talking to my companion first; but she is not here - she was not at the police-office - she had as good an opportunity of seeing him as I had - I saw her last night; she lives in the house I do - she did not know that she was required to come here - the prisoner was searched in my presence, and two sovereigns, one half crown, and one sixpence were found on him - I had never seen him before; he denied having seen my purse - I have not seen his wife, nor sent any message to her - I did not say before the magistrate that I gave the prisoner my purse.</p>

             (police-constable, S. 69). I was on duty in William-street; I was called to take the prisoner for robbing her of her purse and 4 shillings; he was running - when I first saw him he ran by me, but he afterwards walked and stopped when I called to him - I found on him two sovereigns, one half-crown, one sixpence, fourpence in copper, seven new silk handkerchiefs, and two phials of spirits.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far from where you saw a person running, did you take the prisoner walking? A. I suppose about forty yards - I had my police dress on; the prisoner could see it no doubt; he must have known that the prosecutrix was running after him - I did not hear any alarm - the prisoner gave his right address; I went there by his direction - I saw his wife, but she would not have the medicine.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How far did he run after you called to him to stop? A. I called to him to stop, and then he walked five or six yards.</p>

             (police-sergeant, S. 12). When the prosecutrix left the watch-house, I went with her to the spot where the prisoner had been stopped, and I found this purse about ten yards from the place, there are 4 shillings in it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been down to the Borough, and then went to spend the evening with a friend named Adams - I was then going home, and met a tradesman who promised me a ticket to see the Zoological-gardens; I walked a few paces with him - I was then stepping down William-street, and met the policeman who took me - the prosecutrix charged me with robbing her; I said "It is no such thing; I have not seen you" - I stated at the police-office where I lived, and they went and frightened my wife, and asked her to describe my dress which she could not do - and the officer came back and said I had given a wrong address; but he went at eight o'clock, and found it was right - I bought these handkerchiefs at Morrison's, and my mistress went there and found my name entered in their book, but they could not tell who served me.</p>

I keep the Gladstone beerhouse, Spring Place, Wands<lb></lb>worth Road—on Saturday night, the 22nd May, about 11.30, the prisoner came to my bar with another man—I served the other man with a pint of four ale—I saw the shilling on the counter when I put down the beer—I took it up and was going to put it in the till; I felt it was smooth—I gave the change—I tried the shilling; I found it was bad—I went back to the bar where the prisoner was standing, and found both the men had gone—a quarter of the beer was consumed—I jumped over the counter without speaking to any one—I saw the prisoner about 15 yards from the house; he</p>

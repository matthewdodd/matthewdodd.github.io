I have employed the prisoner on two different errands; on the 19th of August I employed him to pledge a table and a carpet for me, at Bird and Haslop's, in Long-acre, he took them and brought me back the money - I told him probably I should have to employ him to pledge me a sofa, but never told him to do it - I did not mention any time when I should probably want it pledged - I gave him no authority whatever to take the sofa and pawn it - he gave me the money for the table and carpet at my house - I left him at the house and went away; I left his sister with him, in care of my house, and there was another person in the house; that was at a quarter before twelve o'clock in the morning - I went to Mr. Wooller, a solicitor, on business - I did not return home myself till between eleven and twelve o'clock at night - he was not there then; I missed the sofa, which was worth 10l., it was in the house when I went away in the morning - I had given him no authority whatever to take it; he brought me no money that day, nor at any time after - next morning I made inquiry about him; I found it, I believe on the Thursday following, pawned at Bird and Haslop's Long-acre.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Bird and Haslop, pawnbrokers, Long-acre - Miss Summers came to my house and claimed a sofa, about the Thursday - I was present when the prisoner brought it to our shop on the 20th of August, he made no remark to me; I did not give him the money; I received the sofa from him, and took it part of the way up stairs - I did not see him receive any money for it; he had a boy to assist him to bring it- Mr. Bird tapped at the window, and told me to receive the sofa at the private door, which I did - I did not hear what passed between him and the prisoner; I did not return to the shop - Mr. Bird is not here - the sofa is worth 8l. - it was about two o'clock in the day; he appeared perfectly sober; he assisted me part of the way up stairs with it.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody on the 26th of August - I questioned him about the sofa, he said he had got tipsy on the same night as he pawned the article, his words were, "Why, policeman, I pawned the sofa."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was employed for the express purpose, to pledge every thing in Miss Summers' apartments, as she wished to quit her apartments - I was to get the goods out in the most secret way I possibly could; I first took the carpet and pawned; afterwards the table, and gave the money to her - she led me to suppose I was to pawn every thing in the apartments in the most secret way possible; and I next took the sofa, but before I took it they gave me three or four glasses of gin in the house, and when I got to the pawnbroker's with the sofa I felt rather warm, and a little elevated - I came out and had two or three more glasses; I became so stupified I was completely lost, and what money I did not spend I was either robbed of or lost - I was to have gone next day, with the chairs and the bed.</p>

            . I received this letter; I never saw the prisoner write, but he has acknowledged that he sent it to me - I received it the day his mother gave him in charge - he said he had sent it to me before he was taken; but I did not receive it till he was in custody: a man brought it to me - I gave the prisoner no liquor.</p>
               <p>The letter being read, expressed the prisoner's regret at not having brought the prosecutrix the produce of the sofa, and stated that he had lost it when in a state of intoxication.</p>

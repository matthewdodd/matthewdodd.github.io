These books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my father's—I know them by private marks, and by their being soiled—on 30th Nov., about half-past ten o'clock, I went into the parlour at the back of the shop, came out again, and saw the prisoner run out of the shop with the books under his arm—I had seen them safe two or three minutes before—I saw him in custody two hours after—he was alone—I am sure be in the man—I had never seen him before.</p>

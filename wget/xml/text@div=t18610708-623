                  </hi>. I am the wife of George White, who keeps the Golden Lion in Kent-street, St. Mary, Newington—on 17th June I saw Frazier in our house several times during the day—I saw Gillard about 7 o'clock in the evening—the last time I saw Mrs. Frazier was from 11 to 12 o'clock—she had Gillard with her the last time—she was in in the evening once with Gillard—he was only in in the evening once, but he was in the last time between 11 and 12 o'clock—on that evening I had a sum of money in the house—it was kept in a box, in a dark room at the side of my bed-room—as we go past our passage the room is facing the staircase—there was more silver in value than gold—the silver was done out in pounds' worth—the gold was wrapped up, except one parcel in the cash-box which had a little loose silver with it—the money was all wrapped up in newspaper—I last saw it safe on Monday afternoon, the 17th, from 3 to 4 o'clock, as near as possible—I did not count it at all at any later period of the day—I went up in my bed-room as late as 10 o'clock that night—my premises were then perfectly safe, and the box also—the window was not fastened, but it was shut—the blind was down—at five minutes to 1, on the following morning, I received some information, in consequence of which I entered my bed-room—I then saw that one of the two top drawers had been broken open—the window was wide open, and the dressing-glass on the floor—the blind was not drawn up, but was gathered up as if done by the window being opened—the two top drawers were put on my bed—the clothes were scattered about the room, and part of Mr. White's clothing was placed on the window-ledge—I went direct to where the money was put, and I missed 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it—the box was not gone, it was broken open—there had been some copper coin amongst the money—one penny-piece of a particular description—there was nothing else that I have seen that I can swear to.</p>

I first received information of this robbery on 22d June, in consequence of which I went to the house of the prisoner Driscoll on the 24th—I found her at home—I said, "What money have you got in the house?"—she said, "Very little"—I said, "How much have you got in that drawer?" pointing to the bottom drawer of a chest of drawers—I had received information which induced me to point to that drawer—she said, "Well, there is some gold in there that belongs to myself, and a quantity of silver and halfpence that belong to my daughter; I do not know what amount there is"—I searched the drawer and found 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver and halfpence—I put the money on the table and sent for Mrs. White, who was only next door—she looked over the money and picked out this foreign copper coin, and said, "This piece I can swear to, I have put it separate with other money in the box where they stole it from"—there was also this other foreign coin amongst the halfpence—she said, "This, I believe, was my property, but I cannot swear to it."</p>

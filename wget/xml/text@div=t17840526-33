            's testimony.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever had any answer to that letter? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bearcroft. My Lord, as this application will be attended with very great consequence to the prisoner at the bar, I beg leave to resist it at large. I take it, that the first principles on which any trial of importance can be put off, and there cannot be a trial of greater importance than this, are these. First: that there should have been due diligence on the part of the prosecution to procure and to compel the attendance of the material witness; but when that case is laid down and proved, that alone I contend is not sufficient, for your Lordship ought to see clearly, upon the face of the affidavit upon which the application is made, that the witness will attend at the time to which the trial is meant to be put off: now the circumstances attending this case, and which shew there has not been due diligence, strike me very strongly; and they are these: the prisoner was fully committed six weeks ago, the nature of the charge perfectly understood, the witnesses were on the back of the bill, they were officers some of them superior and some inferror to this lieutenant that is absent; prima facie, therefore, it appears that they know as much of the matter as he can know. My Lord, in the first place, I say there has not been due diligence, nor any thing like it, for although the prisoner has been committed five weeks before Monday last, yet then first it appears by the affidavit, that the solicitor for the prosecution applies for the purpose of getting at this witness, not only a material witness, but as they state him, much more material than these on the back of the bill; now, with respect to the matter of diligence, is it not incumbent on them to apply all their diligence, and to search after the most material witnesses; I have a right to suppose him the most material witness, and a witness without whom they cannot go on: shall it be indured, suppose it should be followed by any thing serious to a prisoner that is to be tried for his life, that the solicitor for the prosecution chuses to sleep for five weeks: I trust, therefore, that I stand on firm and sure ground, when I say, I have pointed out to your Lordship a want of diligence, even as to the time of enquiring after him, for my proposition is this, that it was gross neglect and want of due diligence in Mr. Baxter not to find him out before; I have a right to say that in argument, and Mr. Baxter will excuse me, though in general it is what he is not guilty of; I say it was gross neglect that he did not think of going after this witness till Monday last: but that is not all, he knew where he was, why did not he send express after him? Why did not he send a subpoena after him? What, in a prosecution of this sorttod pend on a message from a servant! and then take no more trouble than to scribble a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260060"></xptr> letter into Warwickshire to this witness! Why there is not an attorney in the parish that cannot tell him, that he need not regard it: and the prosecution can afford it, there is no difficulty in point of expence; he should have sent down his clerk express with a subpoena, for the purpose of finding out this man, if he was above ground, to have served that subpoena, and to have intimated to the witness the necessity of his attending, and the nature and importance of his evidence. What is the next circumstance? The next circumstance is, that your Lordship must be satisfied on the face of their affidavit, that there is a plain case, and that the object that is now applied for, will be obtained by putting off the trial. Now, my Lord, permit me to ask, does such a thing appear? What does it amount to? Why it amounts to this, perhaps he may come. Why, what a number of perhaps's there are! perhaps he may be at the place where the servant says he is, perhaps he may not, perhaps he may be on a visit, perhaps the letter may not have reached him, perhaps he is not well, perhaps he is engaged on material business, perhaps he is not rich enough to pay for a post-chaise, for they have not even sent down money to pay it; and I venture to say, that if they had gone the length of sending down a subpoena, which they have not, I say that this subpoena, without a tender of the expences, would not have been sufficient: Can this be called due diligence? I have suggested that he may have taken advice about it, and may have earned, that he is not bound to come: it is not too much to suppose this, it would not disgrace any man; if the solicitor of the excise was to send me the civilest entreaty possible, in a case of blood, if he did not send me the compulsory process, I would not come. Your Lordship sees it amounts to nothing more than bare possibility; by possibility he may be here on Monday, and you are to do - what? Now I come to my objection; and I say you are to do not only a possible, but a certain injustice and hardship to the defendant, to give the chance of a witness coming for the prosecution, and to indulge the idleness of the attorney. Now I will state the injustice to the defendant, and we will make affidavit of it, if necessary: we have witnesses of the first character and reputation in the city, and some of much higher rank at the other end of the town, and as this is a charge against a man of high credit and reputation, and great substance in the city, many of these witnesses to my certain knowledge, relying on my brief, are to speak to something besides the character of the prisoner at the bar; something which will go to his acquittal, besides his general character, though his general character is in this case a matter of the utmost importance; and to put this trial off till Monday upon such flimsy reasons as these! and for us to lose the testimony of such witnesses as these! -</p>

            , Esq.</p>
               <p>Court. I should imagine this letter must have been received at Tamworth on Tuesday night, or early on Wednesday morning, on Wednesday it might have been answered, and a letter here on Friday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bearcroft. It is sufficient, I submit the uncertainty of it, but I argue also from the presumption that he will not come. Has he desired him to come in a post-chaise? Has he told him he would pay his expences? I say then the suggestion is, that by possibility he may come; I say the presumption is, that he will not; and in such a case as this, if I lose only six witnesses, what may be the consequence? Will your Lordship be measuring with compasses the extent of evidence? - It cannot be. It is impossible that any man who is used to these kind of prosecutions, but must know that even the loosest evidence that can be give, that relates to the charge, may be a circumstance in the scale of justice that may save my client's life; and you must see it is extremely likely we may lose many witnesses. My answer therefore to the affidavit is this, that upon the face of it, it appears there has not been due legal diligence; there has been a great many neglects, and it does not appear that the witnesses will come; and the presumption is, that he will not: and to put this trial off, would be doing great injustice to my client; nor does it seem to me, but the fact they propose to prove by this witness, may be proved by the others: under these circumstances, my Lord, I hope, on the part of the prisoner at the bar, that you will not put off this trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lee. I must trouble your Lordship with a few words on the same side, and I beg to observe, that the observations which have been offered, appear to me to be substantial and unanswerable. I cannot help thinking, that this is such an application as never was made to a Court of Justice under the like circumstances: Mr. Baxter who makes the affidavit, and I am persuaded does not mean to impose on the Court in it, I am persuaded that he does not, because the is a man of honour and a man of character most certainly, but he says he takes this man to be a material witness; he does not so much as intimate that he ever saw the man in his life, that he ever conversed with him, that he ever corresponded with him, that he ever made enquiry about him until last Monday; that is the fact as far as can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260063"></xptr> be collected from the affidavit: but on Monday last, by what illuminations Mr. Baxter has not condescended to explain, it comes into his head, that a man that lives at Chiswick of the name of Parr, may of must know something of the matter vastly important; for what reason does he think so? Now is there any reason upon earth, except this, that he was the Lieutenant of the Superbe! and it is pretty singular that he should take upon himself to say so, without having any conversation with him. Material, why? Why, because he is the Lieutenant; and this in a case where the Captain of the same ship and the Mate are at the back of the indictment, where the Master of the same ship is at the back of the indictment, and without an intimation that this man either did or could know any thing of it, that they did not or must not know: but Mr. Baxter says, I mean to tell you in point of candour how this man's evidence is material, I mean to prove that the goods were not delivered to Lieutenant Colonel 
               <persName id="t17840526-33-person367">

            , which were supposed by these papers to be delivered to him. Why, now would you believe, my Lord, that this very Colonel 
               <persName id="t17840526-33-person368">

            , cannot he testify it? or does Mr. Baxter mean to say and insinuate, that Colonel

            's supposed defect in evidence is to be bolstered up by the assistance of this unknown gentleman at Chiswick! I am sure Mr. Baxter does not mean to say, that he thinks Colonel

             will not be believed, unless this Lieutenant of the Superbe is brought here to confirm him. There is no colour nor pretence in my apprehension to suppose that the Gentleman can be material, and they cannot pretend to insinuate that he will. My Lord, I beg leave to say, that to put off a trial on the absence of a material witness, against a defendant in a criminal and capital case, where, if there be any blame, it is all the prosecutor's blame, is perfectly unusual: my Lord, I say it would be blame, and great blame in Mr. Baxter, if it were not that I am fully persuaded it would turn out to be totally immaterial if it is to that fact; if it is to prove that Colonel

             himself whether he did or no, and whose receipt itself is in fact the supposed forgery? It is a gross neglect in my mind not to apply to this man in time, not to furnish the compulsory means of getting him: why your leaving that process is not sufficient, it has been so determined twenty times, that even if he had been subpoened, without tendering him his reasonable charges, the Court would not have granted an attachment against him; it has been determined over and over again. I say, my Lord, there is a moral certainty he will not be here; I know if the letter had been sent to York instead of Tamworth it would have been at York in very good time, at this reason of the year, and that we all know; if he had wrote an answer from York, immediately on the receipt of that letter, it must have been here very early on Thursday: the letter must have got to Tamworth on Tuesday night, it must have been delivered on Wednesday morning early, then he has three days, besides this morning, to come one hundred and twelve miles; why, he might have walked it! and besides, did you ever hear of such a thing, and a prosecution for Government too, with a very considerable number of his Majesty's learned Council, to have it said in a Court of Justice, we have been six days in getting a witness from Tamworth in Staffordshire, and we cannot get a witness one hundred and twelve miles! it is perfectly ridiculous! I will venture to say, my Lord, that in your experience, or that of the other learned Judge, or even of the whole bar, there never was a thing of that kind attempted; therefore, I submit to your Lordship, that there is a notorious clear defect of diligence, and more than that, there is a gross neglect, because, immediately upon finding where he was supposed to be, you should have sent the most expediticus messenger; and I say too, it was the duty of Mr. Baxter, to have told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260064"></xptr> us on the Monday, we cannot go on without this witness; but never to intimate to any human being, that this man existed and was wanted, till the prisoner comes into Court, and then forsooth - why? we cannot try this cause, because in a week's time we have not got a witness from Tamworth! Now the attorney may think, that it may be material to have two, or three, or four witnesses to speak to the same fact, and I know that if he was to swear this ten times over it would not be material; however, I do not enter into that so much, for I rely upon it, that these gentlemen being on the back of the indictment will be quite sufficient.</p>

               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. My Lord, to be sure the principles that Mr. Bearcroft has laid down are indisputable; in the first place, that there must have been all due diligence; in the next place, that there is a high probability that the witness will attend; the application of the principles therefore is the true question between us: and first, as to the witness's materiality; I suppose there is no man living that does not know, that a Lieutenant of a man of war is of much importance on board the ship; much of the detail belongs to him more than to the Captain; and likewise if there were three or four witnesses it is little more than possible that some of them may have been absent on important parts of the day, when we are therefore to account for the whole of the day, we must get such separate witnesses as were present in any local station: if it should so turn out, that these gentlemen who are present were not on board that ship any part of that day, if any of the other officers had been on board at different parts of the day, no man's plain sense can doubt but they may and must be very important witnesses. Mr. Lee observes too, that Colonel 
               <persName id="t17840526-33-person374">
                  Rooke
               <interp inst="t17840526-33-person374" type="given" value="Rooke"></interp>

                  </persName>
             can prove all this: now we conceive it important for us to prove, that no such provisions ever did go on board the ship, as well as to prove that they never did go into the garrison. Now, my Lord, with respect to due diligence being used, this man was about the Admiralty frequently, in the day time he was in London, he used to go to Chiswick in the evening, and we had no doubt of his being to be found at a very short warning, but he went suddenly into Warwickshire: to be sure, in the case of gentlemen of his rank, it is not usual to make a small allowance of money to gentlemen; he may not be in want of a little money, but it would prevent his walking up, my learned friend says; now it could hardly occur to any man of business, that he would not come, and it would as hardly enter into the head of any man of business to use the rigorous and compulsory forms or to offer money; as to all the necessary forms they were used on this occasion, such as saying on the back of the letter, that it was for his Majesty's service; and as to the illumination of finding out that he was a material witness, I do not believe it requires a vast deal of sagacity, much less of inspiration, to suppose that it would be very essential to have the evidence of this gentleman, and he being resident in town, we had not the smallest doubt of finding him, and so much was Mr. Baxter persuaded he should find him, that he has been at his house to day, and left a message to conduct him here if he should come; and I think there is no doubt but Lieutenant 
               <persName id="t17840526-33-person375">
                  Parr

             being a gentleman, and a man of reputation and character, if he did not mean to attend, would have suggested some reason why; the probability is therefore by his silence, that he means to come: and as to the gross neglect in a case where no further delay is desired than till Monday morning, what harm can arise? I am sure, from the respectable appearance of those Noblemen that attend for the prisoner, they will attend on Monday; and there are none of them I hope that are likely to perish between this and Monday, God forbid they should! I conceive, therefore, my Lord, that Mr. Baxter in this case has done what any person would have done, respecting a man who lived at Chiswick, and who was suddenly called into Warwickshire; and with respect to the materiality of this witness, I think no man can doubt but that in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260065"></xptr> the transaction alluded to, it is necessary to have every person we can. Mr. Bearcroft and Mr. Lee very properly object to this motion on the behalf of the prisoner, and God forbid that any injustice should be done to him; I hope Mr. Lee and Mr. Bearcroft will give us credit, whose fate it is to be employed on the part of the prosecution, that we do not wish any injustice to be done the prisoner; but to be sure, if there is a foundation in this charge, (which I sincerely hope to God there is not) it is necessary that it should have a fair hearing, and that for the sake of public justice it should be sifted to the bottom: I trust, therefore, on these grounds, that this gentleman being at so small a distance, Mr. Baxter has taken all due pains to obtain him, and we shall have the benefit of his testimony.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilson. My Lord, very little is left for me to say on the occasion. This is an important prosecution on the part of the Crown, and it is also important on the other hand for the prisoner; it is therefore fit it should be as fully investigated as to circumstances and times as it possibly can: the circumstance of delay which has been mentioned is but one day; if it had been the wish of the parties to put off this trial till the next sessions, perhaps a stronger affidavit might have been necessary. The gentlemen on the other side endeavour to prove to your Lordship, on the face of our affidavit, that this gentleman's testimony is not necessary; but, my Lord, suppose the Captain was called, and said there was no stores that he received, yet the Lieutenant might for ought he knew; then the objection would be, why have not you the Lieutenant here? and that is an objection which the Lieutenant's presence would remove, and his presence we hope to have here: but they say Colonel

             will certainly speak the very thing that this Lieutenant can prove: as to Mr. Rooke, it may therefore be a question, whether he can be examined or not; and if he can be examined, it is the constant language of Courts of Justice, where there is an interest in a party, that that interest goes to his credit; or if it does not, it may be very material to confirm his testimony: the learned gentlemen differ widely; one learned friend objects, that the application was not made till Monday; another learned friend thinks it was too soon, and that he might have walked it: my answer to that is this, I am strongly impressed with a belief, that the gentleman will be here for two reasons; the one is, that he is a gentleman, and being so, unless he intended to have come and given an answer to the letter in person, he would have written an answer; for, in point of civility, I do conceive no gentleman would have received such a letter without having written an answer, if he could not or would not come himself: these are the observations that occur to me, and I cannot help thinking that this man being a material witness, your Lordship will, for the sake of publick justice, and for the fuller investigation of this ness, put the cause off till Monday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes. I will consider very shortly this motion upon the several points, which have been argued by the Council for the Crown, and the Council for the prisoner, and they are three: the materiality of this gentleman's evidence, whether due diligence has been used to obtain it, and whether there is a probability of his being here. As to the materiality of the evidence, it is particularly specified in Mr. Baxter's affidavit, that he is material in this respect, that being a Lieutenant on board the Superbe, he is to prove that no provisions were delivered on board that ship to Colonel

But it is said all this may be supplied by Colonel

            ; I think not, because he might not always be in the way, and he might not receive them, but some other evidence might; and if the evidence had rested on the materiality, I own I should have been inclined to put off the trial: but there are other points that will govern my determination, which I am going to give.

Taking all these circumstances therefore together, I am perfectly of opinion, that this trial ought not to be postponed.</p>

            , being then the commanding officer there; and there are circumstances stated to me, whereby we shall be able to shew that no such provisions were delivered, and no such receipt given, and all to shew that the prisoner at the bar, either forged this receipt, or uttered it knowing it to be forged. In opening this case to you, I shall confine myself as decency and duty oblige me to do, to a short state of facts; you perfectly well knowing that it is not from me you are to learn any fact, but from the witnesses themselves: my duty therefore goes no further than to lay before you a sketch of what the witnesses will lay before you themselves, and you will therefore of course dismiss from your minds, any thing that I shall say, further than as it relates to the mere connection of facts, and of dates one with another.</p>

             to certify the case to them, and he made the report, and stated the nature of the vouchers that were produced, that is the order and the receipt; and he observed that it was not quite regular and in the common form, that it was not the custom of the service, for an Admiral to give an order to a Purser, but for the Admiral to correspond directly with the Captain; he observed too in his report, that no notice was taken of the delivery of the provisions in the Captain's account, and that he apprehended that those garrisons were victualled by other persons, that they were victualled by persons under contract with the Treasury, who ought to account for those provisions; and as that was the ordinary course as he apprehended in these cases, and above all as there was that singularity of the Admiral's giving an order to the Purser, he thought himself bound to make these observations on the report: however on the 23d of May 1783. the board directed that the provisions, and the things mentioned in the receipt, should be allowed in Mr. Gambold's account; and that account was accordingly closed, and credit given in that account, for the amount of this second demand given into the Victualling Office of 642. 17 s. 7 d. and a victualling bill was made out for that sum, dated the 31st of May, and delivered to the prisoner, this turned the balance very considerably in favour of Mr. Gambold's account, the small balance that had remained, was something under twenty pounds, and the consequence of this was, that something more than six hundred pounds was due to him. Gentlemen, this receipt from Lieutenant Colonel

A Mr. Bevan and a Mr. Millingham, were made the executors of his will, and the prisoner on the 16th of November, 1782, writes to

               <p>"Sir, I received your letter, of the 16th instant, respecting a debt due to you from the late Mr. Gambold, there are several other debts likewise unsatisfied, and as we expect there is a considerable sum of money due to him as Purser of the Superbe, I desire you will enquire at the proper offices whether the books have been received, as we understand they were sent home, by the Prince East Indiaman, you should know the exact account of those affairs. On the 12th of December 1782, Mr. Robertson writes,</p>
               <p>"In answer to your's, the accounts of Mr. Gambold are passed, and I am sorry to say, they are very much in debt to the Crown, and if you have any other affairs to settle I beg you will particularize them." When he writes that the accounts were passed, he undoubtedly means the first accounts; but in May 1783, these second accounts were passed, on which Mr. Robertson received a balance in favour of Mr. Gambold, and from that hour to this he never let the executors know that he had passed such accounts: we shall likewise prove, that no such provisions ever were delivered from on board the Superbe, and we shall also prove, that none such were ever received into the garrison of Goree; we shall prove also, that this receipt is not the hand writing of Lieutenant Colonel

            . Gentlemen, when all these circumstances are collected together, it will be for you to balance them, and in the first place to see how far the charge and the evidence to support it is sufficient to convict the prisoner, supposing it to stand by itself; and then balancing it against that case, which will be made out by him, whether it will still sufficiently preponderate against him to entitle you to bring in your verdict, that he is Guilty. Gentlemen, I beg to recommend to you again, what I am perfectly satisfied you know, but it is fit I should be anxious in repeating it, that every thing I have stated to you, you are to consider as utterly unproved at present; and that it is from the witnesses alone and not from any thing I have said, you are to collect the guilt of the prisoner. Gentlemen, I shall detain you no longer in opening to you the nature of this prosecution, only expressing on my part a most sincere wish, that you may, after hearing the evidence that shall be adduced on both sides, find yourselves justified in giving a verdict that shall acquit the defendant; but at the same time permit me to add, it is necessary that no frauds of this kind should be committed; and if an unfortunate necessity should oblige you to see that there is truth in this indictment, you will in that case do that justice to the publick, which you shall by dint of testimony be compelled to do.</p>

               <p>Mr. Lee. Can you tell, or can you not tell, whether you received them in August? - It is impossible to tell.</p>
               <p>You might have received them in July, or in June? - It is impossible to tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260072"></xptr>How came you to swear that you received them in September? - To the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>It is a strange thing, that in such a charge as this, that you should begin with saying, you received them in the month of September, and now you say you know nothing about it? - I take it, it was in September that I received them.</p>
               <p>What makes you take it? - Because I generally used to deliver papers as soon as I had them.</p>
               <p>So that you infer, because you delivered them in the month of September, that you had them then? - I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon you to swear that they had not been delivered months before, months, many months; I put it to you, and I tell you there will be some evidence upon that; not one, two, or three, or four, but six months? - I cannot take upon me to swear, I will not take upon me to swear, I should not chuse to swear.</p>
               <p>What are you about, to say you received them in the month of September, and then will not take upon you to swear that they were not delivered the February before; that is pretty extraordinary! Now, young man, about all this matter on which there is a possibility of checking you, you get into a good deal of obscurity and uncertainty, but you say you received a letter from Mr. Robinson? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is a little unlucky that was destroyed? - I cannot say when, I received many notes from Mr. Robinson, being of no consequence I destroyed them.</p>
               <p>You do not know that you destroyed that? - I have not got it.</p>
               <p>Did not you receive papers without letters? - I might receive papers without letters, but I remember finding that paper in a note on the desk.</p>
               <p>What a note written by Mr. Robertson? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I should have thought it most natural to have preserved that paper with the inclosure? - No, the papers were delivered into the office.</p>
               <p>Do you know what became of the letter? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Because you said you destroyed it, you do not know but you might light a pipe with it? - No.</p>
               <p>I wish you have not made some little mistake about this letter, Mr. Williams? - I fancy not.</p>
               <p>Are you sure about that, I would not ask you if I was not instructed to ask you; will you take upon you to swear that there was a letter at all from Mr. Robertson? - I am certain these papers were inclosed in a note, I know it was from him, and to the best of my knowledge it was his writing.</p>
               <p>Now it is only to the best of your knowledge? - I know Mr. Robertson's writing.</p>
               <p>Will you swear the letter that you took little or no notice of was his writing, because you said to the best of your knowledge it might be? - It is impossible for me, I did not see him write it.</p>
               <p>It might be his clerks you know? - To the best of my knowledge it was his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Or it might be his clerks? - It was his hand-writing, I dare say, I very often saw his writing.</p>
               <p>Now, I say, young man, as the note was destroyed, what fixes it in your memory so precisely and exactly the time of this delivery of these papers and note? - I wrote to the board immediately after I received the papers in March.</p>
               <p>Just so was done you know in the month of September, yet you cannot swear that it was not in the February before; that is no reason with you know? - I am sure it was in March.</p>
               <p>What makes you so sure? - From my memory.</p>
               <p>O, that is all! When did you apply to the board? - I applied either that day, or the next day, to Mr. Collier.</p>
               <p>Court. You sent them to the office; what time in March? - About the 15th or the 16th.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lee. Now will you tell me this, whether at the time you received these accounts,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260073"></xptr> this order and this receipt, you did not receive an account of extra casks, signed by Captain

               <p>What is the matter with you, you seem to have the most comical memory that ever was; why it is all of one side! Cannot you tell whether you did or did not; was not he Captain of the Superbe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any account of these extra casks at all, how is that, Master Williams? - I cannot say that I do recollect.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that there was an acaccount of extra casks as well as the others sent by Captain

            ? - I know there was one.</p>
               <p>But you cannot tell whether you received this with the others, or when you received it? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did not you receive them at one and th e same instant? - I do not recollect any thing about these extra casks.</p>
               <p>At the time you received this order and receipt, was not it accompanied with that account? - I do not remember it was.</p>
               <p>Will you say it was not? - I do not remember it was.</p>
               <p>You can remember and forget very comically? - I remember the other papers, but I do not remember this.</p>
               <p>Do not you remember ever to have seen it, or only that you never saw it then? - I cannot recollect whether I ever saw it.</p>
               <p>Now mind, good Sir, this letter is your own letter on the 12th of March 1783, which you signed I think, did not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You signed with the name of Bailey; why, it is your own letter, look at it; look at that, man; I only want to refresh his memory, not to puzzle him: now, upon seeing your own hand writing, do you recollect it? - I might have not had the extra expences, we apply for one thing at a time.</p>
               <p>Why you state the very irregularity of it at the time? - I might know the irregularity, though I had not the paper.</p>
               <p>How could you do that, unless by divination? - The first papers were regular, the second were irregular, therefore that application was made.</p>
               <p>Now, friend, how could that letter possibly be written, unless you had an account of the extra casks? - I might know it was irregular, though I might not have it.</p>
               <p>Now do you mean to swear that when you wrote that, you had no account of these extra casks? - I might be informed that it was not regular to apply for the extra expences, I said before I did not remember ever seeing it.</p>
               <p>Did you recollect when I examined you, that you had written such a letter as that in your own hand writing signed Bailey? - Yes, Sir, I know I wrote the letter, but I might not have had the account of the extra casks.</p>
               <p>Did you know that the letter was false or true when you wrote it? - I might be desired to apply for the extra casks at the same time.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Lee produced an account signed by Mr. Henshaw.)</p>
               <p>Look at that for God's sake, and consider what you are about young man; how could that get into Mr. Henshaw's possession without you had received that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How! how? - Any body might have given it to him, I might have been ordered to apply for it, though I had not the extra expences, I know I applied for it, I can say I did not present the extra expence of casks to Mr. Henshaw, I presented the receipt to Mr. Collier,</p>
               <p>Will you say you did not present the extra account of casks, at the same time to Mr. Collier? - Mr. Henshaw was the proper person, I might have been desired to apply for it while I was writing the letter, to apply for both at the same time, somebody else might have presented it to Mr. Henshaw.</p>
               <p>But how it was, you do not know? - I do not.</p>

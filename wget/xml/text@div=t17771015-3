My lord, I omitted one observation; when they came up, they said, Your money, and put your hat before your eyes. When they had robbed me, they said, I might go on: I cannot swear to either of the prisoners; I think one of the men was like Smart.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Bither, a pawnbroker in Long-acre: I took the watch in pawn the next morning after Mr. Parker had been robbed; Crook pawned it in the name of Smith; I asked him where he lived; he said, at Lord Clermont's, in Berkeley-square; I went afterwards to enquire about him, and was told he did not live there, and they knew nothing of him.</p>

               <p>I am innocent of it; the handkerchief was given me by a man that came up into my room, and an acquaintance of the man that gave the handkerchief, sent Crook with the watch to pawn it.</p>

               <p>The acquaintance of the man that gave Smart the handkerchief, gave me the watch to pawn.</p>
               <p>Mr. PARKER. If I was obliged to swear that they were or were not the men, I should rather swear they were not, for they were so andacious at the justice's office, that I could not think if they had been the same men, they could have behaved so civil as they did to me.</p>

On 21st March, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw Giffin in Mr. Clark's wagon, in High-street, Stratford, and Rogers walking by the side, driving—they stopped, and Giffin handed a sack out to Rogers; Giffin got out and drove the horses, and Rogers went on with the sack—I followed him through three or four streets, and in turning a corner he saw me following, and ran away—I ran after him, and caught him with the sack, which contained mixed food—he said he had got his horses food, and was going to feed them—I told him he must consider himself a prisoner—he was not going the right way to feed his horses—it was quite a different way to where Mr. Clark's horses stand—he said he would be b—if he would! go with me, and resisted—I got assistance, and took him to the station and the sack—he there said he had bought the chaff of a man for sixpence, and he</p>

On 21st March, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, Benton produced some mixed food to me in a sack—it was mine—the prisoners were both in my service, and Giffin had charge of the horses—he was allowed to take out a nosebag with food, but not a bag like that—I believe the sack is mine, I have a number like it—this food is the same sort as what Giffin was entitled to take oat—Rogers had nothing to do with the food.</p>

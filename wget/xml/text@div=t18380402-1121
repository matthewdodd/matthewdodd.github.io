                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Bull, of No. 80, Tooley-street. On the 1st of March my attention was called to ratting among the pickles near the door, and, on going into the shop, I saw the prisoner Heron going from the door, with something concealed in his jacket—I saw him give something to Sweeney, and both ran across the road to<lb></lb>gether—I missed a bottle of soy and a bottle of pickles.</p>

I took Heron, and a boy named Collins into custody; and in consequence of information Collins gave me, I went, with Randle, to a marine-store dealer's in College-street where the prisoner Johnson lives—Mrs. Johnson was in the shop, she ran up stairs, and Randle followed her.</p>

I followed Mrs. Johnson up stairs, and when I did so, the prisoner Johnson ran up stairs also; but pre<lb></lb>vious to that, while I was running up stairs, he hallooed out, "Mother"—he came up stairs after me, with some gin, as I suppose—he said, "It is a bad job," and wanted me to have some gin—I saw Mrs. Johnson coming out of the back room, with something behind her—I asked her what she had there—she hesitated a moment—Johnson was at the foot of the stairs at the time, about eight yards off—I found she had a bottle of soy and a bottle of catsup—I found nothing on the premises except the bottle of soy in relation to this charge—Allison claimed the bottle of soy.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoners Sweeney and Heron—I remember being taken into custody on the 2nd of March, about seven o'clock in the morning, Heron was taken about an hour after—I heard Heron say, the night before, "Perhaps we might sell them to Johnson, if we could get any soy"—I was near Mr. Bull's shop at the time, seven or eight doors off—I saw Sweeney and Heron go by the shop, and then come back—I do not know whether they had any thing with them—if they had, it was under their waistcoats—Heron said, "Perhaps we can sell them at Johnson's;" and Matthew Ryan said, "Do you think he will buy them?"—there were two more boys besides the prisoners—Sweeney's little brother was one—I did not see them go to Johnson's—I left them by the rail-road, and went home.</p>

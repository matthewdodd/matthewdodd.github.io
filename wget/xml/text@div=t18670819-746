                  </hi> I was formerly in the C division of police—I reside at 3, Market Street, Newport Market—since the tailors' strike took place, in April, I have been engaged in watching the proceedings of the operative tailors—I attended a meeting of the operative tailors at the Alhambra Palace on 22nd April last—I should say, from what I have heard the building will hold, that there must have been over 5000 persons present, perhaps 5000 or 6000; the defendant Druid was in the chair—I saw Lawrence and Adamson at the meeting—the meeting had begun when I entered, and was going on—Druid was addressing the meeting—I heard him speaking with respect to the tailors' strike, and the proceedings with respect to the master tailors; a portion of what I heard him say, after I got in first, was, that the new log had been sent round to a certain number of the master tailors, and that eighty-eight of them, I understood him to say, had refused to receive or accept it—I heard Lawrence take part in the proceedings; he moved a resolution, as I understood it to be—I always understood Lawrence to be the secretary of the operative association, up to lately, within the last month or so—I don't know it of my own personal know<lb></lb>ledge—he was sitting on the platform, and Adamson also—the resolution which Lawrence proposed was, as near as I can recollect, to the effect that the meeting was satisfied with what the committee had done in sending the new log round to the masters, and, as they had not received it, or would not accept of it, the meeting declared a general strike against them—that resolution was seconded by somebody—I did hear the name, but it has slipped my memory—it was put to the meeting by Druid and carried—I heard Adamson address the meeting, but I don't recollect what he said; I believe it was after the resolution was put by the chairman—there were other resolutions moved by other persons—I understood Druid, in the speech he was making, to say that shop committees would be formed, and pickets would be put on the masters, and he hoped the men would do their duty, and they would receive their instructions from their committees—that was said during the speech, they were not exactly the words perhaps—about the 24th, two days after the meeting, I was first employed to go round—Mr. Poole's establishment is in Saville Row; Mr. Stohwasser's, Mr. Meyer's, and Mr. Bennett's in Conduit Street; and Mr. Binney's, Mr. Manning's, and Mr. Haldane's in Bond Street—I observed at each of the shops where the men had struck, two or more men were stationed—in Conduit Street I have counted from fifteen to twenty-five men stationed, most of them in front of the doors, walking up and down, some on the opposite side of the road, most of them watching persons going in and out, to see if anybody</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190028"></xptr>
               <p>came out with any work or bundle, and they were generally followed by some of the men to see where they went to, and what they were—from the 24th April to the present time I have been engaged in watching those streets from time to time, and during that period I have seen numbers of persons as I hare described outside the master tailors' acting in the same way, standing outside to watch persons and following them when they came out—a greater number always collected in the evening, when the men came out from work, that, is, those that had not struck—the largest number of men I have seen was on 3rd May, in front of Mr. Stohwas<lb></lb>ser's, in Conduit Street—I should say there were over 200 at that time—I have seen some of the defendants acting as I have described at other places, but not at that time—I have seen all of them, except Druit, Law<lb></lb>rence, and Adamson, on picket at different places—when the workmen who had not struck came out of a night there was generally a great num<lb></lb>ber to meet them, greater than there had been during the day; and upon several occasions I have heard them call after them, calling them "dungs," and point to them, and say, "There you go," "We know you, we shall recollect you, and your name will be put down"—I have seen them hiss them, halloo after them, and follow them some distance till they got tired, and then come back again; they called them cowards and every name almost they could think of—that was the general conduct pursued from time to time—there are several public-houses, ten or a dozen, where they meet and have committee-rooms—I have sometimes seen the pickets there very early in the morning, but more in the middle of the day—the pickets generally go on about seven or eight—at the commencement of the strike I think earlier; at some of the shops about six; they are generally on about seven now, or from that to eight in the morning—I have seen both Druit and Lawrence at the Green Dragon talking to men that I have known do picket duty, both before and after—that is the place they call the Central Committee-room—on 24th May I attended a meeting at the Temperance Hall, Pollen Street, opposite the Hanover Square Rooms—I understood it to be a meeting of the out-door workmen, the operatives—I saw Adamson there; he acted as chairman—I saw a great many persons at that meeting that I had seen or picket, and I have seen some of them on picket since—Adam<lb></lb>son said that no doubt after the strike was over he should be a marked man, and so would a great many more that had taken a part in it, and that was all the more reason why the union should not be broken up—he spoke on for some time longer, but I don't recollect it all—I heard a resolution proposed; to the best of my recollection, it was that after the strike was over no union man should be allowed to work in any shop where a non-union man was employed; that was seconded, put by the chairman, and carried—on 29th May I attended a meeting at the Alhambra—as near as I could judge there were about 3000 persons there, Druit was chairman—I saw a great number of persons there that I knew and seen on picket, and whom I subsequently recognised as doing picket duty—I heard Druit speak for some time at that meeting; the principal portion of his time was occu<lb></lb>pied in reading letters, resolutions, and statements that had been made by the masters at their meeting on the Saturday previous—I understood that the meeting was called for the purpose of considering the truth of the statements made by the masters at their meeting on the Saturday previous—I did not hear Druit say anything about the strike or the picketing; that was said by another person—I heard resolutions proposed, and I heard a person say that, from reports he had received, the masters could only get</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190029"></xptr>
               <p>about one-third of their work done, and if they could prevent the remainder it would learn the masters a lesson for the future, or teach them better for the future, or something to that effect; that was not said by any of these defendants—I heard Druit say in the course of the meeting that he had received a telegram from Mr. Blissett: he commenced by saying, "Glorious news, my boys; 80, 000 unionists at your back in the north," and he made some humorous sort Of statement, I could not say what it was, that a great number of persons grinned and laughed at, but I did not hear it—on many of the occasions I have spoken of I was in company of a person named Lambert.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLERIDGE.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who employed you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> am employed by Messrs. Vallance and Vallance, the solicitors of the Master Tailors' Association—I was not a policeman when I was first employed, I had left just previous, I was not doing anything; I had only left the police about a fortnight—I am still employed by the Master Tailors' Association for the purpose of seeing the conduct of the men on strike—that is not the way I make my living; I did not expect this would last above a week or a fortnight; I never expected the strike would have continued so long as it has, or I do not know that I should have taken it—I am so employed until this is over, not longer—I did not go to the Alhambra with any one, I went by myself; I found the building full of people—they did not know me, or know that I was watching them; latterly I think they have known me, from seeing me about a good deal; they did not at first—I did not hear Druit read any letters at the first meeting—I think I heard some<lb></lb>thing of a letter they had addressed to the masters, asking them to come to terms and negotiate—I heard him say something about lock-outs and strikes—I can't tell all the words—I think he very probably expressed a wish that an early day should be appointed for a meeting for settlement—I have some recollection of it, but I can't say—I remember some talk about arbitration. (<hi rend="italic">After some further cross-examination as to what was said by Druit at the meeting, as to which the witness recollected but little, a pamphlet was by consent put in, said to contain a correct report of the meeting, and from which</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLERIDGE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">read the following passages</hi>.—"'Gentlemen, you will see the necessity for having a proper Time Log in as concise but explicit a form as possible, framed to set at rest the many disputes, whether they be in the form of lock-outs or strikes, which have been going on for some considerable time, and in the spirit of your resolu<lb></lb>tion and the proposition of such a log properly considered and agreed to by you, the representatives of the masters, and we the representatives of the journeymen tailors, will have a tendency to put an end to those painful proceedings called lock-outs and strikes: we desire it: you in your resolu<lb></lb>tion express the same desire, and we trust that you will name an early day when we can arrange for a meeting.' Our employers replied by assuring us that the above was in strict accordance with their wishes. After con<lb></lb>siderable delay a day was named, and we met, when agreements were entered into by which a discussion was to be conducted, one of the special stipulations being, that in the event of a difficulty arising an arbitrator should be called in. Well, gentlemen, we began our work. The first day we took the dress and frock coats; we went over every item minutely, no item was left, every one of which was fairly and honestly discussed. The masters seemed quite satisfied as to the conclusions at which we arrived, and even congratulated us at the close of the first day's proceeding on the manner in which they had been conducted. The results of our discussions</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190030"></xptr>
               <p>upon those garments was a reduction of the hours which we had previously considered was the proper time for making them, and a rise on the hours the masters considered was the proper time. The second day arrived, when it was evident that, after reviewing at their leisure the previous day's work, they forgot all their good wishes and agreements in regard to fair and honest discussion and arbitration; and equivocation, delay, with repeated changes in their committee—when practical men were substituted by those who knew nothing about a log. We urged the continuation of the discussion, till they were obliged to confess to us that they could not proceed, that they had no powers to depart from a log which had been put into their hands by the masters, and that, unless we were prepared to accept of it, with but slight modifications, the negotiations must be con<lb></lb>cluded. Such a course we protested against, and hence the cause of the position in which we find ourselves this day. After a series of com<lb></lb>munications which have passed between us since, in which they positively refuse to meet for discussion, as they first agreed, we have forwarded them copies of the Amalgamated Log, by which we have resolved to stand or fall, till they are prepared to do so. (Cheers.) Do not suppose for one moment, gentlemen, that I stand here as the champion of maintaining that log in its integrity, as I am convinced it requires revision, and is capable of correction; not because it is unjust or too high when taken as a whole, but because some parts of it are too high, and others are too low. But it is not our wish to enforce this log as a settlement of the question, if the masters will but listen to reason. We only wish to use it as a basis. Even the Masters' Log—wretched affair as it is—we are willing to take as a basis of discussion, if the masters will only agree to do so, item by item, so that we may be able to come at what is right for each. The point at issue is this—that while there was a distinct agreement between masters and workmen that no log be presented or enforced by either, but that a 'New Time Log' be discussed and drawn up by the representatives of masters and workmen, the masters have presented their log to us, with this message, 'That unless we shall accept of it, with but slight modifications, all negotiations must be broken up.' Since this decision we have used every means in our power to induce them to renew these discussions, and so carry out their agreement, but have failed. Your committee have there<lb></lb>fore considered that the only course they could pursue consistent with your honour and their integrity, commercially, socially, and morally, was, that we draw up a circular stating our proposed course as follows:—[Mr. Druit here read the circular we published in our last number, which was received with cheers, and proceeded]. This we have forwarded, with a copy of the Amalgamated Log, to eighty-eight of the principal firms of the West End and City, nineteen of which seem to have been endowed with sufficient courtesy to reply.") All that I hears of Mr. Lawrence was the resolution that he moved—I believe he went on addressing the meet<lb></lb>ing after that, but what he said I don't recollect; I heard it, but I can't call it to mind—I took no notes, all I am telling you is from my recol<lb></lb>lection—I was not employed by Vallance and Vallance when I went there on the 22nd; it was on the 24th I was employed; I had not the least idea of being employed by them then, I went in to see what was going on; I lived close by; I was passing, and simply went in as others might.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Lawrence, as well as Druit, say that he by no means wished to stand by the Amalgamated Log, but simply as a means of getting the masters to a discussion upon it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> heard something about the dis<lb></lb>cussion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190031"></xptr>
               <p>of logs, but I don't know what it was; I think there were some words to that effect—I did not hear him say that the masters had formed themselves into an association to defend their interests, and the men must do the same, and that they were each responsible for what they did; I don't think I heard anything like that, or that they were going back from what they had agreed to, and if they would not fulfill what they themselves had resolved upon, there was no course left to the men but to do what they were going to do by the resolution which he was going to propose—there was a good deal of discussion, Adamson and various other persons' spoke—Druit got up and spoke again just before I came out. (<hi rend="italic">The obser<lb></lb>vations of Druit were taken as read from the pamphlet as follows</hi>.—"The platform presented a grand unify of working men; not only did it represent the tailors of England and Ireland, but a large portion of the Continent of Europe as well. To complete the representation, he and his colleague, Mr. Blisset, would change their characters for a little and become dele<lb></lb>gates for the tailors of Paris. The chairman then read a resolution which had been unanimously adopted by a meeting of 10, 000 tailors in Paris, at which he and Mr. Blisset had the honour to be present, and which was entrusted to him to convey to the tailors of England. It was to the effect that an alliance be formed between the tailors of the two capitals for the purpose of rendering each other pecuniary assistance in cases of lock-out and strike. The meeting was then addressed by Mr. Colly, after which a resolution was moved and unanimously adopted, pledging the meeting to support their fellow workmen generally on the Continent. Now, gentlemen (said the chairman), it is my duty to give you such information as is necessary for the discharge of your duty in your pre<lb></lb>sent position. You have now cast the dye! You have struck! You must now consider your responsibility. In regard to the work you have in hand, we have always made it our duty to act strictly in accordance with the law, so we shalI do now. He then stated that full in<lb></lb>structions for the conduct of the strike would be circulated, and stated that all men who had work in hand should ask to be permitted to finish it. If the masters refused to give it the contract in regard to it was broken. He said they must go at once and form their shop committees, and put on their pickets; they must be as willing and as anxious to do their work properly as the executive committee were. The committee would be faithful in doing their duty. He impressed upon each of them the necessity of being the same. Let no one shrink from his duty, or seek to lay it on the shoulders of another. Let nothing either fall from your lips or take place in your actions likely to lead to coercion. If men will not cast in their lot with us, let them go and do so with the dis<lb></lb>honourable employers.") I recollect a great portion of that, but I was not there at the end of his speech—I recollect hearing a Mr. Neale speaking, and somebody asking some questions about out-door workers, and the chair<lb></lb>man said something to this effect: "Of course we cannot guard ourselves against dishonourable men in our midst, any more than we can against masters. If men will act dishonourable, or will not act along with us, let them unite themselves with the dishonourable among the masters, and we shall be well rid of both." I suppose "both" meant mastcrsand men, ac<lb></lb>cording to what you have read there, but I did not understand the mean<lb></lb>ing of it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a pensioned sergeant of the police—I accom<lb></lb>panied Mitchell while he was watching these different places—I watched all the masters' shops at the West End—I went out sometimes early in the morning and sometimes late, not always at one time—I watched Mr. Poole's among others; sometimes there were as many as forty or fifty pickets there, at other times five or six, it depended on the time of day, there were most in the evening—they kept sharp watch on the door, close to the door, smoking their short pipes—if they saw any of the men that were at work inside come out, they would point to them and to one another and say, "That's him!" "There he goes! "—sometimes we could hear what they said; I have heard them call them curs, cowards, and dungs—I have seen them go into the public-houses in the neighbourhood which the tailors have occupied during the strike; there are several of them—I have seen the pickets change relief there after they have been on duty for a certain time, and leave and go to the different lodges or public-houses, and after being there I have seen them leave again and go back to the same point—I have not seen anything particular done when persons have come out of Poole's with parcels—it has been more at Stohwasser's and Smallpage's and Bennett's—when the outdoor workmen have called for their work I have seen the pickets follow them as they come out certain distances till they met other pickets, and they have told them where they came from—I have on one or two occasions heard what they have said, that he or she had got work from Sraallpage's; and on that the other pickets have followed them and taken up the chase, and the old</p>

               <p>picket would return to his post; I have seen that occur on several occa<lb></lb>sions—at the first part of the strike the pickets were on duty as early as five o'clock; there would be perhaps three or from three to four or five on each shop—some mornings there would be more than at others; in the middle of the day they would increase to about six or seven, and in the evening part up to as many as twenty, thirty, forty; in fact I have seen as many as 150 in one street—some would parade up and down the foot<lb></lb>way, and if the police in uniform came to disperse them they would walk up and down in the middle of the road; this applied to the three shops I have mentioned and likewise to Mr. Smallpage's, there was no difference made—I never heard them say anything to the persons who came out further than point and beckon, and generally two of them followed up close—if it was a female they would follow her more closely than they would a man; they would leave the street altogether—I cannot say that I have ever seen anybody come out with a bundle who was not followed—they have not done so much following lately, but I have noticed the people who come out generally keep a very sharp look-out and try to get away from them—I was present on one occasion in Marlborough Street when a woman with a bundle ran into the police-court for protection; two pickets were after her at that time; that was at the latter end of June or the commencement of July—the same conduct was pursued at all the tailors' shops who would not receive the strike men—I have frequently seen customers come to the doors of tailors' shops in carriages, and the pickets have generally got near the door and stood there till the customer has gone into the shop and waited till they came out again, unless the police in uniform came up and sent them away—they have stood quite close against the door and on the steps; in fact I have seen them sit on the steps smoking their short pipes: that has been a common practice at the different shops—I have seen two or three at a time, there has been one sitting down and two talking to him, leaning against the railings right against the door steps—they would sit there until such time as they saw a police<lb></lb>man coming along, and then they would move; and when the policeman was gone they would return to the same point—that was continued pretty much throughout the day, principally in the middle of the day—in the evening, when the men knocked off work, the pickets mustered all hands, and when the men came out they would follow them and say, "Here they come, the cowards"—they would say so to each other, not to the men themselves; it was said loud enough for the others to hear—they said, "Here they come, the cowards; is not he a dung? that's him," and they have followed them whichever way they have gone; in fact, I have gone with them as far as half aud three-quarters of a mile, they have been afraid to go away by themselves—I have seen Smallpage's men followed by about half a dozen—I was not sufficiently close to hear what they said when they were following them, because I was with the workmen—the collection of men of an evening was more at Smallpage's, Stohwasser's, and Meyer's—these were the three shops principally picked out—that was carried on very strong for about three weeks or a month—I have seen as many as 100 or from that to 150 of an evening, pretty well every evening during the three weeks or a month, more so twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays—we have noticed, too, the same kind of language has gone on on all these occasions—after a time the pickets got acquainted with us, but the same matters went on to the same extent in our presence; they paid very little attention to that—we were pointed at after we gave our</p>

                  </hi> I am a master tailor at 44, Conduit Street—at the time of the strike I had about sixty men, including in and outdoor workers; they all left except one—others were willing to work for us after the strike—pickets were stationed at my door from the time of my getting there in the morning till I left in the evening, which varied in both cases—when persons left my premises with work I have occasionally seen them followed; nothing more than that—I received a letter exactly like this, and handed it to Messrs. Vallance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you present at the resolution that was passed by the master tailors to dismiss the men? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> was—a formal resolution was moved, and seconded, to lock out our men until certain men who had struck against other houses had returned to their work—they had struck against three houses—I can't tell how many men those particular houses employed—Mr. Poole I reckon on an average em<lb></lb>ploys 500, and there was Mr. Stohwasser's; altogether from 600 to 700, I should think, had struck against the three masters—to the best of my belief about thirty or forty masters combined together upon that to dismiss their men—the substance of it was in order to compel the men on strike against the three masters to return to their work—the wording of the resolution was that we would lock out the men until those houses had made some terms with their workmen—that lasted about a week, the terms were made very quickly under those conditions—I think between thirty and forty masters were present when that resolution was passed—I don't think there were any absent who were bound by and acted upon that reso<lb></lb>lution—the masters' association was not formed at that time.</p>

                  </hi> I am foreman and salesman to Mr. Poole—when the strike took place, of all our indoor men only two remained—there were close on 500—these two were allowed to remain because they were very old, and one was deaf and dumb—pickets were put on our establishment directly—it was my duty to watch these pickets as much as possible—I had several applications made to me personally from workmen, who would have been very glad to come to our firm, if it had not been for the pickets—we sent out work at times, and the pickets followed the persons who took it—I did not hear much said, but I saw a great many motions made to them—that has continued up to the present time—it interfered with our getting work done a great deal at the beginning.</p>

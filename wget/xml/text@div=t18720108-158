                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Harris, of James's Buildings, Uxbridge—I know the prisoner, and knew the deceased, George Carter—they stood just outside the tap-room door of the Prince of Wales, Hilling<lb></lb>don, on the evening of 12th December, and I heard t he prisoner say to Carter "You b—, you have been jeering at me all the evening, and I will give you a slap for it"—he then hit Carter on the head, and he fell, but got up again, and the prisoner knocked him down again; he got up again, and the prisoner struck him a third time, and he fell again—he laid for a minute or two, and then he said "Take me out"—I do not know who he said that to—two men were standing there, but I don't know who they were—I saw Henry Saunders there, but not Henry Scott, or Herbert Mur<lb></lb>ray—I did not see them there—two men picked Carter up, and I said to my little girl "Mind, Lizzie, you don't fall over him"—he was bleeding very much from his head—I did not see what occurred outside—Mr. West <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> my pint of beer, and I came out—I had no opportunity of seeing whether they were wrangling before the remark was made, because when I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker of Hillingdon—on Tuesday evening, 12th December, I went to the Prince of Wales, at a few minutes after 8 o'clock, and saw the last witness there, and a moment or two afterwards the prisoner came to the bar, out of the tap-room, and said something to the landlord, but I did not understand what, as I was about two yards away—the landlord said "I hope you have done with it"—he said "I have come away <hi rend="italic">on</hi> that purpose"—Carter immediately came out of the tap-room, and came close to the prisoner, and began using very abusive lan<lb></lb>guage—the prisoner then turned round, and used abusive language, and said to Carter "I have come away on purpose not to have any <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, but if anyone will go out and pick me up I will fight you"—Carter drew his arm up in this way into his face, and said "You b—pig, I could double you up"—he was a much bigger man than the prisoner, in fact, I think the youngster was frightened of him—he thought he was going to have a blow, and he struck out in his own defence, and hit Carter somewhere in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187201080083"></xptr>
               <p>the face—neither of them appeared to be drunk—Carter fell against the wall from Fello<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi>' blow—he then recovered himself; and closed with Fello<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi>, who struck him again somewhere about the face or head when he was in a rising position, and he went down on the ground again, and the landlord rushed out and said "I will have no fighting in front of my bar; if you want to fight, go outside," and Carter walked out into the street—several men were there, and he called to one named Saunders to come out and pick him up—Fello<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> followed him out, and they faced each other in a fighting position about a yard and a half from the front shop—I do not think Carter's blow reached Fello<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi>, but Fello<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> struck him, and he fell on the ground, and his head fell on some hard substance, either a stone or some old foundation, by the sound of his head—William Smith, who was by me, and who had been in the house, said "I think he is stunned; let us go and pick him up"—I said "I have nothing at all to do with it"—he did not move, but lay in that position about two minutes—I said "Let some of his friends see to him," but finding he did not move I went and rose him up in a sitting position, and found him insensible—there was a little blood on his face, but it was dark, and we did not see it till we carried him indoors, and sat him on a seat—he was insensible about three minutes—I afterwards spoke to him, and bathed his face—he said "I do not want any of that foolery," and shoved me away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did not seem much the worse—I saw him next day, and he only had a black eye—I saw him on the Saturday, and said "How do you feel?"—he said "Pretty well,"—I saw him about sixteen or eighteen times before he died—I asked him if he would have some drink the next evening, and I said I was very glad that he was not hurt—I have known him from childhood, he used to drink occasionally—he was a coal heaver and a powerful man; very strong and athletic—he liked fighting very much, I think—there were a lot of people in the tap-room—I saw Mrs. Harris there—it is not true that he was carried out—he was first to leave—I am quite sure he was struck outside the house—Carter first addressed the prisoner, he said "You b—y sod I could <hi rend="italic">lick</hi> forty such as you," those were the first words, he used that language in an offensive manner; he seemed very much out of temper—he raised his arm and said "You b—<hi rend="italic">yprig</hi>, I could double you up"—he raised his arm close to his face, appar<lb></lb>ently for the purpose of delivering a blow; I thought he would have it—Carter went out first, when the landlord opened the door, and said he would have no more fighting—he not say: "Come out and fight outside"—they struck out outside, but I do not think the blows reached Fellows; one blow struck Carter from which he fell—none of us interfered, it did not last three minutes from the commencement—Mrs. Harris is making a strange mistake about his being knocked down three times inside the bar by Fel<lb></lb>lows, it is false—she rushed into the bar with a little girl, but I do not think she saw much.</p>

               <p>and the prisoner quarrelling about 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which one had borrowed of the other—I told them they ought to be ashamed of themselves, and left them all quiet, smoking their pipes—I went to the bar and Fellows came there in about a minute and asked me for a pint of beer—Mrs. Harris came in while he was at the bar—I asked him if he had done with that bother because I would not draw him any more beer if he had not—he said yes he had come away on purpose and he wanted no more of it—I was going to draw him the beer when Carter came out of the tap-room and called him "A b—y sod" and said, "You b—y pig, I will double you up, "and he up with his fist to hit him as I thought, but he did not, because the prisoner struck him first and he went up against the wall but recovered himself a little, and slipped down—he got up again, and received another blow and went down again—he got up again, and I unbolted my bar door and slipped out and got between them and stopped the fight, and opened my front door and ordered them out—Carter went out first—Mrs. Harm rushed in when I went out of the bar—if she looked through the window she would see them—when Carter went out he said to Saunders "<hi rend="italic">Prinny</hi>," which is a nickname for him, "Will you come and pick me up?"—he said "No, pick yourself up"—I am sure Carter walked out and was not carried out—he was not much in advance of the prisoner, because the bar is only two yards square—there was no one near Carter—he was afterwards brought in again—his nose was bleeding a little, and he was not sensible—he remained in that state about two minutes—I sent for some warm water and got him bathed and he stopped in the tap-room three quarters of an hour. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have no doubt that he walked deliberately out of the house—when Carter slipped down, he did so intentionally, to avoid receiving a blow; it is a pugilistic trick which is common in a fight, I should do so—Mrs. Harris seemed to be out of her mind—she said that I was not there at all, but I stopped the fight—when she says that two men carried him out she is wrong—I should not allow that—he came to my house every night till the day of his death, smoking and drinking as usual.</p>

               <p>sister—I did not know him before—he was unable to speak—he made a few noises, but could not say what was the matter—his sister told me that he had been fighting some time previously, and that he had had fits—his eyes were black, and there was a mark on his nose—I told him to go home and remain quiet—I went down to see him again at his sister's the same even<lb></lb>ing, but he had gone home and as I was told, to bed—I went to see him next morning, and found him in a semi-conscious state, having had several fits during the night and he afterwards died—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination, and found marks of bruises on his face and scalp—on taking off the skin of the head I found a large bruise, and on removing the skull-cap, I found a fracture of the skull at the back, or rather the side, and a clot of blood on the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, which was no doubt the cause of the fits—they were caused by pressure on the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>—the clot would be caused by the rupture of a small vessel by a blow or a fall—that would be consistent with the fact of his receiving the injury several days before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think his skull might have been fractured on the Tuesday week before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but the mischief was not developed; the clot of blood was beginning to be organised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The fracture of itself caused no pressure, the pressure was caused by the blood thrown out pressing upon the brain—it does oocur from other causes, no doubt, besides fracture—I examined him on Monday night, but should not be inclined to attribute the clot of blood at that interval of time to other causes than the fracture—they had told me that he had had fits before, but I do not know what caused them—it may have been congestion, from drinking too much—he seems to have got over them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a man, predisposed to fits, receiving a fracture, and going about smoking and drinking as usual, and you find him on the Monday in the state which you describe, is it not quite consistent that the blood which pressed upon the brain may have been entirely independent of the frac<lb></lb>ture? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not, because the blood was between the skull and the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, not between the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> and the brain, and therefore it did not come from the internal part of the head, but from one of the vessels broken by the fracture—it pressed upon the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> pressed upon the brain—if a man received a fracture of the skull, I should not expect to find him walking about, and drinking as usual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is, all this might have happened from the mischief which occurred a week before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do not say more than a week, I should expect it to come on rapidly, but evidently it did not; the mis<lb></lb>chief which produced that clot of blood might have happened very re<lb></lb>cently; it might have been hours, and it might have been days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it be much more likely to be a few hours than a few days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in the condition in which the man was, the blood was beginning to be re-absorbed, beginning to become living flesh again, and if the re-absorption had taken place, he might probably have recovered—congestion of the brain arises from drinking, and from many causes—a man who has had fits is pre-disposed to fits, and to congestion; but there may be no congestion, and yet he may have fits—congestion may be caused by over-drinking—in a man who had received an injury of this sort, drink<lb></lb>ing would be likely to bring on the congestion from which he had suffered—he died on the Wednesday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not think drinking alone would have caused it, but it would assist—congestion of the brain was the cause of death—that was connected with the fracture of the skull—there was nothing but healthy structure in the brain, there were no marks of epileptic scars—blood rush<lb></lb>ing into the brain is sometimes re-absorbed, and a scar is formed—I saw a trace of that, but I did not examine for that.</p>

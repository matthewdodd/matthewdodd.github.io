               <p>On the 26th of July, in the afternoon, I was told that a woman who had robbed Mr. Strachan, was at the Roebuck, in Bridges-street, and I went there: I found the prisoner there, and another woman: I took them both into custody: I carried them to the office: they were both charged with robbing Mr. Strachan of a pocket-book, with a 20 l, bank-note in it. On my offering to search the prisoner, she gave me the pocket-book: the bank-note was not in it; but I took two guineas out of her pocket, and they had bought clothes with the rest of the money: she said this was the book she took from Mr. Strachan; afterwards she said it was the book the note was in. The prosecutor since that is gone out of his senses, and is confined in a mad-house.</p>

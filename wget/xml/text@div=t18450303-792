                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Hart—we live in the New Cut, Lambeth—the prisoner was in my service—on the 19th of Feb. I sent her out for work—she had a parcel under her arm—I called her back, and asked what she had there—she said, some dirty clothes to take home to her mother—I told her it did not look well to carry two bundles through the street, and to tie them together—she said she did not like it, as there was something in one that she did not wish me to see—I said that was nonsense—she opened the bundle, and these black trowsers fell out—I said, "Where did you get them?"—she said she found them between two beds that morning—I said that was an untruth—I called a policeman—these are my husband's trowsers—when the policeman came she said, "I will tell the truth, I took them from the shelf, on the right hand side."</p>

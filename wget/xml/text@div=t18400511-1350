                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Deards, and live in Angel-gardens, Shadwell. On the 18th of July, last year, I went out about twelve o'clock at night to get something for my supper—I locked my par<lb></lb>lour door—a widow lived in the top room—I was absent about half an hour—when I came back I found the door broken open, and the hasp hanging by one screw—my drawers were stripped—I missed the articles stated, which were safe when I left the house—I went directly to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house, and found Mary Brown there, with a gown, a shift, and a petticoat of mine—this is part of the property I lost—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 59.) On the 18th of July last I was on duty in Commercial-road, and met the prisoner about one o'clock in the morning, with Mary Brown, at the top of Dock-street—Brown had a bundle in her apron—I asked what it was—she said, some linen which she had been fetching from a washerwoman—I said it was an unseasonable hour, and thought all was not right, and I must take her to the station-house—the moment I spoke to Brown the prisoner walked off, and has not been seen or heard of till last Tuesday fortnight—I took Brown to the station-house, and in about three minutes the prosecutrix came and said the pro<lb></lb>perty was hers—Brown was convicted here in July last.</p>

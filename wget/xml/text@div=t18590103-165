                  </hi>. I live at Sawpit-cottage, Hackney—on 9th December, between 6 and 7 o'clock, I was walking along King Edward's-road, Hackney—I heard footsteps behind me, and the prisoner seized me by the back of my neck, got his finger and thumb into my throat, and strangled me till I fell down insensible—he held me four or five minutes—there was one other person besides the prisoner—he took hold of my left arm—the prisoner seized me by the throat and strangled me; I cannot tell what was done afterwards and I was not aware that I was on the ground, but when I came to I was on the ground for a few seconds—I had in my pocket a porte monnaie, containing 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a card, and two keys attached to a chain—I had a leather bag with me containing some bread and butter, and wood—I had been to market, and was going home—I afterwards missed my porte monnaie, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I described to the policeman where I thought he would find it, and he found it next morning, and I said that it was my chain—there was only 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the purse.</p>

I am a signal man on the Eastern Counties Railway, and reside at Eaton-place, Hackney—on 6th December, I was in the Cat and Mutton Fields—four men passed me going towards the Triangle; towards the spot where this happened—the prisoner is one of the four—they were going in the same direction as I was, they passed me twice; I was walking slowly—I shortly afterwards heard a scuffle and a fall on the ground—I ran about thirty yards towards the spot whence the sound proceeded, and saw four men pass me—I saw the prisoner running from where Mr. Turtle fell—he ran to a wall, and got over into a garden—I told a policeman—I picked up a carpet bag about fifty yards from where Turtle fell, in a direction towards the gar<lb></lb>den wall; I took it back and gave it to the policeman—I called out "Police" and "Stop thief"—I saw a policeman get over the wall, and bring the prisoner back.</p>

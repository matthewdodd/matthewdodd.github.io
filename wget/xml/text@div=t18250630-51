            . I am in the employ of Mr. John Vickris Taylor; he has two other partners. Soon after six o'clock on the evening of the 26th of May. I saw the prisoners standing, conversing with the watchman; they then went to a stable which is under the care of Barton; Wortley then went away a little while - when he returned I believe he saw me; he then drew back. I went into the counting-house, and saw him go on towards the stable; I afterwards saw Barton take one of the horses into a small stable across the road, which is used to put a sick horse in - it has been used for a coach-house, and has no stall in it. Barton went in, and shut the door; I then saw Wortley come out of his own stable, with something under his arm, which appeared to be an empty sack, and go into the small stable where Barton was with the horse; I went into an alley between the small stable and Wortley's stable, and waited about five minutes, when I saw Wortley come out with this sack, and about a bushel of beans and oats in it - I seized him; I conceive that no person could fill that sack in the stable without Barton seeing it. I sent for an officer, and they were given in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Are there not some perquisites allowed to the horse-keepers, such as the loose chaff which is swept up? A. I have been there twenty-five years, but never knew any thing of that kind.</p>

               <p>Six witnesses gave Wortley a good character, and three appeared for Barton.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in Smithfield on Saturday, the 5th of September; Martin, my brother officer, and I were in the fair. We saw the prisoner coming towards Long-lane. Martin said, there goes a pick-pocket. I immediately said, what, is it that old man; he said, yes. I proceeded after him from the time I first saw him to the time we took him. He walked about fifty yards; I saw him put his left hand into the gentleman's pocket, and take this glove out, which he threw down. I immediately stooped, and picked it up. I saw his hand in the same gentleman's pocket; he took out an handkerchief. I immediately seized the arm with the handkerchief in his hand, which he threw down. I immediately stooped, and picked it up. On my stooping for the handkerchief, I lost sight of the gentleman. I was under the necessity of holding it up in the fair, and asking, what gentleman had lost an handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner - A. Yes. I never let him go from the time I seized him. This is the glove and handkerchief.</p>

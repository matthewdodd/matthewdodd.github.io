On Monday, the 27th of April, I went on board, and found Field there—he came to me on deck, and asked if I wanted a boy—I asked if he was ever bound apprentice to a ship—he said no, he had been in a billy-boy, and the owners had laid her up, and could do no more for him; he had been about several ships, but could get no employ—I asked if he had any clothes—he said none but what he stood up in—I said I could not take him because he had no clothes, for as soon as we fit a boy out with clothes he is in the habit of running away—he burst into tears then, and I took him out of compassion—I went ashore at nine o'clock next morning, returned at six in the evening, went into my cabin, found the door burst open, and the lock forced open with a marline spike</p>

On the Thursday morning, about Half-past eleven o'clock, I was in the shop of Mr. Horn, a watchmaker, of Ratcliff-highway, and the prisoner Jenkins came to the counter—Horn handed a gold chain to me, which I have produced, and said, in his pre<lb></lb>sence, that Jenkins had got the gold chain for sale—I turned round, and asked him how he came by it—he said he had found it in Red Lion<lb></lb>square, Horborn—I asked what he was doing there—he said he went for relief to get into Peckham workhouse, and that he found it the day before—I said I should take him to the station, and make inquiry—he then said, "It is no use; a lad is standing out side the door, and he gave it to me to go to sell it"—he described the lad to me—I searched him, and found four shilling and a halfpenny on him—he said the lad gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to carry the watch to sell, and he had spent 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of it—I took him to the Thames police—he was remanded for a week—I saw the two prisoners together on the Saturday at the Thames police, and asked Jenkins, in Field's presence, if that was the lad who gave him the chain to sell—he said, "Yes"—Field did not deny it—I said, "I thought you knew nothing about the watch'"—he said, "I do"—I said, "where did you pawn it?"—he said, "in Rosemary-lane, somewhere," and referred to field, who said, "Yes.

On the 31st of August I had a black gelding, which I turned out in the Port Meadow - there were many other horses there, and I took particular notice of the marks on my gelding, that I might know him again. On the 2d of September I went to get it, and could not find it any where. I went in search of it for two days, and then heard that two suspicious characters had gone to Uxbridge. I saw an account in the paper, and went to Uxbridge on the 9th. I found my horse in the stable of the George Inn, and took him back. I did not see the prisoners till I got to Bow-street.</p>

            . I am a constable of Uxbridge. On the 2d of September, in consequence of information, I went to the George Inn, Uxbridge, and saw two horses standing in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150107"></xptr>the yard - one was a black one. I asked the hostler where the man was who belonged to them - he said in the tap. I went to the tap with the man who gave me the information, and found the two prisoners there. I asked the price of the grey horse; May said 4 l. I asked if he would go in harness - he said Yes, he had worked him at Thane for four years. I then asked the price of the two horses together, and May said 14 l. I said "Let us go and look at them;" May, the man who gave me the information, and I, went to look at them. I said the black horse looks as if he had lain at grass. He said "Yes, I took him out this morning at four o'clock." I then went to Moore, who was in the house, and asked him how far they had ridden the horses - he said from this side Thane. I said, "Then you have been travelling all night - what time did you set off - at nine o'clock?" - he said Yes. I said, "Was it dark?" - he said Yes. I then went to the door and called May in, and said "I will see if I can deal with you." He came in - I said I had strong suspicions of their being stolen, and I should take them into custody, and detain the horses. I searched May, and found nothing on him - I found on Moore three spoons. I took them before the Magistrate at Hillingdon. Mr. Bowell saw the horses in my presence - the black one he saw was the one they had attempted to sell me. While they were in custody Moore said he knew nothing of the horses, but he was coming along, and that May asked him to have a ride.</p>

            , who had the horses with them. I intended to have come by the waggon to London, to get advice for my arm and leg, but I came with them; and just before we got to Uxbridge, they said they were authorised to sell the horses for 14 l. or 15 l., but they would not turn 14 l. away. Mr. Ingram saw the two men I had them from.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM INGRAM re-examined. Q. Did he give you this account when they were taken? A. No; I saw two men at the cage door, but they said they knew nothing of them.</p>

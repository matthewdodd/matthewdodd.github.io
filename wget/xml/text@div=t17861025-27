               <p>I am a housekeeper and patrol belonging to St. Sepulchre's, on Tuesday the 5th of September last, at <placeName id="t17861025-27-crimeloc156">Bartholomew fair</placeName>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250070"></xptr>Prisoner. How far was you distant from me? - Not a yard; the gentleman was shuffled away. I heard an offer was made to Osborne.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not you call to him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was it not dark? - It certainly was dark, but at the same time all the links were round, and a shew just by; I took him at the back of the shew.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The handkerchief he says I took I exchanged with a young man for a silk handkerchief, and I had it in my pocket, and I pulled it out to wipe my face, and he came and took me.</p>
               <p>- OSBORNE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a gun-maker; I saw the other witness shoot forward and seize the prisoner's hand with this handkerchief in it, I assisted to take him, I caught hold of his right hand, the prisoner threw his arms about, and said you shall not take me, the others jostled us; the prisoner said at the watch-house, that he had had one handkerchief six weeks, and the other three months; and he said they were neither of them marked; and they are both marked; the next day he offered me some atonement if I would not say too much; and when he was fully committed, he promised to drop me a guinea or two, not to appear before the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I shew you any money? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Willett. Did you hear any offer made to Osborn by the prisoner? - I did at Wood-street Compter.</p>

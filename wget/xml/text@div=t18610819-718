                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 13). Previous to Saturday, 22d June, I had been watching Sunter—I was in plain clothes—I had seen him go into the King's Head, in Newport-market—on Saturday evening the 22d, I went into the King's Head about a quarter or twenty minutes past 5—I was then in plain clothes—Dyer was behind the bar acting as barman—Sunter was there when I went in—my wife was with me—I remained there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—during that time Sunter was sitting on a seat facing the bar—there were several persons in front of the bar when I 'entered, and they remained there for some considerable time—im-mediately the other parties had left the house Sunter rose from his seat, and went to the bar, and said to Dyer, "James, give me a screw of tobacco"—the screw of tobacco was given by Dyer, and a penny put down by Sunter which was taken up by Dyer—it was a sixpence that Sunter put down—Dyer took it up and put down five pennyworth of halfpence, and two shillings, which was taken up by Sunter—I could not see the till, but the money was taken from the direction where the till generally is—it was a high bar, and I could not see the till—I am quite sure it was a sixpence that put down, and not a penny—I said a penny at first, because I have him put down a penny many a time at other places—on this occasion I</p>

               <p>am certain it was a sixpence that he put down, and he took up the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then filled his pipe with the screw of tobatco, lighted it, and left the house—I followed him—he went about 100 or 150 yards away from the house when I called him by name, "Sunter," and said, "I shall charge you with inciting barmen to rob their masters, and receiving money from them well knowing the same to be stolen"—he said, "I have not incited any barmen to rob their masters, and I have only received my right change"—I had not said anything about change—I said, "I shall charge you with receiving 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the barman at the King's Head"—he said, "You makes a mistake"—I then said, "What money have you got upon your person?"—he said, "About 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—(I am looking at a memorandum which I made at the time)—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—there was a threepenny piece among it, and la. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—it was in his pockets—silver and copper all intermixed—I went with Tarrart to Sunter's house, and there found this book under the shop counter.</p>

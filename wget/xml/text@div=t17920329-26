               <p>(The indictment opened by Mr. Knapp: and the case by Mr. Garrow, as follows:)</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the jury. I have been called upon in the course of my professional duty to state to you the nature of the case against the unfortunate men at the bar; and to persons of serious and sober thinking it must have excited sensations of a very uneasy kind, to learn that you are to day to pass on the lives or deaths of so many of your fellow citizens. Gentlemen, in our journey through life we are very often cast into very uncomfortable situations; but it is your duty and mine, as it is the duty of every man, to meet his duty manfully, and to discharge it honestly: I am perfectly sure, gentlemen, that the cause of these men will be safe under your consideration, with the directions you will receive from the noble and learned judge: on the part of the defendants, they have every claim to your best and most discriminating attention; because, undoubtedly, if you should feel yourselves called upon by virtue of the oath you have taken; if you should feel yourselves called upon by the obligations of conscience to pronounce them guilty, they will have little hope of mercy in this world: on the part of the publick there are claims<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290016"></xptr>on you to attend to this case with the most serious and considerate caution, because it presents a murder of the most horrid and attrocious kind committed, with circumstances of defiance of all the attention of the police that have hardly been equalled in this country in modern times; there will be an end of all security in society, if crimes like this attributed to these unfortunate men should pass with impunity: gentlemen, to you I dare say it will be unnecessary to make the observation I am going to make; I make it because I know an occasion recent to us all, I mean the riots in 1780; vulgar minds were impressed with an idea that prosecutions like the present were unfit, indecorous, and not proper to be had; it has been supposed by such minds that to call on a jury to attend to the case of seven or eight persons together, is a thing not to be done in a country governed as this is by wife and just laws; gentlemen, it is of necessity that it should be done; if many persons engage in the perpetration of the same crime, they must be arraigned together, their guilt must be inquired into by the same jury, the same jury must do their best to find out and discriminate that guilt; therefore, gentlemen, it is no impeachment on the law, it is no arraignment of the proceedings of courts of justice that they should be tried together, in truth it is more beneficial for them, and those that fancy these things are injurious, if they considered the subject dispassionately, would discover, that in the way in which justice is administered in this country, it is in truth more beneficial to the parties accused than any other mode of proceeding could possibly be: gentlemen, I have the pleasure, on the present occasion, to assure you that the number of persons will not excite any difficulty in the decision; that it will be extremely easy to apply your minds to the cases of the several prisoners, under the direction, and with the assistance, you will receive from the Court: gentlemen, the first object of your enquiry will be this, whether Jordan Hosty came to his death by violent means inflicted upon him by any body; the indictment imputes that violence to the prisoner Hubbard; it will be, in point of law, perfectly immaterial whether that allegation in the indictment be true or not; because, if it should turn out that any other prisoner now arraigned gave the mortal wound, still, if Hubbard and the rest were associates in the guilt of that other person it will make no difference; but I believe it will appear from the testimony of very many witnesses, that the mortal wound, as alleged to Hubbard, is consistent with truth; you will have the goodness to direct your minds first to the enquiry whether he was guilty of the fact alleged against him, then you will see what share the other prisoners have taken in that guilt, whether they were present, whether they encouraged him, by adding to that force which he would not have had alone to perpetrate this crime, and whether they lent themselves to his guilty purpose: gentlemen, it is necessary I should state to you, that, in order to make persons accessaries, as we call it in common phrase, to the guilt of murder, it is not necessary that all of them should intend that a murder should be committed; if many persons are engaged in an illegal act, in a breach of the peace, or any assault which they do not intend shall end in murder, still, if murder is the event, it is equally murder in them all. Gentlemen, I shall now proceed to state to you the circumstances which led to this melancholy tragedy; on the 16th of February the prisoners at the bar, who had long been associates, and had infested the neighbourhood of Saffron-hill and Chick-lane, were assembled, all but Hubbard, in a publick-house at the corner of Chick-lane, known by the sign of the Crown and Anchor; about half past eight o'clock the prisoner Hubbard arrived: it is immaterial to state to you on what occasion he came there: the prisoner Frere brought in a cask of cherry brandy, which he desired the landlord to purchase of him; for reasons which were very good ones, the landlord refused to purchase it, upon which Frere spiled the cask, and gave some to the prisoners: about nine o'clock, inflamed probably with liquor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290017"></xptr>they all sallied forth to the door of that publick-house, and there they stood in a very riotous mob, accompanied by several prostitutes of the lowest order; while they were standing there a man of the name of Davis was passing along; the first act (and, gentlemen, I state this, not for the purpose of influencing your minds against the prisoners, but for the purpose of marking to you, that those who will come by and by to identify the prisoners, had the means of knowing them; they had the means of fixing their attention) a poor man, of the name of Davis, a coal-porter, was knocked down by some of this gang without the smallest provocation: I mention this only because Davis will be called to you as a witness; he will be called to identify some of the persons at the bar, and that they were so assembled: very soon after this a man of the name of Connor, a day labourer, was returning to his lodging, within a few doors, he was under the necessity, from the narrowness of the place, to pass through this gang of persons; they hustled him; and he made use of an expression, d - n you, what are you at? why do not you let people go along; upon this they fell upon him with their sticks; they beat him in a very violent manner, and he at last escaped into the Crown and Anchor; he represented his alarm, stated his fear of going home, and he begged somebody would protect him home, imagining that the presence of anybody with whom they were acquainted would keep them in order; the master was gone to bed, and the waiter could not leave the house: the poor man waited there till he thought these people were dispersed, and then he came out: I stated first these persons had beat him with their sticks, and at that time no other instrument appears to have been used; but on his coming out he found they were laying in wait for him; he found they were waiting for his coming; and as soon as he came within their reach they attacked him with drawn knives and sticks, and used him in the most cruel manner; the poor man scrambled to his lodging: he lodged at a house with a man of the same name, Connor; and Conner and the unfortunate deceased, Hosty, came out to his assistance; and as soon as they came out they were attacked by different persons, cut with their knives, and mangled in a terrible manner; at last Hosty, who had been cut and mangled, got to the door of a Mr. Carey, a grocer, he fell, and in falling, partly in the house and partly out of it, it will be proved to you by many witnesses, but particularly by Mrs. Carey, who has no doubt of the person; that as he fell, the prisoner Hubbard gave him the wound which occasioned his death; that he gave, as it appeared to her, the whole force of his body to the blow, and he accompanied it with the most horrid and violent expressions, which it is not material to state to you; they are such as make one's nature shudder, expressing the deliberate purpose of destroying this unfortunate victim: gentlemen, the poor man fell at the door wounded by the knife of Hubbard; he had pursued him to that door, he was followed by some of his associates, and he had the barbarity to jump and tread on the head and breast of the poor man; in this situation, glorying in what he had done, boasting of it, he will be described by several witnesses; gentlemen, at last the poor man was dragged into the house, and Mrs. Carey, imagining that her sex might possibly disarm the fury of these ruffians, went to the door, and desired them to go away; Hubbard was then dancing and jumping with his knife in his hand, and using the most horrid expressions, that he would have him out; he went away, and came back accompanied by several of his associates; he swore the b - y b - r was in the house, he was sure, and would have him out; gentlemen, upon this Carey and his family were alarmed for their own safety, and Carey went for a constable; and I mention this fact to you, cautioning you against accumulating this to the guilt of the prisoners at the bar; God knows, if they are guilty of the murder, it requires no aggravation of their case; but for the purpose of shewing that the witnesses who will swear to their persons, had the means<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290018"></xptr>of knowing them; he made use of this expression to Carey, you will go for a constable, will you! blast you, we will give it you; and he immediately attacked Mr. Carey, and he was knocked down by these people; the wife and Fisher, a lodger, ran out to his assistance; he was laying on the ground, crying out murder, and the prisoner and some others kicking him as he lay on the ground; at that time Hubbard, Armstrong, and Jones were standing over him; Jones was attempting to jump on him; Fisher pushed him away, and had a violent blow on his head; at this time some of them exclaimed, d - n you, draw your knives: gentlemen, after this the poor man was taken to a house in the neighbourhood, and from thence to the hospital, for a few days, when he died most unquestionably of the wound that had been given him: the question, therefore, that you have to decide is, whether you can trust to the testimony of the witnesses; if you believe them, if you believe them persons deserving of credit, if you believe they tell their stories in a manner not to excite suspicion, not to excite an apprehension that they are imposing upon you, if you believe they are not mistaken, it will be your duty to pronounce him guilty of the murder, and it will be also your duty to pronounce what share all the other prisoners had in the transaction: the evidence against them is undoubtedly extremely different; as to some of them it will be proved by many witnesses, as to others there will be fewer persons, and those to whom they will swear will be less connected in the transaction: I will direct your attention to some of those against whom undoubtedly the evidence does not appear to be so pregnant; with respect to the prisoner Savage, he was one of those who composed the gang in Brewhouse-yard, but I am not able to connect him with the door of Mr. Carey, or with the actual time of the murder; I am sure if any merciful distinction can be made, it will be made, and urged to your consideration by the highest possible authority; gentlemen, with respect to one of the prisoners I shall be able to prove by one witness, that, if he was not connected with the murder, he was afterwards, while the windows were breaking, one of those that were standing there and laughing at the transaction; with respect to the rest, I shall prove them guilty, I am afraid, by many witnesses: and, gentlemen, it is lamentable indeed that the law has called upon you to make so many victims to publick justice; you and I have nothing to do with that; it is your duty and mine to attend honestly and fairly to the consideration of the facts; and though the consequence of your verdict may be the offering up to publick justice and society many victims, though it may inflict you with pain, yet it will not induce you to swerve from your duty; and though your situation be undoubtedly a very unpleasant one, yet you will meet that situation like me, and discharge it like honest men, looking neither to the right hand nor to the left, but doing your duty as the evidence shall compel you: gentlemen, I shall call the witnesses, many of whom have felt terror in coming forward; but I hope they will learn that they are under the protection of the Court, and that nothing can happen to them for telling the truth; and God forbid they should state either more or less: gentlemen, I shall now proceed to call the witnesses in support of the facts I have related to you, and I doubt not but on the result of the whole, your verdict will be such as to meet the approbation of the publick.</p>

               <p>I am a waiter at the Crown and Anchor the corner of Chick-lane, and was so the 16th of Feb. last; I know the prisoners, and saw all of them on that day; they were there the middle of the day and all the day but Hubbard, who did not come till eight or nine, some little I think before nine, and Douglas not after five or six. They staid in our house after Hubbard came in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290019"></xptr>about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; they, to the best of my knowledge, had a little bit of a cag with some liquor in it, that was Frere; they drank some of the liquor, and Dildale had some beer; I remember Armstrong going out first and they all absconded the house about ten minutes before nine; I never saw them again that night. After they were gone out about three or four minutes, I heard a woman cry out murder, and then the man that is here, Connor, came into our house running, with his nose and mouth bleeding, as with a blow, not a cut; I cannot say I know any of the people that followed him; I did not see Connor after that time; I did not go out after, I kept the door bolted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hubbard. Do not you recollect seeing me in this house after? - No.</p>

I asked Miles for his master; he was gone to bed; I went into the parlour; I continued a few minutes; I had not a mind to drink; I looked out and saw nobody; in going out in about half a score yards they attacked me a second time; I did not see the knife, but I saw the bludgeons; but I received this cut over the cheek (a long scar) and another cut over the mouth, either by a knife or a tool; I called out for relief; some of them were round me, and my landlord came and took me in doors; I did not see the deceased then; I observed

After the riot was all over, I saw Frere at the Crown and Anchor calling to them; he was in a smock frock, and five minutes after I saw him upon the hill with the smock frock off.</p>

You seem to have been a witness to what passed for a considerable space of time; now making use of all your recollection, can you with moral certainty recollect the person of Hubbard? - I cannot say with certainty to any person; but this man Frere and Hubbard as I think.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you pretty sure it was him? - I really think it was him.</p>
               <p>Court. When you saw him at the magistrate's did you think he was the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you now any doubt about his being the man? - I have no doubt but what he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hubbard. Whether he knew me before, or whether he goes by my having a white coat on? - I never saw him before; but by every appearance of the shape and make of him, I rather think him to be the man, by rather bending his knees.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said nothing at Bow-street? - I was not called to give evidence there.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>My husband is a grocer on Saffron-hill. On the 16th of February, about five minutes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290021"></xptr>before nine, a man fell into the door: we were at supper: that person was Jordan Hosty, the deceased; as I was sitting at supper the prisoner Hubbard was stamping on him with the heel of his foot: the deceased's head and shoulders were inside the door, and the lower part of his body laying out: the prisoner Hubbard appeared to me to aim at his face, but stamped on the breast and stomach; I did not observe him repeat the blow, but he offered to strike him once or twice; I went to the door, and Hubbard rather drew back, and the deceased got up and passed me, and went up part of our stairs; then I pushed Hubbard from the door, and he caught hold of my hair, and pulled me off the step of the door upon the pavement; then he stood in the middle of the street, and swore he would have that b - y rogue out; I said the man did not belong to us, and he should come out, we did not want him there; he put himself into many attitudes, and put his hand into his waistcoat pocket and took out something, but I cannot tell what it was; he said, the first that came nigh him he would stab: he turned himself round after standing about five minutes, seeming to be in a great passion, and swearing he would have the man out, and ran down the street.</p>
               <p>I would trouble you to look at him again. - Sir, I am positive to his person.</p>
               <p>You are positive to his person? - Indeed I am, I am sure he was the man that was stamping on the man that lay on the steps; I looked particularly at him, he took up my whole attention by the manner of his behaviour.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you see him at Bow-street? - I believe it was about a week.</p>
               <p>Did you immediately recollect him? - As soon as ever I saw him go up from the bench I recollected his person immediately.</p>
               <p>Was he sitting alone or pointed out to you? - No, Sir, he was sitting alone.</p>
               <p>Had you at that time, have you now, or have you at any time entertained any doubt about his person? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>During all this transaction were there any persons at the door? - I did not see any besides him: after he ran down Saffron-hill I went into the house, the deceased was concealed under the stairs, by Mr. Cary and Mr. Sheen (a lodger) I said now is your time to go your ways, for the man that has been using you ill is gone down the street; and the deceased looked very earnestly in my face but did not say a word; while I was talking to him, Hubbard was the first person that came to the door again.</p>
               <p>Were there any persons in company with him? - Yes there were some men came up with him but I do not recollect any of the others.</p>
               <p>Court. At this time, when Hubbard went, do you know whether the deceased had received any wound? - Yes, he had received a wound over the face, and I believe he had received the wound of which he died. - When Hubbard came back again he jumped and said the bloody rogue was in there, fetch him out: they would have him out; Mr. Sheen recommended to my husband to go for a constable, and they went away from the door; I believe Hubbard was the first that went after my husband; I heard they had knocked him down, and I went two or three doors and my husband was laying on the ground and holding up his left hand crying out murder!</p>
               <p>Court. Any thing that passed after the fatal blow is not material to be enquired into.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carey. When I came back the deceased was gone, I never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hubbard. You do not go by my having a white coat on? - No, I go by your face.</p>
               <p>I have lived three years on Saffron-hill, four doors from you? - I never saw you before.</p>

               <p>I was at home this evening; I went to the door, but not close: on the 16th of February last, a few minutes before nine, as I sat at supper, I was greatly alarmed by a man falling against my door; I went up, and saw a man with stout thick legs, and a lightish drab coat, but rather darker by wear, it was a very old one; I cannot be sure to Hubbard, but there is none other of the prisoners so much like him; I saw that man kicking the man that lay on the ground as hard as he possibly could; I then went towards the door, but my wife went first; she laid hold of the man that was kicking by the shoulders, and they both went out of doors; the man got up, and he ran up stairs; and a lodger of mine, whose name is Sheen, met the man, and said, you shall not come here; what do you want? For God's sake, says the man, do not turn me out; if you turn me out, they will murder me: I stood at the bottom of the stairs, and the man seemed to address himself to me; Master (he was an Irishman), do not turn me out, they will murder me; I have done nothing, I never touched nor offended any of them: I looked upon it as this, that they had been a fighting, and, as the common phrase is, the man had had enough, and gave out; says I, Poor man! you seem shockingly hurt indeed; for I suppose he spilled a pint of blood from his nose, for I saw no other wound; I observed the wound across the nose very plain, it seemed to me as if I could put my finger in it; at that time I was struck more with horror than pity, the man appeared so very ghastly; says I, poor man, go under the stairs, I will go to the door and see what is the matter; while I was talking to him, the man, who he was I cannot say, came back; says he, the bl - y rogue is here; the bl - y b - r, I will have him out: I went and fetched a constable; and the same man that was stamping on the other came up to me again; I have never seen a man since, in all the times since the affair happened, like Hubbard.</p>
               <p>Does he fully answer the impression which your mind made on itself at the time? - Yes; and another thing I took notice of, he spoke, for a little man, very strong.</p>
               <p>Then, upon the whole, you have a strong belief that he is the man, but you do not mean to swear positively? - No, Sir, I do not mean to swear positively; but, if he is not the man, he is as much like him as two peas can be matched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hubbard. Is he positive it wanted ten minutes of nine? - Yes, I will tell you why; I seldom come from my father-in-law's till nine; but I had not posted our day-book, and it wanted nine minutes of nine when I came home, and I sat down immediately to supper, and I had not had any thing; I saw your legs kicking the man; I do not positively swear that you are the same, but I firmly and sincerely believe it.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury: we are now arrived to that period of the case that demands your attention; and by whomsoever it has been suggested, or on whatsoever occasion it may have been suggested, that it is uncandid to complicate together in one charge different persons, because it may distract the attention of jurors, it is ignorance, to say no more of it; for if the case connects them together, if the facts connect them, the prosecution arising out of those facts must necessarily connect them: where the facts may all of them be brought before the Court without complicating different persons in it, it is always convenient to keep the charges apart, that the attention of those who are to decide may not be distracted by different parts of the charge; but in this case it could not have been conducted otherwise than it has been; the case itself, as stated prima facie, attempts to connect all those persons in one integral act, committed at one time, and ascribing to all of them large portions of guilt, which is the guilt of some person; but, happily for those that are to decide, it is rid of all complicated circumstances; because it is fit to tell you, Gentlemen, that, as far as my observation has gone, I think that the prosecution, though fit to be inquired into with respect to all the persons that have been placed before you for your judgement, so far has failed, with respect to all except Hubbard, that I am not aware that there are any circumstances whatever that will warrant me in stating to you, in a question upon which you are to decide on the lives of these men - that there any circumstances that will attach on any of the parties besides Hubbard: Gentlemen, the law was with great accuracy laid down by the learned counsel, who opened the case on the part of the prosecution, with candour, with abilities, and with clearness; and he stated to you that which I do perfectly subscribe to, that if several persons meet together for any illegal purpose, although the purpose which they intend to perpetrate may not amount to felony, yet if so associated together, they are all of them intangled in the consequences, however enormous, however they may be enhanced beyond their first intention; and I concur further with him, in stating, that though the indictment may charge one person with giving the mortal wound, yet if the others are associated with him in the perpetration of their illegal purpose, it is of no consequence; though the mortal wound may be given by the hand of another, yet all of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290025"></xptr>them are answerable, even to murder, for the blow given by another person: Gentlemen, I do this for the sake of stating to a pretty crouded audience, and for the sake of those other persons at the bar, that they may hereafter bear about them in their minds how necessary it is to refrain from keeping bad company, and embarking in any bad purpose; they ought to know in what peril they stand, if they associate with those who are embarked in illegal purposes, that it will be of no moment to say, I had no intention to kill; the answer of the Judge, by the Jury, will be, it is of no consequence your intention, you was embarked in illegal purposes, and all of you are answerable for the wound: Now, gentlemen, with that preface, I will proceed to state to you the evidence against these parties: [Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and then added] Gentlemen, this is the evidence which is called on the behalf of the prosecution; and, as I before said, I do not think this evidence contains any distinct facts strong enough to involve any of the persons in the guilt which is ascribed to them all by the indictment, except Hubbard; for it does not appear that, at the time when they were in the public-house, they had agreed to go out to commit violence; how the violence arose you are only to collect from the evidence given; and there is nothing, in my apprehension, that involves them: Now, with respect to the case of Hubbard, the lenity of the laws of the country in which we live, in various cases, though homicide happens, indulges the passions and weaknesses of the nature which we carry about us; it is not the consequence, that because a man is killed, that the hand by which he died is involved in the crime of murder; but it becomes the party to furnish the Jury with circumstances which shall in some measure apologize for what he has done, and reduce the offence to that of a less denomination than that of murder; now, in looking at this case again and again, I am not aware that any such circumstances exist; if there had been any provocation given, and men's minds had been heated, and the hand that gave the fatal blow is of his guard, owing to something that happened, this, though not sufficient completely to excuse his guilt, but to be some apology in the eye of that law which indulges the passions of men to a certain degree; if any such circumstances had existed in this case, they ought to have been laid before you; but I do not find that is the case; then how is the fact, if it comes unapologized for, and unreduced in the eye of the criminal jurisprudence of the country? That the deceased died by violence is proved, that he died by the hand of somebody is certain; but that will not be sufficient to impute blame to any person, unless the guilt of that particular person is ascertained by evidence; and, in order to do that, you have the witnesses, three or four of whom prove, and two of them speaking with positiveness, that Hubbard was the man that pursued him, that was upon him inflicting violence at the door of Carey; all the witnesses, and it is not at all to be wondered at, in a tumult, in the midst of a mob, that they did not distinctly see every act of violence that was committed; but, however, the case is not destitute of every degree of proof, because one of the witnesses, namely Hardy, swore, that, besides the kicking, he saw the hand of the person going backwards and forwards two or three times, and that that part of his body which was wounded was uppermost at the time; and though not of import singly, yet combined together it may be of much import; and you will recollect, that afterwards, when he was pursued, and apprehended the ministers of justice were after him, that he took something, which was not seen, out of his waistcoat pocket; but that it was something capable of stabbing is pretty clear, because he said he would stab any one that attempted to take him: You, gentlemen, are in arduous circumstances certainly; for though the case may not be of great difficulty, yet one pauses before one decides on the fate of a fellow-creature; and in this case are the issues of life and death, with respect to this man, in your hands; but you are not to shrink from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290026"></xptr>your duty, you must meet it, as the learned counsel said, manfully and fairly; you must remember that, notwithstanding all the feelings of your minds, with respect to false mercy, you owe a justice to your country; and if this man is the man that shed the blood of one of his fellow-creatures, he must answer it with his own blood; and the good policy of the country, and the actual existence of a state of society, cannot exist, if, after such crimes are detected, they are not punished: you are to ascertain it: the circumstances are strong, they are given by witnesses not impeached; and the contradiction attempted to be given to them for the prisoner is certainly no contradiction at all; all that those witnesses have said may be perfectly true, and yet the case for the prosecution stand wholly unimpeached: Gentlemen, in your hands, it remains to decide on the prisoner's fate, discharging at the same time the duty you owe to the unhappy man, and not forgetting the duty you owe to the publick.</p>

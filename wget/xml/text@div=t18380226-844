                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Flower—we let lodgings at No. 23, Great North-street, Lisson-grove. On the 19th of February, our lodging was taken by the female prisoner and another young woman—it was the second floor back-room—they took it by the week—the prisoner said she was married, and her husband was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> driver—she took possession on the 19th, and in the evening, the male prisoner came and passed as her husband—they continued there till the following Tuesday, the 27th—I gave them warning, because when they took my apartment, the woman said her husband drove a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> by night, and she got the key of my street-door, but no man came in—on the Sunday-morning, at three o'clock, the female prisoner came and could not get in—she rang, and the man came down and let her in, and I gave her warning the next</p>

               <p>day—I said the reason was, there was a man concealed up stairs to let her in, and that she herself went out—she begged me not to make them go so soon—after that the male prisoner came down—I just saw him open the street door—I ran to the door, and the man and woman were going up the street—I ran up stairs, and found my apartment was robbed—I sent a lodger of mine after them, and I ran after her—we gave the female prisoner into custody, and in going to the station we met the male prisoner with the bundle under his arm, which contained the bed furniture, and these other things were what were pledged—this is cotton bed-furniture.</p>

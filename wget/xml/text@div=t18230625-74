I sleep over the stable, the wall of which joins the house, and it is all within one fence. On Sunday morning the 22d of June, at nine o'clock, I went in to breakfast; I came up from breakfast, about twenty minutes after nine, and saw the prisoner coming out of the stable yard; he said, "Where is the privy;" gave me a push and ran away. I called the watchman, and opened a little door which he pushed too, and in the stable yard I found a great bundle; he must have thrown it there, for the things in it were in the stable, at nine o'clock, hanging on pegs. I went into the stable, and missed my box, my watch, and some things which laid on the ground; my box was found in a field, it had contained the articles stated in the indictment, as mine, (enumerating them) a watch was taken which I have not found, my grandfather gave it to me - I also lost two pair of gloves, and Johnson's things were gone. The value of what I lost is 16 l. or 18 l. The coachman and I went up and missed all these things, I afterwards went to the prisoner's lodging, with Limbrick and Lee, and found a few handkerchiefs, an old shirt and a night cap - they had been in the box, that was left in the field, they were all locked up safe just before I went to breakfast, When the prisoner rushed by me, I looked at him very hard, and am certain of him; he was dressed as he is now; I saw him in custody the next day but one, about eleven o'clock in the morning, in a room, with about thirty others, and pointed him out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw him before - A. No; he stopped at the door first, and then pushed by me; he was in my sight two or three minutes; he turned back and then ran again. I went to shut the door to hold him in, and am quite sure of him; if I had met him in the street I should have said, he was the man, and called somebody to take him - all the servants were at breakfast, and nobody left in the stable.</p>

I did not see the thief; he pointed to a bundle in the yard, with his clothes, a pair of stockings of mine, a new pair of boots and a cap. It had been moved down stairs into the yard - he could not have gone out of the gate, without tumbling over it. I had been in the stable from five to nine o'clock, and left Jewell there, my things then hung up safe - a waistcoat, pair of drawers, breeches, a coat, a box coat, and a gold band, were taken quite away. The yard is completely enclosed by a wall and gates, which communicates with the house. The prisoner is a perfect stranger.</p>

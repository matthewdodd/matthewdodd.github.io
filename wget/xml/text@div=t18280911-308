The prisoner lodged there on the 24th of June; when I went out I locked my apartment, and when I returned my window was broken, and the shoes gone - I put up a board with a gimblet, and on the 30th, when I came home, the board was removed, and the four shoes were gone; the prisoner did not return that night - he came the next morning, but I did not see him again till the 8th of August, when I saw him in Oxford-street; I challenged him with it - he denied it; I met him again with his wife a short time afterwards, and said I intended to take him up on suspicion, and said, I was the last person he should have thought of doing such a thing to, as I had been a friend to him; he was then taken up, and confessed that he took those on the 24th of June, and pawned them on the 26th, and those on the 30th he sold to a Jew.</p>

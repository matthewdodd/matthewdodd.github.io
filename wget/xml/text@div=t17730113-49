On Tuesday November the 10th my parlour window was broke open; when I came home about two in the morning, I found the bolt forced off: the sash was lifted up and the screw was remaining, but the timber that fixed the screw was forced out of its place, and there were in the parlour in a drawer some of the goods mentioned in the indictment ( repeating them); the rest were taken out of the kitchen; they were laid out for washing. I made an alarm and the things were seized; part of them my own clothes; the other things were never recovered; these things were produced upon the trial of Hatch, and upon that trial I was sure that the goods produced were my goods that I lost that night. The prisoner being before the Justice said that he was the person that broke into the parlour, and that he went down into the kitchen and broke open the closet door, and then took the coral and the clothes mentioned in the indictment.</p>

            . The things that were produced on the trial of Hatch were my master's property; my things were in the kitchen; my master's, part in the parlour, and part in the kitchen; I found them wanting when my master called me up, for when he came home he found his house broke open.</p>
               <p>- Commings. I am a watchman: about two in the morning, being alarmed by Mr. Holman, I went in search of the persons that robbed his house; at the of Mansfield-street, about a quarter of a Holman's house, I saw five men; they were Allen, Hatch, Waters, Godfrey and Duffil</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all part of the same company?</p>
               <p>Commings. They were; Hatch dropped a bundle and I took it up; it contained some of the goods Mr. Holman lost; I desired Waters, another watchman, to take it; who did; the clothes we re delivered to this man, and carried to the constable's, and were kept there till they were produced upon the trial of Hatch, when they were produced, Mr. Holman, who was present at that trial, swore that the goods so produced were his property. The prisoner, Waters, gave an account that he went into the house, went down into the kitchen, took the goods from thence, and broke open a cupboard.</p>
               <p>Holman. There was a cupboard broke open.</p>
               <p>Commings. He said that afterwards he went into the parlour and took the goods from thence and carried them away.</p>
               <p>- Allen. We were all concerned in robbing the house; the prisoner was not in the house; he and I were out of the house for the purpose of an alarm if any body came by, while the others went in and rifled the house; we carried all the things to the house of Godfrey.</p>
               <p>- Waters. I am a watchman; I took the bundle by Comming's desire.</p>
               <p>Q. to Holman. When did the prisoner make the confession?</p>
               <p>Holman. I was called in at the Rotation Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promises made?</p>
               <p>Holman. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner tell, this story under an agreement that he should be admitted a witness; was he sworn at that time?</p>
               <p>Holman. I saw him sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. If sworn it was not a confession.</p>

On Monday last, the 3d of December, I came home about half-past five o'clock in the evening, and sat down to tea; I heard a noise in the shop; I ran through the passage into the street, but did not go into the shop; I saw the two prisoners run from the window; I pursued directly, and never lost sight of them; I took Crawley first, and then Blaney - they were within a pace or two of each other - they had stopped just before I got up to them, and walked a little way; as I went out I saw a bonnet lying outside my window, but did not stop to pick it up; I pursued the prisoners directly, and when I came back with them, I found two bonnets had been removed, and the bonnet-stands were knocked down; the two bonnets. had not been on the stauds, but on the further end of the counter - they had lifted up the sash, and got in at the window; I had passed the window as I went home, just before; it was then quite down and safe; I had not been home more than two or three minutes; I found the window quite up, as high as it would go; they begged and prayed of me to let them go, and said they would do so no more - I had not seen them inside the window.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter, and am eleven years old. The window was down when my father came in to tea, and the door was shut and fast - all the bonnets were quite safe - I was sitting at tea with him, and heard the bonnet-stands knocked down - I looked through the glass door, and saw Crawley in the shop - he had got in at the window, and was reaching to a bonnet on the work-table - I ran into the shop, and my father ran out at the passage; before I got into the shop Crawley had got out at the window, and got two doors off, I believe; one bonnet laid on the pavement, the other was moved from the work-table into the window; I am certain it was Crawley who I saw in the shop - here is the bonnet which was on the pavement, and this one was in the window - I know them both to be my father's.</p>

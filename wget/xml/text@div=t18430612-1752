I have bad dealings in business with the prisoner's father—about the 20th of May I received this letter, pur<lb></lb>porting to come from Charles Kersley—I had previously received letters signed in the same way, and sent goods in consequence—in consequence of receiving this letter, I sent two cheeses and a flitch of bacon, by Humphreys, the carrier—I had never before received orders in this handwriting—I did not know the prisoner, and never sent any goods to his order.</p>

I deal with Mr. Dewey—the prisoner is my son—he was not living with me about the 18th or 20th of May—he had been my from me about three months—this letter is not my writing, nor is the signature—I cannot write—when I used to send orders I got my wife to write for me—I never authorised the prisoner, or any one, to send this letter to Mr. Dewey, or to sign my name—I know his writing—this is not his writing—I met my son as I was going into Brentford—I took him in a cab to the turn<lb></lb>pike, and showed him to the turnpike man, who said he was the young man that had been to redeem the cheese and bacon—I gave him into custody—as we went along in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, I asked if he knew anything about it—he said at first that he wrote the letter himself—he afterwards said he got the letter written at Farnham.</p>

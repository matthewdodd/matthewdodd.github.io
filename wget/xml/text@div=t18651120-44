                  </hi>. I assist my father who carries on business as a linen<lb></lb>draper, at 105, Fleet-street—the door of the shop fastens with a spring, and there is a bell which rings when the door is opened—on 31st October the prisoner came into our shop—he pushed the door open—the calico wad standing five feet inside the door—he took it up and went out with it—I went after him, and stopped him with the calico on his shoulder about half-way up Farringdon—street—I took it from him, and he immediately ran away—I ran after him and caught him higher up the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman in Farringdon-street, at the Fleet—street end—on 31st October, about two in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner with the calico on his shoulder, and saw the last witness following him—he got hold of the parcel and the prisoner broke away and ran—the last witness got hold of him again, and he got away again—MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The witness owns that he heard the bell ring. Do you think I would have gone into the shop and taken the parcel and deliberately come out? I was forty yards from the shop when he stopped me; if I had stolen it, I should have run away as fast as I could. A man asked me to carry the parcel for him, and said he would meet me up the street, and as I was carrying it, the witness came up and took me, and I (was frightened and ran away. I knew nothing about its being stolen.</p>

I was going to the Ship public-house, to see the landlady there - I was not in liquor; I went strait from home-it is about three miles from my house. I left home at seven o'clock, and met my brother at the Blue Lasts, and stopped an hour with him; we had only a pint of porter; when I left him, I went to the Ship, in Bacon-street. Before I got in, I was stopped by four or five men - I did not know them before. They hustled round me, and one of them drew my watch out of my pocket; I have never seen it since. I caught hold of the seal-the chain was broken in two, and they made off with the watch; the prisoner was one of them - I saw him again that evening. I had 18s. taken out of my breeches pocket at the same time, viz. two 3s. and eight 1s. 6d. pieces. The prisoner was the man that took my money - He was taken into custody at the time.

             saw him searched, and two 3s. and eight 1s. 6d. pieces found on him. He was with those that took my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. It was not very light. I stopped at the public-house about an hour, or an hour and a half, with my brother. I stopped in the street about an hour with him before we went in. I am certain that I drank no more than a pint of porter. I went to the Ship, to see the landlady-there were a great many people<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210011"></xptr>there at the same time. When the men came up to me, they asked me to fight, and bustled me. I called out, and they made a noise to drown my voice. The prisoner was taken immediately after. I had changed a 1l. note at the public-house, and gave my brother 1s. 6d. The prisoner had his arms round me.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CANEW. I live with a cow-keeper, and have lived in my place eight months. I was standing at my master's door, which is opposite the Ship; I saw a skirmish, went over, and saw the prisoner's arms round Warne's body-his arms were under his. I caught hold of him. I saw his hand near Warne's pocket - I will not say it was in it. I dragged him across the road into the public-house - He did not go willingly - He was searched. I did not hear Warne say how much he had lost before he was searched. He said he was robbed of his watch and money before the prisoner was searched. I do not remember his saying what was the amount of the money. - He said, the prisoner took his silver out of his breeches-pocket, but he did not know who took the watch. Turner searched him, and found two 3s. pieces and eight 1s. 6d. pieces on him. When the prisoner was charged with the robbery, he said we might search him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw the money taken from the prisoner, he had only one penny about him beside-the prosecutor said he had lost his watch and silver; I did not hear him say any thing more. I have had no conversation with Warne about it - He has said nothing to me about a reward.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TURNER. I am an officer of Worship-street. On Friday, the 16th of May, I was passing the end of Bacon-street, I heard the cry of stop thief! I went to the Ship public-house, and found the prisoner in the custody of the last witness; I asked the prosecutor what he had lost, he said he had lost his watch and chain; after that I asked him if he had lost any thing else - He said he had lost his silver out of his pocket. Before I searched the prisoner, I asked him what money it was; he said, two 3s. and eight 1s. 6d. pieces. I searched the prisoner, and found two 3s. and eight 1s. 6d. pieces, in his breeches pocket, and one penny in his waistcoat pocket - I found no more silver on him. I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. This was in the presence of Canew; he heard what he said, but may not recollect it - He was close to me; the prisoner was willing to be searched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have a witness to call.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Mansfield-street. On Friday, the 16th of May, the prisoner came to me in the evening, about half-past six o'clock, and asked if he could sup and dine with me the next day, - being our Sabbath; I told him he could; he asked what he should give, I told him 2s.; he gave me a 1l. note, I gave him eight 1s. 6d. and two 3s. pieces in change, being 18s. I have known him from from his infancy, and never knew any thing dishonest of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you a relation of his - A. No; I heard of his being taken up on Saturday morning, between nine and ten o'clock; he supped with me on the Friday night at a little after seven o'clock, and stopped till near nine; I live about a mile from Bacon-street. My family supped with me-none of them went out with the prisoner; he lodged at my house, and slept there on Thursday night for the first time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TURNER re-examined. Before I searched him I did not ask him what money he had about him-when I found it he did not say where he got it, there were five or six people in the room at the time. I am certain that Warne said what the money consisted of before I searched the prisoner. The prisoner said nothing about Fernando, nor did he say he had changed a 1l. note that night.</p>
               <p>JACOB FERNANDO re-examined. I had given change to several people in the early part of the day, but I do not recollect what I gave them; I had got rid of all my small silver, and had nothing but 1s. 6d. and 3s. pieces left.</p>
               <p>TURNER. Warne said there were several of them - He could not say who took the watch; I have got the seal and key. He said the prisoner was the man who took his money before I searched him.</p>

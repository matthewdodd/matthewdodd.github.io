            . I am an officer; I am not related to the prosecutor; he lives in Plumbers-row, City-road. On the 17th of January, about five o'clock in the evening, I was opposite his house, and saw the prisoners in company, looking in at the window and door, and then come back again - there was another a little distance from them; I saw them both particularly engaged at one end of the window, as if they were cutting the glass; I saw Towell as if in the act of taking something from the window, and giving it to Dawkins; they turned, and went towards Plumbers-street- I went into the shop, then followed and took them at the corner of Plumbers-street - I had a good deal of trouble with Towell, and gave Dawkins to another to hold while I secured him; Dawkins escaped from that person; I called Stop thief! and Brown brought him back in two or three minutes; I found a knife on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not take another boy that night? A. Yes; one Blizard - that was quite in a different part of the evening; I took him for having a bundle till he could account for it - it turned out that he was innocent: he has been transported before, and I wanted to know if he had his legal discharge. I was about twenty-five yards from the prosecutor's shop - the lamps were all lighted; the knife found on Dawkins had putty on it - it has now crumbled off; and the point has been ground in a particular way; they were three or four minutes at the window.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was accidentally on the spot, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I turned, and saw Dawkins running: I secured him - he immediately threw something from his hand, which turned out to be two phosphorus boxes; I saw a little girl pick them up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he running when any thing dropped from him? A. He was running towards me; the girl is not here - there was too much confusion for me to take her name.</p>

The officer came in, and said we had been robbed; I looked and saw part of a pane of glass taken out - it was broken before, but the piece was not out in the morning: I missed several things from the window, but cannot swear to these boxes - we missed several of this sort.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there not thousands of that description about? A. Yes; I have no mark on them - the glass might have been broken by a person passing; the prisoner's parents have sent a glazier to mend the glass.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was that after you had given evidence at the office? A. No; before, I believe; but will not swear it.</p>

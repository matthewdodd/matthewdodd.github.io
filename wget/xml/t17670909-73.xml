               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you not tell?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. Because people told me they could not hurt me, as I had served seven years to the trade; and if I did not tell, they could go no farther; I did not tell for about a day and a half, then I informed Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a common thing in the watch trade to change the name and number, in order to palm bad watches for good ones?</p>

               <p>Q. to Burroughs. Can you tell when you altered the name of Mitchelson to Tomlin?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. I had them all from the prisoner in February and March, and the beginning of April.</p>
               <p>Note, The book contained the names and numbers of watches which he had taken out, and the other names put in on several watches.</p>

               <p>I served my time to a branch in the watch business, and I had two legacies left me, which enabled me to make up watches, these were all my own property; I never gave Burroughs any watches to alter the names.</p>
               <p>Q. to Burroughs. You hear what the prisoner says.</p>
               <p>Burroughs. These watches in my book the prisoner brought to me, to alter the names.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body here that can give any account of the prisoner bringing them to you?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. I lived in Allen street, and when I lived at the corner of Ball yard, my landlord can make it appear he has seen the prisoner come to me several times, and my wife can prove the same.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Eldon-street; my husband is a builder. A room in my house commands a view back of the Institution - on Sunday morning the 19th of May. I had been up all night attending to a sick lady in my house; and about a quarter-past three o'clock in the morning my attention was down towards the Institution - it was a harmful morning; it was the flowers on the tree lookout of window - the morning was clear, so that everything - (there is a gate or door in the passage, which separates the Institution-garden from the passage) - I saw that door open, and a hand introduced, and a beckoning motion was made in a direction towards Long-alley - my husband was at the window, at the same time, looking out - Mr. Hooper opened one window, and I opened the other, to see who they were beckoning to; we saw nobody - the door was shut and opened, and a beckoning made with the hand five or six times; and then the door opened, and a face looked out up the street, and down the street - the person had no hat on - the door was shut and opened three times, and every time I saw the same face put out, and had a distinct view of the face every time - it was the prisoner Sanderson - I am sure that is the man I saw look out - Mr. Hooper said something to me - I thought it was a love affair, and he thought it was a robbery - we directly called for the watch and police; the watchman stood at the lamp, and did not attend to our call - then the gate opened, and three men ran out together - they crossed to my side of the way, to get out of sight - we called out, Watchman, police, and thieves; and my husband did the same; and brought people out in all directions - the police came round the corner - they were all three then in sight in Queen-square, and the policemen ran after them - the prisoner Jones is very nigh the size of one of the persons running away - it was about five or ten minutes to three o'clock when I first saw them, and it was twenty minutes after that they ran out - I might have seen them for twenty minutes - it was about a quarter-past three o'clock when they ran out - I don't know that I said it was a quarter past three o'clock when I first went to the window - it was about twenty minutes after three o'clock when they ran away - I had been watching them about twenty minutes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say at first it was a quarter after three when you first looked out of window? A. I don't recollect it - being up all night, I knew the time very well indeed - I had got a clock close by me, and looked at it directly after they run away - I am sure it had not struck three when I first saw the hand - I had never seen Sanderson in my life before - I was very much alarmed the whole day - I was very ill through it - I am very sorry I could not get somebody to assist - my husband was not dressed, nor was I - I made more noise that night than I ever did before - it was me that disturbed the last witness - I was calling to the watchman to know what was the matter - I said at the police office that one of the persons was near the size of Jones - what I said was read over to me and I signed it; I said I do not swear to his face; I said he was near his size, I am sure - when they came out, they all had hats on; I could not see either of their faces then; they ran very fast - one had a brown coat on, but I could not see which it was - my window was so near the door which the head was put out of, I could see the face quite perfectly; I might be about fifty yards off; it was a beautiful fine morning; I saw the watchman directly we looked for him; we did not look for him till we saw the face; it was directly after the hand was put out the last time; the watchman was leaning against the lamp iron; it could not be half a minute; I turned my head and there he was; I had not looked at the lamp iron before - I began to call out after the hand was put out the last time; I beckenod to the watchman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040005"></xptr>and told him, there was something going on there, but he never moved; he stood opposite Wilson-street, which is the width of the Institution, to the other gate; he might be fifty or sixty yards from the door; it was so near that he could see me; he was a parish watchman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is he so now? A. I believe they turned him away; when I accused the watchman, he told me he was deaf and blind; I told him the parish had better pay him to lie in bed, and not to be about - I was dressed at that time; I had come down in the street; I had called out of the window before I came down; the policeman came directly round the corner, when I called, and said,"there they go."</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could the watchman see the hand put out where he stood? A. I have every reason to believe he did see it.</p>

             (policeman G 151). At half-past one on Sunday morning, the 19th of May, I was in Wilson-street, close to the Institution; I there saw three men walking along at a slow pace; Jones and Shaw were two of them; Shaw I am certain of; Jones I am almost certain of, but not so certain of him as the other; Sanderson is about the size of the third man - Shaw made an observation after he passed me, he said, "He did not care a d-n for no policemen; one of the two said "hold your tongue, he has said nothing to you, say nothing to him." They walked on and turned down Eldon-street, and there I saw them pass Long Alley, they were in my sight about ten minutes; I saw no more of them - Jones was dressed in a green coat, made in the Newmarket fashion; Shaw in a blue coat; the other man had a dark coat on.</p>

I was in Wilson-street on Sunday morning, the 19th of May; about ten minutes before four o'clock I saw nobody, but heard voices calling for watch and police - I went to the end of Wilson-street, and saw Mr. and Mrs. Hooper at their window still calling out, and saw three men running in a direction for Long Alley; I only saw their backs, and cannot identity any of them.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I heard the cry of watch and police, and saw three men run out of the gate of the Institution; I don't know either of them; I went into the Institution; I saw the property strewed about, as has been described, and saw the window shutters; they appeared to be bored outside to admit a man's arm.</p>

            . I am a married woman; I have come from prison to give evidence here; I have been committed for want of sureties; I know the house well, where Mr. Upcott lives and knew where he kept his property - I know the prisoner Sanderson very well, and I have a slight knowledge of the other two; I became acquainted with them through Sanderson - I had seen Sanderson about four years ago, but have known him more intimately for the last four months; I remember walking with him and Jones near the London Institution about a week before the robbery - previous to this I had met Sanderson on the Saturday fortnight before the robbery, and told him I was going to see a friend of mine; he asked me, where to; I said, to the London Institution, and told him I was almost afraid to go, because I was afraid I had offended Mr. Upcott, on account of some little circumstance; he asked me why I did not go and see, I said I would; I said I was going then; (this was a fortnight before the robbery); I made an appointment to meet Sanderson when I came away, and I went to Mr. Upcott's, and met Sanderson accordingly; he asked me if I had been; I said, yes; he asked, if I had seen him; I said, no; he asked me, what Mr. Upcott was; I told him, he was Librarian to the London Institution; he asked me, if he was a man of property; I told him, I did not know, but I believed he was a man that took a great deal of pride in some gold coins which he had got - nothing further passed at that time, but about a week afterwards, as near as I can recollect; I met Sanderson by appointment; he took me down to Jones's house, at the bottom of Holborn-hill, and I there saw Mr. and Mrs. Jones; and Sanderson asked Jones, if he would like to take a walk, as he was going to take a walk; Jones made answer, that he had no objection, and we all three came out to take a walk, Sanderson, Jones, and myself; leaving Mrs. Jones at home - when we got as far as Long-lane, Smithfield; I said "Where are we going to?" Jones said he wanted to go round Finsbury-square; we went that way, and went to see the Catholic chapel; he said he had never seen it, and should like to see it; it is near the London Institution - we came round by the Catholic chapel, and walked round till we came to the back of the London Institution; then Sanderson asked me, if that was not where my friend lived; I said, yes, it is, and those are his rooms which you can see; and then he asked me, which was the room he kept his property in, and I told him the room in the hall - Jones and Sanderson desired me to walk on a little, and they stood at the rails for the space of two minutes; I walked on; he asked me where the family slept.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say he asked you, were the others by all the time, joining in the conversation? A. Yes, it was a conversation among us all three - I told him I did not know, but I believed at the top of the house; he asked me if anybody slept down stairs; I told him the porter and his wife - nothing further passed then. - I read in a newspaper of the robbery, a day or two after the robbery;(it was nine or ten days after teh day we took the walk,) and from the description it gave of Sanderson, I went immediately to him where he lodged; I asked him if he knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040006"></xptr>anything of Mr. Upcott's robbery; he said, "No, how came you to think of such a thing" - he said, he thought I was talking very foolish, and I had better go home, and he saw me home, and told me to meet him next morning, which I did accordingly; he said I was to meet him at the corner of the street where he lodged; he asked me then if I wanted any money; I said, yes, if he liked to give me some; he gave me 2l. and told me to buy myself a new dress; I went to buy the dress - he did not go with me - I went to see Mrs. Jones, and had a conversation with her; I know nothing more - I saw the prisoners when in custody; I was taken into custody myself, and told all I know about it, and the conversation I had with Mrs. Jones - when they were talking about the house and property, I told them Mr. Upcott kept nothing but papers in his room below - I never saw Shaw in Jones's or Sanderson's company; I have seen him speaking to them - Sanderson had on a black coat in general; I don't recollect noticing Jones's clothes - when I saw Shaw speaking to Sanderson, I think he had on a blue coat, and yellow buttons; I can positively say that - Sanderson represents himself to be a working jeweller.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Shaw has a blue coat and yellow buttons on now, has not he? A. Yes; it is a very common dress - I don't know why I told Sanderson that Mr. Upcott kept nothing but papers below - he asked me where he kept his property - I don't know why I said he kept nothing but papers below - I am a married woman - I am not living with my husband; Sanderson had given me money before, but not to that amount; he had not given me money often before - about twice I suppose; I never was in Mr. Upcott's service, nor living in the house, nor in the Institution; Mr. Upcott has shown me where the papers were - I have been in service - I have left my husband two years; I have not been in service those two years - part of that time I have been at home with my father and mother, and part of the time with a friend that has taken care of me - I swear that - that is the only way I have got my living since I left my husband.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to get money from Sanderson twice? A. He offered me the money, and I took it - I understand what you mean; I have been living with my friend at No. 3, Weston-place, Paddington - I have lived there about two months - I cannot swear that I have been there three months - I will swear that I have been there one month; I was at my father's house frequently after parting from my husband - it is more than six months ago since I left my father's house; I lived with my friend since that time - I lived with that friend in Duke-street - I have been living entirely with that friend since I left my father's house; I know a man named Maze - that is the person I am living with - Sanderson is no relation of mine - it was while I was living with Maze that he gave me the money - Maze is about thirty years of age - he is no relation of mine - we are living together as man and wife; I believe Sanderson had no reason for giving me money but pure friendship - I swear that I don't know of any other reason - I understand you; I believe it was pure disinterestedness that made him give me the money - I cannot say whether it was two or three times - I don't recollect more than three; I am sure he has not given me money six times.</p>

             (policeman E 86). On the 29th of May, I went to the Crown public-house, St. Giles', at six o'clock in the morning, and saw the three prisoners (Huggleston was with me), I told them I wanted them, which means that I intended to take them into custody; Jones and Shaw came out at one door of the house (there are two doors to the house), I thought Sanderson was following them, but I found afterwards that he had run out at the side door; I pursued him - he ran down Crown-street, along Sutton-street, towards Soho-square - while I was pursuing him, I saw him take something out of his pocket and throw it away as he ran - I heard it jingle like iron on the stones - I could not stop to pick it up - I saw it lying on the ground, it was a crow-bar- it was like this (looking at one) - and as he ran along Soho-square, I saw him throw something more away down an area - I heard that jingle - I secured him, and took him to the station-house; I got over the area and found two skeleton keys - I received four skeleton keys from somebody else.</p>

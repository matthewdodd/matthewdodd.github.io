            . I live in Westmoreland-street. On the 7th of June, at half-past eight o'clock, a person came and told my mistress the prisoner had taken some pots from the doors in the street - I followed her, and in Little Mary-lebone-street I asked her if she had taken a pot off the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110102"></xptr>railing; she said she had not been in the street - I followed her on to Bulstrode-street; she there called another woman - I saw she had something in her apron before she spoke to that woman.</p>

            . I was going along Welbeck-street, and this lad called me to follow the prisoner down to Old Cavendish-street, and on to Shepperd-street - I then went and asked what she had got; she gave me one pot of Mr. Tomsey's and said, "Let me go" - the boy said she had some more, and I found a quart and a pint pot of Mr. Williamson's in her apron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told you to stop the woman in the red cloak; she gave me them to hold. Witness. There was a woman in a red cloak who spoke to the prisoner, but I did not know where she was gone - I did not see the prisoner and the woman meet, but they were speaking together.</p>

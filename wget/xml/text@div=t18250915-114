On the 26th of July the prisoner came to my house - my wife came backwards to call me to speak to him - he said he had called to know if any body had been there about same business - I said "No" - he asked if I should be at home in the evening about nine o'clock - I said that was my time to be out in general - he said if a person calls, tell him I have called, and he left some name, but I forget what - he had been standing in our middle room, where we had some spoons - the next day a pair of spoons were found at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How many spoons had you there? A. About three table-spoons, and eight or nine tea-spoons; my wife missed two of them; she is not here.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to John Dicker, a pawnbroker, of Three-colt-street. The prisoner came to our shop, on Friday, the 26th of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and offered a pair of table-spoons to pawn; they were greasy, which led me to suspect; I asked his address; he said Jones, 12, Jamaica-place, Commercial-road; I asked him if they were his own; he said "My own! to be sure; where's the master of the house, I'll talk to him;" we then sent for master, who put several questions to him; he said the property was his own, they had not been lately used, and were used with vinegar last; but upon being told that they had been used with gravy, he denied it; I then offered to go with him to his residence, and went part of the way, but he appeared as if he would not take me to his house, and I told him to return, which he did; he then said his name was Wilson, and desired to have the spoons, or one pound for them; an officer was procured, and he was desired by Mr. Wyatt to attend next morning with two witnesses, to say where he got them; he attended with one; he gave his true address to the Magistrate - "William Ross, Commercial-road;" the Magistrate then allowed him to go and bring two persons, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not go again the next day? A. Yes he did, but he was ordered to appear again.</p>

            . I am watch-house-keeper. On the 26th of July the prisoner was brought to me; I asked how he came to go by three names; he then said that his name was Ross, of No. 14, Jubilee-place; I sent an officer with him to the Magistrate; on the Saturday I found who the spoons belonged to, and the Magistrate ordered me to apprehend him again if I saw him; I found him on the Monday in the Commercial-road; he said he was then going to get two friends.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. To the best of my knowledge these are our spoons, but I cannot swear to them. I have one more, but they are not marked.</p>
               <p>Q. From what circumstance do you think they are your spoons? A. Because my mother bought a duplicate of a person, and I got them out of pawn.</p>

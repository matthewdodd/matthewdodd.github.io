               <p>Q. During the time that you were there, was Mr. Bullock refused to any other person besides yourself. - A. There were people came in with bills of payment; they were told that he was out likewise.</p>

He said that it was on an aukward business that he had up the Baltic; some payment of money; I could not rightly understand him. I understood that was the case. I believe he had forwarded some rum to a man up the Baltic; he said there were bills coming due, that was the reason he was there, and did not attend the accompting house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. How long did you live with him. - A. It was the 2nd of last March when I commenced with him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time when you proved the act of bankruptcy you was a creditor. - A. I was.</p>

            ; I remember no other payments but rent and servants wages, which might amount to an hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you in the month of May assigned over or transferred any thing except sales in the ordinary course of your dealing. - A. I sold and transferred to Wallis, Lang, and company, all my stock and trade; to Mr. Ralph, a dock warrant for ten puncheons of brandy and rum; and nothing else has been signed or transferred by me in any other manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other consignment coming forward. - A. None. The property delivered to Messrs. Ralph, the dock order, was on the 6th of April, and the dock order of brandy was on the 6th of May. Mr. Low in law expences and money advanced by him in law proceedings.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other effects besides Scot's yard, and at Dulwich. - A. None, except a trunk and a pair of drawers. containing bed linen, wearing apparel, and some little plate, of which I cannot give an account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Here is a warrant that is not signed in the London docks. - A. That was given me the next day, or the day after, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the book there in that examination marked A.- A. This is it. (Producing it).</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined that book carefully. - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear to be a regular kept book. - A. Yes, and the balance is carried forward to the next month.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the balance that is brought forward to the 1st of May. - A.1701.</p>
               <p>Q. The same balance of course is carried forward from the latter end of April to the beginning of May. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What appears to be the difference in the month of June. - A. Eleven hundred, forty-eight pounds and eleven pence halfpenny; but the balance at the time of examination was different, because there has been some addition since.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the balance then. - A. Twelve hundred pounds and a fraction. The entries appear to be the same hand writing, which is Wallis, who used to keep his books.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the second meeting of the commissioners on the 23d of June - did he attend then. A. I believe not, I did not see him. Indeed he told me that he did not attend; he did not think it requisite. I cannot say his exact words, but I have an impression on my mind.</p>

             so much money that would make in the whole one thousand and fifty pound, because he had borrowed of him at different times money to that amount, and that Mr Jones was a particular friend of his, and he considered it a matter of honour to repay it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said respecting the assignees applying to Mr. Jones for the payment of that money - A. I believe there was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say upon that subject. - A. The exact language I cannot recollect; but he wished not for the application to be made by the assignees to Mr. Jones, but that he himself would apply for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the assignees request him to do with respect to his affairs in general. - A. I have a minute in writing of the proceedings on the 24th of January (the memorandum read) that Mr. Bullock do bring the cash book and adjust the bills, and make out the debts in town separate, and the different bills owing in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any such thing. - A. Not to my knowledge. I believe Mr. Wallis made out the list of the town and country debts. The bankers checks were not made up; the cash book was never brought up, and the deficiency at present is eleven hundred odd pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you as solicitor ever received from the bankrupt that eleven hundred, odd pounds. - A.Certainly not, nor any part.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor has any person received it on the part of the estate. - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the last meeting of the commissioners upon the 18th of July. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bankrupt appear then. - A. He did not, or else I should have seen him (this is the certificate of the commissioners.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. When these questions and answers were taken down, I ask you whether he did not state that he did not wish to prejudice the commission. - A. No; I think not.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160037"></xptr>Q. Do not you remember his saying something of that sort. - A. No, he showed a reluctance of being examined.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether he did not state - I give these answers to the best of my judgment at the moment, but I must have power afterwards to rectify them, and then the next day he gave you that memorandum, the next day as something that mistook his recollection. - A. I do not think he did; but it is very probable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at any time do any more than bankrupts do ask for time. - A. No more I believe it was explained to him that without that surrender he could not obtain his commission (the memorandum read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you afterwards search for them things. - A. Oh no.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been able to recover these things. - A. Mr. Bullock gave me, that has being an advance; Mr. Bullock has not secreted this.</p>

               <p>Q. Who applied to you. - A. Mr. Garth; I went down to Leith, in Scotland, after him; I arrived there on the 23d of July. On getting to Leith, I applied to Pith and Co's. wharf about some packages arriving in the name of Brown; the packages were landed, and lying on the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any directions on the packages. - A. I think merely the name of Brown; there were sixteen packages on the wharf; these are two of the directions they are similar to this.</p>
               <p>Q. You can speak to these being two of the cards. - A. Yes, they are all similar, they were all unloaded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time see Mr. Bullock. - A. I saw him that evening; I waited for his coming for them; when he came he went on board the packet, I went on board too, he claimed the goods, and brought some men to take the goods away. I took him in custody, he said, he had got a protection, he shewed it me; this is it; (the paper read) signed G.

               <p>Q. What was it that he wished you to do or say respecting a thousand pounds - A. I supposed he wished me to say if any body asked me, if he owed me a thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do not tell what you suppose; the thing is what he said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney Give us as near as you can the substance of what past between him and you. - A. He expressed this walking along that he owed me a thousand pounds, and he had honourably repaid me; he just mentioned it in a kind of discourse. There was no further words passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that true he had borrowed a thousand pound and paid you. - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever live in Church-street - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Elizabeth Jones in Bond-street, Westminster. - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told me generally that you did not receive of the prisoner a thousand and fifty pounds, did he ever make you a payment of a thousand pounds, of five hundred pounds, or of two hundred and fifty pounds. - A. He never did.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury. It seems to appear that the law does not allow my counsel to urge what I might have to say in my defence, perhaps for me very unfortunately. Gentlemen, you have heard the evidence that has been adduced in support of the prosecution; you have also heard the objections that have been stated; you must be aware that men like me, unaccustomed to speak in public, must feel greatly at a loss; and the state of my mind, which is not most at ease, I trust will have some weight, and no undue consideration with you, when you consider what I have got to say. I flatter myself, while I am addressing a tribunal like this, all of them Englishmen, that if I state any thing that is not correct, in point of form, or any thing that I may have omitted for my defence, will not be forgotten by you.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it is not unworthy your notice, one thing I shall state to you. It is for the breach of an act of parliament, for which I am accused I will say that law is severe, it is partial. You, gentlemen, are like myself, men that get your living by buying and selling. There is every man, even the greatest bulk of society, may buy as many goods of you and me, and other tradesmen, they may pledge them, keep them, embezzle them in any way they may think fit; there is no criminal attachment to them, they may go to prison, and live upon our property. It seems to me very hard, when we, who are subject to so many misfortunes, should be liable to loose our lives, when they may go at large; I trust that will have some consideration with you; I am coming now to speak to you of the motive under which I I have acted; and you will surely while I am doing that fully and freely excuse me of going into general matters. In the first place, I did not consider myself insolvent; for that reason I did not wish to be a bankrupt. This I think you have heard in evidence; I am not aware that any act of bankruptcy I ever committed; I did not in this go on by my own judgment, it was upon the repeated opinion of my solicitors, and whom I believe there is none in the profession more respectable than these gentlemen I am quoting, Messrs. Cooper and Low in Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this refers with more peculiarity to my situation after I had been declared a bankrupt, and it may be worth my while to make an observation upon the evidence upon which I was declared a bankrupt. It struck me in this way; the law has expressed on that subject, as I have since heard, that a creditor cannot be an acting man to establish a bankruptcy; that gentleman who did give that evidence, on which that declaration was founded, has since been found to be a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160040"></xptr>creditor to the amount of one hundred and fifty pounds, and in this court he has averred that he was a creditor; then, perhaps, it does not become me to reason on the subject I am bound to give an historical account of facts I reasoned in this way, my lord, and gentlemen of the jury that if a commission of bankruptcy, issued against me, upon evidence that was not legal; that every proceeding upon that declaration must in itself be illegal also. Under that evation did I refuse to attend the summons of the commissioners, and when compelled by force, I made them terms. Gentlemen, I am not insolent; I have committed no act of bankruptcy, I will not submit to be examined; the answer was, you have no alternative, but to submit, or to be committed to Newgate; for that is our duty; my answer was, gentlemen is is immaterial to me whether you do or not; and when I submitted to be examined, it was with this condition, that whatever I might say with regard to the state of my affairs, in answer to any of those questions that were put to me, that I should at any future time be at liberty to revise and correct. I confess that when I made these conditions I did intend to revise the examination; I at the said time, when I entered into the said examination, was not aware it had so much consequence, as I see it has to day; I considered myself at liberty, to revise and to correct them; I hope you will take this with what I before said, not considering myself insolvent, I avoided any further examination.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen I think I may with some propriety state by way of refuting the allegation, that I have acted with no intention to defraud my creditors; I may state to you that it never was my intention to defraud my creditors; and this, I shall not state without calling evidence to prove it. When I met the gentlemen, who are now my petitioning creditors, I told them I was not insolvent, I was applied to by Mr. 
               <persName id="t18070916-48-person490">

            , to give in the state of of my affairs; I told them I was averse, and never had been of committing an act of bankruptcy; but if nothing else would do, I would give up my whole estate, without being insolvent After this declaration of bankruptcy was made against me, day after day, was I hunted to attend upon the assignees; two or three times did I attend upon them; every time I met them, they and their solicitor, imposed new difficulties, and new hardships. In short it was carried on in that way, that the intent was not to get a full and fair disclosure of my estate, as to drive me into some corner, as would drive me into the prosecution I am now in. I therefore discontinued attending their meetings, I disregarded their summons's; still under the notion, that I was illegally declared a bankrupt, and that I was not an insolvent man, I still kept in my mind that I would resist. This was the ground and motive upon which I acted which will be satisfactorily proved to you, and when I have done that, I trust and hope that the breach of the vindictive part of the act of parliament, will appear to you to be done without manifesting any intention of defrauding my creditors; I trust that will have its due weight with you. Gentlemen, it may not be altogether foreign to the purpose; when I state to you that so far from showing a total disinclination to account to the creditors; that when the officer apprehended me, he having no warrant against me, I made no resistance; he said he was come to take me; well, I said take me; in this he will not contradict me.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it may be asked why I went to Scotland; I will state my reasons, and my motive. Having as alledged against me, refused to attend the meeting of the assignees, they threatened me all manner of things; and particularly one of the assignees, threatened me in these words; that on the 18th, he should take care that I should not be to look after. I thought it a hard case, acting as I did, I was doing no wrong, not submitting as I thought to a hard case; considering myself innocent, I was unwilling to submit to so long imprisonment, with this idea I went to Scotland, with a firm and determined purpose of returning in December, and to stand while the commission was disputed; which I was conscious would be the case.</p>
               <p>There was another view, gentlemen, which by no means appear unnatural; had I surrendered on the 18th, I must have given up every thing, or have perjured myself; it was not unnatural, to reason in this way; here is a great many months, I must be stripped of ever thing for no purpose; for when the courts of law again meet, it will be disputed, and it will be upset and while that is going forward, I and my family must be starving; I do not mean to urge this in point of law, because I am no lawyer. I considered an aged parent a tender offspring, that when there is no provision for them, I trust you will not think unreasonable in me for to think myself fairly entitled to be the guardian, of whatever little property is left rather than to squander, it away in law; I wish you understand me in the way I mean it, and the way in which I understood the act of bankruptcy, as declared against me. It occured to me the furious proceedings of the gentlemen who conducts this prosecution of the invalidity of the commission that was one reason more why I was induced to resist it prowers. Gentlemen I apprehend it would be idle to occupy much more of your time; I have stated to you, the spirit in which I was guided; I therefore believe I had better call the evidence to justify what I have said, and then to leave myself in your hands; I have no doubt but that I shall meet with all the justice that my case can meet with.</p>

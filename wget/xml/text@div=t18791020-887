I was present when the deposition of Michael Butler was taken by Mr. Barstow, the Magistrate, at the Royal Free Hospital, on Thursday, 25th September, in the prisoner's presence—it was read over and signed by Butler—the prisoner asked him some questions—Butler died on the following Saturday. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of Michael Butler was read as follows</hi>: "I live at 10, George Street, Gray's Inn Road. On Monday last, the 22nd instant, I was at the lodging house where the prisoner lives, a common lodge, 45, Vine Street, St. Andrew's, Holborn. A eon of mine lodges there. I was in the kitchen giving my son advice and telling him that some one was leading him to destruction, when the prisoner, who was present, took my son's part and told me to "Get out ot the b——house." I said I came in and out of the house before he ever came there. I don't remember any more being said, but the prisoner then struck me several times on the face and knocked me down. I then saw a table knife in his hand; he struck it on the table and bent it, and in a minute or two afterwards he put his hand into bis pocket and drew out a pocket knife, opened it, and struck me with it on the groin on the left side. I felt blood run down into my boots, and I said 'You have done it' I walked out, got a policeman, and gave him in charge. In the presence of the policeman he said 'That is the knife I done it with, and if I had had a bayonet in my hand I should have done it all the same.' <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I do not remember striking, my son in the Blue Posts, I might have done so. I do not remember pulling off my coat to fight the prisoner outside the Blue Posts; I never saw the prisoner till afterwards outside the Blue Posts. I did not follow the prisoner into the lodging-house; I did not hit him till he hit me; he swore he would grease his boots with the fat of my guts. I did not strike him first in the kitchen, I strongly deny it. When he struck me I returned the blow. He struck me two or three times. I did not pull the table knife out of my coat pocket, and the prisoner did not say 'If you can use a knife so can I' The only knife I saw bent was the one that I bent on the table. I did not try to hide my knife after the prisoner penetrated me. I had no knife only a small pocket knife which is in my pocket now, and I never took it out of my pocket.") I found this small white-handled knife.</p>

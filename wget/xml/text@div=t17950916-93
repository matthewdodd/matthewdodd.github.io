He came down to the outer door warehouse, and called me by my name, and said he was going, I came to him immediately to examine him, as is our usual way, I examined his pockets and about his waist, I found nothing, I felt on his arms something like raw coffee on each arm, the small part above the elbow, I felt his breast, and I felt there likewise coffee, as I supposed it to be; on that I told him I could not let him pass, he attempted to run up stairs, I followed him, and brought him into the counting house, he pulled off his coat, a string was tied round each arm above the elbow, which I untied, and a quantity of raw coffee fell out, he then pulled his shirt out of his breeches, and there likewise fell a quantity of raw coffee from his breast; Mr. Leave was present, an excise locker, and Mr. Cortissos.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have got a great impediment in my speech; this coffee that I am charged with, is a little raw dirty coffee, we cannot help spilling the coffee in coopering the casks, and if I had put it into the casks I might have spoiled the sale of it; I thought I might make free to take it to my family to clean, for I have got a very large family, four children.</p>
               <p>Q. To Bobum. Was it clean coffee at the time you found it? - Yes, it is clean now.</p>

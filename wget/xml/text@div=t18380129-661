                  </hi>. I am a leather-seller, and live in Union-street, Bo<lb></lb>rough. The prisoner had been in my employ, at weekly wages, about four years—I altered it about eight or nine months since at his own request—I then appointed him collector of my small debts—he was to have 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—he was a lame man, and he had to keep two horses—he did not deduct this shilling in the pound every week—he had what he wanted from me, without any regard to the collecting; that was to be settled at the end of the year—he kept a book, and if he was home before the ware<lb></lb>house closed at night, he was to enter the small debts he had collected, but if not he was to do it the first thing in the morning, and to hand the money over to me—I had a customer of the name of Page—on the 3rd of October he accounted for 10*. received from him—he never accounted at any other time for the rest of the payment of 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or the other money to make up the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had no money from him on the 10th of Oc<lb></lb>tober on Mr. Page's account—I had a clerk of the name of Whiffin, whose duty it was to keep the ledger—the prisoner only made entries in this ledger on one occasion, when the clerk tore the nail off his finger—he had no business to make entries in the ledger, except on that one occasion—I have perceived in Mr. Page's account in the ledger alterations in some of the sums—I should think they are in the prisoner's handwriting, but I would not swear it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am general manager to the prosecutors—the prisoner was in their employment about three months, and had care of the stables and hones—I never authorized him to sell or shoot any of the horses—I asked him, on 30th March, if he had sold or offered for sale any horse or horses belonging to the firm—his reply was that he had done nothing of the sort; that he was aware such rumours were about, but they were entirely without foundation—every six months we take a general stock; this happened to be at the time of the general stock taking—it was the prisoner's duty to hand in, on 31st March, an account of the stock with respect to the horses—we did not receive it from him, in consequence of which I received this note from him—it was put in evidence at the police court—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Sir, I am so unwell that I cannot attend to my duties this day, but I hope to be able to do so to-morrow, and trust my absence may not cause you any inconvenience.—<hi rend="largeCaps">G. D</hi>. Bond")—information was given me which led me to go and see a milkman named Mitchell, who I found had possession of one of my master's hones—I did not see the prisoner from that time till after he was apprehended—I went to his house previously, and was unable to find him there—he was taken into custody by my direc<lb></lb>tions either on the Tuesday night or the Wednesday morning—the two horses, which are the subject of this inquiry, had been, up to the 1st March, in my employer's stables, and had been daily used—I cannot possibly say when I saw them last—I saw two horses at the police court; they were my employer's property—I had seen them in my employer's possession within a week of the prisoner's apprehension—I saw them some time in March—one was a grey hone, and the other was a kind of a brown or bay.</p>

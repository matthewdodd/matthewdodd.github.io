On the 8th of December last, a few minutes before six o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in my parlour behind the shop, with my family, which shop is part of my dwelling-house, and heard the shop-window smash, upon which I immediately went to the shop-door, but found it fast-it was tied to the paling, I saw the rope; one boot was gone from the shop, which had hung over the pane of glass that was cut-it was dark at the time; I had seen that boot hanging there in the course of the day.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Could a person reach it by putting their hand through a pane of glass-A. Yes, when the pane of glass was broken, it touched the square of glass when it was hanging up. I was pulling at the door to get it open when Teasdale cut the rope, and brought the prisoner into the shop by the collar.</p>

            . I am a headborough of the parish of St. Pancras. I know the prosecutor's shop in Cromer-street. I saw some persons about his shop on the evening of the 8th of December. I saw the prisoner at the bar, and another man with him-they passed his shop repeatedly, and looked into the window several times; at the time the window was broken I stood in a passage nearly opposite, and saw them go up to the window, and heard the window break; the moment I heard it break I crossed the road, seized the prisoner, and took him into custody, the other man ran towards Gray's Ion-lane, but I had not sufficiently seen him to be able to swear to him. I have an opinion in my own mind who it was, but I cannot swear to him. When I took the prisoner into the shop his hand was bleeding a little, at the thumb point, and he had a white handkerchief about it. I took him to Hatton-garden office.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Hatton-garden. I searched the prisoner, and examined his hand also; the thumb of his right hand was fresh cut, and the little finger of his left hand was bleeding; he had a handkerchief round his right hand, which has the marks of blood on it now; those marks were wet at the time I took it from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a sore that had been knocked off, and it was that which was bleeding.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THISSELTON re-examined. The thumb was cut, but the little finger of the left hand had a sore, which had been knocked off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Mr. Adams, the brickmaker, to take an order for Mr. Duggins, and as I was walking along Mr. Teasdale laid hold of me, and took me into the shop. I know nothing whatever about the business.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TEASDALE re-examined. Jury. Q. Did you see these men tie the door-A. No, I did not see them tie it; I could not, as it was dark low down; but I saw them stoop several times. I took the rope.</p>

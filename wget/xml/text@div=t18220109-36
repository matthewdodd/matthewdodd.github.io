             lodges with me. On Sunday, the 23d of November, my wife and son went to church, and about half-past eleven o'clock, I and my youngest son left home to go to church also. We occupy one room up stairs, and one below. I locked the door of the room where all this property was, and put the key in my pocket. The window is about four feet from the ground. Only one pane at the top opens to admit the air; that was also shut. I do not know whether I left any body in the house. I came home first, about one o'clock, and found the room-door open. A drawer was open, which was shut when I went out. The bolt of the lock stood out. I found an eight-day clock taken off the bracket, but not taken out of the room. The cupboard doors, where I had locked the property, were wide open. I missed twelve sovereigns, one guinea, with the impression nearly worn off, a 1 l. note, 4 l. in silver, and 30 s. in copper. The silver was in one green baize bag, and the gold and note in another; the copper was tied in 5 s. papers, with packthread round them. I alarmed the house - Mrs. Allen came down with several other lodgers. I went with Cooper, the officer, to the Rising Sun, public-house, Bedfordbury, about four o'clock, and waited there; the prisoner came in about a quarter before five; Cooper took him, and found the green bag, which had contained the silver, on him - there were nine sovereigns, the smooth guinea, one 1 l. note, and 4 l. in silver, in it. I knew the guinea and the note - it had my own writing on it;</p>
               <p>"Nesbitt, 33, Oxford-street," was on it. The prisoner had lodged with me for two years; we were intimate; his father lodged with me before that time. He had been in my room about nine or ten o'clock on the Saturday night, and at that time, I had three sovereigns and the guinea in a glass on the mantle piece.</p>

            . I lodged at the prosecutor's. On Sunday the 23d of December I was at home all day with my husband. I went down stairs about eleven o'clock, and was called down again at one. I went at eleven o'clock to make the prisoner's bed, but he was not up; he lodged on the first floor, and is a locksmith. I made his bed at twelve o'clock; he was gone out then. He had locked his door, and put the key under the mat.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. Goddard came to me; I went with him to the Rising Sun public-house, Bedfordbury; the prisoner came in at a quarter before five o'clock; I took him. On our way to the watch-house, I asked him where he had been since he left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090022"></xptr>home; he said, in the Park. I asked who he joined in the Park; he said, Nobody. I asked where he had dined; he said, he did not know that he had dined any where. I asked whether he had any more money in his pocket than he could account for; he said, No. Upon searching him, I found a green baize bag, containing nine sovereigns, a smooth guinea, 4 l. in silver, and a 1 l. note; and in his pocket, 17 s. more. I undressed him to search him, and asked if he could account how he got it; he said, Yes. I took him into another room, and then he said he picked it up in the bag in the passage, as he was going out, between eleven and twelve o'clock. I again asked him where he had dined; he at last said he had dined with a man named Johnson, but declined telling me where he lived. I found two keys on him, one of which opens the door of his own room.</p>

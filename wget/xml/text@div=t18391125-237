                  </hi>. I am employed on the London and Greenwich railway, and live in Charles-street, Deptford. I keep rabbits, and lost two a little before two o'clock on the 25th of October—I had seen them the night before—my garden meets the gardens of the houses in Waterloo<lb></lb>place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty at Deptford in the New Cross-road on the 25th of October—I met the prisoner at ten minutes after one o'clock at night—there was something apparently alive in his arms—I stopped him, asked him what he had got, and a live rabbit fell from the front of his shirt—he had another in his arm—I took them both in my charge—I asked him how he got them—he said, "They are mine, I bought them at Chatham"—he was four houses from Waterloo<lb></lb>place—I took him to the station-house—I afterwards went into the garden of one of the houses behind Charles-street, and saw marks of naked feet in the garden of No. 8, and also in the prosecutor's garden—the prisoner had no shoes on when I met him—I compared the length and breadth of the footmarks in the prosecutor's garden, and it corresponded with his feet.</p>

            . I am a carman. On Tuesday night the 11th of March, I was in bed, and was knocked up by some one who said there were thieves in Mr. Dyball's house next door to me; I went with Mr. Bee and examined the premises - we saw a parcel of old sashes broken, which had been taken from the second floor - we went round to Dyball's; he came with us and searched the premises; on coming away, I said, I had seen the prisoner on the Sunday, taking out some at the back premises - Dyball said, "He lives up here;" we went up to his apartment - he was in bed; they went in and I staid outside - they brought out this old frame and glass which we took to the watch-house; I did not hear the prisoner say anything.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is there not a thoroughfare through the empty house to mine? A. It ought to be kept fastened, but I have seen it open.</p>

            . I went to the prisoner's bed-room and found these parts of sash-frames; he said nothing about them; I took him to the watch-house - I have matched the pieces to the house, they all correspond - I had information, and got up, and saw a light.</p>
               <p>DANIEL DYBALL. I swear these are my property; they were in the fore part of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was there a fire in my room? A. Very little, if any.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There is no yard to my house; I went to bed that night very soon after nine - my wife staid up; she had to go to the cellar, and seeing these pieces thrown down, she brought them up in her apron, and put some on the fire.</p>

I went out to the gate; I left the door open, and when I returned the watch was gone. I was not out of the house more than two or three minutes. I missed the watch immediately I returned.

            . I am an officer. On the 29th of July, I was coming up Tabernacle Walk, some distance from Mrs. Brown's house I saw the prisoner Garrett running; a mob was coming after him. I ran after him; he turned down Paradise-street; he ran through a court there; I catched him. I received information that he had stolen a watch; I asked him what he had done with it; he said he did not steal it, he had it of the other boy. I asked him what he had done with it; he said if I would go with him he would shew me where he had put the watch. I then met the prosecutrix, she had the watch in her hand. The watch had been picked up and given to her before I came to her. I have the watch now. The prosecutrix gave me the watch. Topping and Garret asked the prosecutor to forgive them; she said she would not. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my husband's watch; a strange person picked the watch up, and gave it me. I overtook Topping and Garrett in Tabernacle Row.</p>
               <p>Topping's Defence. I was very dry; I went up a passage, and into this lady's house; I found the door open; I asked for a drop of water; there was nobody within; I came out again, and asked the lady at the next door; she said what have you been in there for; I said I went in to ask for a drop of water; in half a minute after, there was an alarm after me that I had stolen the watch; I told them I had not.</p>
               <p>Garrett's Defence. I was going along the street; a constable came and look me, and said I had been stealing a watch; I said I had not. I never told any body the other boy gave it me; he had not.</p>

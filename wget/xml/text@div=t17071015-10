             to whom she directed the Prosecutors Family for her Character, that Enquiry was there made, and a good Account given of one of that Name who had Lived there; but it appeared that the Prisoner was not that Woman; that the Prosecutors Wife taking the Prisoner to be the true Jane Davis, Hired her into the Family on the 7th of July last. That Friday Morning following about 5 a Clock the Prisoner arose, went into her Mistress's Dressing Room, (where the Buckle was laid) to Scour the Irons, that between 5 and 6 a Clock the Prosecutors Footman, who lay in an Out-House, Knocked at the Door, and was let in by the Prisoner: That the Prisoner told him she had some privacy to impart to him, and took him down into the Kitchen, that when they were there, she told him she had something to say to the Cook first, and pretended to go up to her, but made use of that Opportunity to go off. The Evidence deposed that the Goods were safe, late the Night before, but were missing the Moment the Prisoner was gone. That the Prisoner some time after this offer'd a Buckle to Sale, for the use of one Mrs. Plat, that she did not show it the Person she offered to, but described it by its having 8 Great Diamonds, and 13 Little ones. That the Jeweller, which made the Buckle, Produced in Court the Model of the Prosecutors Buckle, which agreed exactly with that which the Prisoner Offer'd to Sell: And it appear'd that Mrs. Plat did not employ the Prisoner to Sell any Buckle for her. The Prisoner in her Defence denyed that ever she was at the Prosecutors House, and brought Witness, who endeavour'd to prove that she was else where when the Fact was Committed. To Invalidate which Evidence, 8 Persons belonging to the Prosecutors Family Deposed that the Prisoner was the very Person that came to the Prosecutors<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="17071015003"></xptr>House on the 7th of July, by the Name of Jane Davis, and was gone when the Goods were missing.

            . I was at the Bull's-head public-house; I observed the prosecutor asleep - the prisoner offered me a glass of beer - I had no knowledge of him, but I drank with him; he then filled the glass again and broke it - he said,"Don't say anything, I will say it was him that broke it, I will see if he has any money in his pocket to pay for it" - I said, "Don't do that" - he said, "Oh, we are friends;" he then took some silver and copper out of the prosecutor's pocket, but I don't know to what amount - the landlady then came in, she saw the glass was broken, and demanded payment, and the prisoner paid 8d. for it out of the money he took from the prosecutor's pocket - I don't know what he did with the rest of the money, but he called for a pennyworth of gin, and said that the young man in the parlour would pay for it when he awoke, and when the prosecutor awoke, he missed his money.</p>

I am an out-fitter, and live in the Minories—about Whitsuntide a person representing himself to be Edward Williams called on me, and said he lived at No. 185, Ratcliff-highway—I went to the house on the Monday, found it shut, and nobody in it—I think the person called on the Friday—three weeks or a month or more after, he came again, and after that second visit the prisoner and Williams came to me, I cannot say the date—he was introduced as the son or son-in-law of Williams——they selected goods, I can hardly say to what amount—the whole of the goods I sent in amounted to 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they left the selection partly to me—part were delivered on Friday—before the whole of the goods were delivered I went down on Saturday morning, and Williams said he sup<lb></lb>posed cash was acceptable at all times, and gave me four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—the prisoner was present—I applied to the prisoner for payment of the account as soon as all the goods were delivered—he told me that Williams had just gone out of town—I went almost day after day and saw the prisoner there—I saw them together—I do not recollect the day—the prisoner had told me that Mr. Williams had got some bills which he was going to get discounted—I cannot charge my memory whether Wil<lb></lb>liams or the prisoner told me if I came down at such a time he would settle my account—I believe they were both present—I went at the time appointed, Williams was not within—they were both present when the bill in question was given, I think it was |n the forenoon—Williams said I had been very untradesmanlike in pressing a respectable tradesman for cash so soon, and he should have no further dealings with me, he had not been able to get the bills discounted, but he had a bill more than the amount of my goods—he gave me that, and laid a particular stress on his words, saying, "Mind, I will not take the balance in goods, I will have it in money when the bill is paid"—it was for 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is it—my account was 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Williams laid the bill on the table, the prisoner took it up, and they had some conversation respecting the merits of the bill—I cannot say what it was, but both said that Captain Cutting was a respectable man, a captain of a vessel then at sea, but would be home before the bill became due, and the bill was for goods they had sold him, and he had several other bills and a deal of money laying out at the present time which was very hard to get in—the prisoner took the bill, and said, he thought Mr. So-and-So, mentioning a person's name, would cash the bill for me, if I allowed him 10 per cent.—there was an altercation about what 10 per cent would be—I said it was about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner said it would be 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took the bill, put it into my pocket, and thought, as he said the acceptor was a respectable man, I had better keep it than lose the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it.</p>

I was returning from an errand, and met a woman in the passage - I followed her out, and saw it was the prisoner - I did not see any thing with her; I spoke to my mother, and the caps were missed - I went out and found the prisoner near East Smithfield, and took one cap from her bosom - she then pulled three caps and a handkerchief from her bosom, and threw them into the street - a girl came by and took them up - the officer has them.</p>

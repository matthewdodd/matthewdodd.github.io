            . I work for Mr. Foster. On Wednesday, the 23rd of February, I saw the prisoner at work there when I went up to clean the room, and when I went down, he had absconded with all these things from the upper room - Mr. Foster had been out about two hours.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the afternoon these things were missed I asked for a pair of upper leathers, which were not ready - Mr. Foster said it would be a good opportunity for Mrs. Isaacson to clean the room; I went to take a walk, left the children playing in the room, and the things all safe - I had not so much as would pay for my lodging while I was there; had I had the tools I could have got work - I need not depend on Mr. Foster's charity.</p>

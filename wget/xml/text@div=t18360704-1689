                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jacob Metcalf, and keep a shop in Great Marylebone-street—on the 26th of June, between one and two o'clock I heard a noise in the shop—I went in and saw the prisoner—I saw the glass-case door open and some horns were taken out of the window—I laid hold of him—he begged for mercy, and took these six horn cups out of his two pockets and put them on the counter.</p>

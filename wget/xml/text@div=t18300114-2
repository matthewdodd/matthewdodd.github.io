               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you put it into your breast in the morning when you dressed? A. I had about half-past nine o'clock in the morning - it could not have slipped out; I am confident it was in my shirt at the time he stopped me; about half an hour before this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140004"></xptr>happened I took off my ruff, which was round my neck, and then felt the pin; the pin was not in the ruff - I had put it on about ten o'clock in the morning; I did not put it on or take it off by a glass - I distinctly felt the pin when I took my ruff off; I did not remove the pin, but felt it safe- I could not well untie the ruff without touching it; that is the reason why I say I touched it - Fish-street-hill was a good deal crowded; it happened just before the crossing, at the bottom of Fish-street-hill, at the corner of Lower Thames-street - he came bolt up against me, seized me, and charged me with running against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have come against each other? A.Certainly. When he laid hold of me he came against me; I attempted to pass him first on one side and then on another, but he kept before me, pushed down my hands, and extracted the pin - I did not see him with the pin, he kept me so fast; I was not aware where I was robbed - I asked if he intended to rob me while he was taking out the pin; I was sure I was robbed, and felt my pocket - I felt my watch safe, then missed my pin, and followed him; I turned round, and pursued him up Eastcheap; I went about three steps before I knew where I was robbed, but was confident I had been robbed - he kept my hands down, and I first felt for my money and watch, then felt my handkerchief, and missed my pin, which accounted for his holding me so fast by the throat; I had green spectacles - my sight was as perfect as it is now: I had a little inflammation in the side of my eye, not in the pupil - I asked him if he intended to throttle me; he held me fast by the neck, and kept my hands down - he was working as hard as he could in my throat; I thought I should be choked - my pin was fastened in as a pin, not as a brooch; I went about three steps before I ascertained where I had been robbed, and during that time my back was towards him - I had lost sight of him; I think I went three steps before I determined to follow him; I did not see him till I laid hold of him in Eastcheap; I went as fast as I could - he crossed over - I went up, and he was standing blowing at something, as if to ascertain the value of it: I laid hold of him instantly: I could not be mistaken in him - this might be three minutes after I was robbed; there was not a crowd, but the usual number of people - when I laid hold of him be knocked me off, and I called Stop thief! I had a little boy with me - the prisoner was immediately pursued; nothing was found on him.</p>

            . I am eleven years old. (The witness appeared to be sensible of the obligation of an oath.) I was in company with Mr. Grant; I saw Taylor come up to Mr. Grant - he caught hold of him by the collar, and said Mr. Grant had run up against him, which was not true, for I must have seen it if he had; Mr. Grant asked if he was going to throttle him - he was holding Mr. Grant by the collar for some seconds; in about two minutes Mr. Grant said his pin was lost - he went after the man; I followed, but could not overtake him - I was left behind a good way; I saw the prisoner after he was taken, and was quite sure he was the man who had attacked Mr. Grant; when he laid hold of Mr. Grant there was another man in his company who ran after Mr. Grant when he ran after the prisoner; I had not observed Mr. Grant's pin in his shirt.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have frequently seen the pin in the prosecutor's shirt, have not you? A. Yes - I had been with him from ten o'clock till half-past one; I did not know the prisoner before - I should not know the other man: I saw the prisoner more than him - he was behind; I only saw him run: I was behind Mr. Grant when I saw him run.</p>

            . I am a marshalsman. I apprehended the prisoner in Botolph-lane; I had been up a gateway, and seeing several people together when I came out, I went up, and found him in among them, charged with robbing Mr. Grant of his pin; Mr. Grant and the boy went with me to the Mansion-house - he was examined next day; I could not search him till I got him to the Mansion-house - I found nothing on him but 1s. and a pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>MR. GRANT. The pin was worth 2l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. How was it possible for me to abstract a pin from the prosecutor without his perceiving it? he stated in his deposition that he never missed his pin till he was out of the crowd, which stood across the road, and when he missed it he came up Fish-street-hill, met me and accused me of it; I told him I knew nothing of it, and asked him to let me go; he would not - I threw myself out of his hands, and fell down - he likewise slipped down- he accused me because he said he saw me looking at something in my hand. Is it feasible that I should stop a man in a public thoroughfare, in the middle of the day, and take property, without being detected? Gentlemen, either of you being on the spot might be as well accused as myself.</p>

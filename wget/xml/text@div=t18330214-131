             (Police-constable E 145). On the 17th of January, I heard that a man had drank a considerable quantity of brandy at the <placeName id="t18330214-131-crimeloc735">Hope public-house, Windmill-street, Bryanstone-square</placeName>

            . I am a carpenter. I was at the Hope in Windmill-street at four o'clock, and again at seven in the evening - I saw the deceased there, and about eight o'clock I saw him drink half a pint of brandy which the pot-boy had brought in; I suppose it was brandy, but I do not know - I know brandy was ordered; no one gave it to the deceased, or coaxed him to drink it - he took it off the table, said, "Here is all your healths," and drank it, without taking it from his mouth - he then got up, lighted his pipe at the fire, and I went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hear him say he was ready to drink another if any body would treat him? A. He said something to that effect.</p>

            . I am a medical student. I opened the body of the deceased; the stomach was partially inflamed, but the appearance of the brain accounted for his death more than any thing else - the vessels were very full, in consequence of the liquor he had drank; I could smell the brandy on the brain and the stomach - the brandy he drank occasioned his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you many cases of this kind? A. Not very many - many perpersons might take half a pint of brandy without injury, or even a pint; I should not think a coachman would be likely to know that half a pint of brandy would be injurious to him.</p>

            . I am pot-boy at the Hope. The deceased had been drinking there with his friends all day; I do not know when the prisoner came, but there were a good many people who were with the deceased more than the prisoner was - the deceased took the half-pint of brandy off the waiter I had in my hand, and drank it all up.</p>

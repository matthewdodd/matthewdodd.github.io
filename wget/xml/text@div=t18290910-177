Between twelve and one o'clock at night, I lost a pocket-book and four sovereigns from my waistcoat pocket - I was not drunk: I had been drinking at Spring's public-house, in Holborn, for about an hour and a half, with my brother - I only drank ale; we had some spirits with the prisoner - it got late, and rained very hard; I asked Mrs. Spring if she could accommodate me with a bed - she could not; I met the prisoner in the street, and went into a private house in <placeName id="t18290910-177-crimeloc995">Gloucester-place</placeName>

            . I am a watchman. Spring keeps the Castle in High Holborn - I was sent for a little before five o'clock in the morning, to No. 12, Gloucester-court; it is a common house - the prosecutor had called the watchman, who called me; I found the prosecutor standing at the street-door - he said he had been robbed of a pocket-book and four sovereigns, by a woman up stairs, who he had been with; I went up with him to the room he said he had been in - I found the prisoner in that room; he pulled her out; he was quite sober - the prisoner stood at the end of the room; his brother and another girl were there - he stated he had called his brother down to inform him of the robbery; I found the pocket-book in the room, close to where the prisoner stood - it was the room they had been to bed in; I searched every where else, but found no sovereigns - a man named Hawkins keeps the house, but does not live in it; the woman who manages it for him came up and told the prisoner she must have it, and recommended her to give it up, saying,"You know I saw it, and you saw it, the night before" - the prisoner said she had not got it; the brother said the woman he had been with could not have taken it - the woman of the house was taken up, but discharged; there was a woman sleeping by herself in another room.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100088"></xptr>Cross-examined. Q. They were all taken up? A. I took the woman and the prisoner - I have often given information of this house to our people; there was a window to the room - the curtains were down; I searched every place as minutely as I could, but did not search any of the women but the prisoner - he insisted that nobody but her could have it, for nobody had been near her; I left the servant to search her more closely than I could -I did not find three shillings on her; she said he had given her three shillings - they were both dressed when I saw them; the servant said she had the key, and she could not get out without being let out.</p>

            . Q. How soon after you went to the house did she take your money? A. In about three quarters of an hour after we went to bed, which was as soon as we had drank the gin - that did not take more than a quarter of an hour; the watchman was not sent for before, because the old woman of the house kept begging her to give me up the money, as she was certain she had it - when I left the room I left my brother sitting with her; the money was not likely to be found on her - she had thrown it through the window, which she owned.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was she drunk? A. I cannot say that she was - I met her by the Blue Posts, and took her to Spring's, but did not stop there a minute after - Mrs. Spring would not let me have any thing to drink; I looked under the bed, and am certain nobody was in the room - I felt her drawing my pocket-book out, and could not resist her; she did not take my waistcoat.</p>

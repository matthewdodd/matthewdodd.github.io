            . I am overseer of the parish of St. Pancras. On the 20th of December, the prisoner came to me at the work-house, a paper was delivered to me by the beadle, while I was engaged with a Committee of Directors in an adjoining room, I went out into the passage and saw the prisoner, and asked him if this was his order, he said it was, I pointed out two words in it, viz.</p>
               <p>"nine," and</p>
               <p>"each," which appeared to me incorrect, I pointed to them with my fingers; I do not recollect that I read them to him, he looked at them, I asked if they were correct, he said the magistrate wrote them, and that he received the order from the magistrate; he said his demand was 10 s.; I then returned into the adjoining room, and sent 10 s. out by

            , ESQ. On the 11th of December, I remember the prisoner bringing two boys before me, charged with having been found in Oxford-street first, and afterwards in Percy-chapel, with intent to commit felony, and from what he stated, I committed them to the House of Correction for a month; Harris brought me the paper to fill up for his reward for taking them; I inserted on the order the word nine, (looking at it;) this is it, the rest of the filling up is written by my clerk, the body is printed, the word</p>
               <p>"each" was not on it when I delivered it to him; I am confident that it is not the writing of any of the office clerks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Has not the word nine been altered. - A. Not in the slightest degree; 1 s. is paid as the office fee, and I thought 4 s. for each sufficient, the letter N. has been written over something which has been written before, I was going to make it ten, but recollecting he would have to pay but one fee, I made it 9 s., and delivered it into his hands; he was a parish constable.</p>
               <p>- (Order read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, if I had known there had been the least thing incorrect in the order, I would not have taken it to the work-house. I thought it was 10 s. I was to have, and got a person to write a receipt for 10 s. on the back, as I took it for ten, I knew nothing of the word</p>
               <p>"each" being on it; I can write nothing but my name myself.</p>

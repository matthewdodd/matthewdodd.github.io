                  </hi>. I am a constable of Great Marlow. In consequence of some information I went to Ealing with a warrant, which I produce—(<hi rend="italic">the warrant being read, was signed W. Wyndham, and empowered the constables of Great Marlow to apprehend George Webb and Abraham James charged with felony</hi>)—Mr. Wyndham is one of the Magistrates of Bucks—I went with the warrant to apprehend the persons named—I apprehended Abraham James on the Feathers railroad bridge at Ealing, in Middlesex, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I told him that I had a warrant, and laid hold of him—several persons came about me, and tried to rescue my prisoner from me—they pushed me about, and succeeded in getting him away—the prisoner was one of the principal ones—he pushed me about—at the time he did so I had hold of James—one of the party pulled out a knife and cut James's neckerchief in two, which I had hold of, and in doing so it cut my hand at the same time—I had done nothing to the prisoner—he was a stranger to me—I am certain he was one of them—there were about twenty persons.</p>

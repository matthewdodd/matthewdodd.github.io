                  </hi>. I am a pensioner, and live at the Sailors' Home, Well Street, Whitechapel—on the night of the 18th March I was coming home from the West India Docks towards the Sailors' Home, between 12 and 1 o'clock—on reaching Princes Square, St. George's, I saw four men coming into Princes Street at the corner; the prisoners are two of them—Fryer, without my speaking to them, struck me on the nose, another hit me as I was falling, and the other two rifled my pockets of a watch and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am confident as to the identity of the two prisoners—the two not in custody held me down while Webb rifled my pockets—I was senseless almost with the blow—I had had three sovereigns on me on the evening previous, but I had paid it away—I followed Webb without a hat on through Princes Square, and he took his glazed cover off his cap and put it on my head—I took the cover off and hit him on the face with it—a policeman came round the corner, and I gave him in custody at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> At the Police Court I swore positively that a person named Johnson held me down—Johnson was in custody with these two men—I fixed upon., him—I do not know Johnson as the son of a timber merchant living at the Ferns, Clapton—Johnson was discharged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Webb.</hi> I stated at Leman Street Station that I lost three sovereigns, but it was a mistake; my head was off my shoulders almost—I did not swear before the Inspector and Mr. Lushington that this robbery occurred at 9.30 at night.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 252). I took Webb as he was hastening into Cable Street from the direction of Princes Square—the prosecutor and he were together—as soon as he saw me he turned back, met the prosecutor, took the <hi rend="italic">glace</hi> off his own cap and placed it on the prosecutor's head—I stood still and they both came up to me—the prosecutor said he had been robbed of a watch, a hair guard, and three sovereigns—I told Webb he would have to go to the station—he said he had neither got the watch nor knew nothing about it—I asked the prosecutor whether there were any more with him, and he said there were four others—he gave me a descrip<lb></lb>tion of one, from which I apprehended Fryer—I took him to the station, and he was identified by the prosecutor—I received a description of another person, whom I apprehended—he was sworn to, but was ultimately dis<lb></lb>charged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I took Fryer the next day, Wednesday, the 19th—he had his hand in a sling—I have ascertained that he was, an out-door patient for three days at the London Hospital—any longer I cannot speak for.</p>

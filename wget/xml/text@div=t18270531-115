I let the prisoner a furnished lodging about the 16th of May; he left in four days; after he was gone I missed this property; on the Wednesday following I saw him in the Park, and took him - I found my brush on him; he said he had bought it to brush vencers with, and that he knew nothing of the linen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I say, "Let us go to a Magistrate and clear it up?" A. Yes - and you said at first that I was not an officer, and had no right to take you.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife; the prisoner took the room as a single man; he breakfasted with us on Friday, and said he had engaged a person to bring his boxes from Bird-street, but they never came- I have inquired at Bird-street: he never lived there - I heard him go out on Saturday, about six o'clock, and heard him speak to the dog - I went in about an hour up to the garret, where he slept, and missed the articles; the brush was in a box in the room; he pulled the door after him - nobody could open it without a key.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Is it consistent for a person who robbed a place, to go within three hundred yards of it. I intended to go home that very night - I had been over to Hackney, to my brother, who was very ill, and is since dead - I bought the brush at Hadley.</p>

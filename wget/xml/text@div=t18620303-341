                  <hi rend="italic">Evan's Defence.</hi> On the Saturday the robbery took place, I left my father-in-law's house. I was hawking some goods for him, not being in a fit state to go to sea. I went out selling bonnet and hat boxes. I came home at 6 o'clock, went out with my wife, and we were out till half-past 10. We met Bradburn in Whitechapel-road. He asked me where I had been. I said, "To the play." He said, "Are you going home?" I said, "No," and we went together, he and his wife, and me and my wife. We did not go home till half-past 12. He then went up into his room, and I went into mine. My wife went down to get a pot of beer. She stopped a long time, and I went to look after her; when I came up again the policeman and two more constables were in his room, and the good woman was lying on the bed. He said to me, "Do you live here?" I said, "No; this is my room next door." I went into my room, and in about ten minutes he took me in custody. I asked him what for. He said, "On suspicion of a robbery at the Frying Pan public-house." I said, "If that is all, I am willing to go." He found nothing on me, no fine clothes or jewellery; certainly I had a pair of boots, but those I bought and paid 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for, a shilling at a time—I brought them home on the Thursday previous to the robbery. I had not been in the room from 6 o'clock to half-past 12. I have been eight years and nine months in the Navy, and was discharged from Liverpool in June, 1856. I did duty in the trenches in the Crimes, but was discharged with palpitation of the heart and dizziness of the head. My father and mother live at Dept<lb></lb>ford. I had just come home in the ship Mary Ann, which was cast away, and only eleven of us came on shore. I was called down to Southampton to receive 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and came up to Chatham, and met two or three of my shipmates who told me my child was dead; it died on the 4th of January. It was kept till the 13th, as I could not come up to London, and when I came up it was dead and buried. I have been paying the undertaker a shilling or sixpence a week, which I should not have done if I had had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

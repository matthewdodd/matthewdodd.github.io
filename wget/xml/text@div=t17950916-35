The prisoner lived with me three weeks, and it did not suit me to keep her any longer, and on Friday night, the 14th of August, I told her I did not want her any longer; so she went out and said nothing, and said, she would be up with me; she knew the time we generally go for the milk. I went the next day, Saturday, about one o'clock, to meet the women that were coming with the milk, and what money I had in my pocket, two guineas and two half guineas, I put into the drawer and locked the drawer; it was a chest of drawers in the parlour; John Jones he is the landlord. I rented the lower apartment, two rooms; I left the money there, and looked to see if every one of the drawers were locked, and they were locked, every one, and the windows I fastened down with a gimblet, between the two sashes, and locked the door. At four o'clock I came home,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160092"></xptr>and when I had sat down for about ten minutes I wanted the money to give to a master bricklayer that I serve with milk, and I found the drawer open; I looked at the windows, and I found one of the gimblets pushed in, out of the window. There is a door going out of the chamber room into the passage, and that is always bolted inside and locked, she opened that door, and went out of that door (as I suppose) that way into the passage.</p>

I left the gentleman on Friday night; when I had done work his wife told me I should not take the pails any more; so then I walked out and bid her good night, and she bid me good night. The next day, Saturday, I went up to Islington, at eleven o'clock, to look for a new master; after one o'clock I see his wife there at the barn; after milking the cows for another man, whose pails I carried till four o'clock, when I left him and came home to my own lodgings, and I was there till about six o'clock, when this gentleman (Bevitt) called me to him, and he said he was very sorry for what I had done; I asked him what I had done? he said, Pendergrass had said I had robbed him of fourteen guineas, and I went to Mr. Pendergrass's house, and she took me to one Mr. Murphy's where I had lived, and he asked me what I had done with the money? I said I knew nothing about his money. This gentleman asked him what he had lost? so they searched me and took what I had about me, and said that key unlocked his drawers; it was the key of my box, and if it unlocked his drawers I cannot help it; and they took me to the House of Correction, and offered me half a guinea if I would own it was his money; and this gentleman took me up to the House of Correction and gave me to the turnkey, and said, I was taken up for fourteen guineas, and to let nobody come into see me.</p>

I received a bad shilling from her, on the 16th of July—I have kept it ever since—I have two—one was taken on the Friday preceding—one of these two is what I took from my niece—in consequence of what Sulley told me, I went to the barracks, and made a communication to corporal Andrews—the prisoner was there sitting on a form, and the corporal spoke to him—Sulley said it was a bad shilling that he gave him to take to my shop—I do not know whether New-land made any answer—they were both of them taken to the Sergeant Major.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the second Battalion of Coldstream Guards—the prisoner is a comrade. I remember going to Lee's shop for some beer, and gave the shilling to take for a pot of beer—Lee refused it, and said it was bad—I received the shilling of Charles Newman—he told me to go and fetch a pot of beer, which came to 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when I was asked about it. I told Lee it was not mine, and gave an account of it—the went with me up to the Barracks—we went Corporal Andrews, who went with us—I told Corporal Andrews the same I did at the shop—we found the prisoner at the bottom of the stairs—Lee said he had sent me for beer with bad money—Andrews said he should take us both down to the Sergeant Major—we were both confined all night—the pri<lb></lb>soner said he had got seven more in his knapsack, and there was no doubt he was <hi rend="italic">done</hi> through that—he was afraid he was <hi rend="italic">done</hi>—I did not know before that of his having bad money in his knapsack—I told the Adjutant of the Battalion the next day—we were then confined in the guard-room the next day, and searched.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

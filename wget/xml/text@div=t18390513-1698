                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Hockings. We keep a coffee-shop in Black man-street—on the evening of the 2nd of May I was called down into the shop—the prisoner was standing there, in great con<lb></lb>fusion, having just let these medals fall from the box, which was kept in the window, covered with glass—there was a curtain to the window—none of my customers had any business at the window—the medals are worth 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they are silver gilt and metal—I have one here worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is silver—they were there for sale—they are called medals, and are worn as such—he had only one cup of coffee, which he had partly drank, and paid for—I had never seen him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Rose-street, Long acre. On the evening of the 2nd of May I went to Mr. Hockings coffee-shop—I looked in at the window about nine o'clock, and saw the Box of Temperance medals—being a member of the Society, I looked In at the window—there is to be a grand procession on Whit-Monday, and we in<lb></lb>tend wearing them—they were placed in a box, with a glass, over it and a bill on it, stating that the medals were from 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to a guinea each—some were 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went into the shop, and saw the prisoner sitting in a settle next to the window—there was nobody else there—I sat facing him about a quarter after nine o'clock I saw him standing up, and leaning over the settle, with his arm in the window—he brought the box out of the window—the hinge fell back, and he dropped the box in his confusion, and the medals were thrown out—when I came to look at the window, I found he had taken off the glass which had covered them, and put it against the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I took the glass off the box, placed it on the settle, and was replacing the box in the window, when some of them fell out—he came and caught hold of me—he was sitting with his back to me, and says he saw me take the box out of the window—I had merely taken it out to look at them, and was replacing it at the time. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> On my oath he was tak<lb></lb>ing it from the window, not putting it back—I did not collar him—he was not attempting to carry it away—he was merely in a confused state—he had not concealed them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner, and the box of medals was carried to the station-house—I have only one here—there were three round ones like five-shilling-pieces—I went to the prisoner's mother in Union-street, Newington-causeway, and found her a very respectable woman.</p>

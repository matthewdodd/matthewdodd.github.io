I searched Flooks and found a bladder in his hat, it held two quarts and half a pint of foreign brandy. I saw a bladder taken out of Towers's hat. Clements produced four more bladders, they all contained foreign brandy; the six bladders contained three gallons, three quarts, a pint, half a pint, and a gill, I took them to the police office.</p>
               <p>DANIEL CLEMENTS. I am a gate-keeper of the London docks. On the 26th of May I commenced my duty a little before eight in the morning. I saw my brother officer lay hold of Flooks, and Towers ran away. I followed him; he fell; then I collared him and took him to the guard-room; there I found Clarke with the other prisoner. I took a bladder from Towers's hat. Mr. Clarke went away, and I had the two prisoners under my custody. I heard them whisper, what shall we do with these. I said, men, you have got more about you, give it me. From Smith I received a bladder out of his breeches, and one from Towers out of his breeches. Towers then gave me two more from a machine that went round his body. The prisoners were taken to the Office.</p>

               <p>Towers's Defence. I did not conceive that I was doing wrong in bringing this brandy away on account of my wife's illness. I sleeped on shore in the place I usually did. I found them bladders of brandy. I conceived it would be of essential service to my family. I went to take them home.</p>
               <p>Flook's Defence. The brandy that I had with me was given me by the mate of a ship. I went to settle with him a small bill, and he gave me three quarts of brandy. I know nothing of the other man.</p>
               <p>Flook called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the master of Cripplegate work house. The prisoner was a pauper in that house, and ran away on the 24th of June—three or four other boys went with him—they were all clothed with workhouse clothes—William Lucas was not one of those boys—on the 24th of September they all had clothes, and Lucas among the rest—they all re turned except Lucas—Lucas was brought on Tuesday with an old suit of clothes on, and he said that Hines had taken his things—this is the jacket and cap that Lucas had.</p>

On the 15th of May, about twelve o'clock in the day, the prisoner came and looked at a room which I had to let, and asked when he could come. I said he should have an answer at two o'clock; he called at two, and my husband told him to call on Saturday, he left a pair of stockings with me to wash, and a handkerchief to hem; he came on Monday, about two o'clock, and asked if he could have the lodging. I said No; he called the next day for his things, and asked why he could not have the lodging. I said it was let; he took his things which came to four-pence; he gave me a sixpence. I gave him two-pence. I shewed the sixpence to somebody, and being bad, I went after him, as I saw he had a good many more. I met him coming out of Dale's house, and told him it was bad; he said "Come in, I'll change it," and produced another, which Dale said was bad; he then produced a shilling; Dale gave him two sixpence for it, and then said "That is bad, return me the six-pence," which he did. Dale said "Why don't you give the women a good one"; he said he had no more money. Dale seat for an officer, who found four half crowns, and some sixpences on him. I gave the sixpences to Smith.</p>

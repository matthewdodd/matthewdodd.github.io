                  </hi>. I am a cigar manufacturer, of 18, Douglas Road—on the evening of 22nd March I was in Houndsditch at the corner of a court—my coat was unbuttoned, and the prisoner made a snatch at my watch and chain—he did not get the watch, as it was attached by a steel ring, which broke, and the watch slipped back—he ran up the court; I pursued him through several courts into the arms of a detective—I am positive he is the person—when I was crying "Stop thief!" a man said, "What is the matter?" and got in my way—the prisoner passed very close to him.</p>

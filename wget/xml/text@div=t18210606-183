On the 20th of May, he paid me 2 l. on account of Mrs. Bridges, which I entered, that is all he ever gave me on her account; it appears by the receipt produced. that he has received 7 l.; it is his hand writing - she owed me more, which another servant has received.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known him - A. Above twenty-five years; I never agreed to give him a per centage on the customers he introduced; I engaged him in December 1818 to travel; he was to have 20 s. per week, and 20 s. per day for travelling expences; I have his books here, he gave them to me to arrange; he objected to give me one book; I apprehended him on the 5th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when you first engaged him - A. I took him quite against my friends' consent, and my brother particularly objected, and I said to him,</p>
               <p>"I don't wish my brother to know you are with me; but if he finds it out, tell him I allow you a commission," but I did not; I have received about 1300 l. from him; he was not in the habit of giving me money without saying who he received it of - he never claimed any money as due to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving a sum from Mr. Locker, of Northfleet, which was not entered - A. Perfectly well, the prisoner kept the book, therefore I could not enter it; I never said, he had not paid me Mr. Locker's money; I have a clerk, named Edwards, who has robbed me - I have released him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I agreed to have 10 per cent. commission on country orders, and 5 per cent on town; I travelled for his brother fifteen years; I have a wife and ten children who I brought up in the paths of honesty.</p>

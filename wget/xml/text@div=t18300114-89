               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You say you fell down? A. Yes; I had been out all day, and had something to drink - I then went to the fire, and felt myself very bad; I then went out - some of this silver might have fallen from my pocket; I had 38l. 10s. in another pocket.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH CLEMENTS. I am a Police-officer. I was coming out of Mecklenburg-square, and met a witness, who spoke to me, and I went up to four young lads, who were near the prosecutor - Wilson had hold of his right arm, and the other three were pushing him about; I asked Wilson where he was going to take him - he said home, by the order of some man; I then turned, and searched another lad, who is not here, and in the mean time I saw Buckoke run away - I told the witness to run after him, which he did, and took this bag from him; I saw him pick up something and put it into the bag - he delivered the bag and 17s. 7d. to me - when Buckoke got to the watch-house he told me Wilson had robbed the gentleman, gave him the bag, and told him to run away with it; he did not say he had taken the bag from the man.</p>

I was crossing Gray's Inn-road on the evening of the 21st of December, between seven and eight o'clock - I saw four lads about Mr. Williams; I passed them twice, and the big lad said, "I wish you would give us a hand to take this man home;" I said,"What have I to do with it?" they then pushed him down on the ground, and I saw one of them hand something to another, but I cannot say who it was; I spoke to the Police-man, and he went up to them - I saw Wilson with the prosecutor, and saw Buckoke start off, and another with him - I suspected the others had given him something; the prosecutor was drunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Where was Wilson when Bockoke ran away? A. By the side of the prosecutor - Buckoke ran as fast as he could; I said, "That is the lad that has got it, "and I overtook him; I took him with the money and the bag - he threw down 2s. 6d., and I took it up.</p>

               <p>- FOWLER. I am a patrol of Aldersgate Street. On the 24th of August, at half after three in the morning, I stopped at the end of Carthusian Street. I thought I saw a man with something on his back, I watched him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180020"></xptr>until he came to the top of the street, and as he came up I crossed over to him, I asked him what he had got there, he said nothing, I told him I thought he had got something, I said he must stop and go down to the watch-house along with me. He went to go down Carthusian Street again with the sack, I told him that was not the way, he must go to the watch-house; then he pitched the sack down at the green-grocer's door at the corner of Carthusian Street, and said he must ease himself, I catched hold of him by the collar and told him I should stand by him while he eased himself, and sung out for the watchman. He told me he hoped I would not hurt him, it was a bit of corn that was given him for his horses, he had a wife and family, I told him I would not hurt him no more than the law, if the law did it so be it, he must go down to the watch-house to tell the constable how he came by the corn, I took him down to the watch-house, and the watchman brought the corn down after him. On the same morning about nine o'clock I went to Mrs. Rainsdon, she claimed the corn.</p>

               <p>"Robinson make haste," he had hold of the prisoner by the collar, I went up to him at the corner of Carthusian Street, he told me to bring the corn, and he took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JAMES CARTER. I am a constable, at the watch-house I asked the prisoner where he got this sack of corn, he said he saw it lay in the footway, he kicked his foot against it, and he thought he had as much right to it as any body. These are the two samples, one of the sack, and the other of the corn loft of Mrs. Rainsdon.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

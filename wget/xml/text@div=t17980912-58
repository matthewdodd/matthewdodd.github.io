When I went to serve the warrant of distress upon his goods, the landlord came in first for rent, and when I was there, his first wife came and made an uproar about the door; I said, can that be your wife? he said, yes, I was married to her two or three and twenty years, but she had defiled my marriage bed, and God, my master, told me to take a second wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the second wife, whether he got any money with her or not? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury. May you live for ever, and may it please you that I may find grace in your fight. I am happy that I have to make a defence before your Graces, because ye have wisdom to discern between wickedness and simplicity. The Lord, who is my judge, knoweth, that in the simplicity of my heart I have done this; your suffering prisoner, in bonds, has, by his first wife, been cruelly oppressed, as you shall see in the sequel of my defence. After that I had been married to this my first wife about five or six years, the Lord was pleased to give me a knowledge of salvation by the forgiveness of my fins, after a thorough conviction of my lost estate by nature; but before this we lived very unhappy together, because she was not ashamed to own to me, my Lord, that she knew two men before I married her; and also was about to be connected, and was on the bed with her father's baker, but was interupted by the housekeeper, which, before I was converted, I could not brook; but when the Lord was pleased, my Lord, to manifest his pardoning love to my foul, I then, as he had forgiven me, could forgive her; and having now the spirit of light, I was given to see into my past wicked life, and saw, that though I was married to her according to the laws of my country, yet before God we did not come together according to his word, but as the brutes, for the gratification of our lusts. When I was thus convinced, my Lord, I then did heartily beseech the Lord that he would marry us afresh, and that I might then perform the duty of a husband unto her, and I earnestly prayed also for her conversion, and was in good hopes the Lord would have been pleased to hear my prayers, and make her a help-meet for me; but instead of that, my Lord, she became a most dreadful persecutor of me for my profession's sake, and took every advantage of me, my Lord, that she could; she drank very hard. However, soon after this, I believe about a twelvemonth or there away, after the Lord was pleased to convert me in his providence, he removed me to Portsmouth, my native place, from the want of business. When I came there, the Lord was pleased to open a door in his providence for me, and I got work, and between us both we could get a tolerable good living for poor people, our income was about a guinea a week between us both, but I was dreadfully persecuted by her, many times have I been in danger of my life, she has gone to bed with a knife by her side to kill me. It is true, my Lord, and the Lord is my witness, after having been at Portsmouth some time, the Lord had given me a deep experience upon my mind, and a strong impression that I ought to tell what the Lord had done for me, and the people there desired me to speak in the name of the Lord, and I believing that the Lord had appointed me thereunto, I, after earnest supplication to the Almighty, went forth to speak in the name of the Lord, they going with me. When this commended, this women declared she would not live with me, because that I would not let her usurp authority over me, as she did in this thing, she would be cash-keeper, and would not let me, when I received my wages, have any more than a shilling or so at a time, and then I must give her an account of every sixpence that I laid out, and when I gave her a true account she abused me very much. She resolved, however, that she would not live with me. I reasoned the matter with her about breaking wedlock. I told her what the scriptures said, that whom the Lord had joined together, no man should put asunder; I told her I knew her make, and that she could not do without a man, but would be perjured, and would commit adultery. She told me she would go from me in a fortnight; at the fortnight's end I little thought she would leave me, for she had been very quiet with me.</p>

               <p>Court. Why did you marry the second woman?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Because, my Lord, the first went away and left me in Portsmouth, and bedded with a man for a year and a half in my absence; then, after that, my Lord, at two years end it pleased the Lord in his Providence to bring me to London, and I took her again, not knowing what she had done till afterwards; then again, we were removed into East Smithfield, where we lived for three or four years, or more, together; then she went on again drinking and pawning every thing she could lay her hands upon; she retailed my coals, my candles, my tea, and every thing out to the neighbours to get money to purchase drink; when I came to the knowledge of this, she used me exceedingly ill, throwing irons, and knives, and a variety of things, at me; after this, one night, when I was gone to hearing -</p>
               <p>Court. The Court cannot sit to hear all the quarrels between you and your first wife, tell us your reason for marrying the second, as to all you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120065"></xptr>can say with respect to your first wife it cannot avail you at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, when she had run away, I had not the gift of continency myself, and I understood, from the Scriptures, that when a woman has gone aside from her husband, it is lawful for a man to put away his wife; and as I saw myself clear before God, I did not know I was not clear by the laws of my country; I met with my present wife, whom I married, in the Lord, that I might not commit fornication, having first told her that my former wife was living; my first wife was as young as myself, -</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot hear the point argued, the law is clear, and you confess the fact.</p>

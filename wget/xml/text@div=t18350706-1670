                  </hi>. I live in Queen-street, Chelsea, and am a stone—sawyer. On Saturday night, the 5th of July, the prisoner was about my yard—he said, he was without employ—I told him to wait till I got my money, and I would give him something to eat and drink—we went to a house near South ware-bridge, and had something; when we came out, I said, I would have a cab—he said, he would ride with me—before I got into the cab, I looked at my money—I then had one half-crown and six shillings—we got up into the cab—I was tired and fell asleep—we went to a street near Jew's-row, Chelsea, where they put me down—I then put my hand into my pocket, to pay the cabman, and missed my money—I directly caught hold of the prisoner, and said he had been robbing me of my money—he said, he had done no such thing, and he had no money about him—I held till the officer came up, and he was taken—as he was going to the station-house, along the Jew's-row, he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out some money, threw it over a wall, and said, "There is your—money, go and fetch it"—this is my knife; it was found on him at the station-house.</p>

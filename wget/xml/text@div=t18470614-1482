I conduct the business of my father, Lewis Cowan, a soap<lb></lb>maker, in Gravel-lean, Shadwell—the prisoner entered his service a few days before the 14th June—I saw some soap in Mr. Onslow's window, which was my father's property—it has a peculiar stamp on it—I have examined this soap now produced, and from the scent, and the stamp, and other circum<lb></lb>stances, I know it has been manufactured on my father's premises—it is worth 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—there is 3 1/2 lbs. of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am hair-dresser, and live in Cannon-street—I have known the prisoner about twelve months—he represented himself as a little tradesman, a soap-maker—he came to my shop, and offered this scented soap for sale—I bought it, and put it in my window—he told me he dealt in articles of this sort—I gave to the officer the soap I brought of the prisoner a few days afterwards—this produced is it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 212.) I took the prisoner into custody—I told him the charge, and asked him if he had sold any soap to Mr. Onslow—he said he had, and he bought it of a Custom-house officer, in Cannon-street-road, very cheap—I went and receive 3 1/4 lbs. of soap from Mr. Onslow—the prisoner said hi had some more at his house—I went there, but could not find any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> That soap is sold at the Lowther-arcade, and at other places; it is very common at grocers and perfumers; it is impossible for a person to swear to it unless the stamp had the maker's name; I bought it of an officer in Cannon-street and sold it to Mr. Onslow.</p>

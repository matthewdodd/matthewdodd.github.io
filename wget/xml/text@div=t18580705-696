In consequence of information, I went, on 28th June, to No. 31, Lamb Street, Poplar, with another officer, about half past 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I went into the kitchen, which is the back room on the ground floor; it opens into a little garden—in that room I found the three prisoners, sitting down—the moment I made my appearance, Pulford hastened behind the kitchen door; I followed her immediately, took hold of her hand, and took from it these three half crowns—I said, "Come, you have got some more; turn out your pocket"—I put my hand under her apron, and took from her this purse, containing these four half crowns, wrapped in lint—I asked her where she got them; she said she did not know—the prisoner Motz seized hold of something on the table, which appeared to be a plaster of Paris mould; he began breaking it—I seized his arm, and we had a severe struggle—I called for assistance, and the other officer, 147, came down—Motz would not let it go; the other officer struck him on the arm, it fell on the ground, and he destroyed it with his feet as well as he could, and said, "Now do your best"—this paper</p>

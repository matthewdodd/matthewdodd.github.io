I attended the prosecution of Davis at Shrewsbury; this flaggon was a part of the property which he was convicted of stealing; it is the property of the parish of Elsemere. There is the name of the four churchwardens, the date of the year, and the parish of Elsemere upon it. The prisoner gave evidence against Davis, and produced the property that was in his possession.</p>

               <p>Did any plate come into your hands from the prisoner? - Yes; a silver flaggon and some other things. The clerk in the counting-house received it from the prisoner. I was present; the clerk purchased it, and gave him the money for it. In the evening one of the clerks saw an advertisement in the papers, in which this plate was described. On Monday morning he acquainted me with it. I carried the plate to Mr. Legrix, and told him the circumstances; he asked me what I would advise him to do, and said the man who brought it was to return on Thursday morning with some more. I advised him to wait till Thursday morning, and, when the man came, to take him into custody. I went on Thursday; the man did not come; Mr. Legrix seemed very uneasy. I advised him to go before Sir

On the 25th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I stood in the shop with the door open - it was dark, the gas was lighted- I could not distinguish a person's features in the street at that time; our lamps had been lighted about half-past four o'clock; I heard a smashing of glass, and saw two men, one short and the other tall; the hand of the tall man was in the window taking out two musical snuff-boxes, which I had put into the window on a tray, about an inch from the glass, half an hour before; the glass was smashed to pieces - a person must have put his hand in to get them - I saw his hand in, and saw him take hold of the boxes as I passed the window before I got out; one box was gold and worth 9l., the other silver-gilt, worth 5l. - I saw them taken out of the window; the two men walked deliberately from the window; the tall one turned his head round, saw me, and they both ran; I ran to the door, and pursued, crying, Stop thief! and the tall man was taken; the prisoner is that man; I never lost sight of him, and am certain of him; the boxes have not been found; the prisoner was brought into the shop; I could not identify his features, but am sure he is the man whose hand I saw in the window, who was followed from the window, and whom I saw taken; they walked close together; I do not know what became of the boxes; the glass was whole before, for I had only cleaned the window about an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you been into the shop from the time you cleaned the window till this happened? A. I had been in the parlour adjoining the shop for a short time only, but no where else - the prisoner was apprehended in about five minutes, in St. Martin's-court - our house is two doors from that court - the first thing I heard was the glass smash - I went out within half a minute - I saw a hand through the window; it was not light enough to discern a person's features - they ran when I cried Stop thief! which was the moment I got out - the street was clear; there was nobody near the shop but them when I got out - I saw them go from the window when I went to the door - I followed them so close, I did not lose sight of them - they walked deliberately from the broken pane; when I got out the prisoner was close to the window - I have not heard that he is the son of a respectable tradesman - he said at Bow-street he was the son of a tailor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you went to the door, the two persons were just turning from the window? A. Yes; I did not lose sight of them for a moment - I was very near them, and am sure he is one of them.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at No. 58, Poland-street, Oxford-street. On the 25th of November I was going through Cranbourn-alley - I turned down Castle-street, and about ten yards before I got to the prosecutor's door, I saw the prisoner and another standing at the window - I saw the prisoner smash his hand through the window and take something - I directly ran after them - the prosecutrix rushed out of the door just before me, crying Stop thief! she interrupted my progress, or I should have taken him at the window - he turned down the court, and I secured him there without losing sight of him at all - he ran against a man who stopped him, and I instantly seized him - I am confident of his person - I do not know what became of the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Castle-street is a considerable thoroughfare? A. No; there is a great thoroughfare across the street, but not by this door - he was taken six or eight yards round the corner - they went a few paces gently till Mrs. Tuck called Stop thief! and then they ran - she came out directly the smash was made - nobody else was within twenty yards of the shop - nothing was found on him - I saw nothing fall from him - I think he might have thrown property away without my seeing him - I did not notice his hand throwing any thing away or hear any thing fall - I never expressed a doubt about his identity to the Magistrate, or to anybody.</p>

            . I live at No. 22, St. Martin's-court, and am shopman to a grocer. On the 25th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I heard Mrs. Tuck hallooing, Stop thief! our shop is twelve or fourteen yards from hers - I went out, and saw the prisoner run by the door - I saw Fox apprehend him about six yards from our door; as soon as he was stopped, I saw him throw out his right-hand as if he threw something away; but I did not hear any thing fall - there was some wood and rubbish about there, as they were building a house - in the situation he was then, what he threw away might fall on that rubbish - I saw a man stoop and apparently pick something up off that rubbish; I looked for that man soon after, and he was missing - he had passed our door after the prisoner running, and two more followed him - he asked what was the matter, and then went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were running? A. The prisoner and two more - nobody else, except myself and Mrs. Tuck - the prisoner and two more ran before me - I did not know Mills before - I thought the man had picked something up, and when inquiry was made for the property, I said it was picked up by a gentleman - I looked for him, and he was missing - the rubbish has been searched, but nothing found - I do not swear that the prisoner threw any thing away - if metal had fallen on the stones it would have sounded - there were no bricks there - it was the rubbish of a house which was repairing - I did not attempt to take the man whom I thought picked something up - I know nothing about the prisoner.</p>

            . I live at No. 10, Bedford-court, Chandos-street - I am a labourer - I open and shut Tuck's shop. On the night in question, between five and six o'clock, I was in the narrow part of the court, going to shut up the shop, and heard Mrs. Tuck cry, Stop thief! I immediately came in contact with the prisoner, who was running towards me, and secured him - he said he had been doing nothing, and desired me to let him go - I saw his right hand move, but for what purpose I cannot say - I heard nothing fall; the rubbish might prevent that; several other persons were there assisting in securing him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many did you see running? A. I cannot say; several were running, but the prisoner was foremost, and two others ran a little way behind him; the rubbish might prevent my hearing any thing fall - I should think I must have heard if any thing had fallen.</p>

            . I am street-keeper. I was at the bottom of the court - I was drawn to the spot, and found the prisoner in custody - I searched him in Mrs. Tuck's parlour, and found 1 1/2d. on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known him before? Witness. I had rather not answer that question.</p>
               <p>MRS. TUCK. I had the boxes in my hand shortly before, and am certain they were taken from the window.</p>

I heard nothing, but saw two persons pass me and cross the road - it being cold, I was rubbing my hands, neither running nor walking - Mrs. Tuck sung out, Stop thief! and Fox stopped me; this gentleman came and held my hand, and said, "I will see that you throw nothing away;" they took me back - I made no resistance - Mrs. Tuck gave quite a different account before the Magistrate - she said she could not swear I broke the window, but that I was near it; I have worked with my father and mother ever since I was seven years old; I had been to see my aunt in Vere-street, and was returning.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

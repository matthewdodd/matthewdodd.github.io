On the 2nd of Dec., about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I saw Henessy in Drury-lane with some<lb></lb>thing under her cloak—I could not see what it was—I followed her to No. 10, Coal-yard, Drury-lane—she was about opening the door—I asked what she had under her cloak—she said, "A box"—I asked where she had brought it from, and what it contained—she said she did not know, she had picked it up in Drury-lane—I took her to the station—I opened the box—it contained these six new candles tied with a piece of string, a piece of soap, some soda, and some dirty linen—I saw"—Brown, Esq., 32, Tavistock Hotel," on the box—I went there, and saw Hoare—I asked her if she had any friend living in Drury-lane—she said a mother, living with Mrs. Henessy—I asked if she had seen Mrs. Henessy that morning—she said, yes', and she gave her a candle, and some small things—I went to Henessy's lodging, and found a towel with a piece cut out of the middle.</p>

            . I am a surgeon: I know Nangle; I saw him on Wednesday or Thursday some time about the 27th or 28th of June; I am not certain of the day; I have known him in Liverpool; I met him in Bishopsgate street; I went with him to the Red Lion and London Hospital, Whitechapel; there was one Donnelly with us; a man accosted Nangle as soon as we got into the house; Nangle had some parcels made up in paper when I met him, and the man that met Nangle asked him if he had bought the goods he spoke to him about; Nangle said he had, and produced them; Nangle gave the man the goods, and he asked how much they came to; Nangle said ten pounds; the landlord was present in the room at the same time. The man who was waiting at the publick house produced that fifty pound note, and Nangle gave him a twenty pound bank note, and the rest in cash; it was between three and four o'clock when I met Nangle; the man then went away. I do not know to whom it was payable, but I believe one Swyer or Sawyer, or such name; (it is shewn him). I believe that bill is the same; the master and Donnelly were in the room at the same time. I have known Nangle two or three years ago at Liverpoole. I have not seen him till this particular time; I am sure it was on Thursday; I think it was the 28th. The parcel was opened; there were some muslin and some handkerchiefs in it.</p>

               <p>Q. to Barrett. Whether you don't frequently receive bank post bills without any indorsement upon them?</p>
               <p>Barrett. I never did receive a bank post bill without it; I looked upon it to be so necessary that I refused to take this bill till it was indorsed.</p>

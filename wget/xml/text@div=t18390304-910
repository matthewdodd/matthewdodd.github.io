                  </hi>. I live with my father, in Chapel-place, South Audley-street, On the evening of the 15th of February, I was in Oxford-street, between six and seven o'clock, and saw the prisoner, with several other lads, three or four yards from Mr. Thomas's shop—I watched them and afterwards saw one of them, not the prisoner, go into the shop, and take out a roll of cloth, and give it to the prisoner, who ran across the road into a Mews, put it into a bag, come back, and come into Brook-street—I told the witness Atkinson he had stolen the cloth, and he followed with me—the prisoner went into Lancashire-court, and seeing us watching him, put it down, and ran—I followed him, leaving Atkinson, in care of the cloth, and followed him to Hanover-square, until I caught him—he threw me down—a butcher came up and laid hold of him—we then brought him as far as Burlington Arcade—he threw me down several times till the beadle of the Arcade secured him—I did not lose sight of him until he was secured by the constable.</p>

On the evening of the 15th of February Cooper pointed out the prisoner to me in Duke-street—he had something on his shoulder—I watched him into Lancashire-court—we were very near him—I suppose he thought we were following him, for he threw or set the parcel down against the wall, and ran out of the court—I went and took the bundle up, and</p>

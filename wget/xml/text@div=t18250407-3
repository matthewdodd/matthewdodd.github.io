I had a little black mare; I saw her safe about six o'clock in the evening of Sunday, the 27th of February, and missed her next morning with a bay gelding, which was also safe the night before. I came to town and got to the George the Fourth public-house, at Hounslow, on the Thursday following, and saw my mare there; her tail was cut and seared; I saw that it had been recently seared; in consequence of this I went to Bath and Bristol, but found the prisoner on the Monday, at Henley-on-Thames. Hill saw the mare in my presence; she is worth 10 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was she a full size or a pony? A. A pony - it is six years old - I have had it about five years. I am a farmer, and have no partner. I do not know the prisoner.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Roebuck public-house, Witchcross, near East Grinstead; it is four or five miles further from town than where Poile lives. On Saturday morning, the 26th of February, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner at my house with another person - they remained there till Sunday evening. I knew the prisoner by the name of Thomas Baker; he said he wanted to get to town by Monday morning, but the weather being bad he stopped till the evening, intending to go by the mail cart if he could.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you live further from town than the prosecutor? A. Yes, his house is not in the direct road to town from my house. I heard of the horse being lost on the Monday morning.</p>

            . I was hostler at the King's Arms public-house, Weybridge, Surry. On Monday, the 28th of February, between one and two o'clock in the day, the prisoner came to master's house - I did not see him come, but about a quarter to two they sent for me - I found a little black mare and a bay gelding in the stable; the prisoner and another man were there - they came out of the stable and told me to fetch some corn for the bay gelding and black mare. The prisoner remained there till Tuesday, and went away on the little black mare, between three and four o'clock, leaving the other man and the gelding there. He returned next day on foot without the mare, and went away between two and three. May has shewn me a black mare in London, on Tuesday last - it had a white star in the forehead, and I think it is the same, but will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not common for a black mare to have a white spot? A. No, I speak to no other circumstance - it was the same size; my attention was not particularly called to it in the stable.</p>

            . I'am a grocer, and live on Hounslow Heath. I have known the prisoner a year and a half, or two years, by the name of William Sargeant; he lived within thirty yards of my house. On the 1st of March (Tuesday, I think) I was driving a hog to Hanworth and met the prisoner on a little black mare pony; it took fright at my hog, and started, and nearly threw him off, which made me notice it. I said</p>
               <p>"William, you have got a nice lively little thing there;" he said, yes, he had, and that it had never been rode before - he trotted away towards Hounslow Heath. I live next door to the George the Fourth, and was there one day when Poile was there - I think it was on a Thursday; I saw the same black pony there as I had met the prisoner on, and knew it again - Poile claimed it. On the 8th of March I saw the prisoner in custody at the Marquis of Granby, at Hounslow - he told me not to say any thing about the black pony I saw him with the other day - two constables had him, but he whispered to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you had any quarrel with him? A. I never had a word with him; I met him about a mile and a half from the George the Fourth, on the road between Weybridge and Hounslow.</p>

            . I am a labourer in Mr. Poile's employ. In consequence of directions I received I went to Hounslow; I was at the George the Fourth public-house, on Wednesday, the 2d of March, and saw the prisoner there. I have known him eleven years; I saw him come out of a small room, and when he saw me he went away without speaking. I then went to the stables of the George the Fourth, and in consequence of inquiries which I made I found master's pony there - I knew him by seeing him at Poile's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew him by sight? A. Yes, and knew his friends; I knew him by the name of T. Baker; I said nothing to him.</p>

            . I am landlord of the George the Fourth, public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Stacey says he was with you when the pony came? A. He was with me but I did not see it come - I never said that a tall man came with it - I said a tall man ordered me to feed it. I did not see who brought it. A man came to the front of the house, and said he had put a horse into the stable, and I was to feed it. On Wednesday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070007"></xptr>morning the prisoner was in my parlour with two more - I think one of them was this tall man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Pike, of Weybridge, knows that I rode from his place on a pony, three years old.</p>
               <p>WM. PIKE. I keep the Old King's Arms at Weybridge. The prisoner came to my house on the 28th of February, and rode away on the 29th, on a pony; I looked at its mouth at the same time as I looked at the bay horse which I bought of another man who was with him, and sold it it again. I was not at home when they came to my house, and cannot say whether they came together, but they drank together. I have seen the pony claimed by the prosecutor; I cannot say whether it is the same as the prisoner rode away on or not; I am no judge of the age of ponies.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police inspector, E</hi>). I was present at the inquest held before Dr. Lankester on the body of the prisoner's child—I was present when the prisoner made her statement—I do not remember whether she was sworn as a witness—not being called upon to give evidence before the Coroner, I did not take particular notice of what she said—I remember her saying that she did not kill the child—I heard her say the child had been subject to pains in the night—she mentioned spasms for one thing, and that she had called the nurse several times during the time she had been in the workhouse in consequence of the spasms—she said the child was dead before she put it in the chimney.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did she say what time it was that she went into the Harrison's Arms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; about half-past 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she say that the child was troubled with windy spasms, and she had often called the nurse and said she was afraid the child would choke? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She did—she said that as she came along she heard the child choking—after she had made that statement the nurse was called.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you touch the body of the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was wet and warm—I should think it was the legs that I touched—there had not been a fire in that room since I had been there—I went there about three months ago.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there more nurses than one in the ward in which the prisoner was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; only myself, no others—there are other nurses in the workhouse, in other wards—the prisoner never com<lb></lb>plained to me that the child had spasms—she never complained of anything of the sort, neither did the baby have them—she never complained—I do not remember her complaining to me.</p>

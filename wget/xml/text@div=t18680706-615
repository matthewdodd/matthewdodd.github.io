On 19th June, between 4 and 5, I was on duty on London Bridge in-plain clothes, and saw the prisoners and three others together—I followed them into the Borough, and left them there—I returned to London Bridge, and met them all five there about 6 o'clock—four of them went in front of Mr. Brock and turned round against him, and pushed him violently—Collis was on his left side, with his hand under Mr. Brock's arm, and in his waistcoat pocket—I took hold of the hand which was in Mr. Brock's pocket, and saw something shine in his hand—he rushed towards the other four, and what was in his hand was passed to one of them—at that time I received a blow at the back of the neck, which almost knocked me down, and Collis said, "Let me go, I have</p>

On Thursday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180106"></xptr>the 22d of March, the prisoner and another person came to my house, about five o'clock, and called for a pot of beer, and they had to the tune of three; about half past seven I went out, and when I returned, in about ten minutes, they were gone; I did not miss the pots till they were brought back, in about half an hour, by the patrol, with a quart pot and a pint pot, and he has had them ever since.</p>
               <p>- FORD sworn. - I am a patrol: (Produces a quart and a pint pot); I had them from the prisoner at the bar, in Benjamin-street, St. Sepulchre's, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house, or it may be better; I was going round Cow-cross, between seven and eight o'clock, and seeing something under his coat, I stopped him; we followed him; he went into an iron shop, and offered the two pots for sale; he came out of the iron shop and ran, and we followed him; he fell down, and then we took the pots from him; we asked him whose pots they were, and he said Mr. Carter's, at the Green Man and Still, in Coppice-row.</p>
               <p>Q.Had not you recommended him to confess the truth? - A. No; I had told him nothing of the kind. I have had the care of the pots ever since.(Produces them. They are deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had a great quantity of dust to sift at 4d. a load, and all that I found in the dust; I found these pots among the dust; I went to sell them, and when this man stopped me, I told him I had picked them up upon a dust hill.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t17980418-107-verdict587" type="verdictDescription">

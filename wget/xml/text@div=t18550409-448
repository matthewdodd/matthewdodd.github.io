'Thompson says nothing.' "</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Bryan's Defence.</hi> At a quarter before 7 o'clock that morning I left home; I had slept with my parents; I went to the coffee shop, and saw Redman and Thompson having their breakfast; when I had been there about a quarter of an hour a man with a shining coat came in, and said, "I have got twenty-one shillings and sixpence in copper; if you will give me a sove<lb></lb>reign you shall have them," and Thompson gave it him; I then got up to buy some tobacco, and the man said he had some very good cigars; I gave him half a crown for two half dozen; I showed him this coin; he said, "I have not got any other; you can easily pass it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson's Defence.</hi> I think it very hard; this officer says he saw us get out of the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> and the prosecutor says he lost about 18 lbs. of cigars, and they would half fill the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> and the officer must have seen them; we could not conceal all those cigars and this coin without its being seen.</p>

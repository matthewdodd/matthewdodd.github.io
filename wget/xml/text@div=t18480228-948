                  </hi> I am the prisoner's wife—we have been married six years last Nov.—he is a landing-water, at the Custom-house—we have one child—my husband has been absent from the Custom-house three months, in consequence of infirmity of the brain—he holds his commission still. On 21st Jan. we were at his mother's—we slept there the night before—we took him to Bethlehem Hospital, about ten o'clock, as a patient, but he was refused admission, on the plea of permanent insanity, arising from paralysis of the brain—we came back to his mother's between eleven and twelve—he appeared quite deranged that day; he was quite wandering in his mind—he said he thought there were two people in the street who wanted to injure or arrest him, and that he heard people talking to him through the wall—he has been of very weak mind ever since I knew him, and has been subject to paroxysms of this kind for some time back—I have been obliged to call in the police, in consequence of his wildness and violence—I left the room, came back, and found him about to go out—I said, "Where are you going, my dear? What is it you want? don't go out, but wait till Mr. Otway comes"—he said, "I don't want to stop here; I want to go back to that place" (meaning Bethlehem)—I asked him to wait till Mr. Otway came, and he should be taken there—he said, "You must have me confined; for I don't know what I do when these fits come on"—I again asked him to sit down till Mr. Otway came—he sat down—Mr. Otway did not come—he got rather impatient—I said I would put on my bonnet, and see if I could find him—as I was rising, he put his hand on my arm, gently pressed me into my seat, and said, "No, do not go yet; stop a bit"—I spoke to his mother about getting a lodging, where he could be taken care of—she gave me a signal to look at him—his hear was down on his breast, and he was frowning very much; his eyes were almost shut—I asked him if he would lie down, and try to go to sleep—he said, "No"—he peeped round, facing the table, and began gnawing his glove—I told him not to do that, and turned to answer a question his mother put to me—she screamed, and he put his left arm round my waist—he had a knife in his hand, and tried to cut my throat, or my bosom—I said, "Oh! what are you going to do? you would not hurt me? you would not murder me? think of dear <hi rend="italic">Charley?"</hi> that is my child—I do not think he answered—he still attempted to cut me—I was holding his arm, and my hand slipped from his fist on to the knife; I caught hold of the blade—he turned it first one way, and then another, and cut me severely—his mother was assisting me—he threw her down, leaving the knife in my hand, and I dropped it—he still had hold of me—his mother screamed again, and I saw that he had another knife—he endeavoured to stab me in the bosom with it—I put up my hand, it cut my thumb—we struggled—his mother got up, and threw herself on him, which overbalanced him—he staggered over the chairs, and I fell to the ground—he was about to repeat the blow with the knife—some one rushed into the room, and he was secured—he had only had a glass of ale that day—he was always very kind to me when in his right senses—he had been drinking to excess the Saturday before, but not that week—Mr. Lingham was our landlord—we had lived in his house about three</p>

               <p>months—he is married; his wife lives with him—I had no acquaintance with him—my husband never mentioned his being improperly acquainted with me until he had these delusions—the Tuesday before was the first time he had intimated anything of that kind—he then said a man told him something through the wall.</p>

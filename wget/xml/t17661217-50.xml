               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Duck. It is, I believe, about two or three years ago.</p>

               <p>Duck. His house is upon Maze-pond, Southwark; he desired me to set my hand to this paper; he said, it was a thing of no consequence, only a form; he said, any indifferent person might do it, and as I was a neighbour, he called me in; upon that, I witnessed it, and delivered it to Mr. Orton in his counting house.</p>

             accept two transfers, there they be in the book: (he compares the name on the letter of attorney with them) I believe this name on the letter of attorney not to be his handwriting; I do not believe it is like it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Duck. Take the letter of attorney in your hand; can you take upon you to say, that is the very paper that Mr. Orton produced to you to sign?</p>
               <p>Duck. This is my hand-writing I know; this is the paper that Mr. Orton gave me, and I wrote my name there, that I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Court. Recollect yourself what he said to you.</p>
               <p>Duck. He called me in from my work; when I came into the counting-house, he said, Mr. Duck, I have got a letter of attorney here to sign; it is a thing of no consequence, any indifferent person may do it, thereupon I wrote my name, and left the paper on his desk in his counting-house, and went away to work.</p>


               <p>Q. Was the sheet open or doubled up?</p>

               <p>Duck. No, I did not; he said, it was a letter of attorney for him to collect rents, and I understood myself only as a witness to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any seal upon it?</p>
               <p>Duck. I did not, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a name underneath when you wrote your's?</p>

               <p>Duck. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Who wrote these words, "of Maze-pond,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Hormer Howes, and live at 22, Deacon Street—On the morning of 21st July I was awoke a little after I o'clock—I heard some men talking outside—I got out of bed and looked out of the window—I saw five men; two were opening a window at No. 15—I watched and saw two go in and throw out a gentleman's over<lb></lb>coat—one of the men outside put it on—they threw something else out, I could not see what that was, then they shut the window down and I saw a glimmer of a light in the parlour window—the house is opposite—presently I saw the window open a little way, and one of the men outside said, "Shut the window down; here is a <hi rend="italic">copper</hi>. oming,"and the window was closed—it was opened again soon afterwards, and out jumped two men, and the four ran away, the fifth man walking away entirely by himself—I do not recognize the prisoner.</p>

About 2.45 a.m., on 21st July, I was in Sayer Street within a few yards of Deacon Street, it is a continuation of it; I observed a man peeping round a corner—I went after him; it was the prisoner—I saw him cross on to the opposite side of the road—another man came in the opposite direction; they muttered something to each other which I could not hear—I said "What are you waiting about here for?" the prisoner said "I don't see that I should be hunted off, because I have not done anything"—he was about 17 yards from the prosecutrix's shop when I first saw him—I drew the attention of another constable to the matter; the prisoner went away—I waited at the corner of Deacon Street two or three minutes; my attention was then called by another constable I met to the prosecutrix's shop; this was about 2.45 a.m.—from what he told me I went in pursuit of the prisoner; I found him at the corner of Manor Place, Was worth Road, about 200 yards away—he came out of a public urinal at the coffee stall—I said "Oh, you are here now; "he Said "Me, sir?" I said "Yes;" he said "You have not seen me before; "I said "Did not I speak to you in Deacon Street just now f he said No, I have just come from the docks;" I said "Do you mean to say I did not speak to you in Deacon Street?" he wished me good morning and off he ran—I</p>

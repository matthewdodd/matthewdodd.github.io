                  </hi>. I live at Brompton. At half-past nine o'clock, on the 6th of May, the prisoner came into my shop to look at some silk hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs which were in my window—my partner took them out, and shewed her a bundle of about twenty-five—the string was loosened, and they were laid before her—she did not approve of them, and thought she should like to look at one of those in the window—while she was looking I saw her draw one out, and put it under her arm—she was then going out—I jumped over the counter, and said, "Did you mean to buy one or steal one?"—she said she had not money enough to buy two—she dragged me into the street—I brought her back—she had not bought any—when the last handkerchiefs were shown her she said that she had not money to buy two.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When I found that I had come out without money, I asked if the shop would be closed in a few minutes that I might get money; he took hold of me, and this handkerchief came off the counter with my shawl.</p>

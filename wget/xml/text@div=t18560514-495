                  </hi>. I am an emigrant, about to sail in the <hi rend="italic">Sea King</hi> for Australia; she is now lying in the London Docks. On Thursday, 1st May, I saw Marshall on board the <hi rend="italic">Sea King</hi>—he introduced himself to me as a gentleman going out by the same ship, and said that he had some machinery on board—after talking with him on board for some time about the Colonies and other matters, he got me to walk off with him as far as the Spread Eagle, in Graoechurch-street—from thence he proposed going for a stroll to see the sights of London, and he took me to a public house near West-minster Bridge, and treated me with a glass of ale and a biscuit—while we were there, Marshall came in, he fined me and Swilson—he said that he had just come from America in consequence of an uncle haying left him a great deal of money—he pulled out his money, and showed several notes, end several sovereigns, and seemed greatly rejoiced—he said that he would treat us with a glass each to drink his health, which he did—this was about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—Swilson then proposed that we should go to Cremorne Gardens—we all three left the public house together, and walked about different streets—I am not much acquainted with London—we after<lb></lb>wards took a boat—we then went to another public house near Cremorne Gardens—I know it was near Cremorne Gardens, I had beer there—while we were in that public house Swilson gave me a small bag, and also Marshall, and he also said he would give us an American dollar each, to keep for his sake—there was nothing in the bag that he gave me—I had at that time in my possession a bag containing about fifty sove-reigns, among it there were two old guineas—there had been 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., sovereigns and half sovereigns, I had changed one half sovereign—my bag was within another bag, about the same size and colour as tins one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took my bag out of my pocket, and put it on the table before Swilson—Swilson took it up, and also this bag, and said he would put it in for me with the American dollar—he appeared to do so, bag and all, tied it up, and returned it to me, and I put it into my pocket, thinking that I had got my money right—shortly after we all three left the house together—when we had got a little way Swilson said, "I hare forgot my pocket handkerchief, which can run the fastest?"—the other hesitated, and I turned back and ran to see if there was any pocket handkerchief left behind, but there was no pocket handkerchief—I then returned to the spot where I had left the prisoners, and they were both gone—I did not look at my money then—it roused my suspicions, and as soon as I pulled it out, I found my money was gone—I cannot tell at what time that was, it was at some time in that evening—I believe it was as I was going to pay for my breakfast—it must have been next morning, therefore—I Slept at some public house at Ken<lb></lb>sington that night—I went to see a cousin, and then to the public house where I slept—next morning, when I was going to pay for my breakfast, I took out my bag and opened it, and none of my sovereigns were there, nor the two guineas, nor the American dollar, but a quantity of farthings, I think more than fifty; part of them are here, the other part I had to pay for my breakfast with, as I had no more money in my pocket—I then gave information to the police—I had never seen the prisoners before—I am perfectly satisfied they are the men.</p>

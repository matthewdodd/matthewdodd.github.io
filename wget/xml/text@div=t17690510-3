We live in the lower apartment, and lett the other rooms. The outward door we always leave open for the lodgers. The bolt was burst open from the staple.

            . I am a milk-woman, and live in Titchbourn-Court. I think it was on a Tuesday night, in April last, as I was going for a pot of beer, between eight and nine o'clock at night, that I saw a man in the entry of the prosecutor's house. I thought it was the man of the house at first; as I came up close to the door, I saw it was the prisoner Best. I said, What brought you here? he made no answer, but turned his back to me. The other prisoner put his head out of Mr. Saunders's room door, and said to Best, God blast her! what does she want there? I went on, and ordered my beer. When I came back, which was in two or three minutes time, I saw only Best in the passage. I went to my own door and stood there a little. I then saw a woman standing by the gate-way, about nine or ten feet from Saunders's door: she jumped from thence and went on the inside the door of Saunders's house. She put something in her apron: Best and the woman went away together, and Sykes followed with a parcel under his coat: I cannot say I know the woman, but to the best of my knowledge it may be the prisoner; tho' I cannot swear positively to her: she had a hat on that covered her face.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the men at the bar?</p>
               <p>C. Keith. I have known them above a quarter of a year. I have been in their company. I have seen them several times in the neighbourhood of St. Giles's. They lodged at a chandler's shop there, where I served the people with milk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Saunders or his wife that night?</p>
               <p>C. Keith. I did not. I go out very early in the morning, and do not come home till late at night. I told Mrs. Saunders of it the first time I saw her, which was in two or three days after. I went to tell her the next morning, but she was not up. I was forced to go and serve my customers, and when I came home again she was not at home. I told it to a needle-maker that lives next door to me the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what kind of things the woman had in her apron?</p>
               <p>C. Keith. I did not. There was a white cloth about it.</p>

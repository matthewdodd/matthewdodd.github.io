                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of instruc<lb></lb>tions given me, on the 15th Feb. I watched a house, No. 3, Allington-street, Pimlico—about one o'clock in the day I saw the prisoner come out of that house—I followed him to the shop of Mrs. Emmet, on Holborn-hill, a jeweller and silversmith—I looked through the window outside, and saw him produce a parcel, apparently containing spoons—I went into the shop—I said nothing, but stood behind him—I saw him point to the back of the spoons he held in his hand, and heard him say, "'J. J. A.,' as you did the last"—he left the spoons there with the shopman, and went out—I followed and stopped him, I said, "Whose spoons are those you have left in that shop?"—he said, "Mine"—I desired him to go back to the shop with me—he did so—I was in plain clothes—I told him I was a policeman, and suspected the spoons had been stolen from the Junior United Service Club—he said, "When?"—I said, "I cannot answer that question"—I said, "I believe you were there yesterday"—he said, "I was, and am a member of that club; I have had the spoons in my possession four years, and have taken the initials out to have my own put on"—I went back to the shop, and obtained the four spoons, which I produce—I took him to the station, searched him, and found two keys and a card-case, and went</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. In consequence of infor<lb></lb>mation, I directed Goff to watch this house—on Wednesday, the 15th of Feb., I saw the prisoner at the station—I asked him his name and address—he said his name was Ashley, and he lived at No. 11, Stock bridge-terrace, Pimlico—I had seen him come out of a house in Allington-street, about 100 yards from there—he said, "This is a mistake; I received the spoons from Mr. Rawnson, a tailor, living at No. 11, Stockbridge-terrace, about three weeks ago"—I said, "Am I to understand you reside there now?"—he said, "Yes"—I went with Goff to No. 3, Allington-street, and saw the things found, and found the fork myself—it appears to have been filed—I found three files in the chest of drawers.</p>

On the 10th of January, about seven in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop, and enquired for Mr. Marshall a breeches maker; and while I was telling him where he might be found, another person, not in custody, rushed into the shop and stole a pair of leather breeches that were hung on a rail in the shop window; I heard a noise, the buttons of the knees hit against the cutting board, as I supposed; I looked round, the prisoner was in the shop, he said nothing at the time. I did not see the person that took the breeches away; the prisoner prevented me from seeing him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all you know is the breeches were gone. - A. Yes;

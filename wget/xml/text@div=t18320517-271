               <p>WILLIAM STEPHENSON. I live at Old Brentford. I attended a meeting of the Political Union at Brentford, on the 15th of May; we went to the One Tun - I had a large red silk handkerchief, spotted with white - we went from there to the Red Lion; I did not see the prisoners till I returned to the One Tun.</p>

I was at the One Tun, and saw the prosecutor; I saw Bennett take a handkerchief from his pocket, and give it to Pawns, who put it into his flap - I told the prosecutor; he said,"I have not lost it," and just at that moment he was called out to take tea, and in going along he felt for his handkerchief, and found, as he says, a book instead - I could not see what sort of handkerchief it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROWE. Q. What time was the handkerchief taken? A. About half-past five o'clock; it was a public room; there might be sixty or seventy persons there- I took it to be a Belcher handkerchief, but I only saw the corner of it; the prosecutor did not put his hand into his pocket when I told him of it - he came back in about half an hour, and said he had lost it; I never said it would be more profitable for me to attend the Old Bailey, and get 5s. a day, than to follow my trade.</p>
               <p>MR. ROWE to WILLIAM STEPHENSON. Q. Where did you see Dunkley? A. At the One Tun - I knew him before the gave me notice that I had lost my handkerchief -I felt outside my pocket, and felt a book; I said I had not lost it - I afterwards found it had been stolen; it was a full sized silk handkerchief - I missed it about half an hour after I was told of it.</p>
               <p>Bennett's Defence. I went to the One Tun; I sat there till some person said that those who did not belong to the meeting, were to leave, and I got up and went away.</p>
               <p>GEORGE TAYLOR. I live with my father, who keeps a broker's shop at Old Brentford. I have known Bennett from his infancy; I have heard Dunkley say several times, that he should like to get a good job at the Old Bailey, to get his crown a day; and it would be a d-d sight better for him than to set upon his seat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is Dunkley? A. He is a kind of a translator of old shoes into new ones; he had made new shoes; I heard him say this two or three months back.</p>

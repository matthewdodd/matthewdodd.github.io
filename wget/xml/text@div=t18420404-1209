                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 116.) On Saturday evening the 2nd of April, between eight and ten o'clock I was on duty at Bedfont, and saw the prisoners come out of a beer-shop about ten o'clock—Allum came out four of five minutes after Luckett—I followed them down towards Mr. Rayner's farm, and having heard two persons in conversation in Mr. Ray<lb></lb>ner's stables, I went round into the rick-yard, and heard somebody come lost of the stable—I got behind the cart-shed, and saw the two prisoners coming in a direction from the stable—one was carrying something, and the other was two or three yards behind him till he got up to the hedge—they threw the sack of corn over the hedge into a ditch—I followed up to the hedge and seized Luckett—Allum walked away as fast as he could—I am sure it was him—I then went to Mr. Rayner's, and saw Chamberlane—we went to the ditch and got the sack out—it contained oats and beans—we shifted them into another sack as that one was very dirty—I have both the tasks here.</p>

I live in a house of Mr. Rayner's, a short distance from the stables—on Saturday, the 2nd of April, at a quarter-past ten o'clock, I was called up—I went with the officer and found a sack in the ditch adjoining the rick-yard—I pulled it out—it contained about two bushels and a half of beans and oats—the sack they were in is Mr. Ray<lb></lb>ner's—I never gave permission to Luckett to move the horses' food from the stable—it was kept there to feed the horses—it appears to correspond with what remains in, the stable.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 94). On 26th March, I was in St. Paul's Churchyard, and saw the prisoners there—I saw Sullivan speak to Acker<lb></lb>man, and point out an old lady—that lady went into Mr. Holt's, the pastrycook's shop; Ackerman followed her in, and Sullivan looked in at the window—Ackerman placed herself alongside of the lady, and came out again almost immediately—when she came out, Sullivan said, "Have you got any<lb></lb>thing?"—I was in plain clothes, standing alongside of Sullivan—Ackerman shook her head, and they then walked together down St. Paul's Churchyard towards Ludgate-hill—Sullivan there pointed out another female to Acker<lb></lb>man, who also went into a pastrycook's shop—Ackerman followed her in—I followed in behind her, and saw Ackerman put her hand in the lady's pocket, and then withdraw it—I asked the lady if she had lost anything—she said, "No"—the prisoners then went to Allan's, the draper's shop, where there was a sale on—I did not interfere at all then—they went to the side-entrance, where there were a great number of females standing—Ackerman went into the doorway and stood alongside of a young lady—she then left the lady, and she and Sullivan ran down St. Paul's Churchyard very quickly—I ran after them, stopped Ackerman, and out of her hand she dropped this purse, which I picked up—I said, "Where did you get that purse?"—she said, "I did not drop it"—I then took her back to the lady, and she identified the purse as being her property—another constable took Sullivan—at the station, Ackerman said that Sullivan called for her every morning to take her out picking pockets—Sullivan said that was false; she did not do so.</p>

I live at 23, De Beauvoir-square, and was with my mother on 26th March, shopping in St. Paul's Churchyard, at Mr. Allan's shop—I saw the little girl (<hi rend="italic">Ackerman</hi>) close by me—I did not miss my purse before the officer spoke to me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was safe shortly before.</p>

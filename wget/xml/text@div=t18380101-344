                  </hi>. I am in partnership with James Smith, and live in Charles-street, Hatton-garden—it is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. Last Monday morning, the 1st of Janu<lb></lb>ary, an opposite neighbour, named Badger, came and told me something—I ran out in pursuit, and saw two youths carrying away some merino on one of their shoulders—when they saw me they attempted to throw them over into an area, and ran away—I pursued, calling "Stop thief," but they got out of my sight—I came up soon after and found the prisoner stopped by a stranger—I took hold of him—I heard him ask the man to let him go, saying that he had stolen nothing, he was no thief, and I heard some<lb></lb>thing</p>

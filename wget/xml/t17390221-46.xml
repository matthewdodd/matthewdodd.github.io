               <p>Keeling. On Saturday was a Fortnight, I was coming from Barnet, where I had been with Fish, and between Barnet and Whetstone I overtook the Prisoner, (he had been out too with Fish) but as I did not care to be in his Company, I staid behind him at Whetston three Quarters of an Hour. When I came to Finchley Common, I found him again, and he left his Baskets, and came with me to Mother Red-cap's in Holloway Road, where we drank together; then I came away: He follow'd me, and I staid under a Hedge till he pass'd me; and when he was gone, I went down the Road, but between <placeName id="t17390221-46-crimeloc221">Lower Holloway</placeName>

The strange Man caught hold of my Arm, and demanded my Money in a Minute; I told him, I had no Money but what I got very hardly, and I struck him with a Lathing Hammer I had in my hand; upon this the Prisoner came up, and struck me, and they both fell upon me, and knock'd me down, and one of them clapp'd his Foot on my Face, then they rifled my Pockets. 'Twas about Eight o'Clock, and was Moon-light. I knew his Voice, and his Face, and his Cloaths: He had a strip'd Waistcoat, and a cropp'd Hat.</p>

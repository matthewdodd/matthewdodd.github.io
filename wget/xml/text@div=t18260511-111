I went there about ten o'clock, and staid till half-past eleven; we went out together; the prisoner stood at the door, and my shopmates went away; when I got about twenty yards the prisoner came to me, and said he would see me home - I thought he was my friend, but I found his hand in my pocket - I took hold of his hand, and called the watchman; the prisoner threw me down, and when I got up I could see nobody - I suppose he was stronger than me - he knocked me down; he hit me about the shoulder somewhere. I fell on my hands and face in the kennel; I lost 27s. from my waistcoat pocket - I had had my hand in my pocket at the public-house - he got away, and I was in search of him for a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ask the prisoner's brother whether his name was Dan Sullivan? A. No; his brother did not tell me, "My name is not Dan, but my brother's name in Dan" - upon my oath he did not, and I did not say, "Oh! then it is your brother I want - he is married to a carrotty woman;" I had drank part of a pot of beer at the pay-table, and had been at several other public-houses afterwards, with Carty and Tom Farrel; I did not tell Tom Farrel to be sure and say I was sober. I cannot say how many public-houses I was in.</p>

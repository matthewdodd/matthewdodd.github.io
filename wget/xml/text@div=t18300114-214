On the 7th of December I was going into the back parlour - I saw Poole in the shop, and two boys were outside; Poole took this tea-caddy from a table, and threw it to a boy out of the shop - I pursued, and took hold of him: three or four blackguard young men came up, and reseued him from me - I do not know what became of the caddy; the boys he threw it to had run away - I went back to the shop; Poole was brought in in about ten minutes with it.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in George-street.? On the 7th of December, at a quarter before eleven o'clock, I was going down Old-street; I saw a mob, and inquired what was the matter - from what I heard I went in search of two boys I suspected, and saw this caddy in Laver's window; I asked who brought it-she said a boy had left it for a short time, and he was coming again - while I was waiting at Hall's, a young woman brought Poole in; I gave the caddy and the two prisoners to an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then Laver gave you answer directly? A. Yes, and told what she knew about it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

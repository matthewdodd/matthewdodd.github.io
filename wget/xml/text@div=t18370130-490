                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Mr. Huntley Bacon, who lives at Bound's-green, in the parish of Tottenham—he has a wood near his house, called Dampford-wood, in which game is preserved. On Sunday, the 20th of last March, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I was in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood of the wood, and saw five persons at a little distance—the pri<lb></lb>soner was one of them, and Kitley, the two Pages, and Cartwright were the others—when I first saw them they were Coming towards Dampford-wood—they beat the wood—there was game in it—they had two dogs with them—they saw me, and began to run away—I said "It is no use for you to run away; I am determined to have you"—at that time I was by the side of the wood—as I was passing by the side of the field adjoining the wood I saw a dog coming towards me—it was a lurcher, which is a dog used by persons who go after game—I shot it and went towards the men—another dog came out soon after, and I called out to scott, the shep<lb></lb>herd, who was coming towards me, to shoot that dog, because my gun was fired—Scott shot the dog—I called to him to do so loud enough for three or four of the men to hear, but I cannot say about them all—some were in advance of the others—I think some of them could see the shepherd shoot the dog—we then went round to the end of the wood where the men were, and they were running away—when we got to the end they had all got into Mr. Rhodes's land—I did not follow them out of Mr. Bacon's premises, seeing their number was greater than ours—I did not go beyond master's land, but turned back for more assistance—I did not procure it directly—I did not return to the wood for a long while afterwards—I left Scott to see what was done—I returned I suppose in about two hours after, but did not find any of them there, but as I was returning, they all five followed me running up, and Smith called out "Shoot the b——b—"—when I returned they were in Mr. Rhodes's field—I did not see Kitely have any thing at that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701300006"></xptr>
               <p>time—Smith had a gun when I saw him in the first instance—that was a few minutes before I shot the dog—two hours elapsed between that and my return—he had no gun with him when he made use of the expression—upon his saying, "Shoot the b——b——," the two Pages, Kitley, and Cartwright ran up after me and hallooed out to me in the same manner—the prisoners ran with them—he was first—I ran as fast as I could towards home to get away from them—when I got into a field called Twenty-acre Bottom, which joins the wood, I observed Kitley in advance of the rest—I turned my head round to see where he was, thinking I was getting further from him, but still he was gaining ground on me—he had a gun in his hand—after running some distance, as soon as I turned round to see where he was, he fired at me—he appeared to me to level the gun as opposite to me as he could, and then fired at me—I was about fifteen yards from the end of the field—when the gun was discharged I heard the contents rattle over my head like a hail-storm, and rush into the hedge behind me—I should say Kitley was from forty to fifty yards from me when he fired—after he fired at me I told Scott to fire at him, and he did, and I then went home for assistance—Kitley and George Page were taken that night—I believe Smith was in Mr. Rhodes's field at the time Kitley fired at me, close by—I think he had not got over the hedge at the time Kitley fired-Kitley had come through Mr. Rhodes's field to the Bottom, but I belive the prisoner had not got over the hedge—I saw Smith again that same evening, about six o'clock, very near Colney-hatch, walking on the cause-way with young Page—I afterwards saw him in custody—he was hand<lb></lb>cuffed to young Page, and put into a cart by Foster and Fowler the con<lb></lb>stables, and they were consigned to the care of Scott the shepherd—from that time I have not seen him till within these last few days—I believe he lived in the parish of Finchley—search was made after him from that time—I searched for him myself, but was never able to find him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was Mr. Bacon's shepherd on the 20th of March last; I remember the sheep being worried that morning—I went out early that morning about it; and, about eleven o'clock the same morning I ac<lb></lb>companied French to Dampford-wood—French was before me—there was a dog passing—he called out to me to shoot it, and I did so—I did not see the men at that time—we went to the corner of the wood, and saw five men in Mr. Rhodes's field, which joins Dampford-wood—the prisoner was one of them—finding five of them, we returned for assistance—the five men pursued us as we returned across the Bottom field—they followed us out of Mr. Rhodes's field into another field belonging to Mr. Bacon—I heard them cry out, "Shoot the b——b——," and various language of that kind—all of them called that out, but this prisoner more particularly—Kitley was in advance of the others—the prisoner was nearest to us at first, until Kitley came up with the gun—that was after they called out "Shoot, &amp;c.—Kitley pointed the gun to French—he came up, till he found he could not gain any more ground on us, and then he fired at French—French then called out to me—Kitley ran away, and I dischaigcd my gun after him—</p>

               <p>I am now describing what happened at the time I shot the dog—I was left in charge of the prisoner and young Page after they were apprehended that evening—they were handcuffed and placed in a cart, but they got away from me about eight o'clock—it was quite dark—they got out of the cart, handcuffs and all, and escaped, after I struggled with them to hold them, but I could not succeed.</p>

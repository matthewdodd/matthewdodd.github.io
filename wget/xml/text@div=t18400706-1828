                  </hi>. I live in Shoe-lane, Holborn. About ten o'clock at night, on the 16th of June, I was going up Holborn-hill; just as I was going to turn the corner of Shoe-lane, I felt my handkerchief drawn out of my right hand pocket—I said, "My handkerchief is gone, Stop thief"—the prisoner was about a yard and a half in front of me—he passed me on the right—I should have been able to seize him if I had not lost my right arm—I am sure it was him—I have not the least doubt—he was differently dressed to what he is now—he had a brown coat on—there were three of them together, Williams and another boy—I knew Williams</p>

               <p>before—I saw him in Court last Session—I have no doubt about Freeman—I called "Stop thief"—he was the first to run—he ran across up Union-place—I followed him up Union-place or court for some distance, and was close upon him—I was afraid to go further, and lost sight of him—I turned back again—my handkerchief was a white one—it has not been found—I think he was taken about a quarter to eleven o'clock—they brought him to the station-house, and I recognized him immediately.</p>

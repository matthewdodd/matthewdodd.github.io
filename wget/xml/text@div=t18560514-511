                  </hi>. I am a carpenter and builder, and live at No. 26, Sale-street, Edgware-road. On Tuesday, 1st April, before 12 o'clock, I went to the Rose and Crown public house, in Burn-street—I remained there until between 3 and 4 o'clock—I went there to see a person on business—I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Of with me in gold, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I am quite positive I had it safe while I was there—I had a portion of some drink there—I was there, I should say, an hour and a half, or more, before I saw any of the prisoners—my friend and I went into the skittle ground, and played—there were various parties there who were acquainted with me—somewhere about 2 o'clock the prisoners came in—they each came in separately—Bands wanted to force me to bet, and I would not—I was going to the bar to get some spirits, when Rands caught me by the collar, and said, "You shan't go, for you owe me a shilling"—the other prisoners were present—I had betted a penny or two with some parties on the ground; I do not know who they were; I did not bet with either of the prisoners that I know of—I had not played with either of them, only with my two friends, Breewood and Henley—when Rands collared me, each of the other prisoners held me in a position that I could scarcely tell what they were about; they threw me across a rail, and held me, whilst one of them got his hand into my left hand pocket, and took out the money—I could not say who it was that rifled my pockets, because I was lying with my back across the rail, and my head down—I felt somebody's hand in my pocket, and they took my money out—I am quite sure that the three prisoners were engaged in holding me down at that time—they then left me, and escaped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, at No. 28, Praed-street, Paddington. I was at the Rose and Crown on this afternoon, and saw Mr. Fudge there, playing skittles with several persons, in fours—he played with Rands—the other two prisoners were sitting in the ground; I had not seen them with Rands—I saw Fudge attempt to go out of the ground; Rands laid hold of him by the collar, and thrust him back into the skittle ground, and said he owed him a shilling, what he had betted—Fudge said, "I owe you no shilling"—Rands said, "You do"—Fudge said he did not, and Rands backed him into the skittle ground by the collar—the other two prisoners were then in the ground; there were four of them altogether; one has not been taken—Fudge was backed across the bar—M'Kenley laid hold of him by</p>

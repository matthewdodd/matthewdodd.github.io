My husband does not rent the whole house; he has two rooms on the second floor; Mr. Eaton the landlord sleeps in one room in the house. About half past five on the 17th of May my husband got up to his work; it was quite light then; he missed a one pound note, a dollar, a shilling and an eighteen-penny token and five small keys.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen any thing before you missed them - A. On the Sunday night at eleven o'clock the money was in a tea-caddy standing on a table in the room, and the keys were on the table; the tea-caddy was not locked. When my husband got up he went into the sitting room and missed the money.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed do you know whether the door was locked or not - A. Yes, it was locked; I had the key by the side of the bed. In the morning my husband went out of the bed-room; he touched the other room door; it was open. Whoever had taken this they had rumaged the room about. We did not find the room in the same order as when we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your going to the door did you perceive the lock had been forced - A. There appeared to be no harm done to the lock; it must have been opened by a false key or a picklock key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover the money or the keys again - A. I have not recovered them. I saw a one pound note that was found upon

               <p>MR. CRESWELL. I am a constable of St. Bride's. I received some information of a neighbour; I went to Griffiths, and in consequence of what Griffiths told me I counted thirty-nine keys that were found upon the prisoner. I found the prisoner in the Poultry Compter. Griffiths had apprehended him for the other robbery.</p>

            . I am a constable. About half after five on Monday morning I was sent for; I went to one Edwards, a milkman. I found the prisoner in Edward's room, in a court in Bride-lane. I took him in custody. I searched him, and found a one pound note upon him, a dollar, and an eighteen-penny piece, and a shilling. Edwards had taken the keys from him thirty-nine keys, and there was five keys that were afterwards owned by Mrs. Ray. The prisoner said he had no money in his pocket but what was his own. I told him I should search him, and if the alderman thought proper to return him the money upon the examination I should have no objection, and when I took him before the alderman the money was returned to him. I did not see Mrs. Ray until the next day. After I had heard that Mrs. Ray had been robbed I tried all the keys to the boxes in her apartment; they opened the boxes; and this key opened the door. These are the five keys that opened Mrs. Ray's boxes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They are my keys. One of these keys I have had ten years. I cannot swear to the one pound note: I lost a one pound note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There is many keys like that; the rest of the keys and the money I found them altogether in a bag; they laid in the street; why not another man throw them away, and I am charged with the robbery.</p>

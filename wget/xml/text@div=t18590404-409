                  </hi>. I live at 2, Jamaica-place, Limehouse—the deceased, George Washer was my brother—I saw him last on Sunday, 20th February—he left me about a quarter to 12—he was then very well in health—I never knew him to have an illness in my life—I saw him dead on Sunday evening about 6 in Mrs. Maynard's room.</p>

                  </hi>. I knew the deceased, George Washer—he came to my house on Sunday, 20th February—he was very tipsy—the prisoner lived in the next room—the deceased had some words with the prisoner's husband—he said that he could go with the prisoner whenever he thought proper—the prisoner heard that—there was then a scuffle between her husband and the deceased, and I saw the prisoner strike the deceased on the left side of the head—I can't say what it was with—it was with something that she had in her hand—the deceased got up on to his feet as well as he could, and reeled round and round, and fell again—I then fainted away.</p>

Q.</hi> After the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> occurred at our place, did not you drag Washer into your room, and tell him to pay you the money he owed you for sleeping with you overnight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he hardly ever gave me any money—I did not ask him for any—I did not fasten my door—I did not afterwards come and call you, and say "For God's sake, Susan, come in, for he has fallen down in a fit"—I did not take any money out of his pocket, and ask you to go for some gin—you pulled some oranges out of his pocket as he laid on the floor—you have several times threatened his life, and a little time ago you stabbed him with a fork.</p>

                  </hi>. I occupied the front room next to Mrs. Maynard's, at No. 11, Three Colt-street—I heard the deceased in her room, and heard him say, "Oh, Jem, we <hi rend="italic">was</hi> friendly"—I could not catch all he said—I did not pay any attention to it, they quarrelled so often—after the man was dead, I was called down by the prisoner—I did not hear any thing said about the blow—it was two o'clock in the afternoon when he fell down—he was very tipsy—I don't know whether any one struck him—he fell and hit his head against a stool—Mrs. Maynard called me in to assist in lifting him up—that was, two hours before—the prisoner was then asleep in her own room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the College of Surgeons—I examined the body of the deceased—I found two external marks of injury, one on the upper and outer portion of the forehead, and the other at the back part of the head, towards the left side—the first was a lacerated wound, and the other a contused wound, that was the graver one of the two—a vio<lb></lb>lent blow would have done it, or a fall on the corner of a stool—I afterwards opened the head—there were no extraordinary morbid appearances—there were no appearances in the brain that would account for death—I afterwards examined the heart—it was very much enlarged—the cause of death was concussion of the brain, the sudden suspension of nervous influence—there was a large quantity of clotted blood in the chambers of the heart, which would show that death was of a sudden nature—the heart being so much enlarged, it would be more susceptible of the exhaustion of vital influence, but without the diseased heart I was able to account for the death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say that a fall two hours before could not have been the cause of a concussion, terminating fatally two hours after? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can readily imagine that a blow two hours before would predispose him to the consequences of a lesser fall two hours afterwards, but that he died sud<lb></lb>denly I am quite sure—concussion leaves no trace—drunkenness would materially predispose to Concussion.</p>

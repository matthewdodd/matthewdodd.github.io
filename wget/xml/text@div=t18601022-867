                  </hi>. I live with my father, who keeps the Hope beer-house—On the evening of 11th October, about a quarter-past 7 o'clock, the two prisoners came in and Smethurst called for a pint of fourpenny half-and-half; I served them—Chamberlain paid for it with a shilling; I took it up and bit it—I went to my father and said, "Father, here is a bad shilling"—my father said, "I am very sorry, sir, but I can't take this, it is a bad shilling" Smethurst took it out of my father's hand and said to Chamberlain, "You have got it now, Tom, it is a rank bad one"—Chamberlain took and bit the shilling about, and Smethurst went to throw it over the house, but he said, "No I won't do that—it may go in someone's eyes"—Smethurst then went to the tap-room to put it into the fire—I can't say whether he did or not—Chamberlain then paid a penny and Smethurst paid three halfpence for the pint of half-and-half—they remained about five minutes after that, and they left together—they had come in together—Smethurst said to my father "You are very clever, but your cleverness will nick you."</p>

I live at the Six Bells public-house, at Hammersmith—On 11th October about half-past eight o'clock in the evening the two prisoners came to the bar together, Chamberlain asked for three pennyworth of gin and water—I served him and Smethurst paid me a shilling—I gave him ninepence change—I gave the shilling to my aunt—I put it in the cup-board; it was not out of my sight—the prisoners had two more glasses, the first was paid for with three pennyworth of halfpence, and the other with a sixpence, which was good—I looked at the shilling again next morning—I saw it was bad—I bit it and gave it to Sergeant Brown.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman at the end of Mutton-hill: On the 9th of October,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260038"></xptr>about twenty minutes before eleven o'clock, I was standing at my box leaning over; I saw three sheep coming up the hill, towards Clerkenwell-green, from Hatton-garden; the prisoner at the bar was following them, with a pipe in his hand, or in his mouth, I do not know which; the sheep made a stop in the road when they got to the top of the hill; the prisoner came up, and seemed rather confused which way he should turn them, as I thought; I went out of my box, and the sheep turned about to the right; I said to the prisoner, holloa, my friend, what are you going to do with these sheep; he said, they belonged to a man in Liquorpond-street; I asked him who the man was, but he did not tell me his name; I told him I thought they belonged to some drover in Smithfield; he said, no, they did not; I told him I thought he had not come honestly by them; he said, he knew the man very well, he was a drover in Liquorpond-street; I told him I did not think any drover lived there; he said he had them in Liquorpond-street once, and he wished to get them there again; then he went on till he came to Castle-street, which is the next turning on the right hand, it leads up to Saffron-hill, and goes to Hatton-garden again; he was going to turn the corner, when I caught hold of him by the collar, and told him I should take him into custody till I was perfectly satisfied, and I should take care of the sheep; I got assistance, and took the sheep to Mr. Probert's, a butcher, in Great Bath-street; I saw the sheep again on the Monday, when Mr. Stopp owned them; I never saw the prisoner before; he was not sober; but seemed to know what he was doing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a watchman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are acquainted with a great number of drovers about Smithfield? - A. I do not know any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You know of the remuneration given to persons for the detection of sheep-stealers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you expect if this man should be convicted? - A. I don't know what to expect.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you not expect fifty pounds, and do you not wish for it? - A. I do not wish for any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation of life are you in? - A. I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q.Fifty pounds is no object to you? - A. Yes, fifty pence is an object, but not in a clandestine way; if the man is convicted by the real truth, I wish to have it; the prisoner said, he had been led into this, and he would be d-d if he would do a good-natured action any more; then he offered me five shillings if I would give up the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you where he lived? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, have you never said to any body that you believed in your conscience the prisoner was an innocent man? - A. I did say something to Dean that I thought there were more concerned as well as this man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not say to Dean, or any body else, that you believed the prisoner at the bar was an innocent man? - A. Yes, I did say I believed the man was led into it.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is, did you or not say you believed he was innocent? - A. I have told you as near as I can recollect what I did say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you seen any other person with him? - A. At the time I saw him upon the hill there were two or three men following him up the hill, but I did not see them interfere with the sheep, or driving them.</p>

On the Monday morning I apprehended Will the Sailor and Turner; they were discharged before the Magistrate, as not knowing any thing of it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: I received information that there were some sheep astray upon Clerkenwell-green; I went to look for them, but could not find them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Martin? - A. Yes; I will not be sure whether it was on the Tuesday or Wednesday after the first examination at Hatton-garden; after coming from duty, at six o'clock in the morning, the superintendant of the night, and me, and Martin, were going down Benjamin-street, Martin said to us, will you go and have any gin? I rather equivocated, and said, I did not wish to have any gin; he then said to me, I am a d-d fool; I said, for why; says he, when the man asked me to go along with him to help turn the sheep, I might have napped the other two.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the construction of the word napping? - A.Taking them.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, he might as well have had a reward of one hundred and fifty pounds as fifty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How came the prisoner to find out that you had had this conversation? - A.Because I communicated it to his sister, Mrs. Browning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does she live? - A.Somewhere in Bell-yard, by Temple-bar.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five other witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18031026-74-verdict442" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Whetstone. On Tuesday, the 9th of July, a man named Thompson was brought to my house in the afternoon, between three and four o'clock I think; he was insensible<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050083"></xptr>totally - I examined and saw several bruises on him, but no wounds - there was a bruise or two on the head, on the parietal bone, and bruises on the chest; on the right arm and left groin, and a few small punctured wounds on the instep of each foot; these were all the external appearances - I bled him on the right arm, and took three pints from him, then opened an artery in each temple, then applied six leeches, and in an hour after I again took about ten ounces from him; I rubbed an embrocation on the chest; he was then removed from my house to the Green Man - these remedies relieved him, but he did not recover his senses; it relieved his breathing very much - I attended him afterwards at the Green Man until his death - I applied a large blister to his neck, and gave him one scruple of calomel; I found him beyond recovery and did nothing more; he died on the Friday morning - I did not administer anything after Wednesday morning - Mr. Evans also attended him; I understand he is not able to be here.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the bruises on the head? A. There was no violent bruise on the head; there were a few on the parietal bone, and a slight scratch, but no wound whatever - I could not at all judge from the appearances on the head by what instrument they had been made - the external injury on the head could not be of itself the cause of death; the bruises on the chest were heavy, but not sufficient to cause death, they were such as would be made by a man's fist; the bruise on the groin was not of any consequence - he never recovered his senses at all - I was present at the examination after death; I did not operate; I was present, but not for the first half-hour; Mr. Evans operated - on opening the scull the dura mater appeared perfectly healthy, on removing it we discovered a quantity of coagulated blood - on removing the coagulum, we discovered three superficial vessels had burst on the upper part of the brain, one on the right hemisphere, and one on the left hemisphere of the brain, the brain itself appeared perfectly healty; I saw nothing else particular respecting the brain; the scull was not fractured, nor the least denture - I examined the heart, lungs, and liver, all of which were perfectly healthy - we next examined the bowels and groin, and could discover no rupture whatever, nor any material injury - I next examined the scrotum, that was likewise healthy - in the ancles we found some punctures about half an inch deep, they were rather on the instep, we opened one and found it nearly half an inch deep; they could not have caused his death at all - there was one bruise in the eye, the right eye was very much bruised, such an appearance as a black eye commonly has - in my opinion a fall was the occasion of his death; the rupture of the blood-vessels on the brain, and the extravasation of the blood, were the immediate cause of death - that I suppose to be caused by a fall; the bruises had not the appearance of being inflicted with such blows as would cause the rupture, there was not sufficient external marks to produce the effect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do I understand you to say, because you saw no external bruise to justify it, you think the rupture of a vessel must be caused by a fall? A. Yes; I cannot account for the bursting of the vessels in any other way, in the manner they were burst; if he had been fighting an hour and forty minutes, and had made use of very violent exertions himself in that fight, that would not have caused the bursting of the blood-vessels in the manner these were burst; the vessels were so full and congested, they burst from a shake - the personal excitement such as takes place in a fight, would be very likely to congest and shake the vessels, but I think they would not then have burst in the manner they did.</p>

               <p>Q. What would be the difference of bursting of a vessel, supposing it to be burst by a fall or over excitement? A. I don't think it would make a difference in the appearance - I should have thought it might have burst from over exertion, but one vessel had burst on the other side, on the left hemisphere - I will not swear that a violent personal exertion continued for an hour and forty minutes might not have caused the rupture of the vessels; I think it is not probable, in the manner they were burst, as there was not sufficient to justify that they were burst by any violent exertion; the scull was not fractured.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not that render it more likely that the vessel burst from exertion? A. If only one had burst it might, but I think not four vessels - I think if it had been produced by external excitement, larger vessels would be burst - if it was a fall, no doubt it must have been a violent one - he might have fallen on the grass without there being any mark of violence on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. If the vessels had been ruptured by a fall, must it not have been a violent one? A. A violent shake; it was a fall produced the shake - in the act of falling a shake was produced in the act of coming in contact with the ground - if he had fallen on his shoulder, that would not produce it - I think he fell on his head; I found no mark to be certain of that - I found no mark on his head to indicate how he got that fall - I think I can take upon myself to say these vessels were not ruptured by the exertion of fighting desperately; because these were less full than larger vessels - they were congested, but still the larger vessels would be more congested - I don't think these vessels could have burst; for instance, the one on the left hemisphere of the brain had no coagulum; there was some extravasated blood; my opinion is, nothing but the violent shake could produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a member of the college of surgeons? A. No, I am not a member of any college; not graduated in any college - I have no degree; I practise as an apothecary; I don't keep any shop - I only dispense medicines for my own purpose; I do dispense medicines; I am not one of surgeon's hall - I have practised for the last ten years; I was apprenticed to a Mr. Ives an apothecary; I finished my apprenticeship - I have never kept an apothecary's shop at all; I took three pints of blood from him at once; and I afterwards took ten ounces more - I did not measure it; I only took it in a basin; blood varies in weight - we consider the ordinary weight of a pint of blood sixteen ounces; but it varies in almost every person - I should think sixteen ounces is the average.</p>
               <p>Q. Being no surgeon you opened both the temporal arteries? A. Yes, I did; I think he died about thirty-six hours after; nobody attended him but me at first there was afterwards Mr. Evans and Mr. Hammond came;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050084"></xptr>there is no gentleman here who attended with me; Mr. Cox was with Mr. Evans when I visited - I should not think the leeches took more than two or three ounces of blood; I included that in the calculation I made - I believe only five leeches went on, six were applied; they did not take much blood - they did not remain on so long as some do.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you had much experience in post-mortem examinations? A. Yes; not lately - not within two years; I am not sure that I have had one within that time - I had when I was assistant to Mr. Hammond; that is four years ago, at Whetstone - I have had one or two since; the last is about three years back; I have not attended post-mortem examinations of subjects who died by rupture of the vessels of the brain - I have read various works on the subject; I do not know that I can recollect any of them; I cannot recollect any.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever read treatises on the effect of violent passion? A. Yes; I do not know who they were written by - I have read on the effect of violent exertions of the human frame, but I do not know who they were written by - I have not, since I examined the body of the deceased, looked into any treatise to confirm my opinion; I have not treatise at all at home on the subject of the brain - I cannot tell how long ago it is since I looked into any work on the subject of the brain, or the effect of violent exertion of the body; the last time was about three years ago - I was in the habit of reading a great many medical works at that time; they were not my own - I have not been practising without having any book to which I could refer on medicine or surgery - the deceased was brought to my house by the parties who were fighting; I was not at the fight myself - I have read that violent exertion will sometimes effect the rupture of vessels of the brain; I cannot tell the name of the work - I have generally been an assistant till lately, and have read my employer's books; I have a pharmacopiae and anatomical works; death has been often caused by violent passion rupturing the larger blood vessels; I think it is not so likely the weaker vessels would be burst.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think a strong vessel more likely to give way than a weak one? A. I think so, from the great quantity of blood in it; I think the external vessels would not be likely to give way from the effect of passion; I have had a great deal of experience as a medical man, but not on this immediate subject.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you occasionally called in to see cattle? A. No, never; I have not been called on to prescribe for diseases of cattle.</p>
               <p>CHARLES JAMES COX. I am an apprentice to Mr. Hammond, he is a surgeon and apothecary at Whetstone; he is not here - John Evans is his assistant; he is labouring under fever and a sore throat, and unable to attend - I saw the deceased before his death, on the Tuesday, at Mr. Harrison's; he was insensible - I did not examine him then; I examined him with the assistance of Evans and Hammond at the Green Man on the same day; there were a few external marks of injury on the parietal bone, which I thought was violent; it was merely a swelling externally; I could not tell the internal appearance - the skin was not ruptured at all; the swelling was about the size of half-a-crown; I could not see it, I could only feel it, because the hair was on it - the hair was not taken off at that time - on the arm there was a severe blow; that could not cause death - there were a few slight blows on the chest which could not produce death; the blows on the groin and feet could not produce death - the only important one was the one on the head, which I believe must have been made by a fall, or by a blow from some broad and flat weapon; the fist would have left a greater mark - the mark produced by the fist would not be the same as the mark I saw; it would not be so large - that was the only mark on the head that I observed; I saw him after his death, but did not take any part in the treatment - I think he died on the Thursday morning, about one o'clock, early in the morning; I was present at the post mortem examination - I have been at the King's College studying, but was never before present at the examination of a person's head dying from rupture of a blood vessel - on removing the scalp there was the sign of a severe bruise on the parietal bone; on removing the scull, about two ounces of blood issued from three vessels which had burst, and on examing the dura mater, that was healty; the lower ventricle had a small quantity of coagulated blood - the whole of the viscera was in a healthy condition; the brain was healthy; the three vessels I have named were ruptured, and one on the other side; they were immediately underneath the bruise of the head - the rest of the body was healthy; there was no appearance in the rest of the body to indicate the cause of death - my opinion is, he died from the rupture of the blood vessels, occasioned, in my opinion, from the external injury by the bruise - I have been apprenticed to Mr. Hammond two years; Mr. Evans was at the post-mortem examination; he and Mr. Hammond were present - Evans operated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Was the apprenticeship the commencement of your medical experience? A. Yes - I never attended a post mortem examination, where death was caused by effusion on the brain - I know nothing of Mr. Harrison - he was present at the time I speak of, and had the same mears of observation as I had - he lives in our neighbourhood, and practices in the neighbourhood near Mr. Hammond - I know nothing about him - I see him practising - he has been at Whetstone all the time, I have, and practised that time - but how much longer I cannot tell - I see him go to see patients - I have known him two years practising in the neighbourhood - the man was in a state of total insensibility, and continued so - I am surprised to hear Mr. Harrison say there was no appearance of external injury, it is not true - I can bring evidence to prove, the contrary thatwhat Mr. Harrison has said, with regard to that is false, as regards the head - it was evident to all those who saw it - they must have noticed it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are asked whether the colour of the skin was changed, and you say you could not see that for the hair, would the hair hinder your seeing that? A. It would more or less - I could tell easier by the post-mortem examination than before - I did not see it discoloured.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in your judgment as a medical man, do you mean to say the hair on the man's head would prevent your ascertaining whether it was discoloured? A. I did not remove the hair - I should think you could see it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050085"></xptr>my observation of the wound was plain - I felt the bruise, and therefore, there was one, there was a swelling - I felt the swelling, it was about the size of a half-crown in my judgment - and the shape a bruise generally is - it was round I think - I did not examine the shape closely - I felt it- I looked at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what is the reason you cannot tell us whether it was discoloured or not? A. Because I looked at it cursorily, so as to see that it was a swelling - I could see there was a swelling without putting the hair aside - I saw there was a swelling and likewise felt it - it was more raised on that side than the other - a round instrument, a staff or stick would have produced an oblong swelling to the best of my belief in my humble opinion: a cricket ball would not produce an oblong - I explain the round instrument - I mean a staff or stave - I cannot tell exactly the size the instrument must have been to produce it - it must have been a few inches broad - four inches perhaps, and perfectly flat - a blow struck by such an instrument would not produce a larger circumference on the part the blow was given - it was on the parietal bone, and would not take four inches of a flat surface - if the man fell against a stone, or anything, that would account for the swelling - it must have been produced by something flat - the nature of the wound leads me to conclude that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you call it a wound? A. Yes, a swelling - it was not a lacerated wound - I should think it was a wound- I cannot say how many times I saw the man before he died - I was not present when he was bled - I did not prescribe for him at all - in my judgment it was by no means a judicious thing to open two temporal arteries, and take sixty-four ounces of blood. I cannot say it would accelerate death, but I conclude it was injudicious to take so large a quantity of blood - it was requisite to take away a small quantity, but I think so large a quantity would weaken him too much - when the blood was taken away we did not know the state of injury done to the head - his insensibility might be produced by concussion - I thought there was injury to the brain by the snoring noise he made.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pupil of the eye dilated - do you know what I mean by dilated? A. Yes, if the eye was closing - I do not know what you mean by dilated - the eye was closed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Which part of the scull did you feel the swelling, put your hand to it. A. It was on the left side - on the very spot I put my hand - I have before examined the brain of a party after death, at the King's College dissecting room - but only once - there is no water in the brain when it is healty, when it is unhealthy there is generally water, and signs of inflammation - redness is a sign of inflammation - I heard him, Mr. Harrison give his evidence, but don't recollect anything about it - I should not think a fall on soft grass likely to produce the appearances I saw - I said I should say most assuredly it would not - a fall on a round stone might produce that appearance, but it would be according to the size of the stone - a round stone of large circumference might, but a small circumference would not do it - according to my judgment it must have been a flat instrument - it must have been a very violent blow according to my judgment - there was no appearance of fracture of the skull - the skull was extremely thick - in some skulls it might produce a fracture, but in this it did not - I should not think a fist able to cause such an accident - I have seen swellings on the head from a blow of a fist - it must have been a very heavy blow to cause four vessels to burst - that depends on the state of congestion of the vessels at the time - if he had been fighting for an hour and forty minutes, that would have produced congestion of the vessels - it would be difficult to give such a blow like the bruise presented, by the back part of the hand - the knuckles are not sufficiently large to produce it - the swelling was about the size of half a crown - Mr. Evans was present at the post mortem examination, but not my master - I am perfectly satisfied that he died of the bursting of the blood vessels of the brain - he never could have recovered - he died in consequence of the injuries he received.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearances you have seen, and the improper treatment you describe, he had received, can you say he died of suffusion, or from the improper remedies? A. Had the quantity of blood been taken away, which Mr. Harrison says he took, I should say it was decidedly injurious - a man might get well after bleeding three pints, but it would be hazardous to take that quantity - I conclude he must have died from the injury - the remedies did not hasten his death - had it been concussion of the brain, instead of effusion the individual might have recovered - the remedy was a right one - the remedy pursued by Mr. Harrison was correct, had he known the vessels had been ruptured - I have never read on subjects of violent excitement of the brain - I have attended lectures, but not given my time sufficiently to the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps the brain is of all parts what you know least of? A. It is</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Harrison present during the whole post mortem examination? A. He was not; he came in shortly after it began; to the best of my knowledge he came in while we were sawing through the skull; I cannot state whether I had observed the external state of the skull before he came in or not; I believe we did not look at the skull together to see if there was any bruise, I don't remember to have spoken to him; I believe he did not make any observation as to the external state of the skull- I did not hear him speak.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say it was a flat instrument, might not the flat part of the hand have done it, though not the knnckles? A. No, I should think that could not have made that bruise, it might, but I should think it was not broad enough.</p>

             were fighting; I was there at the beginning; I knew the men before by sight; the first rounds till about the third round, were fought in a fair way, what I call a stand up fight; I have witnessed a good many; from the the third round Thompson appeared to be the strongest and the best man, and the bye-standers who I concluded to be Murphy's (party, because they were Irish,) broke the ring, and with sticks and other weapons, they pushed and drove on from one place to another, and knocked down by-standers there; they did not call out any thing that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050086"></xptr>could understand particularly, for it was mostly spoken in Irish; I knew one or two persons who I saw very busy there, but have not seen any of those since; I saw both the prisoners there - Mulany was very active in the fight, but I never saw him strike any body; I saw him there about the third or fourth round, pushing people about with a stick in his hand; it was more breaking the ring than keeping it; he was keeping all the people backwards in a cluster, towards the people who were fighting, pushing them towards the people, that was all I saw him do - Ready was Murphy's second - I saw him act very fair towards his man indeed, I never saw him use any ill language, or put his man forwards, he acted fairer than I ever saw a man in my life - he acted very fair towards his adversary, very fair on both sides - after the third round, the people pushed in, they continued fighting for a length of time - they might have fought for an hour or better for what I know, for I was senseless myself part of the time, being knocked down by one of them; not by the prisoners; I saw no blow given to the deceased - I saw the end of it, but not the middle part of it; I recovered at the end, Thomson and Murphy were very much exhausted; they had been fighting I should think an hour - before I was knocked down, Murphy gave in; I heard him, he looked round to the man who was seconding him, and said to his brother, "I will have no more," in a faltering voice - I then spoke to the other one's second, and said, it was right now and that the battle was theirs - and as I said so I was knocked down; previous to that, (when his brother took him up, just before I was knocked down) he stood across, and put his hands up, and said "Give it to him, you can serve three such as him;" after I recovered, when I got up at the last round but one, they were fighting towards the upper part of the ring, which was on rising ground, grass; Murphy's people had got them all up in a close corner together, on the highest part of the ground; they were at that time breaking the ring and making a disturbance; the whole of the Irish people together were making a disturbance, and their sticks were dropped, and a glass bottle was thrown in, whether wilfully or not, I don't know; several sticks were held up, and some of them fell on them, but whether by accident or design I cannot say: neither of the prisoners had anything to do with that to my knowledge; I never saw Ready in particular; a glass bottle was thrown into the ring; I helped to pick up some of the pieces; at the last round the men were both fighting, apparently as well in strength and health as at first; that was at the first of the last round; they were hustled completely round the ring by Murphy's party, as I considered them, because they were Irish; both the men had fought that round for a good length of time, and were exhausted; the man hit the deceased in the forehead, and he fell down, more by being exhausted, than by the blow; I saw Thompson fall, there was a small turf of grass lying a little on the descent, and he fell on it, and it appeared to reek his head a little back; he fell on an uneven place; there was no stone or hard substance there; I examined the place; his two seconds instantly took him out of the ring, and Ready the second of the other man came to him, and his other second; he got him across his knees, and Ready came and put his knee under him to prop the man up; he was not sensible, there was no breath in his body, apparently at all; he was taken to the doctor's shop, but before he was taken away, I tried to get him to breathe, and pressed my hands on his stomach, and he made a rattling in his throat; I stopped his nostrils, and drew about three ounces of blood, I should think out of his mouth, and then he breathed freely; they took him away directly after; I wished him to be bled, he was taken; in a gentleman's chaise; I afterwards saw him at Harrison's; he was the same man as Harrison attended to; I went with him from there to the Green Man, and left him there about a quarter past nine o'clock, in the care of two surgeons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you attend the inquest? A. Yes, and so did Evans; Mulany was there also, and to give evidence I suppose - he was not in custody - I heard no outcry about a robbery at the fight - Mulany never touched the deceased, as I saw - it is impossible to say how many persons were at the fight more than three or four hundred; there were as near one thousand as four hundred.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. In the early part of the fight, all went on well? A. Yes; and towards the middle part I received an injury, and could not observe what was going on; and towards the latter part the thing was done fairly; I mean by the seconds and the men themselves - the conduct of Ready was fair, both to his opponent and principal, from the commenoement to the conclusion: and when it was found the deceased had been seriously injured, he manifested every anxiety to help him, and render him assistance in the ring; and at the doctor's shop he appeared anxious and concerned for him - Ready did not attempt to break the ring; he endeavoured to avoid it - not one of the seconds had any thing to do with it; it was their greatest wish to keep everything peaceable and quiet - every man would regard it as a fair fight.</p>

            . I was present at the beginning of the fight; the first round was conducted fairly; the ring was broken-in at the second by the Irish; they hit Thompson on the back of his head; only one person hit him on the back of his head; it was Mulany - he struck him with a blackthorn stick; I had not known him before; a number of persons rushed in together; I can say positively that he was the man; he only gave one blow - he was striking about with the stick, but I never saw him strike anybody else; he hit him in the back part of the head; I cannot tell in what place; it did not knock him down; it made him stagger a little, he did not fall, he went on fighting still - I do not know how long they fought afterwards; they had a great many rounds; the ring was broken in at every round but the first round - I saw Mulany kick Thompson at the last round, after the round was over - when he was lying on the ground, after he was down, he kicked him in his private parts - Thompson did not stand up at all after that; I saw nobody else kick him; I am sure of that - Mulany is the one; I swear that he is the man who struck Thompson with a stick in the second round, and kicked him in his private parts after the last round - I never saw any body else strike him; I do not know a man named John Lane; I was examined before the Coroner - I swore it was Lane did it because I heard his name was Lane, but this is the man - I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050087"></xptr>in the yard at the inquest; I swore to him directly he came into the yard - I gave my evidence the day before he was before the Coroner, and he came the next day - I saw Ready at the fight seconding Murphy, he behaved very well throughout the fight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I think you say, the ring was broken-in, every round after the first? A. Yes, I am sure of that; I do not know how many rounds were fought during the battle; I did not take notice; I should think about twenty - I am not certain how long the battle lasted; it was better than an hour I should think - Thompson was not ill-used every round; only in two rounds, that was the last round and the second; the blackthorn stick that Mulany had was about a yard long; I knew it was blackthorn by the colour of it; such a stick as you would cut out of a hedge; a round stick with knots on it; I am sure of that - I went to look on with other people - I have not seen above three fights in my time - I am a farrier, and live at home, with my father and mother - I was never engaged in a fight myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever find your way into any gaol? A. No; I have been in a watch-house for being saucy - the policeman took me there for being saucy in the street, for insulting people, I suppose, when I was coming home, running up against them - it was at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your running against them happen to be very near their pockets? A. No, I do not get my living that way - I was not taken up on suspicion of attempting to steal; I will swear that; I used no words when I ran against the persons; I was given in charge of a policeman; he was by at the time and saw it, and seized me, and put me into Marylebone watch-house; I staid there till about twelve o'clock, and then was bailed out - I appeared the next day at the office, and the prosecutor was there, but nothing was done to me; I swear nothing was done to me - I swear I never was in any prison in my life - I know the House of Correction; I was never there, nor in any other prison; nor charged with an assault for which I was ever sent to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you charged with an assault on a woman? A. Yes, at Clerkenwell, where you go before the grand jury - I was at Clerkenwell when I was charged; I was bailed out from Marylebone sessions-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it for the same assault as you were bailed for before? A. No - yes; I was at Clerkenwell for insulting the woman; it was not at Clerkenwell that I committed the insult; the woman took me there, to that part of it where you have your trial - I was found guilty and fined, and paid 5l.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you swore a few moments before, that you were never taken up, except for being saucy? A. I don't know; I forgot it at the time; I forgot that I was tried, convicted, and fined - I totally forgot it, and thought nothing had happened to me - I swear that I was never tried before nor since - I never was in Clerkenwell; I was tried there; I mean to swear I never was into custody at Clerkenwell - I was not put into the dock during my trial; I was not locked up at Clerkenwell- I was not there till I had my trial - I have not asked money from anybody here for coming to give evidence; that I am sure of; I never told anybody that he ought to find me, and the witnesses with money - I did not say so to Mark Walsh, nor anything of the kind - I live at No. 62, Market-street, Paddington - I did not describe myself as a labouring man living at Marylebone; I did not tell Walsh so - I did not ask Walsh for a shilling, telling him that as he was prosecutor he ought to find us in money; I am quite certain I did not.</p>

            .

I was at the fight; I saw a disturbance take place after the third round - several people crowded into the ring, and fell before Edward Thompson with intent to throw him down; I don't know their names; on the fourth round, a man named Mulany in the crowd, went with a pretence of keeping the mob back with a large stick, and struck Edward Thompson on the back of his head twice; that was about the fourth round - I had never known that man before - I never saw him before; there were plenty of men round the ring with whips and sticks near Mulany at the time he struck the blow - I am quite sure he is the man who struck the blow; it was given out that his name was John Lane at first; I was examined before the coroner, and said Lane struck the man; but I said they gave his name as Lane; but it was Mulany; he is the man I called Lane before the Coroner; after the fourth round, I cried out"Shame," and was knocked down by

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was Mulany inside the ring at the time this happened? A. Yes; a great many persons must have seen him; he had a kind of a black stick - a round black stick - he was flourishing it about under the pretence of keeping the mob off - Thompson was not fighting at the time, he struck him; the fourth round was over - Thompson was not sitting on his second's knee; he was standing - he was standing in an attitude to fight; Mulany did not come in front of Thompson; he was running round Murphy; he hit him the first blow on the back of his head; I was outside the ring, but saw the stick hit him; he swung the stick with all his force - Thompson took no notice of it; he did not seem to mind it as anybody would have thought; he looked round at the man who struck him; I was too far off to hear him say anything; then he gave him a second blow on the back of his head, in the very same place for what I could see; it was in keeping the mob off that he gave him the second blow, in the same round; he did not seem to take any notice of the second blow - it was a very thick stick; a middling size - he hit as hard as he could both times.</p>

            . I was present at the fight. I saw persons break into the ring about the fourth round - they all surrounded the two men fighting, and the sticks flew over their heads, as much as to say, "Keep aside, and let them fight" - and about the middle of the round, I saw Mulany, as Thompson was falling, lift up his foot and kick Thompson in the p*****s - I did not see him kick more than once; directly Thompson fell down he drew his two legs up together, and I never saw him move till the seconds picked him up - I saw nobody else kick or strike Thompson at any time; there were a great many people about - I do not know that any more saw him, there were several strangers close to me - I cannot say whether there was any more ill usage, for I was lifted right away by the mob, and could not get near the ring afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. You said it was the fourth round? A. No; I said it was about the middle of the fight; I did not say about the middle of the fourth round; he received a blow from the man he was fighting with, after he was kicked - as soon as the man received the kick, Murphy struck at him and the man fell down.</p>

               <p>Q. On your oath did you not just now tell us he was falling when the man kicked him? A. To be sure; Murphy made a hit at him and the man kicked him, and Murphy put out his hand and the man fell; the man was hit first and kicked afterwards - while falling Murphy struck out the other hand; the blow which caused him to fall, was received just here (over the nose); the ring at that time was about the size of this table; he fell backwards, and the man who knocked him down was facing him - as he stood with his legs open, a man stood in the ring, and came and kicked him; he came to the side, he could very easy kick him, by swinging his leg round; he kicked as he stood, for he must kick rather round; he first came in front and struck him while the man he was fighting with was standing before him - I don't know anybody there who saw this; I did not look round; I was afraid to move; I saw some of the witnesses there who have been examined - they were all there at the time this happened - I do not know that they had an opportunity of seeing this kick - I am a day-labourer; I work for anybody I can get to work for - I do not work exactly for anybody now - I have had employ from Mr. Manning, a builder; about a week ago, I worked for him, close by my own home, in Little James-street, Marylebone; he lives in Earl-street; I did not work for him above two or three days - I cannot give the name of anybody else I have worked for; these are not my usual working clothes that I have on; this is the first time I have had this coat on - my mother brought it home from a gentleman's house, - I have had the trousers two or three months - on my oath I have not been furnished with these clothes for the purpose of appearing before the Jury - I received the coat on Saturday; I do not know who the gentleman was my mother brought it from - I did not trouble about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have you ever been here before? A. If I have been here I suffered the law; I stood where the prisoners do and suffered the law for it; I was charged with stealing some prints; I cannot say how long it is ago; I never keep a recollection of these things; it is as near as I can guess two or three years ago; I was sent away about my business; I was never here on any other occasion at all, nor in the other Court - I was never charged with stealing shoes in my life; nobody said I had stolen shoes from my master's shop, nor boots, nor anything - I never had any charge against me but stealing prints, that was all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The battle was in a field? A. Yes; it was a very fine day, the grass was slippery, it had been fed off - I occasionally play at cricket; it is usual to wear spiked shoes when the grass is slippery - here is the shoe Thompson had on, they have sparables half-way driven into the sole, to enable him to stand better on the ground; but Murphy's shoe had a spike in the centre like the heel of a skate; I only noticed one spike - I consider his object in wearing it was to keep his foot secure on the ground - Ready's conduct was manly and fair; after the man fell he manifested every anxiety to assist him to my knowledge - from what I saw, I think if it had not been for the interference of the mob, the fight would have gone off all quiet and pleasantly, there is no doubt of it.</p>

            . I am a smith. I went to see the fight between Thompson and Murphy in a cart; the prisoner Mulaney and two or three other neighbours were with me - the fight had gone on about half an hour before Mulany got out of the cart, as near as I can recollect - a stick was given him after he got out of the cart; nothing had happened to him before the stick was given to him - I observed him nearly the whole time of the fight; he took no act or part in the fight whatever - he had not been long in the ring before a man called out that he was robbed, and I and a neighbour who was in the cart got out, as it was said Mulany was being robbed- when I got to Mulany, he was coming towards me, towards the cart, and he had his hat broken; his hat was whole when he left the cart - I asked him to get into the cart, which he did, with me and the others; Mulany was out of the cart about twenty minutes or half an hour before I saw him as I have described - I had a pretty good view of him all the time; I did not see him attempt to strike or beat anybody, nor anything of the kind, and from the time he got into the cart again, he did not get out till we got to Finchley-common - the fight went on after he returned to the cart - I had a view of the people fighting generally; I never saw Mulany within ten or eighteen yards of them - I have known him ten or twelve years - he is a smith.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many rounds took place before he got out of the cart? A. I should think six or seven, as near as I can recollect - he is an Irishman, I believe- I have not seen him particularly a companion of Murphy's; he might have spoken to him in passing, as he lived in our neighbourhood; I never knew him as a companion of his - he might have spoken to him at the door as he passed, but never to go out drinking - they knew each other - I am not in the habit of going to fights, but it being a very fine day, and a neighbour having a horse and cart, I agreed to go - Mulany and I went together, and came back together; it was a neighbour's cart - several others went with us - he stood in the outer ring among the people; I did not see him near the men; for some time the ring was kept, but Murphy was brought out of the ring; then he was called back again by Thompson's party, and there was five or six rounds afterwards; there was great confusion then - at the beginning the fight was conducted very well; there was an excellent ring - the ring was not broken in before Mulany got out of the cart, nor before he came back again; there was some confusion, but not so close as to compass the men; the ring got closer and closer every round, after the sixth or eighth until the fight finished.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When he was out of the cart your eye was not constantly fixed on him? A. No; it was on the people who were fighting - I went out of the cart myself when he did, but it was at the back part of the ring; I remained in the cart when he returned - while he was gone I got out for a necessary purpose, and got in again - I was looking at the people fighting, not watching him - during that time I did not see the ring closed on the men who were fighting - when he got up into the cart and we were coming away, I perceived a confusion in the ring, but not till after he came back - the ring was not properly kept certainly, at the latter part - while he was out of the cart - I first saw it broken in after he came back with his hat broken; he did not come back to the cart twice - I never saw the ring broken in at any other time - I will certainly take on myself to swear it was not broken in at the fourth round, nor at the seventh round; not before the eighth - when Mulany came back, and said he was robbed was the first time the ring was broken in; that was the first time I saw the confusion, and the only time - they did not restore the ring afterwards; there was confusion, and I saw no more fighting - I was a long distance off.</p>

            . I am a whitesmith, and live at No. 10, Oxford-buildings. I went to the fight; I was on the top of a coach, near the cart in which Mulany was - I did not see him get out of the cart; I saw him out of it; the fight had been then going on about twenty minutes - I heard a scuffle on the opposite side of the ring, and saw him surrounded by a mob of men, and saw the crown of his hat was knocked in - I was standing on the roof of a coach; I saw no one go to his assistance; he appeared flurried in the mob; I called to John Hayes, and others in the cart - I never saw him within ten or twelve yards of the men; I had a very good view of the fight; he never was near enough to strike the men; I knew him well and must have seen him if he struck either of the men - there was a man named

            . I was at the fight; I was sitting on the box of a hackney-coach, which gave me a very good view of the fight - I saw Mulany there in a cart; I did not see him get out; when I first saw him in the cart, the fight had not began; the ring was forming; I saw him in the cart after the fight began; there might be two or three rounds taken place before I saw him; I afterwards saw him out of the cart, on the side of the ring; I noticed him there for about half an hour, and saw him return; during the time he was out of the cart the fight was going on; I was looking at it - I did not see Mulany strike, or attempt to strike, either of the men fighting; I don't think such a thing could have happened without my seeing it; I must have seen it.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. I was in a van looking at the fight; I saw Mulany there in a cart; I saw him out of the cart afterwards - I suppose the men had fought ten or twelve rounds before he got out - it might be twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour; I remember his returning to his cart again; the fight was going on then, and continued a long time after he got into the cart; I observed him while he was out of the cart, he did not take any part in it; he was fifteen or sixteen yards from the combatants - if he had attempted to strike either of them, I must have seen it - I remember seeing him near Finchley with the crown of his hat all broken.</p>

            . I am a plasterer. I was at the fight, inside the ring, very near the men who were fighting; I was there before the fight began, not in the centre of the ring, but inside the spectators who formed the ring; I continued there during the whole fight, as near as anybody to the men, except the seconds - I saw Mulany there; I never saw him attempt to strike either of the men, he could not have done it without my seeing it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had Mulany a stick in his hand? A. When I first observed him in the ring he had a small cane in his hand; he was inside the spectators that formed the ring; once he was near me, and that was all; I did not see him moving about, I saw him near me, and that was the only time I saw him; I might have seen him about two or three minutes - the ring was not broken in at the third or fourth round: it might have been broken in about the sixteenth round, but to the best of my knowledge not before - I was there but I did not take notes of the fight - it was broken in, but I did not take notice what time it was broken in; it was late in the fight, I should say about the sixteenth round, not before, to the best of my knowledge - I saw nobody strike Thompson but his combatant; I saw nobody kick him, nor any foul play at all on the part of the man who fought him; it was foul play breaking the ring in - I term the ring being broken in, foul play; the confusion continued from the time it was once broken in, to the end of the fight - to the best of my knowledge there were twenty-seven rounds altogether, the last ten all in confusion - I understood it lasted about an hour and forty minutes; it might be about an hour after the fight began, that the ring was broken in, not till then, to the best of my belief.</p>

            . I am a smith, and live in Oxford-buildings. I was at the fight on the roof of a coach with Branham; I saw Mulany, he got out of the cart about twenty minutes or half an hour after the fight began - I saw him in the act of getting into the cart again afterwards; he was on the shaft of the cart, and his hat was broken - he did not say anything in my hearing about how his hat got in that state - I was about seven yards from him; the fight continued after he got into the cart for twenty-five minutes or half an hour - I observed the two persons who were fighting while Mulany was out; he did not go near them, or attempt to strike either of them, I must have seen it if he had - I was ten or fifteen yards from where the commencement of every round was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then Mulany was three quarters of an hour on the ground? A. Yes, before he left the cart, and then half an hour out of the cart - I did not keep my eye on him all the time; he was out of my sight - I did not see him with any stick in his hand at all - I did not observe whether he had a stick or not when he got out of the cart; I took no notice of it, the whole of my attention was directed towards the men fighting - I saw no foul play from anybody present, all was fair from beginning to end - about the end of it, both parties seemed anxious to see who was winning - but as to striking either of the parties, that could not be done without my seeing it -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050092"></xptr>the ring was broken-in after the twentieth round, not before that.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. He threatened to strike a man if he did not stand back? A. Yes; he struck his stick on the ground to keep the ring; he was inside the ring, there were people behind and before us; I was about ten minutes with him walking round the ring - I did not see exactly the time he got out of his cart, but he was in it for twenty minutes after the fight began, to my knowledge; in a few minutes after he got out, he walked round the ring with me - it could not be more than ten minutes after that I saw him in the cart; I did not see him go back to his cart, but I saw him in the cart about twenty minutes after; I was not with him when his hat was struck.</p>

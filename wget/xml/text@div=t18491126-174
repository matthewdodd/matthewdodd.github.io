                  </hi>. On the morning of 26th Oct. I was walking along a part of London that I do not know very well. I saw the prisoner, and asked her the way; she said it was this way; I went with her—I fancied she was an Irishwoman, and got into conversation with her—she said she thought a little breakfast would do me good, and she would be glad to give me a cup of tea; I said I had no money, and was not accustomed to take refreshment from a stranger in that way—I went into a house, which I thought was hers, to get the tea; after I had sat for two or three minutes, and the tea was not forth<lb></lb>coming, the prisoner was gone—I went into another room, and saw an older</p>

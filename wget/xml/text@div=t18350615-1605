                  </hi>. I am a seedsman. I was in the King's Bench prison—I knew the prisoner in the country, about five years ago—he came to visit me in the King's Bench, to ask how I did—I do not know any other reason—I left the prison on the Thursday previous to Good Friday, which was on the 17th of April—the prisoner accompanied me that day—I took my trunk and my portmanteau—I afterwards lost them—they contained the articles stated in the indictment—I removed them to the New Bridge Hotel, kept by Mr. Wallis, at the foot of London Bridge—I left them there on the Saturday morning—I stopped there from the Thursday night till the Saturday morning—the prisoner parted with me on the Thursday evening; but he called again on me on the Friday evening—not a word passed about the trunks, at any time—he was not to interfere or take any notice of them—I got into Yorkshire by the steam packet—I had been out early, and was coming over the bridge—the vessel was going off—I ran into the hotel—I said, "I ill leave my trunks and the bill, unpaid—give me one of your bar bills and I will write upon</p>

               <p>it that you may know it again—I went to Huddersfield—I got there two days afterwards—I wrote up immediately, and sent by the guard—I did not receive my trunks, and I came to London—I then heard the trunks had been removed—I went to the station-house on the Monday week—I there saw the prisoner—the policeman went and got him—I afterwards found the trunk and the portmanteau at the prisoner's house—they had been opened—they were locked when I left them—both the locks had been broken.</p>

PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you serious in saying you do not know why this man called on you in the King's Bench? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, quite serious; after he had called on me, I employed him to seck out an attorney—I do not remember the name of the attorney—I mentioned the name to the policeman, but now I have forgotten it. I was not acquainted with him enough to know his name—I found his name by information that I had given me—it is an odd name—Mackarel is the name—I have seen him—the prisoner found him out for me, and he did what I wanted done—I paid the expenses myself—the prisoner only went to Hoxton for him—I had plenty of money when I left the prison—I had had the property in the trunks several weeks—it was put in at different times—it would be impossible to say when I bought the property—I took the benefit of the Insolvent Act the day before Good Friday—this was not the property of the assignees—nothing was in my other trunk but old invoices—it was a port<lb></lb>manteau—there were two or three hundred invoices—I returned this property in my schedule—it is not the property of my assignees—I did not swear that this was not my property—the question was not put to me—I never swore it was not my property—I was going to Huddersfield—I called at a place named Goole—I did not tell the prisoner that I should have only 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left, when I left Goole, and desire him to pay my expenses at the tavern—I swore to my shedule, and these trunks were in the room when the person came to take an inventory of what I had—he saw them I read the schedule before I swore to it—whatever is in the schedule is correct—it is a good while ago—I cannot tell whether the trunks were in it or not—they were, to the best of my knowledge—I would not swear it—I swear I never gave the prisoner authority to go and fetch these things—there were no money transactions between us—he had no business to pay Mr. Wallis—he did not know what was in the trunk or portmanteau—he got them both—the invoices were of no value to anybody—I had known the prisoner five years—I do not know how he knew I was in the Bench—he saw my name, very likely, in the newspaper—it was two or three days before I came out, that I employed him to go for Mr. Mackarel—I never received any letter from the prisoner down in Yorkshire—Mr. Wallis told me that the prisoner had paid him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in two separate sums—he paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and got the trunk, and then he got the portmanteau, and paid the remainder—I know Squires and Tolkington, but I paid them all that was due—I have the receipt in my pocket—I heard the prisoner say that he had written to me, but I never received his letter, certainly.</p>

On we 16th of April, the prosecutor and the prisoner came there in the cab—they brought a trunk and portmanteau—I saw the prisoner there on the Friday—the prosecutor left on Saturday morning early—he asked my mistress, in my presence, for a bill of the place—the trunk and portmanteau were left there—he wrote his name on the back of one of our bar-bills—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. I was applied to by the prosecutor—I went to the B division, New-way, Westminster, and sent for the prisoner (who was a police officer) off his beat, and took him into custody—I asked him what he had done with Mr. Pontey's things—he said he had sent them to Yorkshire—I asked him if he bad booked them—he said he did not recollect—he could not tell me by what coach he sent them, or by what waggon—he afterwards said he sent them to Islington—I went to the street where he said he lodged, near Finsbury-square; and found in his lodgings thirty-seven duplicates; but only four relating to the property here—I spoke to him on the subject, and he said his children were starving, and that induced him to commit what he did—I made inquiry, and believe that to be the fact—his wife was in very great distress at that time—I have reason to believe they were starving—he came into the police on the 1st of June—this was committed on the 18th of April.</p>

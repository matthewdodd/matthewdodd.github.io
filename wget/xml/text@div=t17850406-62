               <p>I am an officer, I remember an out-cry on Monday night, I was in Fleet-street, I am one of the City patrols, between nine and ten, coming down Fleet-street, I saw the prisoner at the bar go up to this young woman, and snatched a gold picture from off her neck, he made two or three pulls at it, and before he got it off, she cried out murder! There was another in company with him, and the same time I ran up and seized the prisoner, he opened his hand, and the prosecutrix took the picture out, and one of them struck her on the breast; as soon as I took the prisoner in custody, the other made his escape, I took the prisoner to the Compter, and desired the young lady to give me her address; she was scarce able to walk at the time, and two gentlemen assisted her; here is the picture, I saw him snatch it.</p>
               <p>(The locket shewn to the prosecutrix and deposed to)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask her, whether she is not a common street walker.</p>
               <p>Court. If she was you have no right to rob her.</p>
               <p>Court to Forsyth. Do you know the young woman? - I cannot say I do, I have seen her in the city or Norwich, but I have not seen her for three years.</p>
               <p>Is she a person of character or no? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>I was going down Fleet-street with a young man, I sell greens and potatoes with a jack-ass, as I was coming home walking down Fleet-street towards the market, this young woman immediately ran after me, she was talking to this gentleman, she immediately ran after me, says she, this is the person that robbed me; and this gentleman took me, I had a person here, but I do not see him now, his name is Badcock, a leather-cutter, the corner of Westmoreland-buildings; when I was in the Compter, a person came and said, that woman had served him so, and the constable had served him with a warrant, that he should not appear.</p>
               <p>Forsyth. His name is Simons, the warrant has been out against him this month, I do not know who he is, I imagine he was the same man that was with this prisoner.</p>

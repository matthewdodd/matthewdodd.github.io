                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Guy's Hospital. Last Sunday night week, about half-past one o'clock, Esther Sednem came to the hospital accompanied by two policemen—her lips were very much swollen, and there were marks as if produced by fire, or being burnt by some corrosive substance—I examined inside her mouth, but could find no injury beyond the margin of the lips—I observed yellow stains on her clothes, which might have been produced by corrosive acid, as well as the marks on her person—I kept her in the hospital that night—next morning her lips were rather more swol<lb></lb>len, and had a whitish appearance—I observed her throat again, but could not find any injury done to it—there was a stiffness about the mouth, she could not open it easily—a tea-spoonful of aqua-fortis taken might cause death—it would depend on a great many circumstances.</p>

               <p>the prisoner—he was my seducer—I did not live with him—I have known him upwards of four years—last Sunday week he passed by where I live—he accosted me first, and asked if I would walk with him as far as Magdalen<lb></lb>circus, and I did—he asked me if I had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as he had 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him I had not—he then flew into a passion with me—I tried to wish him good night, when I saw something in his pocket—I asked what he had got there—he pulled a bottle out, and said, "It is something very nice, taste it"—it was a phial—he held the back of my neck with his right hand, while he put the bottle to my mouth with his left—I frit a burning in my mouth, and put my hands up, and struggled with him to release myself—I did not swallow any. thing—some of it went into my mouth, and part of the way down my throat, but I felt the burning, and spit it out—I struggled with him violently to re<lb></lb>lease his hand from my mouth, and in doing so it burnt my face and my clothes, and likewise my hands—I asked him what it was—he said, "It is only hair-oil, you b—, finish it"—I asked him again what it was, when he emptied the remainder on the pavement—he then told me it was aqua-fortis—he walked away from me—I still followed, and asked why he had given me that stuff—when he came to his own door he called a policeman to move me away—the policeman desired him to go in-doors, and me to go home, which I did, and I was then taken to the hospital.</p>

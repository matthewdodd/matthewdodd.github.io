On Thursday morning, 15th April, about 11 o'clock, I saw the prisoners with a hamper, each holding a handle of it—I followed them, and they were stopped by Mile End Gate—therewere fowls in the basket, and I asked George Wheeler where he got them from; he said that he bought them of Mr. Baxter, of Leytonstone, and gave 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for them—two other officers followed them, but I did not—I heard George Wheeler say at the station that he bought them at Romford, on Wednesday—I asked him whether he saw any persons there whom he knew, he said that he did not.</p>

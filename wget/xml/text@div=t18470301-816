                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at sydenham. On the night of the 15th of February, I went into the Railway Tavern, New Cross, and saw the prisoner there—I came out and walked five or six yards on the main road, I then turned to make water—the prisoner came and took hold of my arm and asked me to go with her to Deptford—I said I wanted nothing to do with her, and pushed her on one side, she twisted herself forward, and put her hand into my right hand pocket—I said she had robbed me—she denied it—I seized her hand, and called a policeman—I had a purse in that pocket with two half-sovereigns and ten shillings and sixpence in silver when she came up—I called "Police," and heard the purse drop—the police came, and picked up the ring of the purse close to her feet—she was taken to the station—we returned to the spot, and found the purse, and two half-sovereigns, one half-crown, and three shillings and sixpence in it—I was sober.</p>

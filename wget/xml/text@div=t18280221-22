Earl-street, On the 10th of February, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was standing with my back against a butcher's door in the Edgware-road; the two prisoners came up, and asked why I stood there - I told them I had had a few words with the person I lodged with, and did not feel inclined to go home; they asked me to go home and sleep with them that night; I told them I would not go, for I thought they had got some persons behind them - there were two men behind them: they said the men were nothing to them - that they were going to sleep together, and I should be welcome to sleep with them; I was glad to embrace the opportunity, and walked with them up Edgware-road, along Earl-street, till I came to a street where there is a public-house, called the Champion, at the corner; we went by that public-house a great distance, to a place where there were very few lamps, and a very bad light: I asked how much farther they had to go - they told me to the further end of that street, which one of them pointed to; I began to feel timid, and said I would not go any farther: I was going to cross the street, when I was pushed into a great place that was dug for a sewer, and one of them laid hold of my cloak - I hallooed out, "Pray don't take my cloak;" they dragged it till the ribbon gave way which fastened it round my waist, and the other ribbon which tied it round my neck, and got it off; I held on with both my hands as long as I was able, and one of them beat my wrist; my hands were beat till they were all colours; Ryan laid hold of my cloak, and it was Bryant who beat my hands; they got my cloak - I followed them down the street as fast as I could, calling Stop thief! no person came to my assistance; I lost sight of them, and did not see them any more that night. On the Tuesday following I saw Thompson, the officer, bring Ryan to High-street Office, and on the Wednesday I saw Bryant at the office - I had never seen them before, to my knowledge; I was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour with them, and can swear to them - I took particular notice of them, as I thought it was kind for them to offer to take me home to sleep, being a stranger. I had had some words with the woman I lodge with, and did not like to go in; the woman keeps a dairy - I lodge about one hundred yards from the butcher's shop, and go out washing. I had gone round to the pawnbroker's on the Tuesday, to search for my cloak, and found it at Fairlam's; I then told Thompson, the officer, of it, and he knew the persons I described to him.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 59, Lisson-grove. The prisoner Ryan pawned this cloak on Monday evening, the 11th of February, for 2s., in the name of Mary Ryan; I have seen her before at the shop - it is worth 3s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner RYAN. Q. Did I pawn it? A. Yes; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210032"></xptr>knew her before - she gave her address in Nightingale-street; my boy was in the shop, but I received it from her, and am certain of her; I lent her the money on it. The prosecutrix came on Tuesday, and asked if I had such a one; I produced it.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On Tuesday morning about ten o'clock, the prosecutrix came to me; she complained of being robbed, described the girls, and said the cloak was pawned in the name of Ryan; I went to No. 10, Nightingale-street, and found Ryan in the first floor back room; I said, "Poll, I want you;" I knew her before - she asked what for; I said for a robbery; she asked if it was for a man or woman - I said a woman; the answer she made was,"B-gg-r you;" she was going to state something, but I said it was a serious charge againest her, and if she said anything further I should be obliged to state it in evidence against her. As I took her to the office we passed Fairlam's shop - I stopped there to tell him to come to the office, and as soon as she saw me stop, she said, "I see what has done me, pledging it in my own name;" I cautioned her again not to say anything, and took her to the office. The prosecutrix described Bryant; I informed another officer, having occasion to go out myself - I afterwards went with him, and directed him to a house in Exeter-street, Lisson-grove, where he found her, and brought her out to me; I knew them both before - they are women of the town: I did not know the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH LOCKER re-examined. This is my cloak; I described the marks on it before I saw it - two of the atraps are not stitched, and I put pins in it; I bought it in November, 1826.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BRYANT. Q. Do you mean to say that I struck you? A. Yes, you beat me over my wrists, and over my hand; I am sure she is the person.</p>
               <p>BRYANT's Defence. I and Ryan were walking up the road about ten o'clock on Sunday night, and saw her standing against the door, very much intoxicated, with three or four boys round her; we told her to come away from them - we came along; she stopped at a public-house, said she would give us somthing to drink, and pulled out a bad halfpenny, and said she was sorry that would get nothing; I told her to go home - she said she had no where to go; I gave Ryan the key to go home with her, as I was not going directly myself; she would make me go with her, and as I turned up Exeter-street, as it was very dark, I said I would not go that way, but she would go that way; I said the other street was nearest- we came to a place where there was a plank; I stood while they both went across, and saw her fall; I cannot say whether Ryan knocked her down or not; I heard her halloo, and she said she was pinching her - I heard her say she was in a fit; I saw her hitting her with the key; she said, "Don't take my cloak;" I saw her take the cloak and run away - I ran after her; she was out of my sight in a moment; I did not know she meant to rob her. When I came back the prosecutrix was gone, and when I got home I found Ryan in bed; I asked what she had done with the cloak - she made no answer; in the morning, when I got up, I saw it under the bed, and said, "Here is the cloak;" she said Yes; it was all over mud, and she asked me to brush it - I would not. I went home to my sister's and told her of it, but she advised me to say nothing of it; I returned at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon - she was out, and the cloak was gone - I went out again, and found her at home at tea when I returned; I asked her what she had done with the cloak - she said it was nothing to me - that she should have to answer for it. I went next day to my sister's, and she told me to say nothing about it; the officer came next day; I told Ryan I would tell the truth before the Magistrate, and she said it I did it would be worse for me, and told me to keep my own counsel.</p>
               <p>RYAN's Defence. What she has said is a wicked falsehood; we met the prosecutrix, and went down Edgware-road; she agreed as well as me to take her down that place, and I could bring witnesses to prove she herself look the money that was lent on the cloak, and took it down to a young man who is in Clerkenwell; I did pawn it certainly - she brushed it; she knew more about it than I did, and never left me a moment; she is as much in it as I am - I only had enough of the money to get my tea with.</p>

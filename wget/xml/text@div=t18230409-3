The prisoner made a rush at my watch; he seized the chain which broke, and separated from the watch, and he ran off with it - I gave the alarm of Stop thief! and followed him with my servant and others; he turned into Devonshire-street, three doors from my house, and into Devonshire-mews, where he was taken and brought back to me by my servant and others; he said he hoped I would forgive him as it was the first time. My chain and seals were delivered me - I have them now.</p>

            . I pursued the prisoner - he was knocked down by somebody in Devonshire mews, and I secured him. I saw the chain and seals found within five yards of where I took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, Written. Between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was going up Upper Harley-street, in my way to Paddington-street, to see a friend - I heard a cry of Stop thief; looked up, and a man immediately passed me; I followed him with others, he turned into Devonshire-street; we did not then see him, but concluding he had gone into the mews, we took that way, and fifty yards down the mews I was pushed down by the witness, who said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! I have got you;" I replied you are mistaken, I am in pursuit of the thief, who is gone on before; but he took me back to the gentleman at the house, who said</p>
               <p>"I have lost my chain and seals, have you got them, or, are you the person who took them;" being alarmed, I only declared my innocence, but the man who stopped me said he saw no one pass before me, which induced the gentleman to suspect I had robbed him. A person brought the chain and seals, which were found a short way from where I was pushed down; this strengthened the suspicion of my guilt, and I was taken to the office - these are the general facts of the case. The mews is a thoroughfare, and the man who stopped me was one hundred yards down, and the cry of Stop thief! had not reached his ear till we entered the mews in pursuit; the man we were pursuing was two hundred yards before us, therefore he could have passed the man unnoticed, and reached Weymonth-street.</p>

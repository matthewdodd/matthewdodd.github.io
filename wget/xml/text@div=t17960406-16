               <p>On Sunday night last, about eleven o'clock, I was going up Holborn, the prisoner at the bar took me by the arm, nearly opposite Ely Place; she asked me to give her some money; I told her I had no coppers; I was going to leave her; she gave me a sudden pull by the arm, and put her hand round me; I got myself disengaged from her, rather suspecting that she might have picked my pocket; I put my hand in my pocket, and discovered that my money was gone; I had not three minutes before put my hand in my pocket; I had three guineas and two half-guineas; I immediately turned back, and took her by the right hand; I asked her where she lived; she said, in Covent-garden; I told her it was too far, but I would take her to a nearer house; I led her to the end of Fetter-lane; she turned up Fetter-lane, and seemed to wish to get herself disengaged from me, by pulling off her pattens, and various manoeuvres; I called the watchman, and delivered her to him; she was there searched; three guineas and an half-guinea were found in her pocket, with a sixpence, and some halfpence; on bringing her to the watch-house, the watchman said, he heard something fall; we searched, but could not find any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish him to be asked for the money that he gave me, and then took away from me again.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Had you any toying with her, or any communication with her)? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. He was in liquor, and he gave me the money out of his waistcoat pocket, and said he would sleep all night with me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that so? - A. It is not, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Nor you had no improper communication with her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Were you quite sober? - A. Perfectly so.</p>

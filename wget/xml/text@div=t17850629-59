             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Monday evening the 16th of May, Mr. Worral and myself had been at Ranelagh, and about two in the morning we were in <placeName id="t17850629-59-crimeloc284">Duke-street, Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17850629-59-crimeloc284" type="placeName" value="Duke-street, Lincoln's-Inn-Fields"></interp>

               <p>What sort of light was it? - There was light, the day was breaking, there was sufficient light to discern every part of his dress; I have his face as strong in my recollection as any friend I may happen to know; I did not see Champness till the day after, at the bar of the Bow-street Office , he was in company with others; I believe he came and surrendered himself, hearing that the Magistrates had sent for him , he came to know what they wanted with him; I mentioned that he was the very man before the Magistrate, and I believe Lord Westmoreland and another gentleman that were there heard it; I should suppose that they were a minute or a minute and an half with me, or possibly more; I was somewhat intimidated, and could not get my watch immediately out, and they were very quiet, and did not swear or anything of that kind.</p>
               <p>Court. You say this passed in a minute or a minute and an half, and you was in a hurry, and this was two o'clock, and yet you can venture to swear to him? - I am very confident of him, I feel the unhappy circumstance, I knew him when he came into court, he is the only man I swear to; he had a whitish waistcoat, and a light coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the hand, when you was at the Justice's? - I did, immediately as I got home I mentioned the circumstance.</p>
               <p>When you saw him at Bow-street did you observe his hand ? - Immediately, my Lord, it was in his pocket, it was covered with a handkerchief, it appeared as it did the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. This I see was a very short transaction, so short that you had not an opportunity of observing whether it was a pistol, or a cutlass, or a stick? I observed either a pistol, or cutlass, or something, I had hold of a thing which appeared to me like a pistol, and I put it aside.</p>
               <p>You was somewhat intimidated? - I confess I was.</p>
               <p>So much intimidated that you do not know exactly to whom you gave your money, and to whom you gave your watch? - I know this, that I either gave my money or my watch into the hand that had the wound; I can only swear to one guinea; I never saw the prisoner before, there was something tied over the hand; I do not know whether there was a thumb-stall or not.</p>
               <p>The man came to Bow-street voluntarily? - So I was told; he immediately came to the bar; he said that the officer had been enquiring at his house for him, and therefore he walked up; he was with seven or eight at the bar.</p>
               <p>He was shewn to you as a person that had surrendered himself, knowing that enquiries had been made after him? - No, he was not, I saw the faces of four or five.</p>
               <p>Who was under examination at that time? - I believe the man in the green coat was at the bar at that time.</p>
               <p>Who was in the coach with you? - Mr. Worrall, and a Mr. Hall.</p>
               <p>I should suppose they had the same opportunity of observing the prisoner that you had? - I was next the door myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever see your watch afterwards? - No, I never did.</p>

               <p>- WORRALL sworn.</p>
               <p>I do not swear to either of the men, I only know in general of the robbery.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of May the prisoners were discharged from Sir Sampson's, and the lusty man, Champness had a handkerchief round his hand at that time; this gentleman came on the 17th, to give information.</p>
               <p>This man came to the office of his own accord, did he not? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Jury to Read. Do you know anything of the other prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER CHAMPNESS'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I leave it to my councel intirely; I hope my surrendering myself is sufficient that I was innocent.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you charge him before you saw his hand? - Before I saw his hand I mentioned it to several persons round.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Champness. I confess I had something round my hand; it had been cut; there was not a single person at the bar when I surrendered myself but this young man.</p>

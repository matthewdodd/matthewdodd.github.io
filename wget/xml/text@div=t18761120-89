                  </hi>. I am a surgeon practising at Guildford—on Thursday evening, 6th July, I saw the body of this child at the County police-station; I afterwards <hi rend="italic">made.a, post-mortem</hi> examination of it—as far as I could judge from the condition of the heart and lungs the cause of 
death was suffocation; it was not caused by drowning in my opinion—in my opinion the child was dead before it was thrown into the water—on Sunday, 9th July, I saw Balchin at her house; I went there with Mr. Barker; I'said to her that I thought she looked very ill, and asked her—what had been the matter; she said she thought it was the change of life—I asked if she had lost a great deal; she said "Yes "—I then asked her when she was last confined; she said thirteen years ago—I said "Have you not been confined recently?"—she said "I am not conscious of having been—confined"—I said "Have you miscarried?" she said "Yes, twelve years ago "—I then asked her if she had any objection to being examined; she sad no, but she should like her own medical man—I asked her who her own medical man was—she said "Dr. Capron, of Shere—I said "I know Dr. Capron very well, we will go and see if we can get him to come"—Dr. Capron afterwards came—she asked me how it was she came to be suspected of having had a child—I said "Your mother has been taken into custody, and she states that she attended you at your last confinement on the Saturday previous, and that she afterwards brought the child in a basket and put it into the river; that is the reason why you have been suspected of having had a child "—she said "I assure you, Mr. Shollick it is quite false, I have not been confined."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She was very weak indeed, and very much blanched, in such a state as would result from great loss of blood—I began the con<lb></lb>versation with her at once on going in; I was alone with her; I had seen her before—she knew me, and so did her husband—I had not attended her before, but I had been called in in consultation with Dr. Capron and Dr. Taylor, of Guildford, to see her husband, who had fractured his legs; that</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.D. and live at Shere—on 9th July I was fetched by Mr. Barker to see Balchin—I found her in bed and very weak; I told her she was suspected of having had a child, and I asked her if that was the case—she said if that was so she was not sensible when it was born—I asked if she had any objection to my examining her medically to see if that was the case; she made no objection—I examined her and came to the conclusion that she had been recently delivered of a child, within a week or ten days—I only noticed that she was feeble, she had evidently had a great loss of blood, nothing more—I found nothing else that attracted my notice—of course I looked at her breasts, that was part of my medical examina<lb></lb>tion; that was one of my reasons for saying that she had had a child—I had no doubt in my own mind of the fact—she said the first remembrance of consciousness she had was her mother saying "Good God, child, you are dying "—I asked if she had made any preparation with her mother before<lb></lb>hand to take the child away; that she denied—I think it is possible that as soon as the child was born she might have had excessive flooding, and she might be unconscious as to what became of the child afterwards—patients frequently from severe loss do faint away and are unconscious for some time—I should scarcely think she could have been unconscious of giving birth to a child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have never know such a case, I should think it im<lb></lb>possible—during the pains of labour. she must have been conscious of it; she would not be unconscious before the child was born except under excessive hemorrhage, which would be unusual before birth—such a thing might occur, but it is not usual—I think she must have been conscious that she was giving birth to a child at the time of its birth; she might have been unconscious a few minutes aftewards, and before the child was fully. born—I don't think she could suppose it to be a miscarriage; but that de-. pends upon whether the miscarriage takes place at an early or late period; at a very late period it may still be a living child of seven months, a child that breathed—I don't think it possible for her to be unconscious then—I examined the bed; there had been a considerable amount of hemorrhage, but of course I could not say when that occurred—she asserted that she was unconscious at the birth of the child—I did not hear her say that she saw no child at all—I had been her medical attendant for thirteen or fourteen years; I had never attended her for a confinement—I have heard it re<lb></lb>ported that the mother always attended on those occasions—my last attendance upon her was three or four months previously—she then came to me and complained that she thought she was undergoing a change of life—I treated her for that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If she had recovered from the fainting I do not think she could be unconscious of the fact that she had given birth to a child, or forget it.</p>

               <p>or directly after birth; if it occurred to such an extent as to render her unconscious, that unconsciousness might last some hours, it would depend on the amount of hemorrhage; if it lasted more than an hour I should say it would be of a serious nature, and it would be necessary to call in a medical attendant—severe hemorrhage would weaken her considerably and make her unconscious for some period, not for days, say twelve hours; not total unconsciousness, but a kind of faintness or weakness; she would be unable to take part in what was going on, or to know what other persons said.</p>

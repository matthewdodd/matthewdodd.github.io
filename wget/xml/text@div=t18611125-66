               <p>—on Saturday, October 26th, about noon, I saw the prisoner in a field at the bottom of our garden—he was in the middle of the field, about thirty yards from the footpath, and was looking over our fence—another man was with him—after that the witness Pearson came to the house, and in consequence of what he said I went into a field adjoining the one I had seen the prisoner in, and in a ditch there I found these curtain rings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are my master's—I had seen them safe a few days before—they were kept in a store-room over the stables—I had seen the stable-door fastened at 10 o'clock that morning; but I do not know that the things were there then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You said at the police-court that it was 150 yards from where you saw me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No; I said it was 50 yards, and it was 200 yards from where the things were laid.</p>

I am a labourer at Forest-hill—on Saturday, 26th October, about a quarter to 1, I was walking round the fields behind the prosecutor's house, and saw the prisoner and another man coming in a direc<lb></lb>tion from the house—the other man was carrying something under his coat; I could not see what it was, but it looked shiney—on seeing me they put the things in a ditch, and passed me—I went up and saw what they were—I then went to Mr. Britter's house and asked if they had lost anything, and then went to the constable's house—I saw the things found in the ditch; it was where I had seen them put something in.</p>

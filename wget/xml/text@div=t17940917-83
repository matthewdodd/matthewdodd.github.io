               <p>I am partner in the house of Grote, Myer, and Co. in Leadenhall-street; the ship Maria Elizabeth, Captain Brunswick, bound from London to Hamboro', in the latter end of July I believe she made sail, the 29th or 30th she was wrecked in <placeName id="t17940917-83-crimeloc428">Blackwall Reach</placeName>

The cargo was under the necessity of being relanded, and that Committee gave me the management so far as to take care of it. On Saturday, the 2d of August, the men whom I employed on board to work the ship, among whom the prisoner was one, taking the goods from the wreck into lighters; in the evening, when they had finished their day's work, they were returning on shore, the prisoner, after leaving the wreck, was stopped by one of the King's officers with a piece of satin concealed under his shirt. What I mean by it is, it was covered under his shirt. When the officer had taken it from him, I requested that he might be taken into custody by a constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ager. Did you see every thing that you have been stating? - Most certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him coming on shore? - No; I meant to say, that they were returning from on board the wreck to come on shore; that they had left the wreck, and were on board a lighter, as if returning on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him leave the wreck? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come on shore? - I came on shore with him when he came on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come in some of the lighters? - The lighters did not come on shore; they were lashed along side, and there they remained. He got into the lighter lashed to the wreck, and I see him there, and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the officers of the Custom-house on board the lighter? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. And he came on board the lighter where the officers were, and he stated he had a bit of silk, which he suspected to be smuggled? - I never heard that before the re-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. He asked for the Custom-house officers; did not he? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. He might, and you not know it? - I don't know it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the defendant say? - Not a word, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was not committed the first time? - He was committed for reexamination; I not knowing whose the property was, I did not hardly wish to have the man committed.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was brought up the second time he stated, that he was carrying up this piece of silk with intention to give it the Custom house officer? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. He came from the ship into the lighter where the Custom-house officers were? - Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this vessel wrecked? - On what is called Blackwall Reach, a little below Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you stated who are the consignees of this cargo? - She is a borrowed vessel; when she comes to London she is addressed to Grote, Myer, and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. They shipped this silk? - No; it was shipped by

               <p>Q. Do you know, in point of fact, whether this loss falls on the underwriters? - No; I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. However, from the state of the cargo in which you saw it, there is a partial loss or a total loss, which? - It cannot be called a total loss when things are saved out of it.</p>

            Was it put on board by him, or any of his people, as his property? - Yes; for Hamboro' to our Correspondent Sylick and Moll, they bought it of Mr. Steers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ager. These goods were consigned to the house of Grote, Myers, and Co.? - I only know it is Mr. Steers's property.</p>

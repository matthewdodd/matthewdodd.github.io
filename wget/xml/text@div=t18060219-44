            , foreman to Mr. Braithwaite, informed me that he had missed two metal bushes (a term used in the trade for that article); I instantly ran after Crumpton (the prisoner worked for Mr. Braithwaite), I stopped him and brought him back, he threw something down Mr. Braithwaite's area, I did not see what it was, I took him in the gateway, while I was locking the gate to prevent his escaping, he threw two more pieces away in the yard; I went to Keene the constable; and told him the circumstance, and he searched his house; we found there a great deal of metals and tools.</p>

             sworn. Hearing that Mr. Braithwaite had been robbed, I took particular notice of two pieces of metal laying on the prisoner's bench; I saw these two pieces of metal laying there, before seven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them. - A. A few minutes after seven, I went to the place and found they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards search the yard and the area. - A. I found one piece of metal in the yard, and one piece in the area.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the pieces of metal that you missed. - A. No; I believe they belong to the prosecutor, I will not swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the small shears. - A. No, the candlestick I know that was found at his house on the same evening,</p>
               <p>Q. It could not be taken on that day. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the metal that was missing the same that you found. - A. One piece I believe to be the same, I did not pick it up.</p>
               <p>- WILLIAMS sworn. I picked up one piece of metal bush.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of a metal bush. - A. It is used to part of a pump.</p>

             sworn. Q. Did you search the prisoner's house. - A. Yes, and found a candlestick, I produce it and the metal; the major part of them was found in a chest of drawers down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Lee) Is that your master's candlestick. - A. Yes, I can swear to it by the rod being broke, I broke it myself: I can swear to this metal joint screw that goes to a pump.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your lordships, and gentlemen of the jury; I am a poor young man slow of speech and much confused: I think you will suffer this to be read as my defence, I have lived with the prosecutor two years; the tools as is usual in the trade, were taken only to be used at my own home on private concerns, which I believe every journeyman usually does, the brass is my own, and though it has been admitted that it belongs to the prosecutor, yet there is no marks to distinguish it from others; the patterns are similar at various engineers, and however at first sight and the pattern may correspond, I submit that they are one and the same only. My master is a good man, it is his servants that are against me, I do not wish to speak against them, but they may be mistaken; I have three children and a wife now pregnant, and I am their only support; I shall not be able to provide for them if the sentence is against me; I throw myself upon you lordship's mercy and the jury, I pray god to appear for me at this awful moment; the witnesses at the back of the bill promised to forgive me if I could discover any person taking any property from the prosecutor; I in consequence told them of two, and though he never noticed them, he has acted strange against me.</p>

Yes, I met with these men, about four o'clock on that day, at Bodmin-Cause, near Luxillion, in Cornwall, on the high road; I saw two men riding, as near as I can recollect, and one a walking; there were three horses, with kegs slung across their backs, in the usual way they carry smuggled goods; when I came near them I observed William Row, the tallest man; I alighted from my horse, and went up with intention to seize them; I went up to take hold of the horse, and was knocked down; I cannot recollect any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went up to take hold of the horse, of these men that were mounted, had they got off their horses? - A. Yes; I cannot recollect any more of it, I lost my senses with the blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the very behaviour of the men at the time you got off your horse - did they make towards you or not? - A. I think they did, with their bludgeons uplifted; they were several feet long; a double-handed stick, as they call it.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us where you were when you recovered yourself? - A. At my father's house; it was eight or ten days before I recovered my senses; I saw them afterwards in Bodmin goal; I have no doubt at all of the persons of the prisoners being the men who assaulted me on the road.</p>
               <p>Q. You continued very ill a long time? - A. I am not perfectly recovered now; my sight fails me, I feel a lightness and giddiness in my head at this time.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you were with your brother and his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240108"></xptr>wife, returning from her father's house? - A. Yes, I was on horseback, and my brother and his wife were on another horse; we came up to the prisoners near Bodmin Cause, about three o'clock in the afternoon; there were two men on horseback, and one walking; they had two kegs on their horses, and each of the three a horse apiece; my brother holloaed out to me, here comes a seizure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loud enough for the prisoners to hear? - A. Yes, he halloaed out here comes kegs, or ankers, will you assist, we will take or seize them; I told him I would if there was occasion; they each of them had a large green oak stick, I think they were about four feet long; when my brother spoke to me, I got down; he told his wife to get down, and he went forward towards the men; he said to the men, strike, I will take them in the King's name; they said be off, be off, d - n your bl - y eyes, be off; they prevented me from hearing any more by their noise, they spoke louder than my brother, I could not hear him; one of the men pushed on before, he said to the other two come on; they had their bludgeons uplifted against my brother, the first man that struck missed him; I took hold of his stick, and held it fast; I held him till I heard the shrieks of my brother's wife, then I looked about, and my brother was upon his face, and the other two men were beating him with their bludgeons while he was laying on the ground; I let go the man that I had hold of, and ran between the two men and my brother, and said do not murder him, do not murder him; I said let me assist him, I am his brother, I am no Excise officer; I received a blow that I thought was intended for him, and the man that struck me first struck me again; then the man that I was holding of, he came up, and gave me a violent blow; those two men that are at the bar now struck me twice, and the men that struck my brother struck me down to the ground; my brother's wife was continually shrieking, then they ran off with their horses.</p>
               <p>Q. How long a time might this occupy altogether? - A. Not above two or three minutes; I have no doubt but the two prisoners at the bar are the two out of the three that conducted themselves so, I am sure of their persons, William Row was one of the persons that beat my brother, and George Row was the man that I held, he struck me afterwards; my brother was taken to a cot-house, he was quite insensible, he had some life, but very ill; he was after that taken to my father's house, and was attended by a medical person a long time, he was confined a month before he rode out.</p>

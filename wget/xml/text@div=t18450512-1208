                  </hi>. I live in Pearl-row, Blackfriars-road, and am a licensed victualler. On the 4th of April, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner brought this paper to me—I opened and read it—I said, "Is this Mr. Godfrey's handwriting?"—he said, "Yes"—I told him it would take me some little time to execute the order—he asked me if I had got no bottle—I said yes I had plenty of bottles, but I liked to do business so that I might be led into no dilemma or error, and I should send for a permit—he said, "How long will it be before I shall call again?"—I said it might be an hour or more, as permit writers sometimes were busy, and could not attend—he said, "Then I will call again in about an hour and a half, or two hours, and bring Mr. Godfrey's cart with me"—as soon as he went I despatched an old gentleman, who I send on errands, down to Mr. Godfrey—I told him I had some suspicion before he went—he came back in about half an hour from Mr. Godfrey's, and Mr. Godfrey's servant with him—when the prisoner came again I said to him, "This is a forgery, Mr. God<lb></lb>frey did not write it, or his clerk; how came you by it?"—he said, "Mr. Godfrey's servant gave it to me"—I said, "You have got to prove that, to find Mr. Godfrey's servant"—I gave him in charge—Mr. Godfrey's servant said he knew nothing of him—I live about a mile from Bankside.</p>

                  </hi>. This note is not my writing, nor written by my authority—Turner left me on the 24th of March—this is not Turner's handwriting I am certain—I never saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long was Turner in your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two years—the servant that went to Mr. Hicks is a brother of his—he is here—one of my clerks sent him to Mr. Hicks—Turner had an opportunity of seeing me write—he could write himself, but not at all in this style—I saw his writing constantly for two years—I do not know where he is—he is no relation of mine or my wife's—I have given directions to have him apprehended—I went to Mr. Traill three times—he said he would have him published in the Hue and Cry.</p>

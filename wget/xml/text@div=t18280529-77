On Sunday morning, the 13th of April, the prisoner came to me while I was in bed, and said "Here are your clothes and Joyce's;" I said very well; he came in again in a quarter of an hour, while I was dressing myself, and said, "I will take these for Joyce" - but what he took I do not know.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor has perjured himself - I assisted in looking for the articles for an hour or more: I took his things, and put them on the bed, and saw no more of them. I had an opportunity to make my escape, I went down to get a jug of water; and if I had been guilty I should not have gone to sleep there.</p>

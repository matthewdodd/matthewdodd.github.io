                  </hi>. I live at 18, Ed ward-street, Shepherd's walk, City-road, and have been a barman, but am out of a situation, and have no regular employment—I have known the prisoner some years—I saw him on Saturday evening, 26th March, in the parlour of the Bee-hive, public-house, New-north-road—the prisoner called me out in front of the road, gave me something to drink, and asked me if I could get him change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note? I said "Yes; I can at Mr. Milburn's over the way"—we went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090151"></xptr>
               <p>outside together; there was a female waiting outside—we all three went to Mr. Milburn's; the prisoner and I went in, and the female waited outside—I asked Mr. Milburn if he could change a friend of mine a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; he said "Yes;" the prisoner handed me the note, and I handed it to Mr. Milburn, who said that he should put my name upon it; I said "All right;" and he put the change down on the counter—we had a bottle of soda-water and brandy; two cigars were called for; one of which was offered to Mr. Mil<lb></lb>burn, and he took it—we were standing—when we went out, the female was waiting outside—it was then about 9 o'clock—we then went to Grove's Music-hall, and remained about two hours; we then all three walked as far as Hoxton-Church, and I left the prisoner and the female together, and went home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know the female? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but I had seen her before—I cannot say how lately—I did not know her perfectly—when the prisoner called me out, that was the first time I had seen him that day—I swear that—I had not asked him to come to me for any purpose—I knew he was employed as a letter-carrier sometimes, but did not know in what district—I do not know much about the part where the letters are delivered, it is some two or three miles off where I live—the Hackney-road commences at Shoreditch church—Old-street does not commence from there, but at the corner of Pitfield-street, or the corner of the Curtain-road—I have been about twelve months out of employment—I have sold goods on commission, and I have saved money during the ten yean that I was in one situation, and six years in another—I was in prison for a week once on remand—a friend of mine had a watch to look at, and he gave it to me to return—I was charged with unlawful possession, but was discharged and made a witness—I have not been engaged in skittle sharping, but eleven years ago I was engaged as a witness against some skittle sharpers where I was barman—there has never been any other charge made against me; no charge of assault—I have sold some things on commission for Mr. Milburn, for Mr. Alexander, an auctioneer, and for Mr. Walton, a county court agent—I get an allowance from my brother, and expect to go to California to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Curzon-street, Hoxton—on 26th March I was in the Bee-Hive parlour, New North-road, with Charles Barr—between 8 and 9 o'clock the prisoner came to the door, opened it, and called Barr out—he went out, came back to fetch his hat, and went out again with it—I do not think the prisoner could hear what he said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-officer attached to the post-office—I traced this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to Barr—I traced it from the Bank of England to Milburn, and to him through his brewer—I afterwards went to the house of the prisoner's father, a baker, of 25, Plummer-street, City-road—I left for a short time, and kept my eye on the house—the prisoner went in, and I with him—I asked him if his name was George Ledsham—he said "Yes"—I said, "Do you know a man named Charles Barr?"—he said "Yes"—I said I wished to make inquiry of him respecting a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note he had got changed at Mr. Milburn's, Old-street-road, on the night of 26th March—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090152"></xptr>
               <p>he said "Yes, I was there with Barr, and he changed a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, but I had nothing to do with it"—I asked him if he delivered letters in the Kings<lb></lb>land-road—he said that he had done so, but now delivered them in another walk close to the Kingsland-road—I told him he must go to the solicitor to the Post-office and give some explanation about the note—he went there, told the same story, and I took him in custody.</p>

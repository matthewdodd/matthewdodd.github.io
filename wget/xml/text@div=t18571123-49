               <p>prisoner was in my service for six years; he left in Oct., 1856—about a month after he left, I missed a cream ewer and bason, and some knives and forks—I did not examine my stock when the prisoner left—these articles produced are mine; my name is on these knives, and these silver tea spoons have my private mark, "3290"—this candlestick is of the same manufac<lb></lb>ture as one I had, but I did not miss it.</p>

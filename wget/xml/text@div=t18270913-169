            . I live in Rosemary-lane, about a mile from Globe-fields. As I stood at my door on the Sunday in question, the prisoner came and offered me a watch, and said he wanted money - I offered him 15s., and he agreed to take 18s., which I gave him; this was between nine and ten o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. No. I do not know whether this is a usual time for selling watches, but I keep my Sabbath on a Saturday - I gave the watch to my son-in-law.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to give it to the officer? A. I was minding another shop for my father-in-law, and I shewed it to a fellow-shopman; we had some dispute about the value of it, and I said "Go to the pawnbroker's next door, and ask what they would lend upon it;" they said 1l.; the pawnbroker then gave information of it, and the officer came and took it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I took charge of the prisoner on the Sunday night; I was going by at half-past ten o'clock, and Mr. Payne told me, if I saw the prisoner to take him; while I was there, he came home, and I took him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. PAYNE. Q. Was there not a young woman in your house? A. There was a young woman out of place, who slept with my daughter; but from the time she came in, till she went to bed, I kept sight of her; the seals of my watch were in my hat in the room where the prisoner slept; they were covered with this handkerchief; if he chose he might have taken them, but they were only brass.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Martin - A. Yes; he has been employed as a <rs id="t18081130-46-deflabel269" type="occupation">labourer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18081130-46-defend486 t18081130-46-deflabel269"></join> by me for some years; he lived about a mile from me. On the morning of the 27th, from information of my servant, I discovered that the bars of the window of the larder had been broken, and that the wirework of the window inside was forced open; the bars were the external security.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300041"></xptr>Q. Describe the situation of the larder with reference to the house - A. The larder is not under the roof of the house, the situation of the larder is beyond the wood house; the wood house is between the larder and the passage, they all adjoin; you go through a covered passage, by the side of the wood house, to the larder, and the larder adjoins the wood house; the roofs are connected.</p>
               <p>Q. But the roofs of the wood house and the larder are not connected - A. No; but the wall of the house is the support of one side of the roof of the passage, and on the farther end of the passage is the wood house; on the opposite side there is a small yard; on one side is the house, on the other is the wood house, and on the opposite side is the larder.</p>
               <p>COURT. Going out of the house you go into the passage - A. No, we go into a small yard, and directly opposite the door that goes to the servants hall is the larder: in the yard, on turning to the left, you go into a passage, and on the right hand of that passage is the wood house, and on the left hand is the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How does the larder stand with respect to the wood house - A. The corner of the larder is joined to the corner of the wood house, and the wood house adjoins the dwelling house, and they all make a fence to the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. It is all completely your house - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know any thing of the meat that was deposited in your larder - A. I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I know him by sight; he worked for my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the larder secure on the night of the 26th of November - A. Yes, I had fastened it up myself at nine o'clock that night, I locked the larder door and hung the key up in the kitchen; I went to the larder the next morning by seven o'clock; I found the key where I had left it the over night.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the larder on that morning - A. The window had been broken open and a considerable quantity of meat had been taken away. There was a flitch of bacon and two hams, and one pig's face, which I had cut in two, and another half of a face, which was cut in a different way, a round of beef, an aitchbone of beef, a clod of beef, and some cheese and butter; they were all taken out of the larder.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that all these things that you have named were in the larder at the time you made it secure - A. I am confident of it; I informed the butler, and my master was informed of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any of this meat afterwards - A. I saw it on the Monday afterwards at Marlborough street office; I am sure it is my master's property.</p>

            . On the 27th of November, in the morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I went to Mr. Hamilton's house; there were traces of footsteps backwards and forwards at Mr. Hamilton's house; in consequence of tracing these footsteps I went to the prisoner's house; I saw his wife first; she called her husband; I told

             I had come to search his house on suspicion of some things stolen from his master. I went into the kitchen and the bedroom, I found no property there; on my coming out of the door of the bed room down stairs I saw a stair case; I said, this I suppose belongs to you, I must go up and see; she says, you need not go up there, we never put any thing there; I said it did not signify, I must go up there; the prisoner was close by.

            , to come up; the first thing I saw was a large quantity of potatoes; it was a store room, there were two hams and a side of bacon, it was pork meant for bacon, it was all put in pickle, a pig's head cut in two pieces, a round of beef, an aitchbone, and a clod; they were in two dirty bags, they stood close by one another, covered with nothing, nor yet tied. After I secured the prisoner I took the meat to a man at the next house, his name is Martin. When the prisoner was apprehended he owned he did it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the prisoner, or give him any reason to believe, it would be the better or the worse for him if he confessed - A. I did. I fetched him out of the road; he was going away; I gave him in charge. I said, now Martin, if there is any more concerned, tell us; he said, there is nobody but myself. I left the goods in Martin's house; the groom took them to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Mount-street, Whitechapel. I am in the wholesale clothes line—the prisoner was in my service from the 30th of July to the 26th of Aug.—she left on that day—on Monday, the 24th she said, "Mistress, there is a new sheet stolen from the drawers down in the kitchen," and on the Tuesday morning she said, "What did those sheets cost you?"—I told her what they cost—she said, "Don't make any <hi rend="italic">bother</hi>, I would rather pay you the money"—I said, "No, don't do that, if you pay me for it, I must consider you have stolen it, and give you in charge"—she asked me if I would advance her some of her wages—I advanced her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—early next morning a knock came, I got up, and went down stairs—the prisoner said, "Mistress, did you hear that knock at the door?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "It was a message for me, I have a cousin dying; they wish me to come and see the last of her"—I said it was impossible she could <hi rend="italic">go</hi> as she had a very heavy wash—at a quarter to eight I allowed her to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> for twenty minutes—she never came back—at ten I went up stairs to the first floor bedroom, and found the lady who lived there had got strange blankets on her bed that I had not seen before—they did not belong to me—I made a search, and missed the articles stated in the indictment—I have found the curtains, and one blanket, and a blouse, at the pawnbroker's—I cannot say whether the window-curtains were safe when she left—they were on the Saturday before—I did not see her again till she was apprehended—the purse was found in her possession, and that made me know the jewellery was gone—the ear<lb></lb>rings were in it—the trowsers and coats were for sale in the warehouse—she had access to the warehouse at times, as the door was open—(<hi rend="italic">articles produced</hi>)—this is a new blouse—it has my private mark on it—it belongs to my son—I had sold it him—these curtains are mine—they were taken from a cup-board in the bed-room—this is one of the blankets—the value of the whole is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., without the blouse—I could not trace the jewellery.</p>

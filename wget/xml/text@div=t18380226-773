I took the last witness into cus<lb></lb>tody on the 5th of February, and took the prisoner the same afternoon—I told him I took him for taking a hat from the prosecutor—he said he knew nothing about it—I brought him to the station-house—the witness was there at the time—I asked her in his presence if he was the person who gave her the hat, and she said he was—he denied it then, but shortly af<lb></lb>terwards he said he gave her the hat near the chapel, in Old Brentford, and that he bought it of a man in the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I work at Solomon Cohen's, a pencil-maker, in Prescott-street. He had a truck, which was left, on the 19th of July, on an open space of ground next to his warehouse—I saw it there myself about half-past eight o'clock, and about twenty minutes to nine I met the prisoner with it, about a hundred are forty or a hundred and fifty yards from the premises, drawing it—I asked him where he was going with it—he said he was waiting for a gentleman who had hired him to take it, and was to wait at the corner of Prescott-street for him—I went and called Mr. Cohen, who gave him in charge—he had then gone round to the Ten<lb></lb>ter-ground to take it back.</p>

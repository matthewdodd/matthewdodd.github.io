                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, C</hi> 82). On the morning of 17th June, I was on duty in Greek-street, Soho—I heard a disturbance and a cry of "Police!"—I went towards the spot, and saw five men and two women—one man named James met me and butted me in the belly—I took him into cus<lb></lb>tody—while struggling with him Puikiss was attempting to pull him away—one of them said, "Serve the b----y b----r out," and I directly received a violent blow on my head from the prisoner; he escaped—I received two blows on my head—I lost a great deal of blood; I was completely saturated—the blow stunned me—I was got away, and prevented from going on duty for three weeks—I saw the prisoner in custody last Friday week, and pointed him out from seven others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a picture-restorer, of Frith-street. I saw a struggle and went up—Johnson went over, and while he was struggling with James, a tall man, not the prisoner, struck him twice on the head—he bled very much—I helped him away, and assisted in taking him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gas-fitter. I saw the scuffle and saw Johnson struck over the head by the prisoner with a life-preserver, or, I think a short thick stick; it brought blood—I feel confident he is the man—I had never seen him before—I have not seen him since Saturday week—I then re<lb></lb>cognised him.</p>

Is gas-fitting the only mode by which you get year living? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I sometimes assist my brother to dig a grave—Ser<lb></lb>geant Grey took me to sec the prisoner—he was standing with a lot more in the back of the Court at Marlborough-street—I was asked if I could recog<lb></lb>nise any one; I recognised the prisoner; he had a gold chain—Grey did not say to me, "Look at that gold chain"—I did not hear him say so—the prisoner did not say, "Mr. Grey, what are you at?"—I have never been a witness before—I was called against the prisoner at the police-court, but was not examined—I had not known him before—he had a hat on—I consider he is a triffle higher than me—he had whiskers rather inclined to be carrotty—there was a gas-lamp immediately over.</p>

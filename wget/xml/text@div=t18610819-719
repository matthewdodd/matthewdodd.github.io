I am district superintendent of the traffic on the London and South Western line—I have been in the service about ten years, and in that capacity for the last three years—I know the prisoner and the business he was in the habit of doing—he was appointed on 27th August—I have the minutes here—the first minute with reference to him is a minute of the Finance and Estates' committee, appointing him a clerk in the passenger audit office—that is signed by the chairman of the committee, and was afterwards confirmed by a minute of the board signed by the chairman—here is also a minute of the Finance committee of 19th June, 1856, appointing him cashier, and a minute of 26th June, 1856, of the board, confirming that appointment; it is signed by the chairman, Mr. Chaplin—the minute is "Cashier in Goods Delivery Department; read minutes, Mr. Stanford to be appointed a cashier in the Goods Collection and Delivery Department, at a salary of 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, and to give security with the Guarantee society for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—He continued to act in that capacity down to the time of his suspension on 23d April last—it was his duty to receive money from the carmen—at the time they gave him the money they would return him the vouchers which they took out, signed by the party who received the goods—if the money was not received, the carmen's voucher would be returned, and the bill of charges; in the event of payment it would be left as a receipt—if a bill was returned without the money it would be the duty of the prisoner to hand the bill to the collector, to call for the money the next day—he would mark the letters "0.

               <p>a balance of 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against the prisoner—that was a balance which he ought to have paid, and which he could not account for, which he was unable to tell me anything about—I received his I. 0. U. for that sum—I paid a sum of 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of some of my brother's mistakes—he was not prosecuted; there was no occasion—the same thing did not happen with reference to another clerk as to a sum of 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was another clerk deficient 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I, out of kindness, gave him time, believing it was a mistake on his part—that was in the present year—I am not aware that there have been frequent complaints from the several departments that there was not a sufficient number of clerks—there has been from the prisoner's department, and one other, the Down office—that is all that I am aware of—we have given them an additional number in the Down office, but not in the particular depart<lb></lb>ment from which the complaint was made—my brother's transaction was eight or ten years ago—it is since then, and since the other clerk's deficiency, that the additional clerks have been appointed—I do not know that the prisoner, since the irregularities in his accounts were discovered, has given a bill of sale in order to raise money on his house and furniture to pay the company—I have not heard him say so—he was suspended on 23d April, and was given into custody on 21st May—he had to go out to collect as occasion required, within the last two or three years—I allowed him for that the usual rate allowed to the collectors; Is. a day additional—he did not go out every day; sometimes two days a week, and sometimes four—he would be out the principal part of the day—he could not travel far; he would leave the station about 12 or 1, and be back again at six—I suppose he would be collecting accounts at different places during that time—after his return at 6 he would have to go in behind the pigeon-hole—it has not happened to my knowledge that in his absence money has been paid in and received by some-body else at the pigeon-hole—I have not heard it—he would remain at the office until about ten minutes to 10—he was there from half-past 9 in the morning till ten minutes to 10—before he went out to collect he would be making up his previous night's cash; that would be the different amounts he had received when out collecting, and the amounts paid in by the carmen—those amounts he would not hand over to me; he would send them direct to the cashier at Waterloo, Mr. ls Souef—I know nothing about his paying in to the bank—he was supposed to pay it at Waterloo—I used to band him over money to pay at Waterloo—I am not aware that I have handed him over money to pay into the bank—I should say, on an average, from 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week would pass through his hands; made up of the sums received from the carmen and from myself—he would have to make entries in three or four books—it was with my knowledge that Grimsdick was going over the accounts with him—he gave Grimsdick every assistance—it was not in consequence of their search of the books that these defalcations were discovered—this list was handed to me subsequently.</p>

I accepted from the prisoner, that was not known to the company; that was also on my own responsibility—there was at no time any difference between us in reference to a cheque</p>

               <p>for 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, as to the delivery account or the station account: I deducted a sum of 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the delivery account, because the prisoner had the cheque and realized the amount—that was deducted by me in the prisoner's presence, and with his sanction—it was deducted from the delivery account—I cannot say that it ought to have been deducted from the station account—had he left the cheque with me I should have deducted it from the station account—it was a cheque that had been paid in by the firm of Cooper and Hornby, and it was refused to be received at Waterloo by our then cashie—the prisoner retained that cheque, and the amount was reduced by the cashier at Waterloo—the prisoner took the cheque and realized the amount; I mean he cashed the cheque, and he paid the amouut in on the following week—that is the only occasion that I recollect of a matter of that kind with a cheque of that description.</p>

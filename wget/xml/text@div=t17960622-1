               <p>Q. Describe the fastening of that flap under which the prisoner was found? - A. There is a flap upon a frame, and the door shuts down upon it, and then it is fastened inside with a key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search any other part of the house afterwards, to see if there was any other person there? - A. Yes; every part that we could think of; I did not go to the watch-house with him.</p>

            . I am nephew and hostler to Mr. Purdey - he lives over the stables. On the 23d of December, about a quarter-past five o'clock in the evening I left the premises; the up-stairs premises were then locked safe and bolted, and I am sure the coach-house door was shoved to. I returned about half-past six o'clock, and found a number of people in the stable - the lock of the stair-foot door had then been forced open by some instrument, and when I got up-stairs the room where the bureau was was forced open, and the bureau also was open; the lid was forced open, and the drawers all laying about - the lock of the front sitting-room had been attempted, but they had not succeeded. When I went out that evening I had seen the three prisoners standing opposite the Yorkshire Grey public-house, in the King's-road; I had known Cranley six months; he once lived with my uncle - I am sure of him; I knew the others by their dress, which they had on at Hatton-garden; I had not seen them before; I found them the same evening, at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110014"></xptr>half-past six o'clock, at Hatton-garden, and am sure they are the same; they looked me in the face as they went by- I passed close to them, and noticed them. I found my uncle's gold seal, ring, and key in the further coach-house that evening, when I returned from the office, and on the Sunday morning I found a bundle of phosphorus matches, among the straw in the coach-house - they appeared not to have been used.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know the faces of the other two men? A. Yes; I was right opposite the light from the public-house, and I saw them - it was then dusk, and getting dark; Cranley kept his face from me.</p>

            . I was up in my rooms over the stable at No. 11, John's-mews - I ran out, hearing an alarm, and found Lewis struggling with the coachman; Cranley bolted out at the coach-house door - I followed, and he was secured at the bottom of the yard; I knew him before.</p>

            . I searched Webster at the office, and found on him a purse with 20s. in silver, and 18s. 2 1/2d. loose; also a knife, a silver tooth-pick, and a silver segartube - Goatley delivered to me two gold-seals and a key; also some phosphorus matches, which have not been used, and were not made for the box.</p>

            . This watch and case, two seals, ring, key, and 18d. piece, are mine; they are worth 5l. - I lost 7l. in silver, and 4 sovereigns - I will not swear to the 18d. piece.</p>

               <p>CRANLEY's Defence. I pass there every night about that time. I have often been out with a coach - I owed Purdey's nephew some money, and went to pay him.</p>
               <p>WEBSTER's Defence. I was passing the end of John's-mews, and hearing the cry of Watch! I went down to ascertain what was the matter; the coach-house door was pulled open, a livery-servant said he would go in with any one; the watchman went in, and I went with him - a person crossed the mews with a candle, which I took out of his hand over the bar at the door - I went to the foot of the stairs with the watchman; somebody said,"I dare say that is one;" and they collared me; the gentleman's servant said, "Be careful what you are about, I think I saw that young man come in."</p>

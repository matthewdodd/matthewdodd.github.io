I requested him to return me a seal which was on my watch, which he did. I told him I was going a long journey, and desired he would give me two or three shillings to bear my expences.

            . On Tuesday the 10th of December, about eleven in the morning, I being overseer in our parish of Epping, the prisoner's horse was shoeing at a blacksmith's shop; he was suspected to be a highwayman. A person came and told me; I went and viewed him. He was in very mean apparel, and had a watch, which was thought to be gold. I got the constable and apprehended him; and in searching him, I found a pistol in his pocket, (produced in court) it was not loaded. This watch I found also (produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.) I found in his pocket these pair of silver shoe-buckles, (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost exactly such a pair the evening before; I believe them to be mine; but as there may be others of the same pattern, I will not swear to them.</p>
               <p>B. Hobson. The prisoner's horse was a black gelding, about fifteen hands high, with two white feet behind. There was about seventeen shillings in silver, and some halfpence found upon him. I asked him if he had ever a friend that could come to his character? he said he had lived to bury all his relations, and had not a friend in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed.</p>
               <p>B. Hobson. He had a brown great-under that a flannel waistcoat, which he had bought of a salesman in Epping for three shillings that morning.</p>

I then charged him to assist me. I went and secured the prisoner. We led him to the sign of the cock, and in searching him found this pistol, watch, and buckles, a paper of powder, seventeen shillings and six-pence in silver, and six-pence in halfpence, and a ticket with which he had come through the turnpike at Epping. He had nothing to say for himself.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness. I got up about twelve o'clock on Monday night to come to London (I had gone to bed about seven.) I was getting something to eat before I went out, I was in the kitchen and heard a noise in the pantry, I went in and found the prisoner there; I had not been in the pantry before - it is part of the dwelling-house. I secured him but found nothing on him - he had got in through the iron bars of the pantry window. A pane of glass was taken out of the window near the handle, he could then reach and open the window, the bars were wide enough a-part to let a person of his size through. When the constable took him, I went outside and found the fat and suet under his great coat; I suppose he must have reached them out before he got in - I found a hat and coat under the pantry window, and under them a tin pan with the dripping and 2 lbs. of suet - he had no hat on when I found him - he claimed the hat and coat, there was an iron wrench on the suet. My mother was the last that went to bed that night - she is not here. I had been in the pantry a little before seven o'clock in the evening to get my supper, the window was then shut, the pane of glass safe, the pan of dripping and suet stood within reach of the window.</p>

He had drank a little in the evening, some beer and some half-and-half; I did not see him drink any spirits or wine - he did not fall asleep in my bar; he came there on the evening of the 23rd - he was not very drunk; he frequented the house before I came there, which is fifteen months ago; I believe he is respectably connected; I lock my till when I go out, and take the key - I know there were half-crowns,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150100"></xptr>shillings and sixpences in the till, but no crown pieces; I cannot say how many persons came in while he was there.</p>

            . I was in the house at a quarter after eleven o'clock; Mrs. Oldham had been saying she had lost some money and a tea-spoon - I said, "Who have you had in your bar?" she said, "No one but Mr. Brooks;" soon after Mr. Brooks came into the tap-room, and laid down - Mr. Oldham's brother-in-law was there: Mr. Oldham then came in, and said he had lost the money and the spoon; he saw the prisoner there, he rubbed his hand down him, and found these bottles and this spoon on him - I had a very severe struggle with him; he made very great resistance; there were three half-crowns, two shillings, one sixpence, 3s. in copper, and four farthings on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been there the night before? A. I do not recollect; I had reason to recollect that evening, as I got a brace of very handsome black eyes; I gave him as good as he sent, and a little better: I cannot say whether he was drunk the night before.</p>

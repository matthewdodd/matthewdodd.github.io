                  </hi>. I am an iron dealer at 57, Picton Street, Camber—well—I know the prisoner; he has an iron foundry in the Walworth Road; I had had dealings with his brother Joseph who is dead; he came to me after his brother's death in March last year, looked at a stack of iron, and asked what I wanted a ton for it—I said "Two guineas a ton"—he said "Well, if you like to let me have these goods, I don't want a month's credit like my brother, I have some very heavy orders in, and we can use 20 ton of iron a week, and if you like to sell me these goods there is your money in a fortnight"—I said "You can have the goods for a fortnight's credit"—I sent him the goods by my carman from the beginning of the week—I have invoices here for every load; I cannot read or write; I put</p>

               <p>ray mark—these invoices wore made out by my niece—I left all the writing to her; my carman can neither read or write either—I sent the prisoner the whole stack, close upon 30 tons—I told my carman to take it to Mr. Stone—a fortnight afterwards I went down for my money; I saw the prisoner; I said "Good morning, Mr. Stone"—he said "I am sorry to say I got disappointed, and I shall have to go out and borrow the money to pay the men"—I said "Can't you borrow a few pounds for me at the same time?"—he said "You will be sure to have your money next Saturday"—next week they sent for more goods, and I believe they had three loads—I went there on the following Saturday, and suw Mr. Stone—he said "I don't know what to say to you, Cuttell; I expect a cheque in, and as soon as I get it you shall have your money"—I said "I hope you won't disappoint me"—no cheques came, and I sent my good lady down on the Monday, and day after day—I did not see Stone till after I got this notice of a meeting of creditors (<hi rend="italic">Dated May</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>)—my niece read it to me—I went to the meeting with Mr. King, a lawyer in Walbrook, but I did not stop—he signed the notice, but I cannot read his signature—not getting any money I put it into Messrs. Locksly and Morley's hands, but I changed again, and my present solicitor is Mr. Shepherd, who instituted the criminal proceedings—I send out a weight note by my carman, and he brings it back—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know my own billheads.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot sign my name—the signature to this first invoice is not mine—I do not know who wrote it—my men generally sign my receipts—the firm I dealt with was Stone—I cannot say whether it was Joseph Stone or J. Stone and Son—I do not keep books and cannot keep my accounts in my head—I cannot say whether I dealt with Stone and Son in 1874, 1875, or 1876—I have served them with a lot of goods, but I cannot give the dates—I have not dealt with them for 10 years; I cannot say as to four years, but I have for three years—I know that Joseph Stone. died in January, and 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due from him to me on a bill—that has been paid—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to me by the men before George Stone came and bought these goods of me; he made the false pretence on 31st March, after which one payment was made of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was part of Mr. Stone's debt—this is the receipt, it is dated 12th April—I sent in my account simply to Mr. Stone—I knew that old Mr. Stone was dead when I was at the police-court, but I cannot say the date when he died—I knew that he was nearly bedridden before he died, and did not come to his office at all, but I saw him there at the time my goods were going in—I cannot say whether I saw him there in November—to the best of my judgment I first knew that he was dead between two and three months before George Stone had this iron of me—I only went for the money; I sent my carman with the orders mostly, and I have gone with him—I generally saw Miss Stone, the niece, when I went there—she used to attend to the books and sign the receipts—the iron went on being delivered for three weeks, and the dates are on the notes—I delivered some and some their carman fetched—I had never sold any iron to George Stone before, he had only acted as a servant I thought before—he had been into my yard before and ordered iron; he always said it was for his brother, but this time he bought it for himself—I could not hear what my wife said at the police-court, she was taken so ill and I am slightly hard of hearing—she was. present when those false pretence? were made, and so was my niece—I have not talked the matter over with my</p>

               <p>wife since; I only told her to speak the truth—I may have forgotten one or two words at the police-court, bat I think I have said almost the same today—when I went with the carman the iron was always unlocked in Mr. Stone's yard and put on the stage—I do not know whether a Mr. Caroline supplied iron to the prisoner at this time, bat he did afterwards, and he told me he got ready money for his goods—Mr. Cross and Mr. Jewell also supplied some—when the iron had been sent in a fortnight, I saw him and his niece—I did not know that the estate was being carried on by trustees, or I would never have let the iron go—I found out that old Mr. Stone had left a son who I knew as a boy about the yard, but I did not know who he was—it is impossible for me to say whether every one of my bills was not sent out to J. Stone; they were supposed to go to George Stone, but my niece sent them out by my authority—I gave bit no special instructions, she reckoned them up—I don't think they were made oat to either J. or G. Stone—I did not instruct Mr. King to write to Stone—I do not know whether he did so—I did not instruct him to act for me—I went to him to see what he thought of it—I was afterwards advised to have nothing to do with him, and went to Lockley and Manser, who wrote to the defendants by my authority—I afterwards changed and went to Mr. Shepherd—I cannot say whether I waited six months before I took criminal proceedings, or till I found that the estate would not pay any dividend—I am ignorant of the affair altogether—I do not know who signed my weight notes—I never asked Miss Stone for more orders, they always came to me, and I sent as much iron as I possibly could for three weeks—iron was sent in after the fortnight's credit had expired.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I thought I was dealing with George Stone, I did not think he was the executor—I don't know what an executor is—it was on the faith of the representation that he was doing business on his own account that I parted with my goods—I thought he had his brother's business—no one is helping me in this case—I know Whiteley, he owes me money; he recommended me to Shephard.</p>

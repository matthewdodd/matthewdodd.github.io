                  </hi>. I was in the bankrupts' service as carman—on 13th August I received directions from Poole, but not in Chapman's presence—I know Stone, he is an agent for Poole, he takes work out and brings work in—I fetched a large hamper of goods from Stone's, on 13th August, by Mr. Poole's directions—Woodford was present, but nobody else—I took it to Chapman's house at Kingsthorpe—Chapman lived at Kingsthorpe then—Woodford was not with me—Chapman had it put in the coach-house, he desired me to assist him in putting it there—I have not seen that hamper since—on 15th August I received the keys of the shoe factory, at Northampton, from Poole, and Chapman then gave me orders to go to the factory and pack a lot of trunks, as many as I thought would fill the van—I am not usually the packer—I packed from six to seven trunks with boots and shoes of different kinds, and Chapman directed Woodford and me to take them to his house; when we got them there we put them into the coach-house, in the same place as we had put the hamper—on the 16th we received directions from Poole, in the presence of Chapman and Ventris, to go into the shoe-room and assist him in packing a lot more trunks—we packed, as near as I can say, about twenty—Poole then ordered us, in Chapman's presence, to load them in the spring-cart and in the van—I drove the van, Woodford drove the cart, and we took them to Chapman's house, at Kingsthorpe, and put them in the coach-house where we had put the others—it was about 10 o'clock when we started from the factory on the 15th, and 12 o'clock on the 16th—on Sunday night, the 19th, we had orders from Poole to go to Chapman's house, we went there and Chapman took us into his kitchen and kept us there till 11 o'clock at night—he told us he had taken a barn of one of his neighbours, to put a horse in, and that he wanted us to shift the goods out of the coach-house into the barn—all the goods were in the boxes and the hamper—Woodford carried them to me at the wall, and I carried them from the wall into the barn—Chapman's little boy, fifteen or sixteen years old, I cannot say exactly, walked before me to guide me and direct me to the place—when we had done that, Chapman gave us orders to go to Poole's house, and we did so.</p>

I would do for the man with the smashed leg—I know he was able to hop about and buy goods for me to pack, if he had a smashed leg—before I went to Mr. Poole's, I was working at the General Steam Navigation, as a hammer-man, down at the Commercial Docks—I was there, I should say, seven years—I left them to go into Mr. Poole's employment in London, and then he took me down to Northampton—that was not at a strange change of employment; the reason I took the situation was, that Poole promised me the same wages as I received, and the air agreed with my constitution much better than working in a hot shop; but when he got me down to Northampton he dropped me down three shillings: that does not at all account for my feeling in this matter.</p>

I was in the employment of the bankrupts—on 15th August I received orders and packed six or seven trunks with boots and shoes of different descriptions—Beard assisted me—I received orders from Chapman to take them to his house at Kingsthorpe—I took them there, but a long way round, very nearly two miles out of the road I should say—I went that round-about way by Chapman's direction—I left the ware-house at Northampton, with the goods, between 9 and 10 in the evening, I think—I left them in Chapman's house at Kingsthorpe—on 16th August we packed, I should say, twenty trunks at the least, with boots and shoes of different descriptions, by the orders of Poole and Chapman—it took us most part of the day to pack them—Poole and Chapman both assisted, and Ven<lb></lb>tris assisted in packing goods into one trunk—Beard was there as well—after we had packed those twenty trucks I received orders, both from Poole and Chapman, to take them to Chapman's house at Kingsthorpe—we left the factory with them about midnight, in a van, with a light spring-cart, and left them in Chapman's coach-house—one of those trunks was directed to Ventris—Ventris had given me orders about that trunk the evening before, in consequence of which I went to Chapman's, with the horse and trap, on Friday morning, 17th August—I saw Chapman—he gave me the trunk that was directed, and I took it to Brampton-station with the horse and trap—Chapman went with me—I left it in the station-master's charge—on the evening of 19th August, about 6 o'clock, I went with Beard to Chapman's house at Kingsthorpe—we saw Chapman—we remained in the kitchen till very near midnight, I believe, when Chapman came in and said that he wanted us to remove the goods which we had taken in the week time, to a neighbour's barn, which he had hired to put a horse in—we removed all the goods from the coach-house, that we had taken on 15th and 16th, to the next door neighbour's barn—I did not, at that time, know who it belonged to.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Then with respect to the other matters which we have asked to be reserved, I submit that there was no evidence to go to the Jury of any ad done by Chapman within the jurisdiction of this Court, except that relating to the trunk sent to Ventris in London, and that any such act of his ceased and determined upon the arrival of the trunk in London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">No; I thought at first, and am inclined now to think still more decidedly, that there was evidence that Chapman caused the trunk to be taken into the jurisdiction of this Court, and there caused it to be concealed, for the purpose of concealment after the adjudication. I told the Jury that concealment before adjudication would not do, but that if they thought the parties before adjudication, and in contemplation of it, took steps and employed agents for the purpose of concealment afterwards, and that in furtherance of that intention the goods were afterwards so concealed, that would do; and there is a ruling of Mr. Justice Littledale's to that effect in Reg. v. Evanie in Moody and Ryan.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>). <hi rend="italic">With reference to the including of the three offences in one Count, I would refer to</hi> 269 <hi rend="italic">th section of the Bankrupt Ad, which provides a penalty for the offence of removing or concealing on the part of persons not themselves bankrupts.' Under this section, unless a man is a bank<lb></lb>rupt, he cannot be indicted as a principal. Chapman, therefore, was new capable of committing the original offence, because he never was a bankrupt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">It may be that you may be right as to that, still I do not think it so clear that I ought to arrest the judgment upon it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">As to Ventris, I think I am right in saying he could not be convicted unless the evidence against Poole as principal was conclusive, and the only evidence as to Poole was, that he was present when the things wert seat away from his warehouse at Northampton before the adjudication, and your lordship seemed at one time to entertain a doubt whether that sufficiently brought him within this jurisdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I have considered' the matter and am strongly of opinion that there was evidence for the Jury, that Poole being at North<lb></lb>ampton was in expectation of imminent bankruptcy, and that there would speedily be an adjudication; that that being so, he removed a large quantity of his goods to Chapman's, and that Chapman afterwards and after adjudication was actively concerned in endeavouring to conceal those goods; that Chap<lb></lb>man in Poole's presence directed his servant to take one of the trunks to the railway station to be sent to London, that it was sent to London and there concealed until after the adjudication, and upon that I think there was evident for the Jury that Poole sent that trunk to London with the intention that it should be concealed from his assignees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Does your lordship think that if Poole, out of the jurisdiction, directed an act to be done within it, it would make him responsible not only for what he did out of the jurisdiction, but for what was done within it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I think so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">If that had been before the act relating to accessaries, and if Ventris had committed an offence as a principal within the jurisdiction, I should not have urged the point, because Poole would then have been guilty as an accessary before the fact; but here Ventris is being indicated as an accessary and Poole as a principal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">"Accessory "is perhaps an inaccurate expression. Ventrij is actually the hand that does the act in concert with the man as to whom it is a statutable felony; he is what used to be called a principal in the second degree.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I submit that there is no such thing in this offence, which is a statutable offence; they have always been treated as accessaries. Ventris, when he concealed those goods after the bankruptcy, was accessary to the offence committed by the bankrupt; the bankrupt was committing an offence possibly out of this jurisdiction and Ventris within it as an accessary, and the principal cannot follow the accessary. I also rely upon the objection already urged that there is no averment in the indictment that Ventris knew an act of bankruptcy had been committed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi> (<hi rend="italic">for Poole</hi>). <hi rend="italic">There is no evidence to show any concealment by Poole after bankruptcy, the evidence would rather tend to show that he was an accessary before the fact to the concealment by Ventris as a principal; the offence, if any, committed by Poole, was that of a non-discovery, for until his last examination he had a locus penitentice, if he had then disclosed where the trunk in question was deposited, he would not have been guilty of concealing, and the mere omission to make such a disclosure could not render him amenable to the charge of concealing, which in its very nature implies some act done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Must not the statute have contemplated goods got out of the way with the intention of concealing and embezzling them afterwards?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I think not; the section provides for every conceivable offence, and if a man after bankruptcy is engaged in actively secreting goods, that is one offence, if he keeps silence about it, that is another offence, namely, that of non<lb></lb>discovery. I also contend that the indictment should have alleged a knowledge on Poole's part that he had been adjudged a bankrupt.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>). <hi rend="italic">I will hear you on the point of jurisdiction. I take it that the act done by Ventris within the jurisdiction would be quite sufficient as against Poole, if Poole was an accessary before the fact to the felony committed by "Ventris, but the point as it comes to my mind in the result is this: as the statutable offence exists in the bankrupt, and in the bankrupt only, and the others are only indictable as accessaries, can the bankrupt or Chapman be accessaries before the fact to a felony committed by the hand of a person out of the jurisdiction. I do not know that there is any<lb></lb>thing in the point, but I will hear you upon it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">The question is, whether the parties engaged originally in the transaction are not in reality principals in the act of conceal<lb></lb>ment, and it was with regard to that view that I tendered evidence of the entries in the books, which would show an active concealment after the bank<lb></lb>ruptcy, and that act is brought within this jurisdiction by the delivery of the books by Ventris to Ball in London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">you urged that before, and I think the answer I then, gave decisive; viz. that the goods had been already seized and the dealing with the books would have reference rather to an endeavour to get back the goods then in the possession of the messenger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Then I must meet so technical a point in a technical manner, supposing the effect of the alteration of the books to be intended mainly for the purpose of so getting back the goods, yet if it also had the effect of creating or continuing a concealment of the goods that had been removed, that would bring the matter within the purview of this indictment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I am not clear about that, but if such a subtle answer as that is necessary, it certainly would be a point to reserve. The point I wish to draw your attention to is this, can Poole and Chapman down at Northampton be treated as accessaries before the fact to the concealment in Middlesex, when in fact Ventris who did the act is only brought in as a sort of principal in the second degree to Poole; if for any reason Poole is not guilty, must not the other two be not guilty also?</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I think that must be conceded, but my propor<lb></lb>tion is that at the very moment of the adjudication, supposing the Jury to find as they have done, that the criminal intention continued, all the parties, wherever they were, were guilty, jointly, of concealing the property in any county juris<lb></lb>diction where that property was existing.</hi>

On Friday night, 9th August, the prisoner was given into my charge by Darby; he had a bundle of brass fittings in a handkerchief—I said, "I think you have something which does not belong to you?"—he said, "No, I have not, and threw it down"—I had a severe tussle with him, held him, and sent for assistance—he begged and prayed of me to destroy part of the brass, as it would not go so hard with him—he said, "It is the first time, and I will never do it again"—I detained him till I got a constable and then took him in custoy.</p>

I am foreman in the erecting shop at the Stratford I works of the Eastern Counties Railway—the prisoner was their servant—I the brass fittings are their property, and are perfectly new; they have I never been used—they are cast for the purpose—I ordered this fitter's lamp to be made; it has on it "E.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I picked up the things in a watering-place; I had I had five or six glasses of old ale and a couple of glasses of stout; they were in a basket with a skewer stuck through the top.

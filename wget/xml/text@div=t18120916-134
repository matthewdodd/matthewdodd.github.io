                  Richard

             - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gegg and the prisoner come to your house on the morning of the 17th of September - A. They did. About seven o'clock in the morning, one of my men servants let them in, and I gave them the key of the warehouse, and I went into King-street. I returned in about ten minutes there, with a customer, and on my going into the warehouse, I observed Rogers skewering a wrapper which I supposed contained straw.</p>
               <p>Q. Is straw one of the perquisites that you allow to your porters - A. It is; I let him finish what he was about; after he had skewered it up, he threw it on a pack of calico. I thought then it was straw only. He went down stairs about his work; and when he was gone, suspicion came across my mind. I looked into it. I took it from where he put it, and trod upon it; and heard the sound of paper. I opened it, and found a piece of worsted cord wrapped up in paper in the centre of the straw.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the length of it - A. Twenty-eight yards three quarters, the value of it is 6 l. The prisoner was not there when I opened it. I put the goods where it was before, upon the pack of calico. I called him, and told him to call Gegg, the other porter. They both came up. I then asked the prisoner what there was in that straw. I then called the other porter, Gegg, to look at the straw in the prisoner's presence, from whence he pulled the piece of worsted cord. The prisoner seeing it, he then asked for mercy. He said, it was the first piece that ever he had stolen. I told him it was the first piece that ever we had found, and asked him, how many more he had taken. He said, it was the first, and asked for mercy. I told him he must be punished, and placed the other porter between him and the door, to prevent him from going out until I had served a customer; and then I sent Gegg for an officer, to whom I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose dwelling-house is it - A. It is my dwelling-house; the other partners do not reside in the house.</p>

Between twelve and one o'clock, on the 5th of March, the prisoner came to our shop, and asked me for a quarter of a pound of cheese—I served him and took his money—I went round the counter to serve a customer with some bacon, and heard the money rattle—I looked round, and saw the prisoner's hand in the till—I asked what he was about—he said, "Nothing; only getting a bit of paper for the cheese"—I asked him to let me look in his hand—I took hold of it, and took 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from it—I told my master, and he sent for a policeman—while the young man was gone for one the prisoner ran off—I ran after him down several yards and streets—at last he went into a tim<lb></lb>ber-yard, where there is a water-tank—I saw him behind a door, hiding something in the tank—he was standing there three or four moments—I was afraid of going too close, for fear of being struck—the policeman came up, and I told him he had been hiding something behind the door—the policeman told me to go and look—I did, and found 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a hand<lb></lb>kerchief, at the bottom of the tank—I took it out and gave it to the police<lb></lb>man—there was a half-crown and several shillings among it—the inspector asked him at the station-house what made him put it there—he said, if he was taken, and the money was found on him, they would say he had taken it out of the till.</p>

I said, no particular hurry; he asked me if I would go to the top of the Old Jewry, and call a coach; he said he had two ladies waiting, and he could not leave them; I went to the top of the Old Jewry, and beckoned a coach, and brought the coach to the door, and I went in, and saw the gentleman of the house, and I asked him where the young man was that wanted a coach, that stood at the door, and the gentleman said there was no coach ordered there, nor he never saw a young man; the prisoner and the box was gone.</p>

               <p>How did the prisoner get the box? - He told me he would take it into the warehouse while I was gone to get a coach; he said I need not be gone a minute, he said he would give me a shilling when I came back; Sir

            .</p>
               <p>Have you washed for her at all since the 28th of April? - Yes, a little; but this was a great wash, she never has had so great a wash since or before; the old gentleman is not here, he is very infirm and lame.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>(Mrs. Hill ordered to stand up again, and the two other witnesses, Hearn and Smith, sent out to the door.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Hill. You remember distinctly how the prisoner was dressed that day? - Perfectly well; exactly the same clothes he has on now.</p>
               <p>How was your father dressed? - I believe my father had a half mourning coat, a red waistcoat, and half mourning breeches.</p>

             called in again.)</p>
               <p>How came you to recollect so particularly how the prisoner was dressed that day? - Because it is a dress he so usually wears; I never saw him but in three coats since I was there; I never saw him in any other dress all that week.</p>
               <p>How was your mistress's father dressed? - I believe it was a dark brown, or old black coat, and cloth waistcoat and breeches; I do not recollect the colour.</p>
               <p>How was your mistress dressed? - She had a striped wrapper on; she had not put on her gown; she had a cap on, no hat nor bonnet, her hair undressed, she was quite in a dishabille that morning.</p>
               <p>What coloured stripe was the wrapper? - It was a kind of a buff.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the father had a black coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The witness Hearn called in.)</p>
               <p>How came you to be so particular in the prisoner's dress? - I took notice of his handkerchief about his neck when I brushed his coat.</p>
               <p>Do you pretend to know exactly from this distance of time how he was dressed? - I am very particular in that point; he only wore them clothes.</p>
               <p>Do you know if any body else was there, except the prisoner; how was the old man dressed? - In a greenish coat, a red waistcoat, and red breeches; but I am not so very particular, because he was only at dinner.</p>
               <p>How was your mistress dressed? - In a striped loose gown, of a buff colour, and reddish stripes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310103"></xptr>Had she a hat on? - She was not out, her hair was not dressed; she had a cap on, but she had no hat.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you directed, before you came here, to say what you have said? - No, I was not, upon my oath.</p>

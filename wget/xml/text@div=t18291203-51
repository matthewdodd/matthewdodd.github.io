             and his father - they had some iron in their stable on Monday week; we had not missed it till the prisoner was taken - I had seen it five or six days before; there were chalk marks on it, and so there are now - I believe this iron was part of that which was in the stable; some persons have been tried and transported for stealing the same iron before - I had been about the stable on the 24th of November, and went to dinner about ten minutes past one o'clock, leaving the prisoner on the premises; a cart afterwards happened to break down, and I went to assist in getting it up - during that time the officer took him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the witness, Croast,. had directed him to take the iron as waste, and procure a few shillings on it to spend in drink, it being the carman's birth-day.</p>

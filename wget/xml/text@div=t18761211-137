                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant, of Colchester—I saw the prisoner in custody at the station-house, on 11th November—I told her she was charged with passing a forged, cheque at Mr. Blyth's, a draper, of High Street, Colchester—she said "I did not know but that it was a good one; my master, Mr. Mussett, of Butt Road, Colne, gave it me the week before last as part of my wages; he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. besides; he is gone away to North America"—she gave me the name of Smith, and afterwards of Elizabeth Stebbing—the nest day she sent for me to go to her cell; I went with the gaoler—she said "I have a statement I wish to make to you; I have been thinking over it, and shall be glad to get it off my mind"—I cautioned her, and said "You need not say anything, but what you say I shall take down in writing, and it may be given in evidence, against you;' she then made this statement; she also said when charged that she had lived with Mr. Mussett three or four years; (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> Elizabeth Stebbings states:—"The week before last, I believe it was Wednesday or Thursday week, a young man come to see me at. my mother's house, and asked me to go out for a walk with him. I told him I could not go then. He then went out, and I went out about an hour after, and went up the Colne Road and met Mr. Frederick Mussett, of Earl's Colne, near the George Inn. He said to me 'Good evening, Jane, can I see you home?' I said 'Oh, no, I do not want anyone to see me home.' I afterwards went into the George public-house with him, and we had a glass of ale. We then left, and he said he would see me safe home. We then went on the road about a mile. He then wanted to have connection with me, I said 'No, I should not think of such a thing.' He said ho would before he went much further. He afterwards had connection with me. It was about 5.30 in the evening. He then offered me a sovereign. I refused to take it. He then said I have not got any more change only 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I have got a bank note, which he took out of his purse and gave it to me, and I took it, also the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I said to him 'What am I to do with it.' He said 'You can change it at any shop; you know where I live, at the red brick house, up the Butt Road, and if anyone asks you how you came by it, tell them you have lived with me three or four years, and that is some of your wages. I then went about half a mile further with him, and then left him. It was near Chappell Railway Station. I did not know but what it was a good note. I kept it till I came to Colchester, and changed it yesterday at a shop in the High Street, and bought a pair of slippers, some wool, and some cotton. Elizabeth Stebbings, November 12th, 1876." Elizabeth Stebbings further states:—"On Monday, the 30th Octo<lb></lb>ber, 1876, about 12 o'clock, I went into Mrs. Cloughton's, who kept a public-house, at Wake's Colne, and in the tap-room I saw Frederick Mussett. I went and sat down by the side of him, and we had some porter. He took out his pocket-book and asked me if I could write, I told him yes. He had a pen and ink in his pocket which he gave me, and asked me to write his name. I did so. He then gave me two cheques, and asked me to write on them, which I did, but I cannot remember what it was I wrote on one of them, only the one I changed in Colchester. He gave me one of them, and that I changed at Sudbury the same day. I saw Mr. Mussett in Sudbury about 4 o'clock. My young man went with me to Sunbury, but he stayed in a public-house, since the time I went and changed it. After I changed it, I saw Mr. Mussett near Mr. Hills, and he asked me if I had changed that cheque, I said 'Yes.' He asked me to let him have two sovereigns, which</p>

               <p>I gave him. I did not see any more of him that day. It was on the Wednesday or Thursday afterwards I saw him again, and what took place then I told you before, and that is when he gave me the other cheque Elizabeth Stebbings, November 20th, 1876."</p>

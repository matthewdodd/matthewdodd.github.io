On Saturday, 15th February, about half-past 1, I was sent by my sergeant to Gray's-inn-road, and found the door of the china shop, next door to Mr. Samuels', open—I looked round the shop, and seeing that there was nothing for anybody to take, I hastened to Mr. Samuels' door, and heard something more in the shop, as though jewellery was being moved—another constable, E 54, came up—I told him what I had heard, and we both listened—I sung out, "Who is there; is that you Mr. Samuels?"—the answer was, "Yes; all right"—I went to Mr. Samuels' private residence, No. 1, Lisson-street, and rang and knocked, but could not make any one bear—I went back to the shop and listened, but could not bear any one—I turned, and saw Parsons and Grant come out of the mews, about five yards from where I stood—that was about a quarter to 2 o'clock—I was on a strange division at that time, and did not know there was a mews—I got Mr. Samuels up, and found the shop rather disturbed—there is an area, and I went down to the kitchen, and found marks on the water butt—from there I went on to the wall, where there was a ladder, which enabled parties to get over into the mews, where the railings were all broken away—that was the same mews that I saw Parsons and Grant come from—I saw them two yards from where the ladder was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am quartermaster sergeant of the ninth battalion of Royal Artillery, and have charge of the stores, which, among other things, contain officers' baggage—they were deposited in a lower room on the ground floor at the Artillery Barracks, at Woolwich, and in consequence of the crowded state of the stores, a great many heavy packages had been deposited in the passage leading to the stores—on Tuesday, 5th June, Captain Elgee's servant, William Manfield, came to me—I had a half chest of drawers painted blue, belonging to Captain Elgee, whose name was on it—I deli. vered it to Manfield, and left him with it in the passage by the stores—on Thursday, 7th June, Manfield came to me, and made a report—the chest was not there then—I made inquiries, and from information I received, I went with. four privates of the Buckinghamshire Militia to Hill-street, Woolwich—Fletcher, Saunders, and George, were three of them, the other is in the hospital—I knocked at the door; it was opened by a female, and on going into the house I found this chest of drawers, covered with some dirty linen—the sergeant found parts of various cases—Manfield was with us—I found the case broken in pieces, and part of it was on the fire—here is part of it, with Captain Elgee's initials on it—I sent for a policeman, and remained till Newell arrived; he made a search—a short time after he arrived, I was up stairs with him, and Bowden came up, and said, "What is all this about?"—Newell told him that he was charged with stealing those articles, and asked what he had to say about them, pointing to the articles lying on the floor—we also found an officer's canteen belonging to Captain Yelverton, which had been in my charge—I cannot say when I last saw it, because the stores were so full.; it is marked in chalk, "Yelverton"—in another room up stairs, I found another box, marked, "Captain Adding<lb></lb>ton," which had been left in my charge on 10th May—those boxes were broken up, and the contents, or a great part of them, gone—I knew Bowden before; he had been a gunner and driver in the Royal Artillery, and had been discharged—he had no business about the barracks that I know of:</p>

On 5th June, I went to the last witness, got the case out of the stores, and left it in the passage, locked up—I went the following day and took some books out belonging to the library, which I took to the library—I got some lashes, and lashed the box up—I last saw it on Wednesday, at 1 o'clock in the day—I went again on the following morning, Thursday, and it was not there—I gave information, and went with the quartermaster sergeant and several others to Hill-street, Woolwich—the three militia witnesses were with me; they pointed out the house, and we found there a chest of drawers, partly covered over with clothes, which was Captain Elgee's property—I saw other property of Captain Elgee's, went for a policeman, returned with him, and found some books, and a great number of things, which were safe in the chest when I left it—on the following Friday, 8th June, I went with Sergeant Newell to a house in Dorset-street, Spitalfields, and found two shirts, an epaulette case, some guitar strings, a set of new brushes, and a silver star, which had all been in the drawers when I locked them up and corded them; I put them in myself—a great many of the things have not been found; there were three silver forks, and spoons, and two silver ladles.</p>

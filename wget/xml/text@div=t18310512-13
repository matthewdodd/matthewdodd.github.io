On Friday night, the 22nd of April, I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock - I saw my house and premises secured; between five and six in the morning Pitts, my servant, alarmed me; I went down stairs, and found the house broken open - they had broken through the brick work, by the side of the back door, and made an entrance - I missed the articles stated in the indictment out of the shop - (enumerating them); the time-piece was a very peculiar one; the bottom of it was made of wood, and painted to imitate bronze - it had a figured brass band round the top; it was made out of a few materials, which I fitted up myself - it was old-fashioned, and stood on three brass legs; I missed many other articles of linen-drapery, and an Eolian harp - the value of all the articles stolen is not less than 100l.; I should think considerably more - I found an old tinder-box left behind, which did not belong to the premises - I saw the greatest part of the property before Mr. Mores, the Magistrate, about a week after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any second Christian name? A. No, nor partner - I reside in the house.</p>

            ALLEY. Q.Did you examine the house to see that it was fastened? A. I did - I examined the street door and the back door; I only keep one servant - she locked and bolted the door, and placed two chairs against the back door, besides locking it, and it had a chain, a bar, and bell - we had placed chairs there for a long time, as we had heard of an attempt at robbery being discovered by chairs being thrown down - I never saw Chalk near my house - the door was not insecure.</p>
               <p>SARAH PITTS. I am servant to Mr. Katenbeck. On the 22nd of April, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I fastened the doors and windows - I fastened the back door with two bolts, a lock, and chain, and placed two chairs against it; I came down about twenty minutes before six o'clock in the morning - it was then light; I found the little shop door open, which was shut over night - the chairs I had placed before the door I found in the kitchen when I came down - I had not removed them there; the alarm-bell, which hung on the door the night before, was taken off, and put in the garden - I observed the brickwork taken out of the wall by the side of the door; the space was not large enough for a man to get in, but he might put his arm in and open the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The door was locked, bolted, and chained? A. Yes; a hand could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120015"></xptr>be put in to remove the bolts and chain - they got the door shutter down, and then broke a pane of glass - the bottom bolt could not be undone through the hole in the brick work; I was the only servant.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. Was the hole on the side where the lock was, or the hinges? A. On the side where the lock was - the chain fastened on the side of the hinge - the hole in the wall was about half a yard from the floor; an arm put through it could unlock the door, undo the top bolt, and unscrew the shutter; a pane of glass was cut- all the fastenings might then he undone.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM POOL. I am a retailer of beer at Tottenham; I know all the prisoners. I saw them all three at my house on Friday night, the 22nd of April - they came in about a quarter-past nine o'clock; my house is about a mile nearer to the prosecutor's than Patrick's - I believe they all came in together; they had some porter, drank together, and staid till about five minutes after ten, which was my time to clear the house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.They went, because you turned them out? A. Yes; I told them it was my time to shut up, and they went.</p>

            ALLEY. Q. Have you not known Chalk some time? A. He has frequented my house about six months.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BRADFORD. I am a labourer, and live at the prisoner Brown's house - this is the eleventh week I have been there; neither of the other prisoners lodged there - it is Brown's house, and is in High-cross-lane, Tottenham. On Saturday morning, the 23rd of April, between three and four o'clock, just as it got day-light, I saw the three prisoners there together - I was up.</p>
               <p>Q. What first attracted your attention? A. I was up stairs in my room - the house has only one floor; I heard somebody come in - I did not know who it was, and I went to the stairs to see; they had no candle when they came in, but a little bit of candle was lighted in the back washhouse - I saw them all standing in the wash-house; they were not doing any thing, or bring my any thing in.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect what you stated before the Magistrate, and be careful, did you see any thing in the wash-house that night? A. Yes, I saw the time-piece while the prisoners were there - the time-piece appeared to be on brass standings, and it had some brass about it - I saw several things laying down, but do not know what they were, not to swear to it - there might be a little ribbon, but I was not near enough to see exactly what colour they were; I am certain I saw something there resembling ribbons - I was not on the stairs above two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what resembled ribbons, rolled up or unrolled? A.Unrolled - there was a goodish lot of whatever it was; I saw some worsted - there seemed a goodish bit of it; I saw nothing else - the things were close to the three prisoners; it is a very small place - I stood there looking about two minutes; I then left them, went up stairs, and went to bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What distance were you from the wash-house? A.About four yards - I was looking through the bannisters, not through a window - I did not speak to them; I peeped down, and went back; I could tell the colour of the worsted, because it was dark blue; I cannot tell the colour of the ribbon, it might have been white, black, or green, for what I know; it was as near to me as the worsted, but when a lot of things are together, you cannot see them all alike - there might he different colours of that, but the worsted was all blue; I am a labourer, and do any thing I can get to do - I have been in trouble before for getting tipsy, and been locked up for it - I have been in the cage once or twice - three times is the utmost; I was taken to the cage with these three prisoners - I will not swear it has not been four times, five, or six; I do not think it requisite to swear about it - I have not been locked up six times; you would make a person tell a lie.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not say you would not swear you had not been six times locked up? A. I told you I would not swear to it - I was never locked up for any thing but drunkenness, except when I was taken with these prisoners - I was never accused of theft in my life; I was in the employ of Mr. Fiddler, of Tottenham, before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, justly or unjustly, were you never accused of theft? A. Not any thing but drunkenness.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.How long have you lived at Tottenham? A. I was born and bred there, and have lived there all my life.</p>
               <p>JOHN DELLARS. I am a labourer, and live at Southgate. I know the prisoner Grimley; I heard of this robbery on the Sunday morning, as it happened on Friday -I saw Grimley on the Saturday after the robbery, at the Red Lion, at Tottenham, when I was getting my dinner, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon; I had not then heard of the robbery - he had a little bit of music in his mouth: he played it, and one and another asked him to let them look at it; I asked him to let me see it - he said he would sell it, and I gave him 4d. for it; I gave it to Griffiths, the officer, last Friday week - I kept it in my possession till then; I saw him take a few shillings out of his pocket, as they appeared to be - he said nothing.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SAVAGE. I am shopman to Mr. Murray, a pawnbroker, of East Smithfield. On Saturday, the 23rd of April, the prisoner Brown, came to sell some old silver, which I bought of him, and have got here - it is silver buttons, a silver clasp, a spoon, and part of another, a silver pencil-case, and a broken silver buckle - I broke that up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120016"></xptr>to weight it; I gave him about 39s. for the articles - he did not tell me his name; there was some silver coin among them, which the prosecutor cannot identify, and I have not brought them; I gave 39s. for the whole - there were several shillings - it was all mixed with other old silver; Mr. Katenbeck picked out what he thought was his -Grimley brought in a time-piece the same morning and offered it in pledge; I am quite sure of his person - I did not take it in; it was a very old fashioned one, made of wood, and a little brass-work about it - I thought it like an urn; I did not notice what it stood on - Grimley came first and offered it, and in half an hour Brown brought the silver; they were not in the shop together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You do not remember how many coins you bought among the silver? A. No; a dollar was worth 4s. - there were several shillings, I cannot say how many; I put them all into the scale together, and weighed them; there might be 20s. or 30s.; they were old shillings; I do not think there were thirty; I would rather swear there were not than that there were; Mr. Katenbeck saw all my silver, and pointed out what he could identify; what I have brought is worth about 20s., and the whole weighed about 8ozs. - Brown was dressed very respectable, and gave a good account of himself; he told me he came out of the country, and that they were given him by his father, and that he was going into the country - they were old fashioned buttons, and Prussian silver, not worth 3s. an ounce; there was not crest on the spoon - it is an old fashioned spoon, and Prussian silver.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Were these things sold you by weight? A. Yes - I gave 4s. an ounce, which is the value for Prossian silver; it is silver mixed with tin.</p>
               <p>JOHN THOMAS. I am a watchmaker, and live in New-road, St. George's East. I know Grimley and Brown; on Saturday, the 23rd of April, about ten o'clock in the morning, they came to my shop together, to dispose of some silver; one of them, I do not know which, produced two Spanish dollars and two 3s. tokens to sell, which I put into the scale; I am not quite certain whether there was any more or not, but after that, one of them chucked a piece of a spoon into the scale - I do not know which of them it was - the scale was as near as possible on a balance, and I took the piece of spoon out, threw it back, and said I would do business with one of them at a time, as it was a different man who threw the spoon in - after that the one who threw in the broken spoon pulled a time-piece out of his pocket, and asked me to purchase it; one of them produced some old fashioned buttons, but which it was I do not know - these are them (looking at some) - in consequence of seeing so many different pieces from one and another, I refused to have any thing to do with them; the time piece was on a wooden stand, painted like bronze - there was a figured brass round the edges, and it stood on brass feet - it was rather old fashioned; I refused to deal with them, and after a good bit they left the shop, taking the property with them - I afterwards found in the box of the scales which I had used at the transaction, the top of the spoon, and I gave it to the officer; it was the same as was chucked into the scale, as I suppose, for it did not belong to me, and I do not know how else it came into my shop; I believe it to be the one they brought - it might be two or three days after they came that I found it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you keep any shopman? A. No - the buttons are silver; I cannot say if I bought them whether I should weigh them with spoons - I should buy old silver by the ounce, but I might reckon the buttons as useful articles; I do not consider them so good silver as spoons - the shanks are soldered on: spoons are generally reckoned the best silver - there is a difference in the quality even of coin; I cannot tell whether there is any thing in silver to depreciate it, unless it is assayed - I should not consider them such good silver as spoons, but I have not tried them - I should not call them Prussian silver.</p>

            . I am a constable of Edmonton. On Monday, the 25th of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was at the Horse and Groom there; I heard a noise, which induced me to go into the house; I saw the prisoners Chalk and Grimley, in company with others, drinking - I went into the bar, and they saw me; Chalk followed me to the bar-door, and asked if I would have any thing to drink - I told him No; he afterwards went into the tap-room, and in a few minutes he came again, and asked if I would have any thing to drink; I refused - he then asked if I had found out any thing of Katenbeck's robbery; I told him I had not - he said, "Oh, they must be some Londoners - us country folks cannot do that;" I told him he might make some people believe that, but he would not me; he then said, "You may as well say it was me;" I replied, "I believe you was one of the party;" he afterwards asked me to drink again, which I refused - he then put his hand into his pocket, pulled out some money, and said, "Here you b - r, here is some of Katenbeck's money, and I have got plenty more of it in my pocket," and he pulled out some more - I replied, I thought he had never spoken a truer word in his life; he then called for a glass of brandy or a bottle of wine, saying he would treat me with either - he ordered the landlord to bring it; I still refused having any, and he said, "You b - r, come out, if I could get you out here I would run a knife into your bl - dy guts, and rip you open;" I told him if he said that again I would come out, take him into custody, and take him to the cage; he then denied saying so, and said he did not mean any thing, and would give me any thing to drink - it there ended, but he afterwards struck a person in the house, and I went in to take him out.</p>

               <p>Q. Had Grimley left when this conversation took place? A. He was there, in the tap-room; I have not a doubt of his being able to hear it, from his manner of speaking; I did not see Brown that evening - Mr. Reed, a farmer, and Shadbolt, the landlord, were in the bar with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Grimley take any part in the conversation? - A. I did not hear him - he was talking, but did not hold out any threats to me; neither Mr. Reed nor the landlord took any part in the conversation; I was not in any fear of my life; when I went to turn him out of the house they helped me; Chalk was against the bar door, and Grimley was in the tap-room, which joins the bar - a great many others were there; Grimley was drinking with them - there was nothing between them but the bar door; every body in the tap-room could hear the conversation - Grimley took no share in the conversation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. How often have you been a witness in a Court of Justice? A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120017"></xptr>cannot say; I have been an officer ten or twelve years - Chalk knew I was an officer perfectly well; I drank that evening, but not with them - no man ever saw me drunk; I was perfectly sober - Chalk spoke in a very loud tone; I have no doubt Grimley heard it - he seemed to care nothing about what he said; I should think there might be a dozen persons in the tap-room - I thought it very extraordinary, but I thought it was true; I suspected he was one of them from the first morning I was sent for - he told me this was some of Katenbeck's money, but I wanted stronger proof, and that we had in a few days, and I gave information to the officers - I should have taken him that night, if I thought I had proof enough; it was not said in a joke.</p>
               <p>Q.Might he not have been hear saying this at the distance of twenty yards? A.Perhaps he might, for he was in a violent passion, talking about ripping my guts open; I saw no stick or knife in his hand - he threw half a crown out of his hand, and I saw a great deal more silver; he was not perfectly sober, but he was not drunk - he was the worse for liquor; I believe he knew what he was about - he said what I have stated exactly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you known Chalk any length of time? A. Yes - he is a sawyer; he follows that business sometimes.</p>

             SHADBOLT. I keep the Horse and Groom public-house, at Edmonton. I remember Camp being in my bar on Monday evening, the 25th of April - there were about nine people in my tap-room, including the three prisoners; they were all three in there at the time Camp came in - he went into the bar; Chalk came to him, and asked him to drink - he refused, and Chalk called him an old b - r; the prisoners had two or three pots of beer - Chalk asked Camp to drink, and after that asked him to have a bottle of wine; he refused drinking at all with them - nobody but Chalk asked him to drink; Chalk pulled out a handful of money, and said, "D - n you, you old b - r, here is plenty of old Katenbeck's, money, we have got more when this is gone, in Mr. Reed's hollow tree in one of his fields;" I heard nothing more - I had the house cleared shortly after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Camp hear all that you heard, for it was addressed to him? A. Yes- he told Camp that he had got more in Mr. Reed's hollow tree; Camp must have heard that - I have been out of Court while he was examined; I should think he must have heard all about the rest of the money being in the hollow tree - there were only Chalk and Grimley at the bar when he spoke of the hollow tree; nobody was drinking then - Grimley was standing up at the bar door; they were all three together at the bar door, or walking about by the side of the bar - they had nothing to drink then, for I would not draw any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. If Camp has said that Grimley and Brown were sitting with the rest of the people drinking near the bar, he must be mistaken? A. They had been drinking together at the first part of the conversation; there were about six of them there - I should think they were within hearing; I am satisfied that at the time of the conversation, Grimley was standing at the bar door listening to it- I cannot say that he took any part in the conversation; I should think Camp must have seen him at the bar door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Did you mention to any body what you heard about the money? A. He mentioned it to Camp, the officer, shortly after he came into the house; I gave this evidence before Mr. Mores - I should think they were sober; nothing whatever was said to them about Katenbeck's property - they brought it up themselves; I can swear to the very words Chalk used - I did not write them down, but I took notice of them; he put his hands into his pockets, and the observation he made, made me remark it - he was sober, I should think; I do not think it was said in a joke - I was in the bar at the time, and listened to what they said; my attention was not called off.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. You say, at the time of the conversation, the other prisoners were either at the bar, or walking about near it? A. Yes - the tap-room joins the bar: Grimley was leaning against the bar door, which opens into the tap-room; nobody could be in the tap-room without being close to the bar.</p>

A.Certainly not; I never said I would get him transported - I never took any money from his father or mother, unless it has been when he has been before a Magistrate, and there have been fees to pay for serving warrants, and I received the money for the warrants from the Magistrate's clerk; I never took the money from his father or mother - I never expressed any dislike to him, or said I would do him an injury.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Edmonton. I was in the bar at the Horse and Groom on Monday night, the 25th of April, about eight o'clock; I saw Grimley and Chalk there - I saw Chalk put his hand into his pocket, take out a handful of silver, and shake it; he said to Camp, "Here, you b - r, here is some of Mr. Katenbeck's money, and when that is gone I will go down to a hollow tree, which stands in Steven Reed's field, and get more;" he was then leaning over the bar door, and Grimley stood by the side of him - he told Camp if he had him outside he should like to let his bl - dy guts out; a man, named Gregory, a gardener, was also in the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Gregory here? A. No - Camp was about three yards from Chalk when he said he would go to the hollow tree; he was addressing himself to Camp - I and Camp did not go down to the tree to see if there was any money; I could not tell whether there was any there or not - I did not believe him; he was rather in liquor - I cannot tell his meaning for saying what he did; I had no reason not to believe him - I thought it was malice towards Camp, which made him talk of ripping his guts out; he said if he had a knife he would do it - Camp had given him no offence; he pressed him very much to drink ale, and then brandy, rum, or wine.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you the least doubt he was so drunk that he did not know what he was saying? A. I cannot say that; I should think he did know what he was saying - there are a great many trees in the field; I cannot say which tree he meant - I do not know a tree which goes by the name of the hollow one; I did not consider I had any occasion to ask him which tree it was in - Grimley was standing by; he was drinking at times - he had a pot in his hand,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120018"></xptr>and was passing it to the rest at times; I am sure of that- I should think there were six or eight people in the tap-room; they all heard about the hollow tree - they were not all drinking with Grimley; I should think two or three were not drinking with him - Brown was not there at all; I did not see him - I saw all the persons in the room; he was not one of them.</p>

            ALLEY. Q. You have said Grimley was drunk? A.No, Chalk was; I rather thought it was some of Mr. Katenbeck's money that he had - that did not strike me as being so curious as the rest being in a tree; I did not give him in charge - there were others present besides me.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you believe the money was Katenback's? A. From the character of the man; I did not believe the money was in the tree - I thought that a curious place; I certainly thought it extcaordinary that he should say he had got Katenbeck's money, and I had reason to believe it true from his character.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 20th of April I searched Brown's house; he was not present, but his wife was - I know it was his house; I had seen him living there - I went into the bed-room, and while I was searching a box Mrs. Brown was behind me; I turned my head, and she snatched something out of another box, which appeared to be muslin; she goes by the name of Mrs. Brown, and I knew her to live there with him - I instantly seized her hand, and asked what she had got; she said it belonged to her baby, and put it into her bosom - I took it from her, and it was a piece of black satin; this was at a quarter before five o'clock in the afternoon, and about seven the same evening I apprehended the three prisoners at the White Hart, Tottenham-hale - they were altogether then; when I found they were there I called Coffee, Webb, Knott and Camden - they went in with me, and we apprehended the three prisoners altogether; Chalk was rather obstinate - he used no fowl language nor threats, but said he would not he taken; we secured them all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLET. Q. Did you see Chalk enter the house? A. No; he swore I should not take him - I laid hold of his arm to put the handcuffs on, and he struggled; he did not strike, but, when I held his arm, he laid hold of me, and I suppose would have tripped me up if he could - I found 13s. on him; I searched his house, and found nothing but two duplicates belonging to his wife.</p>

            . I am a constable of Tettenham. I went, accompanied by other persons, to search Brown's house on Friday night, the 29th of April, after the three prisoners had been apprehended; the first time I went, a man, named Wiseman, was there, but not Brown's wife - I found nothing the first time; I went again the same day, and looked on the roof of his house outside - I borrowed a ladder, got on the tiles, and, by the side of the chimney, I found the mortar, which is called the pointing, had been removed; I lifted up one of the tiles, and saw a bag full of something under the tiles - I produce it; I found a wrapper full of goods in the same place, and a bundle of worsted - I found a chisel in the back washhouse; I have been to Mr. Katenbeck's house since the robbery, and examined his back door - I could not see any marks on the door, because the boards had been removed, and new ones placed; Mr. Karenbeck gave me this piece of wood, which has marks on it corresponding with the chisel.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This, you say, exactly corresponds? A. Yes, if you turn it the right was you will find it does; nobody could get on the roof without a ladder; the prisoners were in custody at the time I made the search; I knew the people in the house - they were not strangers to me.</p>

I have; it is mine, and part of the property I lost that night - it consists of a great part of what was stolen; I am certain every thing here is mine, except the wrapper, which does not belong to me - this silver is my property, decidedly; I lost a number of old coins, some plain shillings, some had money, and, I rather think, there was a dollar - it was in a small drawer in my desk, where I used to put all those sort of things; these buttons I know, they are sixty years old - I know this pencil-case, this part of a spoon, and the salt-spoon; the buckles are German silver.</p>

               <p>EDWARD BROWN.</p>
               <p>The bell on the door was taken off and given to me, which I laid down on the ground in the garden.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BROWN.</p>
               <p>Taken before me, the prisoner Edward Brown, having been first asked what he had to say in answer to the charge, and cautioned as to his statement.</p>
               <p>E. R. MORES.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRIFFITHS re-examined. I received from John Dellars this piece of music, which Mr. Katenbeck has seen.</p>
               <p>MR. KATENBECK. This is mine - it is an Eolian harp, I call it so; I lost it with the goods - I have had it about five years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are these not very common things? A. I think not, made in that way; they were common five years ago - I know it by one of the pegs having been broken and mended again; there is no mark where it was mended - it is a note in playing.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. Have you tried, by playing on it, whether you can discover that it is a mended instrument? A. No, it is quite out of order, and I cannot play it.</p>
               <p>MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Is there any private mark on the silks or satin? A. The greatest part of the silks have my private mark - here are the tickets, with private marks on them, and some are in my own hand-writing; here is this crape scarf I know.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You sell them with the marks on them? A. Yes, but these have not been offered for sale, and I have sold none of exactly this pattern, to the best of my knowledge, but I may - I had one of this colour the night before the robbery; to the best of my belief I had not sold this scarf, and I found it with the goods which I lost that night.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.Had you, the day before the robbery, an article of that kind? A. I had, and missed it the next morning - I have scarcely two patterns slike in my stock; I had thirty or forty different scarfs or handkerchiefs, all of different patterns - they nearly emptied the whole box; I have not a doubt that the goods now produced belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. If I had not been persuaded by others, I should not have thought of doing what I did - we were all three together in the White Hart, and Grimley proposed to go to Mr. Katenbeck's - he persuaded me, and I believe Chalk woudl not have done it if he had not been persuaded; I always bore a good character, and never did any thing till I got into company.</p>
               <p>Grimley's Defence. I know nothing of Brown, further then seeing him, the same as others; what he says is false, with regard to me - what has been stated here to my prejudice is false; I never was in Mr. Katenheck's premises, nor near them, except being once outside the house.</p>
               <p>Chalk's Defence. I never saw 
               <persName id="t18310512-13-person199">Brown</persName>
             that night, after we went out of Pool's house - I should like to ask the constables if they knew any thing wrong of me before; I had been at work all day, and at night went into Pool's to get a pint of beer - I met a bargeman or two there; Brown and Grimley came in, and we had a pot of beer together; the day I was taken I had been working for - Hun, Esq. - the beer-shop was in my way home; I went home, went to bed, and saw no more of Brown - my sister would have come and proved this, but I did not know the trial would come on.</p>
               <p>Brown. I wish to know if the constables know any thing wrong of me.</p>

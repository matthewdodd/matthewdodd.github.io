On the night of 4th July I passed through the bar parlour—I saw the prisoner and another man standing there—the prisoner called for a pot of beer, and put a shilling on the counter—it was bad—I went and took the others out of the till, and found they were counterfeit—there were only two shillings in the till—I took them out, and sent for a policeman—I went round, to prevent the prisoner and his companion from escaping—the one that got away struck me severely—he got away, but I kept the prisoner—we struggled nearly twenty minutes—he struck me severely, and kicked me—I gave the three shillings to the officer—I marked them at the station.</p>

I lost these things on the 25th of last month; they were taken out of my bed-room. The prisoner came into the house, he called for a pint of beer; he asked my mistress to go backwards; she said, yes. Instead of going backwards he went up stairs, into the one pair room; he took my clothes that I wore in the afternoon; he brought no bundle in. My mistress saw him with a bundle; she ran after him, and brought him back; my shawl was in his pocket, and my petticoat and gown was in his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>MRS. PARVIS. On the 25th of June, in the afternoon, the prisoner came in and asked for a pint of porter; when he came in he had no bundle, as he went out he had a bundle; I called the people to help me in with him; he said if this is yours take it, and threw it down. The servant came in, she saw her shawl in his pocket. We secured him, and took him to Marlborough-street office.</p>

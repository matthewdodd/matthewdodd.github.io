                  </hi> I am sister of Mr. Paine, a music-seller, of High-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone. On 7th Feb., about seven o'clock in the evening, I went up stairs—when I got on to the landing I saw Connell standing at my bed-room door with a large bundle—he had just come out of the room—I asked with he did there—he knocked the candle out of my hand, knocked me down into the adjoining room, and he fell over me—he was then in the same room with me—he shut the door—I jumped up, opened it, and rushed down stairs—it was on the third floor—I did not see him again till he was in custody—I saw this bundle(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the landing—this dressing-case is mine, and was in my bed-room—I afterwards examined my bed-room, and missed some rings from my dressing-table, and a pair of bracelets out of the drawer—they have not been found—two men followed me down stairs—I cannot positively swear to Martin, but a man like him, with a hat on, passed me at the bottom of the stairs, and went out at the private door—I found another bundle in my brother's room—I gave both bundles to Steed—one was tied up, and the other partly so.</p>

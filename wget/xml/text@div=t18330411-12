I said I did not know; the prisoner George was out in the big yard - he did not see or hear what passed between us; I was taken by the Policeman on the Monday; I did nothing with the box but looked at it- the Policeman asked me if I had a little box; I said Yes, and pulled it from under my bed, and gave it to him - I was in prison for a week, and while there I heard John Godwin asked if he stole the money; he said Yes, he had stolen two guineas - that he gave them to his brother, and his brother gave him 8s. out of it.</p>

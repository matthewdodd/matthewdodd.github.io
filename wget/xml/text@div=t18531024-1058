                  </hi>. I am parish clerk of Great Walden, in Northampton-shire. I have known the prisoner more than thirty years, he was formerly groom to Lord Winchelsea—I knew Mary Richardson, she was living at her father's house—I was present at the parish church there on the 16th June, 1823; she and the prisoner were then married—I was present, and produce the certificate of the marriage—(<hi rend="italic">Ready</hi> "John Davy, bachelor, and Mary Richardson, spinster, married by banns on 16th June, 1823,")—they did not live together more than six months after they were married—I believe be then went away—I did not see him afterwards in that part of the country—I have not seen him for thirty years after that time—his wife continued to live in the same neighbourhood with her father and mother, she is living now with a man named Plum, in the parish of Dean, which is four miles from Walden—she has been in the same neighbourhood ever since her marriage—I saw her alive on 27th Sept., it will be one month to-morrow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How long did you know me before you were married to me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four years; it might have been twice four years—I had two children by you before we were married, but that was not my fault, you might have married me before—I was married about eight years, and was obliged to leave you through your cruelty—since that you have been living with a woman, and have got a family.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I married the second wife under the impression that I was single; I heard that my first wife was dead in 1830, a man sent me word that she died with the cholera; I afterwards married this woman, who had two children by me; her daughter would go out, and stay till 12 or 1 o'clock; I reproved her for it, and her mother said she should do as she liked, and they went out and lived at a common lodging house in Shadwell.</p>

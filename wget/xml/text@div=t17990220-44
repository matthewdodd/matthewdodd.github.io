             sworn. - I am a watch-house keeper: The prisoner was brought to the watch-house on the 5th of February, I searched her and found this pocket-piece, and this thimble, (produces them); she had a shilling and some halfpence, but I did not take them from her; then I went to her lodgings, No. 6, Maypole-court, up two pair of stairs; the watchman went first, and as I was going into the passage, she slipped half-a-guinea into my hand to let her go; when I got into the room, between the bed and the sacking I found this guinea; I brought her back to the watch-house, and took her before a Magistrate. (The thimble and pocket-piece were deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The half-guinea I gave the watchman was my own; he put the thimble and the pocket-piece upon the table, and I was foolish enough to put them into my pocket; he was very much in liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. Not in February? - A.She has not been for six months in our neighbourhood.</p>

               <p>MARGARET CHAPMAN sworn. - My husband is a master cooper: I have known the prisoner fourteen years; I have not known any thing of her for the last six or seven years; before that time she was a very honest girl.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at No. 1, Belvedere Place, Cambridge Heath Road, Middlesex. On the night of 27th March, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I was in Houndsditch; a tall man came in front of me, and then the prisoner came up on my right—the tall man asked me some place, and pretended to be a foreigner—at the same time the prisoner, with his right hand, <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> me—my watch was in my trowsers pocket, attached to a guard, which was round my neck; I felt a something touch my ear; I drew my hand back, and felt the prisoner's left hand in my pocket, straight down—I laid hold of him by both arms, and threw him on the pavement, and said, "You scoundrel, you are trying to rob me," or something of that sort—the other man stooped down to his leg, and said, "He has hurt my leg"—as the prisoner was in the act of getting up, I felt a tug at my watch; I put up my hand, and there hung the two ends of my guard—the prisoner at once started off running towards Moses's; I ran after him; he <hi rend="italic">doubled</hi> me in Houndsditch, and came back again by the side of the church yard, and then turned down Church Row—I came up with him, and then he <hi rend="italic">doubled</hi> me again—I had nearly got hold of him; I called out, "Stop thief!" as well as I could—I did not lose sight of him until he ran against the policeman, in Aldgate; I lost sight of him then just for the moment that the policeman was in front of him, but I followed him up, and found him in custody; I could not have lost sight of him for half a minute—he ran perhaps eighteen yards, or something like that, after he had passed the policeman, before he was taken—I saw my watch produced by the witness Gooderham.</p>

A little before 11 o'clock on 27th March I saw the prisoner in Houndsditch, running from Aldgate Church towards Bishopsgate Church; the prosecutor was following about fifty yards behind him—the prisoner passed me; as he passed, he gave a kind of a laugh, and said, "What a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>!"—the prosecutor came up, and</p>

               <p>passed me and cried, "Stop thief!"—I was going to follow the prisoner, but I saw he was going to turn down Church Row; he then turned round, and came towards me, and when he got within a few yards of me he made a rush at me to <hi rend="italic">capsize</hi> me; I made a grasp at him, he avoided it, and ran towards Moses and Sons', at the corner of the Minories—I ran after him, and when I got within two yards of him I saw him make a kind of <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> with his right hand, and throw something away—at that time a young man who was passing, hearing me cry, "Stop thief!" ran up against him, and <hi rend="italic">capsized</hi> him, and they both fell together; I then secured him—the prosecutor came up, and said, "That man has got my watch"—the witness Gooderham came up, and produced this watch, which he said he had just picked up; that was not above three yards from where I had seen the prisoner make the jerk—I did not lose sight of him at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, at No. 6, Windsor Court, Monkwell Street, Falcon Square. On Friday night, 27th March, I saw two men running across the road, near the corner of the Minories; they fell to the ground; at the same time something passed me with a sort of humming noise, and alighted a few yards off; I went and picked up this watch; just at the moment a tall pale man with dark whiskers came up, and said it was his, and he would give the d—fellow in cheques—I would not give it to him—he tried to get it out of my hand, but I kept it, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

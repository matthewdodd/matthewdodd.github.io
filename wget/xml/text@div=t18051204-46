               <p>Q. What? - A. A lottery ticket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney-General. Q. That is your own hand writing? - A. It was made by myself at the time, most likely; our regular way is to do it immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt but that you made it in the ordinary way? - A. Not the least doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness to look at that Bank note, and see whether you know it? - A. I see the figures in my own hand writing 1257 on the back of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the number of that note? - A. 2588.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney-General. Q. You observe upon the back of it 1257 in your own hand writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any letters besides this number in your own hand-writing? - A. Yes, tick, signifying ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. These letters and figures were written by yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you write them? - A. In case the note should be a bad one, that we might have an opportunity of stopping the ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you then able to say from that circumstance, that you received that note for that ticket? - A. To the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. No doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. You tell me that it was made for that express purpose that that ticket should be stopped if that Bank note should be bad? - A. It was for that purpose; and that ticket was bought by that Bank note.</p>
               <p>Q. You are certain of it? - A. I might make a mistake in the figure; I have no doubt but I did it at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver it to any other person to look at at the time? - A. I cannot recollect delivering it at the time; It appears there is a memorandum of Mr. Brookes's upon it, done at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Brookes is Mr. Bish's nephew, a clerk in the same office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether it was a day in which a great deal of business was done? - A. It does not appear by our books that it was a busy day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how many tickets you sold in that day? - A. Two whole tickets.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of these tickets were this, the first or the last? - A. The last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I observed you to speak with a great deal of caution; Mr. Bish does as much business in the lottery way as any gentleman in London? - A. He does.</p>
               <p>Q. A great number of persons employed, I take it for granted? - A. Five or six, or upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. I observed you to say that, that book refreshed your recollection? - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Without the assistance of that book you would not be able to recollect so long back? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But that figure I took it you said, you might be mistaken? - A. I did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the hurry of your business your book is sometimes incorrect with respect to a figure? - A. I have known that fault attach to myself frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. It has happened to you frequently, and I suppose may happen to any other person, when you are particularly busy? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. This is the third of September you are speaking to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the lottery begin drawing? - A. I do not exactly recollect the day, I think was the 30th.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore this was bought in the month that the lottery was drawing? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the memorandum that you made, I think that you said you most likely made the memorandum at the time, you do not mean to be accurate, whether you did make that memorandum at that particular time or not? - A. I will not swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, in proportion as your business or other things call your attention, you sometimes do not? - A. It is our general mode of doing it directly, I never knew an instance of not doing it at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear whether you did or not? - A. I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know at all the person that bought the ticket? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney-General. What was the number of the other ticket that you sold on that one day, you say you sold but two? - A. It appears by the entry to be 17,109.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say to you at that time? - A. He said that he was very unfortunate that morning; that one of his numbers was within one of the one thousand pounds prize; he asked me if I would be so good as to enquire if such a number was drawn, giving me the memorandum of 3; I went accordingly to oblige him, and made an inquiry if they were drawn; the gentleman that attended at Mr. Bish's office that day, said two of the three were drawn blanks, and marked B to each number; the other number he took no account of; upon this one I asked him if he would oblige me with the information whether that was a prize or blank.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not ask you what passed between you and the clerk in the office; when you had made the inquiry, did you return to Mr. Andrew? - A. Yes, directly; I delivered the paper into Mr. Andrews's own hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you then say to Mr. Andrew? - A. I told Mr. Andrew I could not conceive why they were so very inquisitive at the office, so particular in asking me if they were my own tickets; I had told them they were not my own.</p>
               <p>Q. You told Mr. Andrew that you had said at the office, that they were not my own; what did Mr. Andrew say to this? - A. He smiled, and said never mind.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he say never mind? - A. Yes. and smiled; I said, sir, I do not know what they mean at the office in asking if they were my own numbers; the prisoner said never mind; but the words he said immediately after, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. What became of Mr. Andrew at that time? - A. At that time I left him at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this was it when any clerk came and pointed out you, and you gave the account that Mr. Andrew was the man that had sent you? - A. No other person than Mr. Stow called me.</p>
               <p>Q. A person came from Mr. Bish's office and pointed out you as the man that had made the enquiry, you pointed to Mr. Andrew as the person that had sent you on the message for the enquiry of the numbers? - A. Yes.</p>

If this ticket should be in the hands of any office-keeper, he is desired to give notice, or to be registered, or any enquiry, to stop the party until the secretary shall be applied to; did you ever see that? - A. Never, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of it? - A. I will not say I never heard of it, but to the best of my knowledge I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not know that there was such a paper circulated in order to get at that note? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether Mr. Andrew directed you to go to Mr. Bish's? - A. Yes, particularly.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any thing that you was to keep secret at all about it, in going to Mr. Bish's or any other place? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had gone to any other lottery-office, you could have known the fate of the ticket? - A. Yes, he gave me the information where Mr. Bish was, as I had said I did not know where it was.</p>

I did, he told me that he bought it at Mr. Bish's and that he gave for it either a 20 l. Bank note, or two 10 l. but he could not recollect which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inquire of him when he bought it? - A. I did, he told me about a week before the drawing of the lottery, I think to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any inquiry of him as to the 20 l. or 10 l. notes that he said he had paid for them? - A. I asked him if he could recollect the number of these notes? He said he could not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether he said then by whom he received them? - A. I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether Mr. Parkin said any thing as to the importance of his endeavouring to recollect from whom he took these notes? - A. Mr. Parkin told him it was of the utmost consequence for him to recollect from whom he had received these notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did he make to that? - A. I think he said he could not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing then said to the prisoner as to searching his house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said upon that subject? - A. Mr. Parkin told him that it was necessary to search his house; Mr. Parkin and I accompanied the prisoner to his house, and searched it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take an officer with you? - A. No, we did not.</p>
               <p>Q. That was for the purpose of doing it in the least manner that should be unpleasant? - A. I believe that was it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon searching, there was nothing found which threw a light upon this subject? - A. There was nothing found but a duplicate, which Mr. Parkin took away.</p>
               <p>Q. After the search, was he informed that he must be put into some custody? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you return with him to the post-office for that purpose? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether in your way to the post-office you said any thing to urge him to recollect where he got these notes? - A. I did, I impressed it strongly on his mind the necessity of so doing, where he got the two tens and the twenty; I saw him again next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Parkin present then? - A. He was; he was then asked if he could recollect where he had them notes; Mr. Parkin I think put it very strongly to him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at any time asked by Mr. Parkin whether he was on the confidential duty on the 21st of November? - A. He was asked by Mr. Parkin if he was on the confidential duty on the 21st of November; on a reference to the office-book he admitted that he was on duty that night.</p>
               <p>Q. He referred to the office-book, and he found it so? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there an entry in the book upon which every person is put down? - A. There is an entry on which every persons name is put, except those persons who are on secret duty.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the reference of the book to be? - A. Because he saw Mr. Faulkener's name on the regular duty, and his name was not; therefore he must be on the regular duty, and Andrew upon the not regular.</p>
               <p>Q. This examination duty has been for a long time? - A. Yes, before, and continued a long time after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have known the young man at the bar ever since he came to the post-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He remained in the service of the post-office till the day he was apprehended? - A. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. In all the questions that were put to him, except in the two tens and the twenty, was his story consistent at all times? - A. Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the book in which was entered the notes of Mrs. Blundle that had been lost, was that book opened to the inspection of any other person in that office? - Q. Yes. in general.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had the opportunity of seeing what was in this book, the book giving intelligence that 180 l. was lost? - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in December the very month after the letter was sent? - A. On Dec. 3. after November 21.</p>

               <p>Q. He still continued in the post office, notwithstanding what he had seen in that book,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040059"></xptr>down to the time of his apprehension? - A. Yes, down to the time of apprehension.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem to try to recollect that which Mr. Stow and Mr. Parkin very humanely impressed him to remember, the number of the 20 l. and the two 10 l. notes; did he try to recollect as much as was in his power? - A. I think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that in consequence of the questions that were put to him, that he endeavoured to recollect before he made an answer to the questions? - A. I think he did; he seemed to consider; and as far as I could judge, that he could not recollect the thing.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had endeavoured at different times to recollect, it was then proposed to search his house, and through the kindness of the prosecutors, no officer but you and Mr. Parkin were to make the search. Did he make the least objection to your searching the house? - A. None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. On Mr. Bish sending to you at the office, were there any hesitation on his part to the questions he was asked? - A. On the contrary, perfectly free.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you have known him for the space of ten years? - A. I have known him ever since he has been at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. He has been at the office for ten years: has he always remained in this office? - A. He was removed to this confidential duty on account of his excellent character.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been in this last confidential situation? - A. About three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you occasion during the three years, when he was more particularly under your care, of observing his conduct and demeanor? - A. Very often, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Having had that opportunity for the space of three years and more, your immediate attention being paid to it, what is your opinion of him? - A. My opinion of him was, that he was one of the most correct men that I ever met with in my life, strictly honest, and of the greatest integrity.</p>
               <p>Q. That opinion that you thus formed of him, was from the opportunity that you had given you of watching his conduct narrowly? - A. Of course.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the connection that was between you, he being a clerk in that particular department, produce any intimacy between you? - A. I had a great regard for him, through his being in that confidential duty.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether you had the means of knowing whether he was an extravagant man or economical? - A. I always thought him economical in every respect.</p>
               <p>Q. From the whole of your observations of his conduct and character, would it ever have entered your mind to have suspected him to be guilty of an offence of this sort? - A. The last man that I should have thought.</p>
               <p>Q. His salary, I understand, is about 210 l. a year. Do you know of his having any other means of subsistence beside that? - A. He lets lodgings, by which I understand he got about 70 l. a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Any other source? - A. An estate that was sold at Mansfield in Nottinghamshire; I understood that he received some money there on account of his mother and sister.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbot. Q. Not for his own use? - A. Not for his own use.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated that he received some money from the sale of his house, on account of his mother and sister, not for his own use; when was it? - A. In the year 1802.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned, that in your opinion he was quite economical? - A. I always thought so.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you aware that he was a purchaser of whole or parts of lottery tickets? - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is his house? - A. In Ely Place, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the amount of it? - A. I think 80 l. a year.</p>
               <p>Q. When the particulars of lost notes are given at the Post-office, is it usual to enter the particulars in that book? - A. It is whenever they are given.</p>
               <p>Q. And not to put query? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then those words query, and what, would lead a clerk to suppose that the particulars were unknown? - A. It would.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What paper is that you have got in your hand? - A. It is the date that I did it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you put it down? - A. A week back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rowe. Q. Have you a certain rule that you can ascertain that you were not on that duty on the 21st of November, 1804? - A. Yes, I never knew any one besides him and me do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, if the witness was not there, it must have been the prisoner Andrew? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that duty, would a letter that came in the Bath bag, have come to his hands? - A. It would, if it had not been taken away before, it must have gone into his hands.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to state when you wrote this, was it subsequent to the query? - A. Oh! Yes, a long time after, to the best of my recollection, after the prisoner was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. So that query remained in black ink, up to the time that the prisoner was taken up? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the duty that he had on the 21st, the Bath bag would have found its way before him? - A. Exactly so.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Abbot. You have heard the account that Mr. Stow has given of the conversation of the prisoner, and that in your presence? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Is his account correct? - A. Is is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any share of a ticket or tickets that you received from the prisoner at the bar? - A. I asked the prisoner if he had any Bank notes in his possession, upon which he produced<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040061"></xptr>two one-pound notes and two shares of lottery tickets in September lottery 1805, one an eighth share and the other a sixteenth share; he also produced a ticket in Bowyer's History of England lottery. The bank-notes I returned to him; the shares of tickets I kept.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I can say no more to you than I have already stated to Mr. Parkin and the gentlemen of the Post-Office. It is most certainly true that I bought the ticket at Mr. Bish's, at the time the office was full: that, instead of giving a fifty-pound note, I paid either a twenty or a smaller one. This is my case, together with the good character I have hitherto had. I therefore leave my case to your lordship and the gentlemen of the jury.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called ten witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 446). I was on duty in Charles-street, St. George's, on 13th November, about ten minutes before 12 o'clock at night. I was called to 25, Angel-gardens—I saw the prisoner there in the attic, I believe, or second floor room—there was a female named Horragan with him—the woman belonging to the house gave the prisoner in my charge, and she showed me several pieces of furniture which had been broken. I took him in custody for wilful damage—I asked him to come along with me to the station—he said he wished to have his cap, and the female took the candle to look for his cap, but could not find it—I told him to go along with me, and they would find his cap, and let him have it—he did not attempt to come with me, and I took hold of him on the left arm with my right hand—I said, "You had better come quietly; it will be all the better for you"—the female that was with him then assaulted me—he did not move his feet, and I took hold of him behind with both hands—I wished him to go quietly, and almost immediately, I felt something in my right thigh, and I saw his right hand there—he took it away from my right thigh and turned round to me, and I felt I was also stabbed in my left leg just below my knee—the prisoner stabbed me; I saw him draw his hand from my leg with the knife in his hand—I seized his wrist, and he had the knife in his hand, and he attempted to make a third stab at me—the female was violent during the whole time, and finding that I could not take the prisoner by myself, I got down stairs and sprung my rattle in the street—I then saw the prisoner on the roof of the house—two officers came to my assistance</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 310). On 13th November, I was on duty in Angel-gardens. About 12 o'clock at night, I heard the rattle sprung, and I ran in that direction—I saw the last witness bleeding from the leg—I did not go into No. 25, but there was a ladder at the bottom of the street—I went up that, and on the roof—I searched over several houses, and found the prisoner behind a chimney, fourteen or fifteen bouses from No. 25—I put my hand against his feet, and told him to come down—he neither moved nor stirred—I told him to come down; he was charged with stabbing William Roebuck—he made no reply—I took him to the station—in my opinion, he was perfectly sober—he walked to the station as well as I can now—I took him through a window, and he walked down stairs.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 332). I heard the rattle that night, and went to where it was—I found Roebuck bleeding from the leg—the last witness was with me—I saw him take the prisoner into custody—I assisted in taking him to the station—he was quite sober—he walked well—when I got him to the station, I went to 25, Angel-gardens—I went in the top room and found a quantity of blood on the floor, and the tables, chairs, and other things were broken in pieces—I went on the roof, and about thirty yards from the window where the prisoner went out at, I found this knife—it was stained with fresh blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the police force. On 14th November, I was called to attend Roebuck—I found him suffering from the loss of blood and two incised wounds; one on the right thigh, about two inches and a half long, and about half an inch deep, and the other was a wound on the leg, about an inch and a half deep, and about two inches long—they were incised wounds and severe, and had bled very much, especially the left leg—he has been unfit for duty ever since.</p>

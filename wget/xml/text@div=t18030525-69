             sworn. - On Monday, the 9th of May, about four o'clock in the morning, I was informed by a drover that the prisoner was turned out of the Holloway road, with a copper upon his back; I immediately pursued after him, and in a bye lane I found him among some thick bushes, and the copper by his side.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutor's house, at Holloway? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from his house was the place where you stopped the prisoner? - A. About half a mile; when the prisoner saw me advance towards him, he got up, and took the copper upon his back; I asked him where he was going with that copper; he said, to a coppersmith's, in Smithfield; I asked him where he brought it from; he said, from Whetstone; I asked if it was his own; he said, no, that it belonged to one Sanders, a bricklayer, that he had it of; I asked him the coppersmith's name that he was going to take it to, and he said he did not know the coppersmith's name; I told him he must go along with me for further examination, and I took him into custody; I took him to the Islington watch-house; the Magistrates of Islington ordered him to be taken to Hatton-garden at half after eleven that day; it has been in my possession ever since; I put two marks on it before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q.Did it appear to be recently taken out of the brick work? - A. Yes, the mortar was all about it.(The copper was produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am veryinnocent of taking the copper away; I brought it from Whetstone.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutor.) Was the house broke open? - A. There was some brick work down behind the place where the copper was, and some wood work put up at the windows to keep the weather out; he must have got in by removing the wood work, or where the bricks were down.</p>

            . I was going among my customers, on Saturday the 24th of July; I heard a box of silk was left at Mr. Ravenhill's; I went, and with Mr. Ravenhill looked at the things. On the top of the box there was a direction; it was "To Mr. Jones at Mr. Smith's, Aldersgate-street," where he lodged when out of place. Upon that Mr. Ravenhill said they were left at ten o'clock at night, by a smart person. I went the next day to

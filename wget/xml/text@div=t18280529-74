On the 2d of May, the prisoner came to my shop at half-past nine o'clock at night; she asked for some mourning-caps - I said we did not keep them; she then asked for some plain net caps - I showed her some, towhich she objected; I showed her a number of others and then missed one which I had shown her - I said I missed it; she said "It must be on the counter;" I said it was not - I called Mrs. Jay and told the prisoner she must go into the room and be searched; she then put her hand to her back, took the cap out of her pocket-hole and put it on the counter.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner; she said she had no pocket on; but the watch-house-keeper's wife found an opening behind her gown.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am really innocent; I neither intended to take a cap nor did I see it till it was at the watch-house - I was dressed as I am now, and had no pocket on; I could not put a cap into my pocket - my gown fastens behind, and I must have lifted up my gown to have got it under; I wanted a small mourning-cap for a child - I never went near the counter till I went to take up my glove and money.</p>
               <p>JOHN JAY. She was two or three yards from the counter; I was close to her, and saw her take it out - she did not ask for her glove till she got into the room.</p>

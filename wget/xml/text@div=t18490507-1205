                  <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE DAVET</hi> I am in the employ of James Bone, who keeps a public-house in Hammersmith-bridge-road. On 25th April, between twelve and one o'clock, I was standing at the side-door—I saw the prisoners and a bigger boy coming over Hammersmith-bridge, when they got near my master's, Hurson left the others, crossed the road, and came towards my master's—as soon as he got across, Douglas followed him—I could see through a glass into the bar—I heard the door go—I saw through the glass, Hurson in the bar, going from the till to the door—he went out at the front-door, and ran off, Mr. Gilpin caught him—when Hurson came out, Donglas was stand<lb></lb>ing in the road, and Hurson called to him—I took Hurson into the house—Douglas</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184905070103"></xptr>
               <p>ran away towards the Red Lion—Hurson had his hand in his pocket, he took it out, and put six shillings and seven sixpences in his mouth; that money was given to Mr. Gilpin—I afterwards saw Douglas coming back—he asked us to let the poor little fellow go, and not lock him up.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KENEALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far was Douglas from the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Fifteen or twenty yards, when Hurson was in; he ran down the road—lie did not walk—I do not know what became of the third boy—we had taken Hurson four or five hundred yards when we met Douglas coming back. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM GILPIN</hi>. I am brother-in-law to James Bone. On 25th April, I had occasion to leave the bar for a short time between twelve and one—I shut the door after me—I was absent two or three minutes—while I was away I heard the door shut—I looked through the glass and saw Hurson going from the till out at the door—I went after him; he ran a short distance; overtook him—I saw Douglas in the middle of the road, more towards side of the house, ten or twelve yards off—Hurson called out some name to him, and he advanced towards me—my impression was that Hurson called him to strike me—I called for Dnvey, and he took Hurson into the house, and I saw six shillings and seven sixpences come from his mouth—I had been at the till two or three minutes before, and there was about that amount in it—I found it empty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-exammed. Q.</hi> How do you know who Hurson called to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I There was no one there but Douglas, and he was looking towards, him—the I third boy was gone on a head. <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES LINE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 282). I took Hurson—he said he found the I money on the mat—I told Douglas he must go with me on a charge of taking money—he said, "You b----r, if you don't let me go, I will split your b--y <hi rend="italic">nut"</hi>—before the Magistrate he acknowledged being with the boy coming over the bridge—I was in plain clothes—he said, "Let the poor <hi rend="italic">ti</hi> I low go"—he said he did not know the boy, he had never seen him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you always use the expression? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; made the statement to the Magistrate: the clerk has omitted to put it down—I did not seize the boy violently, I took him by the arm—I told him I was A policeman, and then he used that expression. (Douglas received a good character.)</p>

            , at Brunswick-house, Hackney-road. On the evening of the 24th of August, about eight o'clock, I had been to a jeweller's shop, for the articles stated in the indictment - they were his property - they were in my ridicule, with my handkerchief.

            . On the evening of the 24th of August, a little after eight o'clock, I was in Bishopsgate-street, there was a little crowd opposite Widegate-alley, the prisoner pretended to stumble in the kennell, he snatched the prosecutrix's ridicule from her hand, and ran up the alley, I pursued him, three or four little boys came from the doorway, and ran by his side for some way. I kept him in sight, till he was stopped. He made a desperate resistance by kicking and fighting. I am positive he is the man.</p>

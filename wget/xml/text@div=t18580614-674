On 21st May, the prisoner came between 11 and 12 o'clock for a glass of mild ale—she gave me a shilling; I bit it and told her it was bad—she said that I had changed it—I told her I would lock her up if she said so again—she begged I would not—she asked me to give her the shilling, but I said that I should detain it—she then gave me another, and I gave her 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and she started off out of the shop—I followed her, and saw her go into Mr. Green's, the King's Head, about ten minutes' walk off—a policeman went with me.</p>

On Friday afternoon, 21st May, about 2 or 3 o'clock the prisoner came there—my niece served her, and she gave her a shilling—my niece gave it to me immediately, and I am able to say that it is the same—she never opened the till—I bent it, and asked her if she was aware it was bad?—she said, "No," and paid for what she had had, and left—I gave her the shilling back, but am quite sure it was bad.</p>

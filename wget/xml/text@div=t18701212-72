I live at 33, Wharfdale Road, King's Cross—on 24th April I was married to the prisoner at St. Jude's Church, Gray's Inn Road—when I first knew him, two years ago, he told me he was a married man—I went with him to Hastings, at his request—he told me the firm was going there for a holiday, and a party of ladies were going, and I should be quite safe—he said in March or April last "My wife died last night," and asked me if I would be his wife—I said that I was in no hurry to marry, and said "You are too old for me"—he pressed me a great deal to have him, and I at last consented, and went through the ceremony of marriage with him about three weeks afterwards—it is the fact that when we were at Hastings he slept with me—my mother did not give her consent to the marriage, she was very much against it—she gave no reason—these</p>

               <p>two letters are in the prisoner's writing—I have frequently seen him write—I am entitled to some property when I am twenty-one, and after we were married the prisoner used to ask me to get a loan on it, but I refused—about a month after we were married I found out that his wife was alive, and I asked him—he said that she was alive, but he had had a judicial separation, and I was legally his—I did not say anything to my friends regarding it, but continued to live with him—at the time he called on me in mourning I believed his wife was dead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at home when he first made my acquaintance—I afterwards took a situation at University Tavern, Tottenham Court Road—it was about two years ago, July, I think, that we went to Hastings—it was in summer-time, but I cannot say the month; it was soon after I knew him—it was in March this year that he said that he was no longer a married man—during the time I knew he was a married man, and since we went to Hastings, I continually went out with him, and slept with him at different places—I have not done so once or twice a week—I knew that he lived at Holloway with his wife, but was not certain of the address—I never went there—I was introduced to Mr. John Liddle about three weeks before the prisoner married me—that is he (<hi rend="italic">pointing kirn out</hi>)—he is, I believe, a fishmonger, in the Caledonian Road—I went with the prisoner when he called upon Liddle, before we were married, but I did not go to the house—I did not hear him say to Liddle that he and I were going through a mock ceremony the following Sunday—what they said was quite private, and not within my hearing—I did not hear Konter ask Liddle to take us for a drive afterwards—I heard nothing about a drive—I did not see Liddle again for two months—I believe the prisoner and I called on Mrs. Emma Maria Konter once, shortly before the marriage—her husband is a dairyman, of Talbot Road, Netting Hill—he did not say to her on that occasion that he had left his wife, nor did he say "The reason I have come to-night is to ask a favour of you"—he did not say "If Mill's aunt comes here and asks any questions about us you are to say my wife is dead"—my name is Milly, and my aunt, Mrs. Harris, lives near there—Mr. Router formerly served her with milk—I did not say "Oh do, Mrs. Konter, please say that," nor did Mr. Konter say that he had crammed her up with a tale one morning, and the old girl shed a tear or two, nor words to that effect—I do not remember Mrs. Konter inquiring if his wife gave him any furniture, nor did I say "No, she only gave him a feather bed, an old-fashioned looking-glass, and a cracked tea-pot;" it is false—I did not say "She is an old cat"—I do not know anything of the linen given to the prisoner by his wife.</p>

B. C.," and in consequence of that answer he made his will in my favour—I do not remember the nature of the question he asked; he did not write it at my request—I have not got the will now, and do not know who has it; it is mislaid.</p>

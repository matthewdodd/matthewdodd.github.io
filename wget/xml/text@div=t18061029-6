               <p>Q. That was merely suspicion. - A. Merely suspicion; at his father's house I found some articles to which I had given to him to do what we call bell carriages and cranks; the officer searched him in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290009"></xptr>my presence at the office. I saw some brass escutcheons taken from his breeches pocket, and a brass plate; he had them to work a day or two before. He said he was going to the lackerers, they were not in a state to be lackered, I told him he had no business to take them to the lackerers without my orders. He then said he was sorry he was going to take them home.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the escutcheons. - A. Yes, I have sworn to them. I have missed a variety of articles, and money out of the till; there is money in the indictment, but I do not wish to swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated that the prisoner said he was going to take them to be lackered. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which you told him he had no right to take them without your leave, his answer was, he was sorry for taking them without your leave, and he was going to take them home to your house; what is the value of the whole of the articles found on him. - A. The value would not exceed three pence or four pence.</p>
               <p>Court. Does your lackerer work in your premises. A. No, he lives of this side Tower hill; it is never our custom to send any thing to him without writing the name, and to be lackered.</p>

             sworn. Q. You are a police constable. - A. I am. I apprehended the prisoner on the 18th of this month in Worship street office. In his breeches pocket I found eight brass escutcheons, a piece of brass plate, and the key of a beer barrel; I asked him how he came by them, he said he was going to take them to be lackered, afterwards he said he was going to take them home, I went afterwards to the prisoner's apartment in company with Mason; in the prisoner's box, in his father in law's house, I found four small bags of gold and silver; the mother pointed out the box to me, the bags contained about seven pound in gold and silver; the the prisoner said that one bag containing two guineas, three half guineas, and three half crowns were his; the other bags he said he knew nothing about. I produce the articles in brass.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been living at 5, Glasshouse-street, White<lb></lb>chapel. On Thursday 14th Dec. I was in the Sir Sidney Smith public-house in Dock-street, in front of the bar, with a young man, a sailor—the prisoner came in with a jacket on his arm, and in a very improper manner asked the young man with me for relief—the words he used are not fit to express—I told him that was not the way to ask for relief, and if he asked properly I would not hinder the young man from giving him what he liked—he then offered his jacket for sale—the young man said he did not want to buy a jacket, and if he did he should not buy one of him, and told him to go about his business—he was told so more than a dozen times, but would not go—he called me a cow, a sow, and a mare, putting other dreadful words to it—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him, he struck me and knocked me down, and as I was trying to get up I caught hold of his arm and he struck me twice under the eye—I bled very much indeed—I could not judge with what instrument it was done—I felt him pull<lb></lb>ing it out of my eye—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there till the Saturday following.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a boarding-house, at 5, Glasshouse-street. On Thursday night, 14th Dec, I was in the Sir Sidney Smith—the prisoner came in, and offered a jacket for sale to a young man, one of my lodgers, who was with Connell—he said if he wanted a jacket he should not purchase one of him—the prisoner was repeatedly told to go away—some altercation took place between the prisoner and Connell, but I did not hear the words that were made use of—after he had used some expressions to her she pushed him towards the door, and he raised his hand and struck at her downwards—I was not aware at the time that the blow had taken effect on her eye—I afterwards saw it—his hand was closed when he struck her—she fell, and as I was in the act of picking her up, he struck her over my shoulder again in the eye—there were four or five foreigners standing there, and they very much illused the prisoner—I interfered to protect him, and he went out—after he was gone I heard that Connell had been stabbed with a knife or razor, and I saw the blood running, and went out after the prisoner, overtook him, and brought him part of the way back—he then made some resistance—I said, "You shall come back with me, and I will not leave you"—he then said, "Then here goes for life or death," and he made a hit at my head, but it fell on my breast, and it ripped my jacket open—I was not aware that he had anything in his hand, but when I got him to the house I found that my coat was torn—when I took him into the house he had something in his right hand—he was about to put it into the breast of his flannel-shirt, when I took it out of his hand; it was a razor; it was not open—I sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody—I believe he was the worse for liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon, at the London Hospital. The prosecutrix was brought there on Thursday, 14th Dec.—she had two stab wounds beneath the right eye, which penetrated to the bone—there was a great deal of inflammation of the eye and face on that side—she is suffering from the effects now—the blunt heel of the razor closed would produce such wounds, and if the wounds had been a trifle higher up the effect would have been very serious injury to the eye—it must have required considerable force to make the wounds; such a force as a downward blow would have.</p>

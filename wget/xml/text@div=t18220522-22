            . I set out about half-past ten o'clock in the morning with the prisoner, she had come and asked for the goods to be sent to her mistress, Mrs. Archer, No. 7, Thames-street; we went together to the house, the door was open, I went into the passage with her, the name was on the door - she said her mistress was confined, and I could not see her; she took them from me to shew her - I remained in the passage; we had told her the price of the things. In two or three minutes she came down and said she had left them with her mistress, that her master was in the room, and that she was going to fetch Mrs. Taylor to see the things, and would thank me to wait a few minutes - she then went out leaving me in the passage; she could put all the things about her person without appearing bulky; she said she was under nursery maid to Mrs. Archer. I waited two hours and a half, she did not return - I found that no lady lived there. I found her three weeks ago in a house in Webber-street, St. George's-fields, and gave her in charge.</p>

I was in company with the two prisoners from eight until between eleven and twelve. When I was coming home, I found the patrole before I got home. The prisoners had gone with me from my lodgings, in company with two more; they left me, and the other young woman in the public house, and went away at about eleven o'clock; they did not say where they were going to. On our return to my room, I found the door had been broken open; five pictures were missing, two mugs, and a brush.

The first I heard was a cry of watch, which proceeded from a comrade of mine. named Jones; I came up, and found the prisoners in custody of Jones; he said, they have broken open this room, and pointed to the room of the prosecutrix. The prisoner White, made his escape from me. Jones took care of the other whilst I went after him. I found him, and then took them both to the watchhouse, and gave them up to the care of the beadle. When I first came up to them, Jones had the pictures. The beadle searched Griffiths, and found the brush on him.</p>

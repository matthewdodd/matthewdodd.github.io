On Saturday, the 27th of January, he left the shop with a pair of boots in his hand - as he was leaving I saw something white in them: I followed and told him to come back, his mistress wanted to speak to him - he said, "I am not coming back any more;" he had said to me, in the middle of the day, that unless he was allowed an hour for his dinner he would leave - I asked if I should tell his master; he said No, if he wished to leave he would ask himself - he was walking, or rather running, and I took hold of his arm; he said, "You need not take hold of me, I have nothing in the boots;" I think I must have collared him - I had not had any quarrel with him; I did not detain him in the shop, as I was not certain what he had - he was at the door before I saw him, and when I came round the counter to go to the door he was walking away very quickly; when he said he had nothing in the boots he attempted to shake me off, and then I said, "You must come back, you are my prisoner:" when he came back I told my master I thought he had something in the boots, but I could not see what it was while I had hold of him, he struggled so violently it was with difficulty I held him; I saw my master take a pack of cards from his boots - he gave his address at No. 21, Westmoreland-place; this was about ten o'clock in the evening, the time he would be going home - I believe the officer has the pack of cards, but I did not examine them at that time; my master took them out of the boots, and put them on the counter by the side of the boots - the prisoner was taken to the station-house; he said, "They are a set of scoundrels, and the scoundrels put them into the boots."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe he was in a very great passion? A. No, he was not, nor was he quite cool; he appeared agitated; a person might have said what he did without being angry - I had not seen him cleaning his shoes in the course of the day, but I saw a pair of boots behind the counter, where we keep blacking-brushes, and other things; I judged they were the prisoner's - they were not mine, nor my master's, but my master's brother had died some time before; they were cleaned - I did not see any boots there after he was taken: I have no doubt that they were the same I took from the prisoner; the prisoner was before me at the door when I saw something in the boots; the counter was between us- I do not know why I did not call to him; he was near enough to hear me - I hesitated whether I should call my master or not; I did not call him back and say he had forgotten his shoes, but I had told him not to forget to take them - I had seen them in the middle of the day, and I asked him, "Are these your boots?" he said Yes - I said, "We are going to clean the place up to-morrow - if they are yours don't forget to take them home," and he said, "If I do you remind me of it;" I did not send him out to see what time it was - upon my oath I do not remember sending him out; I might have sent him, but I do not believe I did - I was in the habit of sending him to know the time, that I might know when to send him home- I did send him out that night, and he brought me word that it was half-past seven o'clock - we have no clock in the house; it was a custom to send him out to know the time - we do so always; my master's watch very seldom goes right - he sets it right but it will not do - the prisoner took up the boots in such a way that I could not fail to see the cards; I told all this story to the Magistrates - they let the prisoner go on bail; I have heard so since the prisoner was taken up - he and I had not had any altercation about my watching him, or pretending to watch him for two or three days; I did watch him, but he did not complain of it, and for what I know he did not know it; the prisoner signed a book before he went away, and he asked for his wages - I do not remember sending him out after he signed the book; Mrs. Carvalho was in the shop when he signed the book - I did not see him take the boots up at night; I was about two yards from him - he carried them openly in his hand; I think he could not have concealed this pack of cards. because my mistress was behind him, and I think she would have seen them - he could have put one boot on the other; my master was in the parlour with Dr. Ramsbottom - I did tell my mistress of it when I went out; he had crossed the street in a slanting direction when I took him - he was twenty or thirty yards off, near Mr. Caslon's letter-foundry; I swear he said he had nothing in the boots - he did not say "Nothing but my boots."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was he carrying the boots and cards? A. Openly in his hand - I did not see him take them up; he took them from under some paper, I judge, by the direction he took them in - his mistress was close behind him- the place he took them from then was at some distance from the ledge, where I had seen them in the middle of the day; he had taken his wages, and signed the book, as he did every Saturday night - there were no cards kept near the place where the boots were; I do not know who put the boots where I saw him take them from - I am sure I did not: when he was signing the book I said, "James, don't forget your boots," and he then took them - he could not have put them at that time in the place where I saw him take them from - I do not know who put them there; I did not know where they were when I said.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170041"></xptr>"Don't forget them;" the back of the counter had been cleared in the middle of the day, and I believe he did it; I went out directly Sabbath was up, and did not return till half-past nine o'clock - Yes, I forgot, I returned at seven to get some things I had ordered before - I did not send the prisoner to any particular place to know the time.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner about nine o'clock in the evening on Saturday, the 22nd of January; our Sabbath ceased at dusk, about six o'clock or half-past six, when we open shop - I think Cohen went out about six; I think he had not returned before nine - I do not recollect his returning; we have no clock in our shop- I do not recollect seeing the prisoner's boots that day -I had seen them a few days before; I was not aware, but by chance, that he had any boots in the house, and I asked Cohen if they were his - he said No, and I told him to ask the prisoner if they were his; I really forget whether my wife went out that evening, but she was at home about nine, because I was in the parlour when Dr. Ramsbottom came - I saw the prisoner about nine o'clock that night, stooping behind the counter - when I spoke to him he raised himself up, and put a pack of cards on the counter; I thought they had fallen down, and he had taken them up to put on the shelf - I saw the prisoner brought back, I think, after ten o'clock that evening; I had not sent him out to know what time it was that evening - I have a watch, and it goes, but it might not go right; I have sent him out repeatedly to see what time it was in the evening, to know if it was time to shut up; I do not know whether my watch went that evening - I was without a key for some time, but I think I had one at that time; my watch not going was probably owing to its not being wound up - when the prisoner was brought back he had a pair of half-boots in his hand, and a pack of cards in one of them; I presume he has pockets to his coat - it was stated at the Police-office that the officers had the greatest difficulty to get their hands into his pocket; there was a pack of cards in one of the boots, but I have no idea how they got there- one boot was not over the other - I saw something white in the boot, put my hand in, and found this pack of cards; I looked at them, and found my private-mark on them - my wife is not here; the prisoner had only been with me a fortnight - I had a good character with him, but when I applied again, for them to put it to writing, they refused; I should judge his friends are not respectable.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you keep the whole of the house? A. I do, Sir - it wants now twenty-five minutes to two o'clock, by my watch, which is a quarter of an hour too slow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did the prisoner say? A. He said,"I did not put the cards into the boots," and he said he would tell me all about it, alluding to some other things.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was Cohen present then? A. No, I had sent him for an officer - I told the Magistrate that, and, to the best of my belief, I told about the prisoner's placing a pack of cards on the counter; the Magistrate did say, when I was telling that to the clerk, "I did not understand your saying any thing about that," and I said,"Sir, you interrupted me;" I had not sent the prisoner out that night to see what time it was, nor did any one else to my knowledge - I did not see Cohen return; I had sent him out after my Sabbath, which ended about six o'clock, on business - he had not told me the business he had done, because I was engaged: I had asked Cohen about a pair of boots, and told him to ask the prisoner if they were his - there is no other man living in the house; the last one who lived there was a Mr. Emmings, which is about six months ago; no other man has lived there but a Mr. Evans for two years, and no other man but those two have lived there for three years - my brother might have lived there two years ago, but he is dead now; he did not die in my house - his wearing apparel was not in my house; I did not take his old boots and shoes into my house - Cohen did not tell me he thought these might be my brother's old boots; he said they were not his, and I desired him to ask the prisoner if they were his - I had sent Cohen out to take home an order; Cohen slept under the counter, near where I saw the boots - Cohen told me the prisoner's boots were left in front of the shop, and that he took them up in his presence; he pointed out the spot, about a yard and a half from the door, on the floor in the passage, through which the prisoner would go, rather on one side - any one going into the shop would of course have passed them; I do not recollect that he showed me the place at the moment, but he did afterwards - there were some reams of paper, and books on the floor near the place; I heard that the prisoner said the scoundrels themselves had put the cards there, but I was not there then -I cannot say that the prisoner ever threatened me with an action for a conspiracy, but he said, "Well, as this is the case, I will see if one swears different to the other, and if they do, I will have them taken;" the prisoner did not say to me he would have me indicted for a conspiracy, nor did he in my presence - I did not say that if it were not for his insolence I would not prosecute him; I said if any respectable person would come forward, and say he was respectable, I would not prosecute - I heard from Cohen, that he had sent the prisoner out that night after the shop was shut, to see what time it was.</p>

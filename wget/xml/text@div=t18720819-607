                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, of 14, Store Street, Shepherd's Bush—on the morning of 26th June, from circumstances which were called to my attention, I searched my house—I missed a large quantity of property, a great coat, a diamond ring, and other goods, and almost every room in the house was in a state of great confusion—I had fastened the back window of the dining-room at 8.30 the night before, and I saw it safe at 12.30—every<lb></lb>thing was safe when I went to bed—on the morning of the 26th I found the dining-room window eighteen inches open, and away from the window in the garden there were footmarks—I have seen a coat which was found under one of the beds; it is not mine—a shirt and a piece of wire were also found in the kitchen, which did not belong to me—I handed them over to the police—a coat has been shown me by the police which I identify as mine; this is it—the back of a locket was also shown to me, which I can identify as having been stolen from me.</p>

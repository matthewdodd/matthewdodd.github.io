                  </hi>. I am a leather salesman, of Willow-walk, in the parish of Bermondsey. On 31st Oct. I went to bed, but did not see to the fastenings myself—I came down next morning, about a quarter to 6 o'clock, and found the bottom sash of the kitchen window open sixteen or eighteen inches, and the washhouse door wide open—I examined the window, a pen knife had been passed between the sashes, and the bolt pushed back—both the frames had marks on them—I missed a pair of boots of mine from the kitchen, where I had left them the night before—I looked at my watch when I came down, and will swear it was before 6 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness. On the evening of 31st Oct., before going to bed, I fastened the kitchen window with a catch—there was a carpet bag in the kitchen, containing three shirts, three collars, a shirt front, and a pair of stockings—I missed it the next morning—these are the things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know this shirt front, because one of the strings was sewn on with drab cotton, just before I put it into the bag—this collar is my brother's, and was in the bag—there is no mark on it, but I know it by its general appearance, the material, pattern, and the way in which it was sewn—I did not make it, but I know who did—my brother has others of the same description—I do not distinctly swear to it, because hundreds might be just like it—I also missed the carpet bag and a concertina, which was on a chair in the kitchen the night before—there was a <hi rend="italic">jagging</hi> on the window catch, and the side of the sash was split—the back door was secure when I went to bed, shortly after 11 o'clock—these things are worth 12<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was the last person up—it is a sash window, and I urn quite sure that it was catched.</p>

On 2nd Nov., from information I received, I went to Maidstone Gaol, where the prisoner had been committed on Nov. 1st, but not on this charge—I examined him in the cell, and found this shirt front and collar on him—I asked him to take them off, and he did so—I said I should take possession of them, because I believed them to be part of the property stolen from a house in Willow-walk, Bermondsey, broken open on the 31st, and that I suspected him of doing it—he said, "I have had this shirt front four months"—I had a pattern collar which I held to this, and said, "I do not think you have had this four months"—he said, "I have had the shirt front more than four months, but I have not had the shirt collar so long—this handkerchief is of the same pattern; he had a bird in it at the police court.</p>

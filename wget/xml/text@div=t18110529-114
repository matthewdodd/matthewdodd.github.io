               <p>Mr. Newton. After being informed by my servant that there were some hairs in the hole I went and saw two bundles; I went a second time and found a third bundle, Mr. Cook kept the prisoner in conversation when he was going out, and after I found they were all gone; I turned to the prisoner and ordered him into the back shop, I desired Mr. Cook to search him; Mr. Cook did, and said he had three bundles about him.</p>

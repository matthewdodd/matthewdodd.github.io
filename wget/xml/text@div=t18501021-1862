                  </hi>. I live in Northampton-row, Clerkenwell, and am a gold-beater. On Saturday evening, 19th Oct., I was out between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—I met the prisoner Croughan by the House of Correction wall—we had something to drink on the opposite side of the way—I took her to two public-houses—I had a silver watch in my right-hand waistcoat pocket, a chain, and a gold seal, a gold-book in my pocket, and a shilling—we went to Snow-hill; I saw Hart there—we had a pot of beer between me, Hart, Croughan, and another young woman—I left the house with Croughan, and a woman followed us, who I believe was Hart—I went to an alley in Field-lane, and went up-stairs into a room with Croughan—I had not been in the room many minutes before some one said, <hi rend="italic">"Down;"</hi> the candle was put out, and I was seized round the throat by a man, as I suppose, from the force I was held by—Croughan, Hart, and another woman were in the room—I fell on the floor, and felt my watch going, but I was choked and could not speak—the person who kept me down, released my throat—I was in the dark—I scrambled down into the back-yard—I found a bit of a shutter, and hammered away at it—some man inside said, "What are you making that noise for?"—he opened his door and let me into a yard, the end of which was Field-lane—I placed my back against a shop and said, "I have been robbed of my watch"—I searched my pocket, and my piece of gold-book, watch, chain, seal, key, and shilling were gone—I shortly afterwards saw a policeman—I described Croughan to him, and he went and fetched her—I identified her, and I went home—between two and three o'clock the policeman knocked me up and brought Hart—I identified her, and went to the station and gave her in charge.</p>

On Saturday week, about twelve o'clock at night, I saw Broomfield in Field-lane, and from what he told me I went in pursuit of Croughan—I met her about half-past twelve—I told her I wanted her on suspicion of robbing a man of his watch—I described the man to her—she said she had been with the man, but knew nothing about his watch—I took her to the station—she was searched, and on her was found this little book—I took Hart at two in the morning—Broomfield described her to me, and showed me the front room first-floor—I have known Hart to live there for the last nine months—I said I wanted her, on suspicion of</p>

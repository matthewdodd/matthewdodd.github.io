I am manager of the printing and advertising depart<lb></lb>ment of Cook &amp; Son, Ludgate Circus—the prisoner came into their employ about two months' ago as collector of advertisments for their Continental guide—it was his duty to collect advertisements and obtain written orders from the persons who gave them, and deliver them to me—I then paid him 25 per cent, commission on the amount—on 5th May he brought this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and I gave an order for him to receive his commission—on 19th May he brought this other order and this other on 26th May—our sus<lb></lb>picions were then aroused.

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. On the 17th of Nov. I saw the prisoner and another person, about two o'clock in the day, in Sutton-street, Clerken well—the prisoner had under his arm these twenty-seven yards of linen, wrapped in paper, in this bag, and the bag wrapped up in this black apron—I knew him and his companion—they tried to escape, and the other got away—I followed the prisoner and took him—I asked what he had got, he said some linen which he had fetched from the warehouse for his master, whose name was Noon, or Newland, and who lived in Old-street—I said, "Tell me the number"—he said, "No, he does not live there, he lives at Hoxton"—I took him to the station, and said, if he would tell me the truth, I would make inquiries, and not detain him—he said, "I see yon mean to detain me; I shall say no more."</p>

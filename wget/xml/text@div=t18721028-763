                  </hi>. I am a Parliamentary agent, carrying on business in Westminster—I know the bankrupt, James Abraham Fox—this is his signa<lb></lb>ture to this agreement. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1866, <hi rend="italic">by which the Witness agreed to let and Fox to take a meadow in New Road, Wandswarth Road, Comprising </hi>7<hi rend="italic"> acres, then in his occupation, for seven years from</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">th December, Determinable by either party by six months' notice, at an annual rental of</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">payable half-yearly.</hi>) I received one half-year's rent under that agree<lb></lb>ment—it was not received by myself; I received it from a clerk of mine, named Laurence—he is at my office now—I did not receive any other money during the time Fox was tenant; not in the name of rent for that land—of course I received other money, but not in the name of rent for that land—I never had any rent for the land except what I received from my clerk Laurence—where that came from I don't know—I subsequently sued Fox for the rent through my solicitor, Mr. Rutter—I subsequently petitioned the Bankruptcy Court to adjudge Fox a bankrupt upon a debt due to me—I was the petitioning creditor.</p>

I have been served with a subpoena and notice to produce my title to this land—I have no documents here relating to it; my solicitor has the whole of my practice now—Mr. Rutter is my solicitor; he has had all the papers relating to this matter—under advice I do not produce any deeds relating to this land—I have not any—Mr. Rutter holds as my attorney, bus I am told that I am not bound to Produce anything at all relating to title—I decline to answer whether I have any deeds here relating to this land—I don't like to charge my memory accurately as to when I first became possessed of this land, but I think it must have been in '66 or '65—I received possession from a person of the name of Graham—I can't give you his address; he is in America—I gave him a sum of money—I purchased from him what interest he had in the land—I believe he was not the freeholder—I did not know at the time whether he was or was not—I paid him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I won't be quite sure about the date; I can give it you if you wish to see it particularly; but it must have been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187210280066"></xptr>
               <p>'66 or '65—I have a paper here showing that I paid him the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this land—as I have said before, I have no personal objection to produce it, but I am told I am not bound to produce it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) this will give me the date perhaps, it was earlier than I thought, it is 12th September, '64, I should not have thought it was before '65—I then purchased from Graham the interest he had in that piece of land—I had no other interest than I purchased from Graham—that was the only piece of paper that passed between me and Graham in respect of the purchase of this land—it is not in the nature of a conveyance at all; it is a receipt—I should tell you that Mr. Graham was at that time on the eve of leaving England; I think he went away the next day; I had no time to get any other document—that is the only interest I had in this land, for which I paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Fox was not in possession at that time—I went on the land long before Fox was there—he certainly was not on the land at that very time; it was Simmonds I think, he was a grazier I believe—it was a meadow at that time used by Simmonds as grazing ground, and Simmonds paid me rent—at the time I got possession of the land he was paying to Graham, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for the land—I knew that from Simmonds and from Graham both, and he continued to pay me that sum, and I let Fox in possession on the same terms—I let Fox in possession of the land—I don't mean to say that I actually went on the land and put him in in that sense—this is the only document I have respecting the land, "To John Charles Rees, Esq. In consideration of the sum of fifty pounds paid by you to me for the assignment of all my interest in the premises let by me to James Morphew, dated 12th September, 1864, I do hereby undertake to hold you harmless, and to indemnify you for any claim on the said premises"—the reference to this land is "the premises let by me to James Morphew," that is let by Graham—a man named Simmonds was in possession; I believe it was in this way, Morphew was Graham's tenant, and Simmonds took from Morphew; I believe it was Simmonds, I won't be quite sure about the name, it was somebody who was under Morphew—I did not mention Morphew's name to you before, because Simmonds was in possession of the land, and you asked me who was in possession—I did not give Simmonds notice to quit, he left without notice to quit—Fox was substituted as his tenant—I did not let Fox into possession; I believe Simmonds did—I said just now that I did not do so physically, but in the sense in which I entered into an agreement—I do not draw a distinction between the natural and the non-natural sense, but I drew a distinction at the time; I did not let him into the physical possession of the ground; he had possession under the agreement from me—I believe Fox was let into possession by Simmonds; I believe he held first under Simmonds before he held direct from me—I do not know when Simmonds gave up possession to Fox; I fancy it was shortly before the date of the agreement that Fox had with me—I did not go to Fox and represent that I was the freeholder; certainly not—I did not represent to him that I had a better title to the land than he had—I made no representation to him on the subject at all—Fox came to me; I believe Simmonds and Fox came together, and I agreed to accept Fox as tenant in place of Simmonds, that was the simple transaction, or the person I call Simmonds, I won't be quite sure that is the name; it is seven or eight years ago, and I cannot charge my memory; I believe the name was Sim<lb></lb>monds—I think Simmonds' name is mentioned in the agreement; I think you will find it in a memorandum at the foot that there is something about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187210280067"></xptr>
               <p>Simmonds, if that is the right name—I am not aware that an agreement would be void by parol if it was more than three years; a lease is void, I believe, if not for three years—I don't know that that is void I really have not considered the question whether it is or not; I will not give an opinion upon it; more shame to me if it be, for I believe I drew it—it does not purport to create a term of years; it is a yearly tenancy for seven years, I think—I am not aware that it is necessary to have an agreement under seal—this does not create a term of seven years; it is an agreement to let—I cannot see that there is anything illegal in that—I was a witness on Fox's trial at Guildford, he was indicted there for perjury—I believe he was acquitted—I was not present at the acquittal; I believe he was acquitted by direction of the Judge—perhaps you will allow me to add that I was ordered by the Judge of the County Court to prosecute him for perjury—previously to this transaction of letting the land to him I had no acquaintance with Fox—I said then that I could not prove that I had received any rent from him, nor can I now—I am not in a position to give legal proof of it, I believe—I should say that when I sued Fox for the rent, I gave credit for the half year's rent—I was sent for and bound over by the County Court Judge to prosecute Fox very much against my will—I was not present when the Judge made the order.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. I am generally aware that one of the assignments of perjury against Fox was with reference to the tenancy of this land, but I had never seen the indictment—I was called as a witness to prove that Fox had paid me rent—I never heard Fox state that he had never paid me any rent—I believe he did, but I never heard him say so—I did not go to Guildford for the purpose of proving that he had paid me rent; I was called as a witness, and I answered such questions as were put to me, as I have to-day—I gave the evidence that I have given here to-day, that I never received any myself—I have not brought my clerk here—I have recollected since how the rent was paid—I can't say whether there I was an assignment of perjury as to Elsey's debt; I really don't know I was only the nominal prosecutor—I brought an action against Fox in the County Court for his rent—I was asked to produce my title-deeds, or explain how I became possessed of the land—I was advised that Fox was not in a position, having accepted tenancy under me, to dispute my title, and I declined to answer or to produce any deeds—I have persistently done so up to to-day—the paper that I have produced, and which has been read, is the only document that I have showing that I derive my title from Graham, and for that I gave about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I have not the remotest notion of the value of these seven acres—I am not in possession of them now; they are not my property now; they have passed from me to the London, Chatham, and Dover Company—I made an arrangement with them, and gave them up possession—they stated that I was quite right in the contention—I have not received any money—I did not make them a present of the land; I gave them possession of it without requiring them to give me notice to quit, upon certain grounds—they did not repay me the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wish you to know all about it, as far as I am concerned—I have satisfied myself of that which I was totally ignorant of before, that the London, Chatham, and Dover Company bought that land, and are entitled to it, and had a conveyance of it years and years before, long before I had anything to do with it; upon being satisfied that that was so, as soon as I ascertained it, I said "I am very willing that you should have possession; I am satisfied the land belongs to you, the freehold;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187210280068"></xptr>
               <p>I am perfectly well in possession as tenant," which they admitted; they were old clients of mine, and I said "You shall have possession at once, and Mr. Forbes, the General Manager, shall say what you ought to do, as far as I am concerned, under the circumstances;" that is exactly how it stands—Mr. Forbes has not yet settled what is to be done between us—he is my friend also—I was undoubtedly against Fox—this piece of land was not originally waste land, occupied by anybody—to the best of my knowledge and belief it never was—I don't know where Simmonds is—I don't know that he has gone to America—I don't know how long he was in possession; I found him in possession—I paid the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Graham without calling upon him for any evidence of his title—he told me the circumstances under which the land was in his possession—he was a connexion of mine—he was going out to America, and I said "Very well, if you like to leave the land in my possession there is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for you"—Fox was not then in possession; it was Simmonds or Morphew, I won't say which—allow me to add that I took very great pains to ascertain to whom the freehold of the land belonged; no rent had been paid for it for some years, and I could not, at that time, ascertain who the freeholder was—afterwards the London, Chatham, and Dover Company came to me, and satisfied me that they had the best right to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the agreement between Graham and Morphew—I know Graham's handwriting—this is his writing—this agree<lb></lb>ment was deposited with me at the time I gave the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is dated 7th September, 1864, the date referred to in the memorandum—these two documents are my title to whatever interest I have in the land—I took whatever interest Graham had—I never pretended to be the freeholder, and never was.</p>

               <p>was the managing man who then appeared on the scene—I was not aware that he was managing clerk to the solicitors of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway until quite recently—he acted as managing clerk to the petitioning creditor, Mr. Rees; he did not appear for the Company—here is the order of 13th February, 1872, also one of 27th October, 1871—I can't say whether some of the debts were expunged owing to the fact that Fox had previously been a bankrupt, that that bankruptcy was re<lb></lb>opened, and that these were proofs under the old bankruptcy; I was not in Court at the time the matter came before the Judge, Mr. Stonor; I don't know the fact—I think there was some subsequent proof of some other creditor whilst these proceedings were pending—the old bankruptcy did not come up for a long time afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. No doubt Elsey was examined, or his debt would not have been expunged—I was at Guildford; I heard Elsey examined there; I heard the Judge make a remark in reference to Elsey—I think Swinford was examined at Guildford—Patteson's debt was ex<lb></lb>punged, I can't say that it was on account of his non-appearance, having left the country; I don't think I was in Court at the time—the Judge made the order, and I drew it up—if a creditor does not appear in support of his claim of course it would be expunged—I don't recollect Patteson's case at all—England's was expunged and then restored, but afterwards expunged, I believe, on account of his bankruptcy, and his assignees would be the proper creditors—there are one or two affidavits of Mrs. Fox on the file—I think an I O U for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was produced on the trial of Fox; I did not see it; there was some document handed up—I think I heard Elsey say it was his handwriting.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After the meeting of 10th November, when the proofs ere given in, there was an inquiry ordered which came on about 6th or 10th February upon an application to remove—that was heard before Mr. Stonor—I think that inquiry embraced the validity of the debts of Deacon, Elsey, and Harvey, but the application will speak for itself, it is on the files of the Court—I was not present when Mr. Stonor was examining witnesses; I had to attend to other business—I do not know the ground of Mr. Stonor's judgment; all I know is that certain debts were ordered to be expunged, the particulars of which I have given; that was after hearing proofs on both sides—I was subpoenaed by the attorney for the prosecution to bring all documents—these are the shorthand writers' notes of the witnesses who were examined before Mr. Stonor; Mr. Stonor would not hear the case with<lb></lb>out having a shorthand writer to take down the evidence—there is no account of any meeting of creditors on 3rd January, held in Sloane Street—there was an application to remove the trustee, Mr. Harvey; that appli<lb></lb>cation came before me, and in the interval, between the application and the hearing, the trustee directed a meeting of creditors—I adjourned the hearing of the case before the Judge, and expressed my opinion that it was a very improper proceeding for a trustee to take—I saw Mr. Harvey on the subject, and told him it was most improper for him to summon a meet<lb></lb>ing of creditors as trustee, when there was an application that he had know<lb></lb>ledge of to remove him from being trustee for fraud—he made no remark—about twelve creditors subsequently proved besides these ten, they have been dropping in at different times, all for small proofs, the highest 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they were all put in before the order to prosecute.</p>

Hayward, Keele, &amp; Swan, of 5, Frederick's Place, Old Jewry—Mr. Keele, one of the firm, is attorney for the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company, he has the management of the land department of the Company—I was there five years and eight months—I am sorry to say that almost from first to last I have had the management of this prosecution, it has lasted a long time—there was a prosecution at Guildford, there were other persons before the Magistrate, and this prosecution now—during that time I was managing clerk to the firm—this prosecution is not promoted by the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company; the proceedings in bankruptcy were, in conjunction with Mr. Rees, the under tenant, so to speak; he appears to be the under tenant of Mr. Graham—Mr. Rutter is the attorney for Mr. Rees—inferentially I hare acted with him, and as<lb></lb>sisted him in this prosecution by permission of Messrs, Hayward, Keele, &amp; Swan, because from the first it was left entirely to me to exercise my dis<lb></lb>cretion as to what proceedings should be taken, with a view to obtain and secure the possession of this land—the body of Deacon's proof it in Mr. Harvey's handwriting, and the jurat in Mr. Condy's, and the same as to Elsey's—I was present at the County Court, Whet Deacon and Elsey, were examined as to their proof and when they Were ordered to be ex<lb></lb>punged—I remember Andrews being examined on two days, the 6th and 15th February—his proof was afterwards expunged by the Judge as fraudulent—I spoke to him on the subject of his proof several times—on 4th January he told me, after some considerable discussion on the matter, that Fox, the bankrupt, only owed him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was d—sorry that he had anything to do with the vagabond—this is Andrews' proof.

To Mr. Miller, Solicitor. Dear Sir, Mr. Hughes having left our office, we beg to return the enclosed subpoena, Hayward, Keele, &amp; Swan")—I thought there was something very denunciatory in it, according to your introduction—I first came on the scene with reference to this matter of Fox and the land, early in October, 1871—I had seen Fox once previously, I think I served him with a writ of ejectment in July, 1871, at the suit of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway—I had not pre<lb></lb>viously had a communication with Mr. Rees on the subject of this land; I believe Mr. Keele had—we did not go on with the action because we were too late for the then Surrey Assiees; it has never been determined to this day—I should have gone on with it if I had had my instructions in time, but I was just a day too late—I was not at the Wandsworth County Court when Fox was adjudicated a bankrupt; I was in the country—I knew of the proceedings—I advised them, in order, if possible, to obtain an adju<lb></lb>dication in bankruptcy against him; my employers called upon me to give my assistance, and I was bound to do it, I gave them the best of my advice, as I was bound to do; I could not refuse the service they appointed to me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187210280072"></xptr>
               <p>—I attended at the Wandsworth County Court on all the occasions after the first meeting for proofs—Mr. Rutter appeared, and took the active part in promoting the proceedings in bankruptcy—previous to their initiation, I was only once in communication with Mr. Rutter at my employers' office—I was present when an application was made to the County Court Judge to insti<lb></lb>tute a prosecution against certain parties, including Mr. Condy; that appli<lb></lb>cation, as far as Mr. Condy was concerned, was refused by the Judge, and he gave his reason for it—I was at Guildford, but not examined—Fox was prosecuted there for perjury and subornation—he was acquitted—the County Court Judge ordered that prosecution; Mr. Rees was the prosecu<lb></lb>tor, he was put under recognisances to prosecute by the Judge—I am the prosecutor of this indictment for conspiracy to-day—at the time I instituted this prosecution against Mr. Condy I was clerk to Messrs. Hayward &amp; Co., the solicitors to the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway; I was not acting under their instructions, I did it upon my own impulse; put it on the love of justice if you please; I did not like to see great rascals escape; I am not bearing the expense of this prosecution, I have been called on for nothing yet—I don't know who has found the funds up to the present time; that is a question that should be addressed to the solicitor for the prosecution, my mind is a blank on the subject—it has not always been a blank, we have had so many of these proceedings that I am surprised that I have any mind left at all; so many proceedings were initiated together that a necessary complication arises—I take it for granted Mr. Rutter has found the money—I, of course, have paid certain expenses—I have not been called upon to pay professional fees, a bill of costs, or anything of that sort—I know Mrs. Fox very well, I have only known her since these bankruptcy proceedings—I have been contributing 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to her support since the date of her husband's committal for trial, by direction of Mr. Rutter and Mr. Keele; they find the money—I suggested to them that this woman ought not to be allowed to starve—they find the money, and pay it through my hands; I have paid it to her personally, taking her receipt every week—I have paid it at various places, generally at my house; I have generally left it out for her to call, and the receipt to be signed; sometimes my wife has paid her, and sometimes my servant—I have seen her very frequently since her husband's committal, sometimes at my own house, never at other people's houses—I have seen her in public-houses, never alone; I have been very careful all through; it is very dangerous to be with another man's wife anywhere—I have not been paying money to any one else, only the witnesses; I have paid Mr. Elsey some, I have given him a subpoena, Mr. Deacon, I have paid him, Mr. Swinford, and other witnesses whose names I can give you, many witnesses; I never gave them anything only with the subpoena—I have stated that I took care not to give them too much for fear it should be suggested that I had bribed them—you don't know the company I have been in—I was in the employment of the Poor Law Board—I have not seen Mr. Glenn here to day, you mean a member of the Bar, and one of the officers of the Board—he was a fellow-clerk of mine for years, I see he is sitting behind you, I have not seen him for ten years—I was in the legal department of the Poor Law Board about twenty years—I was called on to resign—this is not my first appearance in the witness-box—you have not the honour of speak-to an ex-judge, that is a delusion of the other side; I know what is coming—the cause of my resigning at the Poor Law Board was this, I was fined 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Sir Thomas Henry, myself and another, for being the registered</p>

I have seen Mrs. Fox here to-day—I took her down to Guildford; she wanted to see her husband—I did not tell her that she was to be a witness; I believe she had a subposna, I don't know for what purpose; of course Mr. Butter and I knew she could not be a witness; she made an appeal <hi rend="italic">ad miserecordiam</hi> to me take her down to see her husband, and I thought it was only fair that she should see him—she had seen him in Horsemonger Lane Gaol—she stayed at the same hotel at Guildford; I was never alone with her there; I was never with her alone in my life—I think we were there four days; I paid her expenses, in addi<lb></lb>tion to the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I think she has made from first to last three or four affidavits in this case for her husband and for the present defendants—I believe she made one on 13th February—I was at home ill at the time she quarrelled with her husband in April, 1872—I did not know anything of it till some fortnight after it took place—up to that time I believe she had been on her husband's side; she was not on my side—I had nothing whatever to do with her turning—her husband was committed on 2nd July from the Wandsworth Court, and I think it was on 9th July I began to allow her the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I had made her no allowance from April to July—she made affidavits for Mr. Butter, but I was at home ill, and could not be supposed to know what was going on—it is not a fact that she handed</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. I think I became acquainted with An<lb></lb>drews in November, 1871—the adjudication had taken place on 27th Octo<lb></lb>ber, and the first meeting was on 10th November; I had nothing to do with those—I first went to him—I was then acting as managing clerk to my late firm, and conducting the inquiry into the validity of the proofs; it was in pur<lb></lb>suance of that office that I called on Andrews—I had never seen him before—I then saw him at his house in Arthur Road, Brixton—I saw him several times afterwards, at the Windmill public-house, Lower Kennington Lane; that was his rendezvous, and I used to find him there at various hours in the evening; sometimes at 6 o'clock, sometimes 8 o'clock, and on one occasion I did not find him till about 11.30—the communications he made to me were not over our glass; I think we had finished our glass—on 4th January he told me; that was not the evening when I found him at 11.30, that was about 7.30 I think, a summer's evening—there were no other persons present on that occasion; I found him in front of the bar; there were no other persons where we were—the bar is divided into three bulk head compartments, and he and I were in one compartment together—there were other persons in the other compartments at a distance—I have also met him at his house, but never only on this business; I have been there once, twice, or three times—I did not see him on each occasion, only on one; he was alone then, in his front parlour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Fox was acquitted on the charge of perjury, but stands remanded till the next assizes on four indictments—he has not been out on bail; I offered to let him out on easy bail if he could get it—the reason I was called on to resign my office at the Poor Law Board was this, I was fined for an offence against the Refreshment Houses Act, the Act was then new; I was one of the joint lessees of a place in which this took place, and the proceedings were taken against me; of course I could not deny it, I was in the country at the time, and I paid the penalty—I was not called upon to resign; I resigned rather than have any inquiry into the matter; it 'was a matter that I could not congratulate myself upon; it was on account of the fine that I resigned; I did not think the Board should suffer any annoyance through it—a summons was taken out against me for detaining some books, papers, moneys, and so on, belonging to the society of which I was secretary, and the oldest member; it was called the Borough of Southwark Fifty Pound Provident Society—the summons was heard before Mr. Burcham and extended. over four months—the re<lb></lb>sult was that Mr. Burcham suggested that it should be referred—I said rather than protract the proceedings any longer, I would make the payment without prejudice, to the society of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,; they were satisfied with that—Mr. Burcham said it was a very handsome offer, and that my accounts were most correct—that was the close of the transaction between me and the society; they found out afterwards that they owed me money—there is no truth in the suggestion that I have been guilty of any im<lb></lb>propriety with Mrs. Fox—in what I have done with reference to her I had the sanction of my employers previously obtained—the allowance of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week has gone on from July to now—I had not the slightest personal know<lb></lb>ledge of the quarrel with her husband; I was quite surprised to hear it—I had never known Mrs. Fox before this matter, or Mr. Fox.</p>

               <p>I don't know whether he is to be a witness or not—I suggested that he should be brought here—I have been in communication with him during the time he has been in gaol—he has written several letters to me, asking me to get him out on bail; I promised to do so—I did not do so, he put it out of my power—he wrote to me certain statements that he was going to make as a witness, but before the Grand Jury he adhered to all his old former statements—I told him before, as the Magistrate told him that I would not believe him if he was to swear upon a stack of Bibles—I did not call him as a witness before the Grand Jury; I told the Grand Jury that I must call him, I suppose, because his name was on the back of the indictment—I put his name on the back of the bill, because I was bound to do so—I did not think him a favourable witness at that time; I was bound to put his name there, because his wife had made a certain statement to me; I relied on the statement she made—I did not believe anything of him—I put his name on the bill because he Would have an opportunity then of doing what the Judge of the County Court advised him, making a clean breast of the whole matter; that was not to retract what he had first stated and swore to; I did not know what he was going to say at all—I knew what he had sworn, and I was present when the Judge gave him the advice to put himself into my hands and make a clean breast of it—I thought he would make a clean breast of it, but I did not care whether he did or not—the Grand Jury examined him shortly, and would not hear any more; he did not say half-a-dozen words.</p>

I have not been particularly acquainted with Fox, but I have known him several years—I had not transacted busi<lb></lb>ness with him very long prior to his giving me the I O U, only a few weeks, that is all—I had never had any transaction with him before; I received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of what I had done, so it was not long—I don't know what day of the month it was now; it was at the time he gave me the I O U—it is true that he gave me the I O U in consequence of what I had collected, and what I was to collect—he paid me the I O U for past services, and services that were to come, to the amount of the 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote out the I O U my<lb></lb>self at his request, he could not write I suppose—my debt of 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was expunged, and I was put down as a creditor for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the Judge; I explained to the Judge, as I have done here to-day, that the I O U was given to me for past as well as future services—Fox and I never had any dispute about the amount—I don't know what Fox swore; I was at Guildford—the I O U was put into my hands, and I admitted that it was all in my handwriting, except the date and Fox's signature—I don't know whether the Judge stopped the case against Fox or not; I don't remember what he said—he did not tell me that he could not ask the Jury to convict even a cat upon my evidence; he never made use of those words, or I should have heard it, and I don't think he did, nor anything like it—I don't know what he said to the Jury about me, I swear that; I only attended one meeting, that was the first, at which Mr. Harvey was elected trustee—I received two or three letters from Mr. Harvey to attend, but I never attended, and never took any interest in the affair—I don't know what they put me down as a creditor for—when I put my signature it was in blank and part print; the amount was in blank—I signed this paper of course for one of the Com<lb></lb>mittee of Inspection; the signature is mine; they are not my figures, I swear that; at the time I signed it the figures were not there, I swear that; I ought not to have put my signature to this of course—I never sent in any amount, for I was not in possession of the I O U—it was given to me by Harvey—I can't tell the day that Fox gave it to me, but whoever received the I O U when I gave it bock put a date to it—Fox gave it into my own hands, I kept it for some short time, and returned it to him again as useless—when he became bankrupt I did not send in my claim for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I never put it down—I deny the 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I acknowledge to the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never admitted the figures on the I O U to be mine.</p>

               <p>door;" of course he must have heard it—then Harvey gave the notes to my husband, and said, "You can now swear that you have received money for the bill," and he said, "Give them to your wife first, then she can say that she has"—that ceremony was gone through and I put them on the desk, and he picked them up and put them in his pocket again—Fox said "Of course Mr. Condy knows all about it," and Harvey said, "Oh, yes, that is all right"—there were two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes the first time, that was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the first money—on Monday, the 13th, we went again and met Mr. Harvey and Mr. Condy there—Harvey said "I must go and borrow some money"—he went out again and borrowed some money, and came back in a few minutes with three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, that was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—Oh, I think I have made a mistake, I think it was three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes the first time, that would be 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—when Harvey gave Mr. Fox the three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, he said, "Give it to your wife, and if any one asks you what you have done with it, say you have given it to your wife, and she is an extravagant woman, and spent it in clothes"—Mr. Condy was not present in the office then—Harvey said, "You must give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back"—Fox said "I have not got 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and he said, "Well, I will give you the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and you can give it to me back," and he gave him two half-crowns and he gave it him back—the money was all given back to Mr. Harvey—that all passed in my presence—Mr. Condy was not present in the back office, he was in the front office, and when we came out of the back office Mr. Condy said, "Have you settled it?"—my husband said "Yes, and it is all right"—Mr. Condy and Harvey came out of the office, and me and my husband went away—I believe they went to a public-house below—nothing was said between Condy and Harvey, that I know of, as to the money having been borrowed—I did not hear anything of it—Harvey said he would have to borrow the money; he said that to Mr. Fox and Mr. Condy, in the front office, that was in the presence of Condy—I remember an inquiry made before the Judge at the County Court—in March afterwards I was at 71, Sloane Street with my husband, when I saw Mr. Condy, Harvey, and Harvey's son—Harvey gave my husband a piece of paper so as he should remember; that was after the first examination, I think—I can't say whether it was in March, it was after the first examination; it was in March—Mr. Harvey was very angry with Mr. Fox because he made a mistake about the money—I can't exactly say the words he said, but he was very angry with him, and told him he was a fool to take and make such a mistake—he made a mistake in the dates of the bill that Mr. Harvey told him to say when he had the bill; for having made a mistake in the date, in the evidence he had given before Mr. Stonor—Harvey wrote an affidavit, and my husband had to sign it, and he gave him a piece of paper to keep in his pocket, and he said, "Read it night and day, and don't forget when you go there again to remember the date."—there was an affidavit made at that time about making a mistake, at that very place, and Harvey wrote on a paper, and said, "Keep that, read it over day and night, and then you won't forget about the date, perhaps"—Condy was there at this interview—I don't remember a person named Carroll coming to the office; I never saw him at Mr. Condy's office—I have only seen Carroll with Condy and Harvey since this case has been on, about here and at the Police Court; I have seen them once or twice together—he was at the County Court on the day of the first examination, but he came in just after it was over—he wanted to make an affidavit or something about a debt Mr. Fox owed another gentleman, and</p>

               <p>he said, "You are too late, you should have been here before," that was on 10th November—I never saw Carroll after that, at any time, at Mr. Condy's—some papers were written out for me by Mr. Condy and Mr. Harvey when I nave gone there to swear affidavits about things; they read them down to me and asked me to sign them—I did so under the juris<lb></lb>diction of my husband, or else I was knocked about if I did not—my husband was present at the time; he wished me to sign them—I signed two papers—I was asked to sign others and I would not—I heard Mr. Harvey and Mr. Condy both tell Mr. Fox that he must say that he left Deacon in the fields (that is Battersea fields), and they must say that he came to the office, or some man like him, to swear his affidavit—I believe there was an affidavit made to that effect—I was at Guildford—Mr. Harvey was not there; he had not surrendered—yesterday afternoon, while I was down stairs, Mr. Harvey brought two rough men up to me in the street; he says, "You know her, that is Mrs. Fox, you will know her again, won't you?" and then again he brought up another one, a respectable-looking man, I think he was a policeman in disguise, I have been told so, and he said, "That is Mrs. Fox, that is her; do you know her, the cat," and he pointed his finger at me like that, and he said "Yes, I think I know her;" and I said, "I will lock you up if you insult me," and they walked away, and Mr. Harvey insulted another gentleman who was outside in the tame manner—he brought these two men up to Mr. Elsey, and he said "Do you know him? look at him from top to toe; that is the villain "—that was yesterday morning, before the Court was opened.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The witness's affidavit of 10th April was read at length</hi>)—With the exception of the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, the affidavit is quite true; it was three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—I have remembered it since; it was drawn up by Mr. Butter, at his office in Chancery Lane; I went there to give my evidence to him—that was the first step I took in the proceeding.</p>

The things were not sold to Halliday, they were only made over to him; the poor man had not got money to pay his rent at the time, therefore I am quite sure he had not got money to pay for things like those; they were moved after the first bankruptcy—an inventory was made out of goods sold by valuation on 18th September, 1871, to Halliday, but that was not the day the things were moved; they were not sold to him; they were moved in October, after the first adjudication in bankruptcy, some, and some at Christmas—he did not pay 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; my husband signed a receipt for it, but he never bought them—it was done for a sham sale, so that the bankruptcy should not have them; I was taken up on a charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the shorthand writer appointed by the Judge of the County Court to take notes of this examination—I was sworn to take what passed—I have the notes before me—the transcript produced is correct—at page 127 in the examination of Fox, Mr. Condy, addressing the Judge, says: "Sir, in Elsey's last affidavit he swears that the money was due to him, but he swears that he did not take the affidavit before me. I see that I swore the affidavit on the 10th, therefore I must have made a mistake in the jurat, copying probably from one of the affidavits. I think it was before the learned Registrar arrived in Court. I am extremely sorry that such a mistake should have occurred, but it probably occurred from copying from another affidavit. But, at all events, he swears to the amount, and he was one of the committee of inspection; if, therefore, any one was imposing on the Court, it was Elsey himself. Mr. Stonor: Do you know Elsey? Mr. Condy: Yes sir, I know him, and I remember his taking the oath now—he does not dispute the amount that is due to him. Mr. Stonor: Yes he does; he swears that there was an I O U for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that there was only 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. really due. His proof, therefore, will have to be reduced to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "Andrews was examined on 6th and 13th February, and his proof was expunged. In Harvey's examination he is asked:" <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, then, I believe that under this bankruptcy there is no estate whatever, save and except this land? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is none whatever, I believe—"A little further on, Mr. Stonor asks:" Is there a dispute as to the freehold? and Mr. Condy says: Yes, we have had possession of it since 1866, and now they</p>

               <p>are setting up a claim to it. Mr. Ribton: There is no dispute, and can he no dispute upon it; we have recovered our judgment debt against them. Mr. Condy: We have never attorned at all Mr. Miller: But you, as trustee, are very willing to give up the land if they can show a better title to it? Mr. Condy: Yes, a better title than I have got. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And has there been an action of ejectment commenced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I mean to try it—"At page 90 in the examination of Fox, Mr. Stonor says:" As the case stands, the creditor and trustee contradict him in every material part of the transaction. The transaction is almost beyond belief, and as to all the circumstances surrounding it, the bankrupt contradicts the trustee in every one of them. He says that the payments were made at three different times, instead of one. The trustee says you were present when he says you were not. Mr. Condy: You will not fail to perceive, sir, that the man is anything but a man of business, and therefore we must not read him too strictly. Mr. Stonor: If you go into the case further, you must put that straight about yourself. Mr. Condy: With reference to whit, sir t Mr. Stonor: Mr. Harvey says that you were present when 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid.

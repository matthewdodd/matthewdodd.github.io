I believed what he said, that he was Mr. Scott; he asked me if we had any children's black hats to dispose off in the shop; I told him yes; he told me I might take two children's black hats there at six o'clock, for a child about four years old, and a bill and receipt, and he would pay for the hats. He took me up a street out into the Old Jewry, said he wanted to go to Coleman-street, and for me to make haste home. When I got home to my master's shop I told what had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in the evening with the children's hats to Mr. Scott - A. Yes, I went alone, and when I came there they said they did not know any thing about the children's hats.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire whether the hat come home to Mr. Scott, by the person calling himself Mr. Scott - A. Yes, I could not learn any thing about it there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the man again that took the hat from you - A. On the Tuesday following, in Cheapside, by our door; I told my master of it, the prisoner saw me, my master went after him; the prisoner was going to run through a passage, a thoroughfare, my master stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the hat again - A. No. I said I was sure he was the man, he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this hat charged to the customer - A. Five shillings. It was an old hat that had been dressed.</p>

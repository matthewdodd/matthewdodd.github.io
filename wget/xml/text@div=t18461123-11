                  </hi>. I am shopman to William Greedy Mott, of 55, Cheapside, in the parish of St. Mary-le-Bow. On Saturday afternoon, the 14th of Nor., I heard a violent knocking outside the shop window, which was of plate-glass—I ran out and saw the prisoner Gibbs just leaving the window—the prisoner Ire<lb></lb>land at that moment had his left hand in the window—I seized him, looked to<lb></lb>wards Gibbs, and saw him being stopped by two gentlemen—then he dashed this gold watch from his band violently on the stones—he was taken in custody by some gentlemen—I saw no more of him at that moment, but several persons were scrambling to pick the watch up—I held Ireland some time, and then my next door neighbour took him into his shop, and a gentleman picked up a third watch from the iron gutter, across the footpath, just beyond the window which was broken, and over which Ireland had been standing while I held him—the second watch had been picked up in the scramble—it was thrown down by Gibbs—I did not see that watch pass from Gibbs's hand, but I did the first—and the third was in the gutter—all three are the property of Mr. Mott, and had been in the window by the pane of glass, which I found a large hole in sufficient to put an arm through.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gibbs. Q.</hi> By what do you swear to me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I was in the street, and saw you throw the watch away—I had seen the prisoners at the window, and nobody else.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 15.) On the 14th of Nov., about a quarter to four o'clock, I was on duty about twenty yards from Mr. Mott's shop—I saw a crowd, went to the spot, and found one prisoner in one shop and one in another—I stopped to protect the hole in the glass, and then received the prisoners in charge—Gibbs's right hand was bleeding, and cut in two small places by the knuckle, as if cut by glass.</p>

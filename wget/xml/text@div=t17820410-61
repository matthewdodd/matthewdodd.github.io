            . I am headborough of St. John's, Wapping, a person came past me and said, there was another in great distress, that he had been robbed of his watch and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100085"></xptr> handkerchief, another person came with a message to the same purport, then I went down, and when I came down to Execution-dock there was a croud of people; some cried out, here is the headborough, others, there is no occasion, they have delivered them up to the press-gang; I turned round and said, a press-gang had no business with a thing of this nature, I should take them into custody, and I took them before a justice. As I laid hold of Ford, he damn'd me, and would not go without a coach, I told him he should go, and must go, at last he said he would; I searched him and found a handkerchief on each, and a picklock-key on one of them.</p>
               <p>From the prisoner. Did not Baker say the watch was half out of his pocket? - He said it was out of his pocket, so as he catched the watch in his hand, and they had hold of the chain; he said then as he does now, that is, what he said at Sherwood's.</p>

             deposed, that he saw Mr. Marshall have the two prisoners in custody, that he searched the last man and found a key on him; he was present when Baker was first examined, he remembers, he said, that the prisoner had the watch chain in his hand, and he catched the body of the watch in his hand; he said one catched hold of the flap of his coat, and brought him round; that one had hold of his arm, and one catched hold of his watch with the other arm.</p>

               <p>I saw that man pulling this lad about, and I said it was a shame he should; he turned round to me, and said, you are going to pick my pocket, and you shall go with him; he took hold of me, and a press-gang came by, and because the press-gang would not take us, he said we should both go to gaol; at Mr. Sherwood's he said we tried to pick his pocket at Kings-gate-stairs; the watch was half out of his pocket, he got as far as Execution-dock; he said this lad meant to pick his pocket, I never saw this lad before in my life, I never was in company with him.</p>

               <p>I go about with a jack-ass, I went to a person that keeps a green-stall; and as I was coming back this man stopped me, and said you want to rob me of my watch; I said let me go, he let me go, it was quite day-light, then he came again, and catched hold of me and swore I should go to gaol; this man came up directly, and said, what are you about? he had me on the ground; says he, I will take you to gaol, you are his companion, or confederate, or such thing as that, and I will have you both to gaol. Justice Sherwood asked him if we had any arms about us, he said no; and if they had had me in a bye place they would have murdered me. Says Mr. Sherwood, did not he put you in bodily fear? he said no; Did not you find a knife about them? - No; he said Ford put a long stick down his throat, and that did put him in a little fear, but he was in no other fear. Mr. Sherwood said they have put you in fear, and you must go and file a true bill against them, and get these rascals out of the world.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ford. He said yes and aye to every thing the justice said, and he never asked no questions at all.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these are the same men that took your watch and handkerchief? - I am positive of it, they was not two seconds from me, I turned my head round every minute to see how near they were to me, I had a view of them constantly; I do not know that ever I saw Wapping, at twelve o'clock at night, so free from people in my life; there has been a neglect of bringing a young woman here, whose name we have forgot, she swore to seeing them there.</p>
               <p>As soon as you perceived him taking the watch you caught at it and did not afterwards get it again? - No.</p>

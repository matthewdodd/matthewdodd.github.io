            . I am a carman. I was sent by Mr. Wills to that house, on the 20th of December, about five minutes before six o'clock in the morning; I found the bolt of the lock was undone - I called the watchman to bring a light, and I found a stove against the front door; I went in, and tried the back door, which was safe; I came into the front parlour: I then went up stairs, and found the prisoner concealed in a back room - I caught hold of him; he said he was employed by the landlord to take down the fixtures - I gave charge of him, and ran up stairs, but saw no more persons there; I did not go into the back kitchen, but went and alarmed Mr. Wills, who came and found the stove and the copper taken out of their places. At the watch-house I observed that the prisoner was all over dirt and mortar.</p>
               <p>COURT to WILLIAM WILLS. Q. Did you see the stove? A. Yes - it had been fixed in the parlour; that and the copper had both been fixed in with brick work, and the brick work was torn down.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man met me the evening before, and told me to come to him at No. 20, (I forget the name of the street, but it is facing the Haberdashers' Arms public-house), and help him move to Whitecross-street, and he would give me 1s. 6d. or 2s.; he told me to go at six o'clock; I went, and knocked twice; a man opened the door: he said, "Mind you do not fall over the stove which stands there;" he led me up the stairs, and said he would go and look for a man and woman, and he should scarcely be three minutes; the witness came directly after - I was on the landing-place, and said a man was moving some things, and was gone to see for some persons; the man had given the screw-driver into my hand.</p>

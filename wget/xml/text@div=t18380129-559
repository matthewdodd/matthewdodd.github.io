                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. John Gower; he lives in King-street, Covent-garden, and is a linen-draper. At eleven o'clock it the morning of the 18th of January, I hung up the shawl in the lobby—after that I heard the line snap—I ran out, and about eight or nine yards off I saw the prisoner secured by some gentleman, and this shawl dropped from her—I took it up, brought her into the shop, got the officer, and gave her in charge—this is my master's shawl.</p>

There were two girls pulled it down, and threw it down at my feet—I told my mother who the two girls were, and they are gone into the country—my mother is now ill in bed, or I should have had cha<lb></lb>racters—there was no gentleman there at all; if there was, why don't he come—this is the first time I have ever been in such a situation, if you will look over it this time. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not see any other girls there—I had hold of her when she dropped it.</p>

A few days before 8th April, I saw the building, and observed that it was all right—on the night of Wednesday, the 8th, I heard a noise outside the house, apparently from the building—on the Friday I saw that some lead had been taken from there—I informed my master.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police sergeant, T</hi> 11) On Saturday, 11th April, in consequence of information, I went to a building occupied by Mr. George Rippon Heron, on Uxbridge Common—on Monday morning the constable Masters brought 56 lbs. of lead to me; I went with him and one of Mr. Heron's servants, and compared the lead with what remained on the build<lb></lb>ing, and it exactly corresponded—White was in custody at this time; I heard him say that Harry Howe brought the lead to his house on the Fri<lb></lb>day night, after he was in bed—I took Howe into custody, and he was charged with being concerned with White in stealing some lead, which White was remanded for—he said he found it in Stransom's field—that is near where the lead was stoles from; he said White sold it for him, but he had not had any of the money—the prisoners live in the neighbourhood—I have the lead here, and the pieces that match it.</p>

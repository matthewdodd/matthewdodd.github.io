I am the housekeeper; I went out on Thursday, the 12th of September, between five and six o'clock in the morning, and left my wife at home - between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I left my work and called at my mother's, and my wife was there; I went from there to my club, and on leaving my club, I met my wife, and we both went home - when I got home I found the front door locked as usual, and on going through the house to the back premises, I found the back door unbolted and ajar - I made no further inquiry that night; the back door opens into my own yard - next morning I went to my work, and on returning, between seven and eight o'clock, my wife was up stairs; she gave me information, and I examined, and missed a coat, waistcoat, and trousers, a violin, and some more things - the prisoner has worked for me at different times, and so has Rayner - I was in debt to them nearly 9s. between them on the day of the robbery; they both came to me the day after the robbery and asked for money - they were both still working for me - I told them I would pay them as soon as I returned from breakfast, having no money with me - I had not at that time missed my goods; when I returned from breakfast they were gone - I did not see them any more till they were in custody; they never came back to ask for their money - I made inquiry after them directly, suspecting them - I have since seen my things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You say they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170013"></xptr>were in your occasional employ? A. Only employed now and then - I am a bricklayer, but I have a gravel-pit of my own; I sometimes make bricks of the gravel - the prisoner was not employed by the week, nor by the day, only by the hour, as he took it into his head - he never worked a whole day together for me - I am sure of that; I can swear it - he never worked a whole day for me throughout; he was a poorish lad - he had no other way of getting a living that I know of, but through me; I did not know he wanted his money before the morning; he never asked me for his wages before - I said I would pay him when I returned from breakfast, and when I returned he was gone; that was the morning after the robbery - Rayner was with him then, and asked for money as well.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you never was asked by the prisoner before for his wages? A. Not for the whole of it; I always paid him what he asked, but it was his father's particular wish I should not pay him his wages, for he never brought any money home - I was the only person who would employ him, and he agreed before his father to work, and I was to pay him on Saturday night, but he said he had no means of getting victuals - I said,"Suppose I go with you to your father, and I will pay all that is coming to you" - on the day before, he came to a boy, and gave him money to work for him, saying, he could live much easier than by work - Rayner has been in my employ two or three months, at different times.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Parker. The prisoner and I worked together on Thursday, the 12th of September, at Mr. Parker's - I went away from my work at six o'clock in the evening, and after working, I and the prisoner went to a cook's shop, and as I was sitting down to get my supper, Isaacs said to me, "Mr. and Mrs. Parker are out; there is a gift, will you go?" - I told him no I would not go - he did not say what I was to go for; I did not know what he meant by a gift - no person joined us on that occasion - after that, he said he had been up in the room on Tuesday night and got a coat - a person named Alburn came past the cook's shop while we were there; he looked in at the door, and Isaacs went out and spoke to him - Isaacs came in again, and told me to make haste and eat my supper, and go along with him - I consented to go - me, Isaacs, and Alburn went - there is a place called Globe-lane chapel; it is twenty or thirty yards from Parker's house - when we got there the prisoner told me to wait there to see if Mr. or Mrs. Parker came out of the house they were in - that house was not twenty or thirty yards from the chapel - if I saw either of them come out, I was to go to the end of Mr. Parker's street, and Isaacs said he would be there- if I saw them come out, I was to go and tell him, and if not I was to go in twenty minutes time against Bethnalgreen church, which is about five minutes walk from Parker's house - Isaacs said he would be at Bethnal-green church in twenty minutes - I waited twenty minutes; I did not see Parker, or his wife come out - I went to Bethnalgreen church, and saw Isaacs, and he gave me a waistcoat - he did not give me anything else; he told me to go and pawn it - it was just dusk - I pawned it; I don't know the name; it was the first pawnbroker's - he pointed with his hinger and told me where to go - I pawned it with the witness Rubey for 1s., in the name of Smith I think - I came out and offered the money to Isaacs: he told me I might keep it, and he gave me another shilling going along - he said nothing then - a minute or two after this Alburn came up and told me how Isaacs got in at the window; the prisoner was present; he did not say how they got out again - he said it was Parker's up-stairs window and they had got into with a ladder - Isaacs abused Alburn for telling me how he got in; after that I heard Isaacs say he had laid the plan before and let it be to watch an opportunity of Mr. and Mrs. Parker's being out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Pray how long had you worked for Parker? A. Two months; the prisoner had worked with me, on and off, I don't rightly know how long; I think about six weeks off and on - he very seldom worked for a week together - I don't think he ever did three or four days together - Mr. Parker is a man we could get no wages of; he owes me some now- the prisoner had not applied from time to time for his wages; he owed him some - the prisoner was in want of victuals sometimes, as he told me - I have known him for a day together without being able to get any - he has told me two or three days he could not get any - I have known him without a meal for two or three days - I don't know whether Parker knew that he was without victuals during that time - he had asked Parker for money and told him he was starving; I heard him ask Mr. Parker; but Parker did not have the money at present to give him: he said when he got some he would give him some - that has not occurred more than once; that was about a week before the robbery - he was represented that the reason he asked for the money was to buy victuals - Parker has told him frequently that he had not money, but when he had he would give him some - I was myself in want one or two days before; I was without victuals at that time; Parker was in my debt - I went three or four Saturday nights; he was not able to give it me; he gave me 6d. one Saturday night; 1s. on another - he owed me for three or four weeks - I was almost starving for want of victuals, and not able to get money to buy it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner tell you he could not live without victuals, that he was kept starving, and his master would not pay him, at the time he said he had planned this? A. No; he had represented it before; the coat was taken, on the Tuesday preceding - the waistcoat was not a very good one - I have often heard Parker say his father had told him, if he did not give him the money, he should not have any victuals at home - I will undertake to swear that Parker has been without the means of giving it to him, and could not pay - Alburn was working there, and he was half starved as well; he was not at work at that time - my father is living; I had made no arrangement<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170014"></xptr>for my father to receive the money - he owed me about 5s. 4d., and Isaacs 4s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On the night of the robbery, when you were at supper, had the prisoner been eating supper? A. Yes, with the 8d. that was left at dinner-time.</p>

               <p>JOHN GEORGE (policeman). I apprehended the prisoner on the 28th of September, close by the Mansion-house; I had been looking for him before - I was on the opposite side of the way; I crossed over and said, "Isaacs, I suppose you know I want you;" he stopped directly, and said, "Ah, but you can't take me in the city;" I told him I did not want any bother with him, if he would not come quiet I would call a city officer, and then he went with me; we walked along together, and he told me he did not think I should have had him that morning; he then pulled a small knife out of his pocket, and asked if I thought that would go against him; we still walked on, and he presently said, "Do you think I shall get fourteen years?"</p>

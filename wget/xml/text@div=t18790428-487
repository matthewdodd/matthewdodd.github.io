                  </hi>. I live at Spitalfields—I knew the deceased George Buckley—I was with him at the Bluecoat Boy on 7th April—the prisoner and two others came in; one was a carroty-headed woman, and the other, I suppose, was her husband—as soon as they came in Buckley said to the prisoner, "I think I knocked you down last night; I am very sorry for it; I did not take any notice of it; if it is all over with you it is all over with me," and they shook hands and drank together—I do not think either of them were drunk; they were quite capable of knowing what they were doing—drinking ale and half-and-half went on from 6.15 till between 7 and 8—they both became quarrelsome about 8.15, and Buckley stood up and hit O'Connell with his open hand, but only one blow—O'Connell took no notice for five minutes, and then he said, "Do you think I will let it go as I let it go twice last night? I shall very well make you pay for it to-night," and he ran. two or three steps over to him and gave him a running kick in the bottom of Ins stomach as he was sitting on the seat—he made a jump and turned to me, and said "Bridget, that man has given me a kick that</p>

               <p>will do me for life"—I said "Don't be so foolish"—he was taken to the hospital, but the authorities would not take him in, and he was in terrible pain, and spent the night in my house, and between 3 and 4 a.m. he was taken to the London Hospital, and died there eleven or twelve days after.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 38, Dorset Street—on Monday night, 7th April, I was in the Bluecoat Boy, and saw Butcher and the prisoner, who were strangers to me—they were neither sober nor drunk—Buckley struck the first blow, but before he struck him he pushed him three or four times—the prosecutor did nothing on being struck because the two women held him, and a witness here held him, and when he could not strike him he gave him a kick—Buckley was sitting by me, singing—it did not seem a violent kick to me, but he rolled off the seat after he got it—it was at the bottom of his stomach.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—Buckley was brought there on 8th April, and I saw him at 9 a.m.—he was suffering from inability to pass water and severe pain in the lower part of the abdomen, and his groin was swollen—peritonitis set in in twelve hours, which was the immediate cause of his death—no signs of external injury were apparent—if he had been kicked on his stomach one would rather expect to find some mark, but not necessarily, the wall of the stomach would yield to the kick—I found on a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination that an abscess had formed between the wall of the stomach and the muscles of the abdomen, and probably some vessel had been ruptured—I am led to suppose that violence caused the injury—I do not think the abscess could have been set up by internal causes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Rumble, who keeps a haberdasher's shop, No. 3, Pleasant-place, Holloway-road. On 14th Feb., between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop and asked for a handkerchief out of the window—I said it was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then wanted a pair of socks, and then a pair of shilling stockings—they came to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—after I packed them up together he laid his hand on the parcel and laid the money down—I said, "That is a bad 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece"—he must have heard that, he was quite close—he took the parcel and ran away out of the shop—I ran after him down the Holloway-road, and he was at length stopped—I swear he is the man—I followed, and kept my eyes on him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece.</p>

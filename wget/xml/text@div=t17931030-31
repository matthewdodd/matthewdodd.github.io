               <p>I sell old clothes in Rosemary-lane; I lived at the lower part of this house till last Tuesday was three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lived there? - I believe a month or five weeks to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout were the lodgings of Dempsey? - In the one pair of stairs above me.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know about stealing these articles? - The prisoner at the bar brought me this property, and told me he was very much distressed, this was on last Saturday was a week, he brought the sheet, blanket, and quilt, and I went and pawned them for him for two shillings, I brought him the duplicate and two shillings before witness, and delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you pawn them? - In Nightingale-lane, all at one place in one bundle together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more about them? - No, I do not, I was taken up last Sunday and kept till the Monday, because Sunday I could not have a hearing; the prisoner at the bar he wanted to leave me in the lurch, because my name was on the duplicate; I was taken and discharged before the magistrate, he was taken up on Sunday afternoon; I was not cleared till one o'clock on Monday, I was cleared when he had a hearing before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first give an account of these things being delivered to you? - I gave it to the justice when I was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give any account of that before you was committed? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You pawned these things as your own property? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the pawnbroker they were your own property? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was taken up for stealing the things? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And in order to save yourself you accused the prisoner? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And till you was taken up and carried before the justice you never told this story? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when he brought you these things you thought they were his own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300040"></xptr>property? - No, I knew they were not, but it is a usual thing to pawn these things and get them out again.</p>

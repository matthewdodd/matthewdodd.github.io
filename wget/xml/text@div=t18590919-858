The money that I had in my possession was all taken in the way of business. I was in a comfortable way of business; I had no reason for passing bad money. The shilling wrapped up in paper was returned to me as bad during the day, and I wrapped it up so that I should not give it again. I had no knowledge that the money was bad.</p>

I am cashier at the London and County Bank, Knightsbridge branch—Mrs. Cox keeps an account there—on 23rd June, between 10 and 11 o'clock, the prisoner presented this cheque for payment—I saw at one that it was a forgery, and made a communication to Mr. Morris, and Mr. Cutter, the assistant manager—the cheque is now torn; it was entire when it was presented to me, and was for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was shown into the private room, and I left the matter in the hands of Mr. Cutter and Mr. Morris.

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Knightabridge branch of the London and County Bank—I saw the prisoner come into the manager's room—I was not present at the interview between him and Mr. Cutter—afterwards Mr. Cutter told me to accompany him to Howell &amp; James', the place he said he came from, to clear up the matter—I proposed to go in a cab—the prisoner objected to ride, and I waked with him—when we reached Eagle Court, near the end of Piccadilly, he turned to the right; I went with him—we reached the end of the court, and ought to have turned to the right, but the prisoner suddenly darted off at full speed to the left—I chased him, and called out after him—there were three or four persons standing on the pavement, which rather impeded his progress, and they helped me to secure him—a policeman came up, and we conveyed him to Howell &amp; James,—I saw the senior partner, and asked him, in the pri<lb></lb>soner's presence, if he knew him, and whether he had ever been in their employ—he said, "No"—I asked if he knew the endorsement—he said he did not, it was not their endorsement—at that moment, the prisoner snatched the cheque out of my hand, and attempted to swallow it—he was being held by two constables at the time, one on each side—I siezed his throat, and tried to prevent his swallowing it—he was thrown down, and we succeeded in getting the fragments of the cheque from his right hand—while he was struggling, he said, "I have swallowed it"—I said, "No, you have not"—he was then conveyed to the station—in January last I de<lb></lb>livered to Mrs. Cox a cheque-book, numbered "S 15962"—all the cheques in that book would bear the same number—this cheque bears that number.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would no other cheque book but that delivered to Mrs. Cox have that number? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not deliver the book to Mrs. Cox myself; I don't know who did—I should not under any circumstances pay a cheque signed "Mrs. Cox"—that is utterly irregular—the endorsement is also improper.</p>

I am at present residing at the Grosvenor Hotel, and have been for some months—I understand that the prisoner was a waiter there, but I do not recognize him—I keep an account at the London and County Bank, at Knightsbridge—I obtained a cheque-book from there in January last—these are the counterfoils—this cheque is not my writing, nor was it written by my authority—one of the cheques is missing from this book, counterfoil and all, torn from the end—there were fifty, and forty-nine only remain—I usually kept it in my bed-room in a box, locked up—when I wrote cheques I brought it down to my sitting-room—I do not deal at Howell &amp; James'.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The number does not appear in the counterfoil? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I know this cheque come from that book by comparing the numbers of the cheques returned to me by the bank—I have not got them here—there</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the police-force, but am superannuated, and am specially employed at the Grosvenor Hotel—the prisoner was a waiter there from 9th May to 23rd June—it would not be his duty during the day to be in that part of the house where Mrs. Cox's rooms are, but every other night after 8 o'clock, up to 12.0 or 12.30—his wages were 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he was paid monthly—he left on the 23rd, and was paid his wages.</p>

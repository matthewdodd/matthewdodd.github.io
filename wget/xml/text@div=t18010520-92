               <p>Q. Was it Lemon's duty to take the key out of the house? - A. Yes; I went the next morning to receive the key again, I received it from Lemon, and went to the warehouse in Three-crane-lane, between six and seven o'clock; I found the door single-locked, there was no appearance of force; I found a great quantity of wool lying about the floor, the pack that I had set up on end was cut all the way, and the biggest part taken out; I then went up to the accompting-house, and gave information of it; I then returned, with Mr. Marsh, and weighed what remained, there was not more than half a hundred, I believe, left; there was about three parts out of four of the bag gone; they weigh about two hundred-weight.</p>

               <p>HENRY LEMON sworn - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am porter to Mr. Brooke: In the afternoon of the 16th of December, I was at the warehouse in at Antholin's Church-yard, Watling-street, in my business; Bew brought the key of the Three-crane-lane warehouse, and gave it to me; I took it, with the other keys, to the accompting-house, in Sambrook-court, Basinghall-street, I put them all in an iron safe; and the next morning, between six and seven o'clock, I went to the warehouse in Watling-street, with the keys, and delivered the key of the Three-crane-lane warehouse to Bew; Bew came back to me, and I went to the warehouse, and saw the remains of the bag which had been plundred, and the greatest part of it gone; the package was cut from top to bottom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Bew brought the key to you in the evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.At what time? - A. A quarter past five o'clock, or it might be a little after.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it earlier or later than half past five? - A. Earlier rather than later.</p>
               <p>Q.And the next morning you gave the key back again to Bew? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you give it to any body? - A. No; I put it by itself in the iron safe.</p>
               <p>- PARTRIDGE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am one of Mr. Brooke's clerks.</p>
               <p>Q.In December, 1799, do you remember there be ing any Spanish wool in Mr. Brooke's warehouse in Three-crane lane? - A. Yes; I weighed the bag in question, in December, 1799, I took down the weight at the time it was weighed, it weighed two hundred and two pounds gross, or two hundred and twenty-six pounds; I saw the same pack the following day, it was afterwards weighed again; I did not take any notice of the deficiency, but Mr. Marsh did; there was a deficiency of about three-fourths I should imagine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any wool produced before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes; in Spanish wool bags there are four searns, and if any one of them is cut, they can take out the wool; it was cut with some sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was it that you saw any wool produced before the Lord Mayor? - A. I think within ten days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that wool? - A. I did; it exactly resembled the wool that remained; it corresponded in quality exactly, I have no doubt but it is the wool that we lost from the warehouse; the remainder of the wool is here.</p>

               <p>JOHN MARSH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp I am clerk to Mr. Brooke, he has a warehouse in Threecrane-lane, from whence this property was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the particular pack of wool? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a pack of wool of which there was a deficiency? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember weighing it, to see what the deficiency was? - A. Yes; I did not weigh it before, I only weighed the quantity that remained; I made a minute at the time; it weighed a quarter of a hundred and twenty-seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the general run of the weight of a pack of wool? - A.About two hundred pounds; the deficiency was one hundred weight, two quarters, and three pounds gross, or one hundred and seventy-one pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen any wool since you lost it from the warehouse? - A. Yes, before the Lord-Mayor; I saw some wool which corresponded in quality with that which I weighed, and also in quantity; in the warehouse where this wool was seized, I picked it from twenty sacks.</p>
               <p>- GOWKETT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a warehouse man in Great Distaff-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the 10th of December, 1799, any body coming to you with any package of wool? - A. Yes, about a quarter past five; I had locked up the front warehouse, as we generally do when it gets dark.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you take upon you to say, that it was not later than that? - A. I am confident, for I had an engagement to go out.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was it that brought it? - A. Mr. Leggatt's carman.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.(Produces a sample of wool.) Q. The bags of wool are at the door in a cart, are they not? - A. They are; we brought them from Mr. Brooke's warehouse, in Three Crane-lane; I took this sample out of the warehouse, in the presence of Mr. Marsh and Bew.</p>
               <p>- CARTWRIGHT sworn. - I know no more than Mr. Miller; I was with him when he got the sample from Mr. Brooke's warehouse; I assisted in bringing the wool from Mr. Gowkett's on the 20th of December, 1799.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Marsh.) Q. Is that a sample of the wool that remained in your warehouse of the pack that was cut? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. At what age did you first begin? - A.About twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had an opportunity of becoming well acquainted with Spanish wool? - A. I certainly have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen that wool, which is said to have been produced, from Mr. Gowkett's warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you compared it with the remainder of the bag that was left in Mr. Brooke's warehouse? - A. Yes; I entertain not the least doubt of its being the same; it is of a very singular quality, a wool that we seldom receive in the country; when we have it, it must be known from other wool.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that this wool, found in Mr. Gowkett's warehouse, is identically the same that was found in Mr. Brooke's warehouse? - A. I can undertake to swear to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You don't mean to say, that all the wool that comes to England, comes to your house? - A. This is an article that seldom comes to this market; it has been generally sent to Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me what proportion of that, which comes to England, goes to your house? - A. I suppose one-fourth.</p>
               <p>Q.Suppose you had seen such wool as that at Bristol. would you still say, you had no doubt of it? - A.Most assuredly, if it was the same poil, I should say it was the same, as far as my judgment goes.</p>

               <p>Chetham. No, it was not; being asked before the Lord-Mayor how he came in possession of the wool, he said; he had bought it of some Spanish sailors, who said, it came to England in their beds; the Lord-Mayor then put a question to him, whether it was a usual thing; upon which he said it was a very usual thing for their beds to be stuffed with Spanish wool.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const then intersered, and the witness stopped, and said no more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. I believe you know that the prisoner has put off this trial upon an affidavit of the absence of those witnesses, and that he swore he had done all in his power to obtain them? - A. He has certainly put off his trial upon an affidavit that some sailors were material witnesses, who were gone in an English ship to the South Seas, and I think, named a witness of the name of Carbinell.(Mr. Const addressed the Jury in behalf of the defendant.)</p>

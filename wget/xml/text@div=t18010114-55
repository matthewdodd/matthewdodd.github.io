               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Therefore that would put it in the hands of a great number? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. We understand you have been formerly employed in the Post-office? - A. Yes, I have been between four and five years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have been out of that employ? - A. It might be about two years; it must be two or more.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your employ in June last? - A. In the Excise.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, I know him extremely well.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you particularly intimate with him? - A. Yes, particular friends during the time I was in the Post-office, and since that we have been upon terms of friendship.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be dismissed from the Post-office? - A. There was a little misunderstanding between the Gentlemen of the office, there was something lost as I understand, and they went to my house to search it, and at that time thre were half a dozen spoons, and they took them away.</p>
               <p>Court Q. A misunderstanding about what? - A. About a note that was lost from some letter in my walk, I believe. and on account my not giving them that answer which they wished, which was to know where I got the spoons from.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who do you mean by they? - A. The officers; I sent them there of my own will, there was no warrant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. In consequence of that you were dismissed from your employ? - A. I was suspended till I gave a satisfactory account.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. A satisfactory account of what? - A. Where the spoons came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give that satisfactory account? - A. I told the Comptroller I had no objection to inform him in private, but the officers should lnot be so far satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were discharged? - A. No; I was suspended, not discharged, as Mr. Harris can prove.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the 6th of June last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner that morning? - A. Yes, at the Dolphin public-house, the corner of Cannon-street, near the new road, St. George's in the East.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning? - A. To the best of my recollection, between tell and eleven o'clock; but I am sure it must be half after ten.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and the prisoner at that time? - A. I called in, not by appointment,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140066"></xptr>but by accident; the prisoner was there; he informed me that he had got something of value.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the house, or when you came out of the house? - A. When we came out of the house together, I asked him what it was, and he produced me a check, after we had walked, I may say, the fourth part of a mile down the road.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at this check?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I object to the production of this piece of paper as not being stamped.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. With respect to that, it might avail my friend, if it was produced as a note, but as a mere piece of paper to be identified as a thing shewn to the witness I contend it will not; if I were calling upon the witness to look at it as a note it might be a different thing; but I only offer this in order to connect it with the letter containing that piece of paper.</p>

               <p>Mr. Woodfall. I will not detain your Lordship a minute, only to suppose a case; a man is indicted for stealing a letter, containing a half-guinea, and that which was supposed to be half-a-guinea, proved to be a piece of lead, of course that indictment could not be sustained; then, suppose a fresh indictment is preferred for stealing the letter, and that dump were to be produced as evidence of that letter having been stolen, no reference could possibly be had to the original indictment for stealing the half-guinea, but I contend it would be good evidence of a fact to trace the allegation of the letter having been in possession of the parry who clearly had that dump in his possession. That is a case perfectly analagous to this; it is to be considered as a piece of blank paper with marks upon it, sufficient to bring it to the recollection of the witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. My Lord, I am very well aware of the extensive words of the Stamp-act, but we contend-that the words are no more than this; that a paper requiring a stamp, shall not be given in evidence as a good and valid instrument. My Lord, it is perfectly clear, notwithstanding the very large and extensive words of the statute, that such a piece of paper may be given in evidence for some purposes, because it may be produced in evidence, to convict the party drawing it, which, if the words of the statute were to be taken literally, could not be done. It is perfectly clear from several decided authorities, that such a piece of paper may be given in evidence in a criminal prosecution for forgery, and I apprehend it is upon this principle, that it is the nature of the crime of forgery, that the instrument should be false and counterfeit. My Lord, we do not offer this in evidence, as a good and valid draft, but one of the witnesses having informed your Lordship that he put that piece of paper into a letter; we now offer it to prove, that that piece of paper was taken out of the letter by the prisoner himself, and for that purpose, as it seems to me, it is of no sort of consequence whether this be a valid stamp or no, we only shew that this bit of paper was put into the letter, and we offer it in evidence as a medium to shew, that that letter was in his possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Myers followed on the same side, and contended that it ought to be admitted as evidence, to prove, that as it was in the possession of the prisoner, he must also have been in possession of the letter which contained it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. My Lord, my objection is, that that paper-being produced, however they may with to call it waste-paper, is a thing bearing definition, that the law forbids to be given in evidence. There was one answer to this objection, which I with to get rid of immediately; that, supposing a half-guinea to be contained in a letter, and the party is indicted for stealing a letter, containing a half-guinea, which should turn out afterwards to be a mere dump, or false coin; it is said, that that piece of false coin may be produced in evidence. - To be sure it may, but it is begging the question to assume that in argument, because that dump is a thing which no law of the land forbids you to produce in evidence, that is therefore a plain begging of the question, because a dump is a thing which they might legally produce, and which it would be extremely important to produce in evidence. The witness calls this piece of paper a check, I say, they cannot produce that, unless it is legalized by having received the proper stamp which a check ought to have, and if this be the check, the witness has himself proved to your Lordships, that that is a thing not to be received in evidence, it is a thing that cannot be produced in evidence, because the law says it shall not be produced in evidence, not shall it be pleaded, nor of any avail in any Court of Justice whatever.</p>
               <p>My Lord, it has been said, that there have been decided cases in which this point has been ruled, but I rather think those cases that have been alluded to, of Hawkeswood, and other cases, were put upon the instrument itself, that it was not a valid instrument, and therefore not capable of having the effect of availing the party in law to obtain the money which the forgery was intended to defraud the party of, which, therefore, cannot be the subject of an indictment for forgery; but I don't think that any of those determinations have gone upon the question, is this admissible or not? - I am informed there was a case in the Court of Exchequer, at nist prias, where an instrument was produced, merely in order to enable the party to ascertain the fact of another transaction having taken place, and not as an acquittance for money, and there my Lord Chief Baron Eyre refused to receive it in evidence, because the law had said it shall not be offered in evidence. My learned friend, Mr. Gurney, has furnished me with the case, he was present when it was so determined, and therefore I contend, with considerable confidence, that it will not be decided against me ultimately, and perhaps your Lordships may think that there is room for after-consideration.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron Graham. Are you quite sure that those are the words of the statute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The words of the Statute, 3l. Geo. III. ch. 25. sec. 13. are not that it shall not be pleaded, or given in evidence in any Court to enable the party to recover it; but that it shall not be pleaded or given in evidence in any Court, and then comes a subsequent clause, which says it shall not be good, useful, or available in law or equity. Upon these grounds I contend before your Lordships, that this statute prohibits it's being given in evidence for any purpose whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. The question, how far a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140067"></xptr>note unstamped may be given in evidence, has been under the consideration of all the Judges in the case of Moreton, which ruled the case of Cotin Reculist. The Judges were of opinion, and it was expressly so stated by Mr. Justice Grose in delivering the opinion of the Judges upon that case, that the note ought not to be received in any way to make it a valid instrument, but that it was evidence for collateral purposes. Now, the answer given by Mr. Knowlys, to the argument of Mr. Abbott, with respect to the penalty, I think does not hold, because it is to be construed in the most extensive way. - Look at the object of this Act of Parliament, it was a revenue law to lay a duty by means of these stamps, but not to enable persons to commit larcenies, and all sorts of crimes with impunity, that was not the object. We are of opinion that the evidence should be received; if between this and the first day of the term, any doubt should strike our minds, we will certainly take the opinion of the Judges, but at present we have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. (To Hill.) Q. He gave you that check? - A. I do not know that this was the check, it is impossible for me to swear that, I wrote nothing upon it, it was for the same sum, it answers the description; a few minutes afterwards, a letter was shown to me by the prisoner, but what became of it I do not know; I saw the prisoner tear the letter, but I cannot be certain whether it was that or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a memory of what was written upon the paper which he produced to you? - A. To the best of my recollection, it is a long time since, it was from one brother to another, with an enclosure of 200l. it began, dear brother; I do not know the date, I know it was signed Thomson, but I cannot recollect the christian name; it was directed to Mr. Thomson at Mile-end.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue together then? - A. If I staid ten minutes, it was the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did he put that first piece of paper into your hand? - A. To get it changed; the next day I went with it to Stratford- place, to the banker's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tender that piece of paper at the banker's? - A. Yes; I received a 100l. a 40l. and a 50l. Bank of England notes, and 10l. in cash.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass at the banker's shop? - A. Yes; he asked me if I received it for Mr. Thomson, and I told him, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had got these notes, where did you go? - A. To the Bank of England to change those for small notes.</p>
               <p>Q. When change did you get from the Bank - was it the same day? - A. Yes, to the best of my recollection; I got, I think, forty-five 2l. notes, and four 25l. notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you desired at the Bank to write your name upon any one of the notes? - A. Yes, upon one.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you put upon it? - A. Welch, Kensington-grove.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any letters denoting a christian name? - A. Yes, J. or P. or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner after this? - A. At the Black-horse, Fieldgate-street, Whitechapel, about seven o'clock in the evening; I told him I had changed the notes, and he wanted some of the money, but I would not give him any that night, except four or five guineas; on the Sunday morning, I called upon him at his lodgings, and gave him ten 2l. notes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes did you give him, either that or the next day? - A. On Tuesday morning, I gave him ten 2l. notes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes did you give him either that or the next day? - A. On the Tuesday morning, I gave him ten more 2l. notes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did you dispose of the other notes? - A. I exchanged them at different shops.</p>
               <p>Q. For the purpose of getting rid of them? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how much the prisoner had of notes and cash? - A. Ninety pounds exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you knew the prisoner was apprehended? - A. I cannot be certain, but I think it was the Wednesday fen'night after.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you pay him a visit in the Computer? - A. I called and intended to pay him a visit, but I could not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after was it that you heard of yourself being enquired after? - A. I knew it the next day, I think it was; I went away on the Saturday morning, and therefore it must have been two days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you from town, before you were apprehended? - A. Five weeks, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Part of these notes were exchanged by you, were any exchanged by any other person? - A. Yes; some by Mrs. Sturgess, but she was perfectly ignorant of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how you passed the 6th and 7th of June? - A. On the 6th, I was to attend the surveyor at the chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the surveyor of excise, Mr. Hindes, in company with the prisoner, any time that day? - A. Yes, at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to the surveyor of excise, for you? - A. I sent him with a message to beg him to assist me in my duty, for I had particular business that morning, and would come to him as soon as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. What particular business was this? - A. To get the money, but I did not go that morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you send the prisoner from the Dolphin, down to Hackney? - A. I did; upon looking at the note, I discovered that it was the 6th day of the month, the note was dated the 7th; I never looked at the month, I discovered that the note was dated wrong, it was dated the 7th; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140068"></xptr>thought it was the 7th of June, instead of that, it was over due a month.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I like to have people's own words in their accounts of transactions - while you were in the employ of the Post-office, there was what you call a little misunderstanding? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, that little misunderstanding was merely telling you that you were suspected of having stolen a ten pound note out of some letter? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What then? - A. It was a 100l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your superior in office, in this little misunderstanding, told you there was some suspicion of a one hundred pound note being missing? - A. It was a misunderstanding, I am certain.</p>
               <p>Q. This little misunderstanding produced some officers to search your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were desired to account for the possession of some silver spoons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you tell us, you were suspended but not discharged, till you could account satisfactorily to your superiers? - A. That is exactly the case.</p>
               <p>Q. You were suspended but not discharged? - A. I was not discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it that you were not discharged? - A. The case was, that I got a better situation.</p>
               <p>Q. That is to say, you resigned? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Before they could determine whether they would turn you out of place or not, you resigned? - A. I never went into the employment afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in the Excise-office, were you not? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not appeared to attend in your duty there since? - A. I have been in confinement ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you come from prison here? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You have at least made use of 100l. out of this 200l.? - A. Yes, and it cost me above 100l. more.</p>
               <p>Q. Running from justice, you know, is an expensive thing? - A. I should never have gone from the place, but by the persuasion of my friends; I positively meant to surrender to the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do it? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, instead of surrendering to give information, you absconded, and was pursued from place to place, for about six weeks; I dare say it was.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were called to account about this business of the Post-office, I will ask you, though you left your employment there, have you not been frequently in the Penny-post Letter-office? - A. I have been twice.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no business there? - A. No business whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever turned out of that place? - A. Never, I was ordered to go out; I was desired by Mr. Harris to walk out.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not turned out, that is, not laid hold of by the collar, and kicked out, but you were desired to go out? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Those who are in that office can reach the table of course? - A. It is impossible without the notice of letter-carriers.</p>
               <p>Q. Things are to be done sometimes, unobserved? - A. It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know, that by giving evidence against this man now at the bar, you exempt yourself from all prosecution? - A. I received a letter at the time I was taken; signifying the same.</p>
               <p>Q. And not till then did you come forward? - A. No, nor would not; then they over persuaded me in protecting a woman that knew nothing of it; the first word Mr. Parkin said to me, when I was apprehended, was, to save myself, and become an evidence.</p>

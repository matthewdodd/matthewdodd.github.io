After two o'clock on the 18th of November, I heard my brother watchman in the parish of St. Giles's, spring his rattle, crying out stop thief; I was in my watch-box in Prince's-street, in Stanhope-street, when I heard the cry I ran out of my box, and I saw the prisoner at the bar coming up Stanhope-street with the carcase of a sheep on his back, and when he saw me he heaved down the sheep just within one door of my box, and heaving down the sheep he crossed the street and thought to make his escape from me, and a strong man catched hold of him till we came up and seized on him, and we took him to the watch-house, and the constable of the night examined him.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman of St. Clement's Danes, in Stanhope-street, Clare-market. At two o'clock the 18th of November I was sitting in my box, and I saw the prisoner at the bar come by my box with two carcases on his back, I called to him and said, my brave fellow, what have you got there? he made me no answer; I then jumps out of my box and I said, my brave fellow, stop! and I seized him by the collar, and he throws the upper sheep against my breast, which throws me back about a yard. I jumps over the sheep, sprung my rattle, followed him, and cried stop thief, and in the course of twenty yards he throwed the other sheep down against the watch-box; in about twenty yards further he was stopped in Prince's-street, where there was no thoroughfare for man or horse. Mr. Jolly see the sheep and said they were his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never see the man before I see him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my sheep, I know them by the mark particularly by the side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, I am at present distressed and not able to see a counsel, as your lordship is to be my judge, I humbly hope you will also become my advocate. My case really is as follows: On the 17th of November I worked all day at my business until eight o'clock at night, when a shopmate called on me and I went out with him to Charing-cross, and unfortunately staid out drinking with him till near two o'clock the next morning; returning home, I heard a rattle and noise among the watchmen, and being rather in liquor, went to where I heard it, when one of them laid hold on me and said I was the person. I told him I had been drinking with an old shopmate that was going to sea again, and it was curiosity that induced me to come to see what was the matter. All expostulation was in vain, he insisted I was the person that stole the carcases of the two dead sheep, that he saw me throw one at his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080193"></xptr>watch-box, and run away with the other; I was taken before a magistrate, and he persevered in the same story. The magistrate, after hearing the charge, asked me if I was willing to go to sea? I said I had an aged mother and a wife and child that depended on my earnings, and I could keep them decent by my honest industry; I am but recovered very lately out of a severe fit of illness, never used to carry any load, nor ever in my life able to carry the carcases of two sheep; and I humbly submit to your lordship whether I am the person that could do the felony, and that the witnesses must be mistaken with respect to my person. There are some persons waiting to avouch to my character, that I am a good character and keep remarkable good hours.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. By what marks do you know these sheep to be yours? - Particular marks that we have in scoring the shoulder, I could swear to them if I had seen them a hundred miles about.</p>
               <p>Q. Does no other butcher mark in the same way? - Not in our market.</p>

On the 2d of August, about 9 o'clock at night, I was in the lane and heard a cry of murder, and saw the prisoner abusing Mrs. Shanks, who lived with the deceased as his wife - she was treating her violently, and after that she crossed to the opposite side. Simkin came out of his own door, and asked her if she had struck his wife; she said she had, and would serve him the same, and gave him a blow, which did not appear to me to be of any consequence - he had not touched her. He was very much in liquor and fell immediately he was struck; a mob came round and picked him up, and I saw no more - he was taken in doors. She was sober - she had thrown Mrs. Shanks on the ground.</p>

            . I lived with Simkin, and had a family by him. On the 2d of August, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I had some words with the prisoner about our children; Simkin was sitting in his room, and was a little intoxicated. The prisoner began the quarrel - there was a cry of murder, which brought Simkin down to the door. Harris was beating me; I was down, a man took me up and supported me; Simkin said</p>
               <p>"Don't kill the woman quite," and immediately the prisoner seized him by the collar, and gave him a push as he was coming to my help. She pushed him in the stomach, and said she would do the same to him if he came to my assistance. I did not see that it hurt him. I was taken up stairs, and saw him soon after in his own room: he went out, came home, and was in bed with me by ten o'clock, and next morning, when he awoke, he complained of a pain in his stomach. I got him some warm gin and water, which he drank. Mr. Jenkins, the doctor, saw him. He was ruptured, and had a gravel complaint; he died about half-past eight o'clock on Wednesday morning. I do not think the blow the prisoner gave him could have hurt him.</p>

            . I live in White Horse-court. On this night I was in Simkins's company at an ale-house for twenty minutes after this occurred; he was very drunk; he had been drinking all day, and was drunk the night before also. I saw him at ten o'clock on Tuesday night - he had been bled, twelve leeches were ordered by his doctor.

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Rosemary-lane. On Tuesday, the 3d of August, about the middle of the day, I saw the deceased, he was labouring under an inflammation of the bowels, and died on Wednesday morning. He appeared to me on Tuesday to have been drinking the day before. I opened his body with Mr. Canstall. The first morbid appearance was an inflammation in the intestines, called the choler; upon opening which, we found about three pints of liquid, the consequence of mortification: this may have been produced by intoxication, or violence; my opinion is, that external violence was used; it is impossible to say the cause of his death; he was the most healthy subject I ever saw, considering his age. If external violence produced his death, it would happen within the time at which it is said he received the injury. His lungs were perfectly sound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you form your opinion from your own observation, or from what you have heard - A. From observation; I don't allow him to have been a diseased subject. A cough could not produce such consequences. Falling on his stomach, in a state of intoxication, might produce it. I did not observe that he was ruptured; that would have no effect. If the inflammation was caused by violence, he would certainly complain of pain immediately. There was a blood-vessel broken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have heard that he was ruptured, had a cough, and a complaint in the bladder; that he received a blow or push, not particularly violent, and fell, either from that or intoxication - Would a blow of that description produce the symptoms you saw - A. I think not. It<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160020"></xptr>appears probable that external violence had been used, but such as described I consider not sufficient; and if there was no external violence, I consider that death must have arisen from internal causes. The liquor on his stomach appeared to me to be spirits.</p>

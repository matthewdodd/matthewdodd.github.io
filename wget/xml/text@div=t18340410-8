            . I am servant to Mr. Eastman. On the 13th of September he ordered me to turn the gelding in the field between five and six o'clock - I did so - I went there again at eleven in the morning, and it was still there - I saw it there about twelve o'clock on the 14th- I went there again on Sunday, the 15th, and it was gone - I saw a horse in the possession of Evans afterwards - that was master's horse which I had turned out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A. Were you present at any examination at the police-office? A. Yes: I do not know when the prisoner was apprehended - I cannot say whether he was ever discharged.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH EVANS. The horse in question was in my possession on the 15th of February - I am a bargeman - I cannot tell justly when the horse came into my possession - I had him twenty-two weeks - I bought it in the morning - it was either the 16th or 15th of November - I cannot recollect the day - I do not remember when the prosecutor claimed it - I know I had it twenty-two weeks in my possession - the officer took it out of my possession - I do not know his name - they fetched me out of my boat as I was going to bed - I bought the horse of the prisoner - I found out it was twenty-two weeks ago, because I used to take a load of hay to London every week - I cannot justly say that I brought a load every week - I cannot say on what day it was I saw the prisoner with the horse - I took no notice - I bought it at the White Lion, either on Monday or Tuesday - I saw the prisoner there about eleven or twelve o'clock - I bought the horse of him there - I cannot say whether I have ever said what day I bought it - he asked me 9l. for it, he said he had a horse to sell - I wanted one, and thought that would be too little - I gave him eight sovereigns for it - if the horse turned out well, I was to give him 10s. more, when he came up again; and he followed me to Paddington, stops about a month after, and asked me for the 10s. - I told him I would give it him when I came up again, as I was rather short of money - I do not know on what day of the week, or in what month that was - it might be November, but I will not be sure - I was driving along the canal from Paddington - I was not taking any hay for my master about that time - I do not recollect how many loads of hay I took about that time, - I had so many masters - I work for anybody - I am sure I had the gelding twenty-two weeks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you buy the horse at the White Lion, at Paddington? A. Yes; I always put up there - many boatmen put up there - I never saw the prisoner before that - I saw him, I think, about the next week or fortnight - I saw him every time I came to town, but I had not 10s. - other persons were present when I bought the horse - my father was present - I paid for it just as I went into the room - I tried the horse along the river side before I bought it - everything was done publicly; there was no attempt at concealment - I used the horse to tow my barge - I thought it was a bad bargain - I frequently saw the prisoner afterwards at the White Lion, and about Paddington.</p>
               <p>MR. DAWSON. Q. Your father was present? A. Yes; he bargained for the horse, and I paid the money - the prisoner said he bought the horse in Smithfield market, to run in an omnibus, and it was too small for him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where were you when he said he had the horse to sell? A. Against the White Lion - I went to look at it in the stables - I did not look at it before he said he had a horse to sell - I never paid him the 10s. - he came after me for it, and I should have given it him if I had had it - my father is in Staffordshire.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner at 127, Edgware-road, on the 16th of February - I went up stairs - I found him standing in the room, and said, "Well, Peter, is this you?" - he said, "Yes" - I said, "You must accompany me to the station-house" - he came with me directly, and on our way I told him I took him on suspicion of horse-stealing - he made no reply, but on arriving at the station-house, I confronted him with Evans, who was there in custody, and who immediately said he was the person who sold him the horse; at the same time saying to him, "This is a pretty hobble you have brought me into, about this horse" - Bradley replied, "I cannot help it; I bought the horse in the market" - he said he sold it to Evans - he did not say at what time he bought it; nor did he then say at what market.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know if he has been in custody on this charge before? A. He was - I do not know by what officer; he was taken before the magistrate at Union-hall - I believe the same prosecutor appeared against him - I was not there - it was on the 14th of January - he was remanded until the 21st, and again, I think, until the 24th - I am acquainted with him by seeing him about the Edgeware-road - I cannot say what business he followed - I cannot say whether he returned to his residence in the Edgeware-road - I found him there a month afterwards - I do not suppose he absconded.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Evans before the magistrate on the first occasion? A. No; the property could not be found on the first occasion - I believe that was the cause of his being discharged.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you present at the examination? A. Not at Union-hall - I do not know myself of his being at Union-hall.</p>

            . I am second clerk at the police-office, Union-hall. I heard a deposition read over to the prisoner, by Mr. Edwin, the chief clerk - this is Mr. Edwin's handwriting - (looking at it) - this is the magistrate's signature.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why has not the prisoner himself signed it? A. The prisoner seldom or ever signs his own state<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100017"></xptr>ment; it has never been a custom - he was not asked to sign it - Mr. Edwin took it down - the magistrate was on the bench - he told the prisoner he need not say anything unless he pleased - I was in the office when Mr. Edwin took it down - I was near enough to hear what the prisoner said, but not to see that Mr. Edwin took it down correctly - I cannot undertake to say he took it correctly - the prisoner said he bought the horse in Smithfield market of a tall thin young man; he did not know who it was.</p>

            . I am a stable-keeper, and live with Mr. Smith, at the Royal Oak, Back-hill, Hatton-garden - I am in the habit of attending Smithfield market regularly - to the best of my recollection I was there on Friday, the 13th of September - I saw the prisoner buy an old horse there - I do not know the person he bought it of- it was a brown poor horse; a middling sized horse - I saw it walked myself - I bid the man 6l. for it - the prisoner bought it for 8l. - I saw him pay the man the money - I generally ask the name of persons I buy of - they give a name - I have repeatedly bought horses of persons who are strangers - I walked with the prisoner - he said he would give him 8l. for it, if it was a good worker in a town cart - I stood by till the horse was put into a cart and taken out again - he said to me, "Brown, will you go and take anything to drink? I think I shall get 1l. or 2l. by this horse"- he offered 8l., and I went with him into the Bull's Head, and he paid him what I supposed to be 8l., but I did not count the money - the Bull's Head is at the corner of St. John-street - I think it was between three and four o'clock - it was an open sale; there was no concealment whatever - I offered the money myself for it - they did not close the bargain until it was tried in harness, and the man said, "If you try it, you must pay the expense of trying it, whether you buy him or no" - I afterwards saw the prisoner pay the money to the same man; he was a tall thin man - it was more than I would give for it - he asked 10l. for it - I was not in the prisoner's company after that day - I did not leave him directly - I have seen the horse he is accused of stealing - it is decidedly the same horse, but it was in a deal better condition; the marks and the colour are the same.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On what day was this? A. On the Friday; to the best of my recollection it was the 13th - it was in the week after Barnet fair, which makes me recollect the time - Barnet fair is on the 4th of September - I saw the horse the prosecutor claims to-day.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL EASTMAN. The horse is over at the New Inn - I do not know whether he has seen it - I value it at 12l.</p>
               <p>W. J. BOWSER. The hostler was dressing it at the New Inn-yard.</p>
               <p>MR. DAWSON. Q. Are you aware whether it is usual to keep a book at Smithfield to enter the names of people who sell horses? A. It is, if people will go to that expense, but it is not done once in a hundred times, if persons appear respectable.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. You saw the hostler dressing the horse in the New Inn: was it pointed out to you, or did you know it yourself? A. I knew it myself; at a distance I said that was the horse.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you know it was at the New Inn? A. Some of the witness said, "Come along, let us go and see the horse," and before I got down the yard I recognised it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you positive as to the day of the month on which you saw the horse sold? A. I am not - it was on a Friday: it must be either the 12th or 19th - I do not know what day of the week Barnet fair was - it was in September.</p>

            . I am hostler at the White Lion stables, Edgeware road - I know the prisoner - I do not know how he gets his living - I have seen him about there a good many times - there are stables with room enough for sixty horses - it is open to any person who chooses to bring horses there - I have seen the prosecutor's horse this morning - that horse was at the White Lion four or five nights - the prisoner brought it there - I do not know the day of the month - I should think it was about six months ago, as near as I can guess - I could swear to the horse - he rode it about ever so many different times - he made no concealment; he offered him for sale to three or four - he asked 10l. for him, but he made 8l. or 8l. 10s. of him - I was present when he sold it in the yard, and know he did sell it to a man named Evans, who paid him the money in the house - I know Evans very well; he used our house - I have been there six years - he offered it to Mr. Franks, Mr. Pitcher, and, I think, to Mr. Ambrose, and different people besides.</p>
               <p>MR. DAWSON. Q. Just try and recollect when it was he brought the horse to your stables; do you know the month, at all? A. No: I cannot tell - it was about six months as near as I can tell - I cannot tell whether is was five or four months ago - I will not swear anything at all about it - I am quite sure he had it there, and am quite sure he sold it there - I do not know whether Evans knew the prisoner before - I should think it was nearly five months ago - I am no friend of the prisoner's - I have seen him repeatedly, and heard many people call him by his name - I think he was five nights there with the horse - he told me he had bought it at Smithfield - I did not see any advertisement - I heard Webster say there was an advertisement - I did not tell the prisoner of it - I am sure he sold it to Evans.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you in the habit of making an entry when a horse is taken in by you? A. Yes; I always settle with mistress once a week - I cannot tell the day of the month - I dare say I could tell if I had my book here - the horse was taken to the stable on Friday night - I saw the horse about an hour ago over the way - it was the same horse as I saw Evans buy of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a hay salesman, at No. 3 Wharf, Paddington. I only know the prisoner by seeing him walking backwards and forwards - he offered me a horse for sale - I cannot justly tell when - it is the same horse which is at the New Inn; but I do not know justly the time, as I did not take particular notice - he sold it to Evans about a week after he offered it to me - I thought it would not suit me - he asked me £9 for it - I did not see the prisoner use the horse at all - I went with him to look at it.</p>
               <p>Mr. DAWSON. Q. He sold it to Evans about a week after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100018"></xptr>he had offered it to you? A. Yes; Evans being a neighbour of mine, came and asked if I knew who had a horse to sell, and I recommended Evans to him to buy it - he did not tell me how long had he had it, or where he bought it - I saw no hand-bills respecting it - I cannot recollect in what month he offered it to me - I took no particular notice of it- it was the latter end of the summer, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not in the winter? A. I cannot tell - I do not notice such things - I could tell if I was to look back in my business, because I recollect, I had a horse died about that time, and I wanted to replace him - I have not brought my book with me - I do not know that I can recollect justly the month my horse died.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Edward Jones, a linendraper in Aldgate. On the 8th of February, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner and her mother came in together to buy some Welsh flannel some I rish linen and check—they bought some and paid me for it—they were there about half an hour—about five minutes after they were gone I missed some muslin—they had been close by where it was—I went in pur<lb></lb>suit, and came up with the prisoner's mother in the Minories, sitting on the steps of a door—she had no property—I and an officer went in search of the prisoner, but did not find her—I then went myself and found her in the Minories, and gave her in charge—I fancied it was her that took the property from the manner in which she leaned towards the counter, and I heard her draw something from the counter—and I missed a piece corre<lb></lb>sponding exactly with this—I believe it is my master's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I saw the prisoner in Mr. Jones's shop—she was asked about this muslin, and said it was to be found at her home—she went with me, and pointed out this on the bed in the room where she said it was—she walked before me all the way to the house—her mother gets her bread by selling second-hand clothes in Rosemary-lane.</p>

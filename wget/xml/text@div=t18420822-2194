                  </hi>. I am assistant to my father, John Dale, carman, of Stoney-lane, Tooley-street, Borough. On the 10th of January, 1838, the prisoner was in our employ as carman, and was sent to the sugar-house, Lambeth-street, for two hogsheads of sugar, one to be taken to Mr. Sayers, St. Dunstan's-hill, and the other to Mr. Davis, in Cullum-street—as he was gone longer than proper, I went to the corner of Cullum-street, and found the cart standing there—a man named Garrett got out of it, and ran away—he was afterwards tried here—the prisoner was standing by the side of the cart, and as soon as Garrett ran away the prisoner ran away also—there was a tilt over the cart, but Garrett could not get up without the prisoner knowing it, as he must get in at the front—the prisoner stood on the pavement, about two feet from the cart—I have not seen him since till within the last three months—when I saw him I gave information—I drove the cart to Mr. Davis's warehouse, Cullum-street, and found the two hogsheads in the cart, the tin off one hole in the hogshead, and a bag on one side, containing 83lbs. of sugar, of the same quality as that in the hogshead, which we found 831bs. deficient.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman, on Monday the 20th of December, I was crying five, in Broad-street, and the prosecutor called from a two pair of stairs, do not make any alarm, but go round, there are some thieves in my back yard; I called for Hall to go with me, and went to the back door, and placed him at one of the garden gates, so I went round to the other back gate of Mr. Hicks's, and there I met two of them coming out: the back gate I went to is in a court or alley, I do not know the name of it, and when I came round, the prisoner at the bar and another man rushed out of the gate, I cannot say who the other man was; the gate leads from Mr. Whiting's premises, and I cried out to Hall, here are the thieves, with that the tall one made a shove, and I had liked to have knocked him down, he was in the corner, and I knocked the prisoner down, and as he was laying upon his back, thought I, I will have one of you, I was lifting my stick at the other man, and he fired a pistol at me, I heard the ball whistle past my ear, then they both run away to the top of Butcher-row, I cried stop thief, and fell down, and the other man that was along with the prisoner, turned and ran back, he ran by me when I tumbled down, and ran up Brook-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Not towards the prosecutor's house? - No; they then said they had got the prisoner, then I came up to him, and the man said he had got a pistol, I searched him, and took this pistol primed and loaded out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the man that you first knocked down? - Yes, I can swear to him.</p>
               <p>When he was taken, was his dress the same? - Yes; I knew him before, I have seen him come home all hours in the night, and come close by my box: I found this pistol upon the prisoner, and Hall took up a crow that he threw out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no thorough-fare there but that leading to Harriett's garden and the prosecutor's? - No other. This is the loading of the pistol.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Council. Where did you see the man that you suspected came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120025"></xptr> from the prosecutor's first? - This man rushed out of Mr. Hicks's garden, the gardens join, it was not upon Mr. Whiting's premises.</p>
               <p>Were not other people looking about besides you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You knew the prisoner before? - Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>Did you know him at first? - I knew him as soon as I had him down, I had my lanthorn in my hand.</p>
               <p>After he got up, did he tell you who he was? - I knew him very well.</p>
               <p>Did you call him by his name? - No.</p>
               <p>Was he searched? - I only took the pistol out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing else in his pocket? - I did not look for any thing more after I took the pistol out.</p>

               <p>Do you know or not know, that none of the property was found upon him? - Nothing but the pistol.</p>
               <p>Was this the same man that you knocked down first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any mark upon him? - I knocked him down once, and he did not get up, then I made another blow to keep him down.</p>
               <p>Yet you say there was no mark upon him when he was taken? - How could there be?</p>
               <p>There was not, was there? answer the question. - Not that I know of, for he warded off the blow with his crow.</p>
               <p>Did he offer to stop and be searched? - He offered it at the Justices.</p>
               <p>He had been in your custody from the time he was taken to the watchouse? - Yes.</p>

Hall! here are the thieves; before I got to the corner I heard one pistol go off, I run by the alley, and by the garden gate I picked up this crow, as they run I suppose it dropped from out of their hands; I met the other watchman, and we went towards the street, and in the street we met another watchman, who called stop thief! his name was Hamwood, and he said, I have shied my stick at him, and he is gone on; and in about a minute they came up with the prisoner Bruce, and the man had him fast in his arms, Harris put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a pistol that was loaded and primed.</p>

               <p>I live in Bishopgate-street, I have known the prisoner about five or six months; I keep a public house, I never knew any thing of him but as a customer; I gave him an order to make me a wig, he brought it home; as my wife was taken in labour, I desired him to stay an hour, I paid him for the wig about three, I believe it might be about four when he went from our house.</p>
               <p>- CLARIDGE sworn.</p>
               <p>I never saw him twice in my life, I saw him at Mr. Mills's, that was on the 19th on Monday morning between two and three; Mr. Mills said, now Mr. Bruce I will pay you for the wig, they staid till past three o'clock, and Mills asked him to stay with him all night and not go home; the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, and said, I have what will protect me through the fields, and he took out a pistol and put it in his pocket again, and staid about a quarter of an hour, and went home.</p>

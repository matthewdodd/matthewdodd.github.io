               <p>of linen—they did not say for whom—I knew that they worked for Messrs. Pellatt and Watts, of Tenter-street, Moorfields, who are in the habit of sending for orders every day—I told Scott to go into the lower warehouse to hook on the box—I went up to the crane, and left Scott in the lower warehouse to hook on the box, and Webb was outside with the cart, in the yard—while I was looking out at the loop-hole I saw Webb come out with the linen, and put it into the cart—he shut the cart up—it was a covered cart—I came down, and then the prisoners were both at the cart—I suspected what I saw Webb take out was linen, and I said "I must have a mark out of the box," meaning the box of linen that they had just put into the cart—Scott said I had already taken it out—I said, "Yes, but I must take the number out;" I wanted to get into the cart, but Scott jumped up, and would not let me get in—Webb was then standing by—I told my master, and we went to Pellatt and Watts—Scott was there unloading the cart, and Webb was carrying the goods into the ware-house—(the parcel I saw Webb take out was in blue paper)—I asked Webb what he had done with the parcel he took out in a blue paper—he said he had taken nothing at all out—I said he had—Scott said it was no such thing; if we had lost two pieces of cloth, they had not got them.</p>

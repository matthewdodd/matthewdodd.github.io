On the 19th of May, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for a sixpenny row of beads. I took them from the door, and he picked out a row - I hung them up again. He walked about the door, backward and forward - I lost him all in a minute, and was told the beads were taken from the door. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>JOHN ANDERSON. I live next door to Mr. Haskins, and watched the prisoner lurking about the door, and saw him take a quantity of beads off the door-post - He put them in a handkerchief and ran off with them. I told the constable - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COOK. I am a constable. Anderson described the prisoner to me, but I could not find him; I told Anderson to keep a look-out, the next day he sent for me, and pointed the prisoner out - I secured him, and asked him where the beads were? he said he never had any, but admitted having been to the shop.</p>

I am a widow, and keep a chandler's shop, in Royal Mint-street On Saturday, 29th March, the prisoner came for a halfpenny worth of coffee, and a halfpenny worth of sugar—he threw me down a half crown—I am positive the prisoner is the man—I took the half crown—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he left the shop—after he left I took the half crown out of the till—I looked at it, and ascertained it was bad—I had put it first into the till, and there was no other money there—I took it out again in two minutes—I found it was bad—I called my daughter, and she looked at it, and said, "Any one could see this is bad"—I put it on a back shelf, apart from other money—this was on Saturday night—on the following Monday I saw the prisoner walk up and down for about three hours, looking into my shop, and into my sister's, next door—I saw him through the window, and I went to the street door, and looked after him—I am sure he is the man—he came into my shop about 3 o'clock—he asked for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of bread, and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of butter—he tendered me another half crown, which I found to be bad—I told him so, and told him he was a very bad young man, to come and pass bad money on a lone woman like me on Saturday night—he persisted in saying he was not the person—I sent for the police<lb></lb>man, and gave him the two half crowns.</p>

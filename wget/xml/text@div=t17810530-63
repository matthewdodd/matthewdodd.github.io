On Sunday the 13th of May, at about half after ten o'clock at night, an acquaintance of mine came to the gate with a horse he was going to put into a field: he said, as it was dark, if I would go with him a little way, he would treat me with a pot of beer. When I had got with him about an hundred or an hundred and fifty yards from the gate, I was collared; but who the person was, I did not know, it was so dark. I asked, if they were going to rob a poor turnpike-man? Just at that instant, there came a flash of lightening; and I saw one of the company particularly. They let me go when it lightened. I went back to the turnpike-house; I unlocked the door, and left the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300070"></xptr> key outside. I went up to the fire-place to look for a poker, in case any body should come in upon me: before I could find a poker, I was knocked down by the prisoner

That brother came into the turnpike-house just after we had tied the prisoner's hands, and asked what was the matter? and I charged him with being one of the men that had stopped me. When the brother came back, he said he had never seen the prisoners: but he told a different story before the justice.</p>

               <p>I am a collar-maker. On Sunday, the 13th of May, I was going to a field with a horse. It was very dark. The turnpike-man was going a little way with me. Somebody came up and collared him, and bid him stop. He said he hoped they would not rob a poor turnpike-man. They made no answer, but went off towards the turnpike. There was flash of lightning just then; but I was going off, and did not see them. I took the horse to the field. In coming back, soon after, I heard the cry of, Murder! I found Massey at the door of the turnpike-house. He said he had locked two men in, that had knocked him down. I went in with him, and we laid hold of the prisoners. A brother of the prisoners came in about ten minutes after the door was opened, and wanted to know what was the matter. Massey said he knew that was one that had stopped him on the road; and we secured him. He pretended he did not know the prisoners. They were stroaked down by a person, but no arms were found upon them.</p>

When I got there, they had opened the door, and seized the prisoners. He said they had knocked him down in the toll-house, and demanded his money. Their brother came in afterwards.

               <p>I am brother to the two prisoners. On Sunday, the 13th of May, we took a walk to Kentish Town. We had two bottles of ale. Then we came to Mr. Armitage's; then we went to the Nag's-Head; there we drank till about half after ten; then we were going home, by Battle-bridge Road. In going past the toll-house, (I was before my brothers twenty or thirty yards) there was a cry of, Murder! they both returned back to the toll-house, and I turned back after them; and they directly took me in charge. Massey said he had seen me with some people that had stopped him before. I asked them what was the reason of my brothers being tied? All the answer they gave me was, I should know time enough to-morrow. I did not know what my brothers were charged with till next morning.</p>
               <p>Were your brothers and you in com pany together? - Yes; I happened to walk a little before them.</p>
               <p>Had you parted company? - No.</p>
               <p>You had got before them twenty or thirty yards? - It might be more. Not hearing my brothers, I turned back, and then I heard the cry of, Murder! upon which I went to the turnpike.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you heard the cry of Murder? - It might be five or seven minutes. I walked down the road towards Gray's-Inn Lane, hearing the cry of Murder! I then missed my brothers, and turned back again, thinking that something had happened.</p>
               <p>What do you think they stopped for? - They went back, after having been through the toll-gate, upon the cry of Murder: they went back to assist the person that was crying Murder. The gate-keeper was crying Murder by himself, as I understood.</p>
               <p>Do you know how they came into the toll-house? - They were pushed in by the keeper of the gate, as I understood from them; I did not see it; it was too far off.</p>

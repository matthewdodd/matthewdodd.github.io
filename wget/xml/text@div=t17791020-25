               <p>I am a laundress in Lincoln's-Inn. One Brent, a shoe-maker and his wife, lived in the room the goods were taken out of; I went with Ballard's mother to the room on Saturday the 16th, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and found the door broke open; we examined the room; there were then in the room all the things mentioned in the indictment; we nailed up the door and put a padlock on the outside; the prisoner was afterwards taken, and the looking glass, which was in the room when we nailed it up, was found in her lodging in White's-alley; the prisoner said she wanted to be hanged, and cried. The glass was delivered to me by the landlady of the house where the prisoner lodged.</p>
               <p>How soon was this after the door was nailed up? - The same evening, between seven and eight o'clock at night. I am deputy landlady to the house.</p>

               <p>I live in the house. The prisoner came in the morning of that day to my room to wash for me. At about five in the evening she wanted a dish of tea, and went down to fetch some; after staying an hour I went down to see for her and bring up some water; I met her on the stairs; she seemed surprised and stood like a statue; she took the thing out of my hand and went and brought up the water; she said she had not brought the tea; I asked her where she had been; she said she did not know, she believed she had been to the devil, but she would go and fetch the tea; when she had been gone about five minutes I heard somebody walking softly along the passage that leads to the room the goods were taken from; I went to see who it was, and to my great surprise I saw the prisoner going down stairs with a bolster, pillow, bed quilt, and sheet in her lap; I laid hold of her, and brought her into my room, and called down my father and mother who lived one pair of stairs higher; she ran away; my father went after her and brought her back.</p>

               <p>I was at the fastening up of the room that was robbed. Stokes stopped the prisoner and called me; I saw the things that were found upon her; they were in the room when it was fastened up in the morning; they are Mr. Eaton's property. The prisoner cried out Lord, what have I done, what have I done, what have I done! I went up into the room, and missed all the things that are mentioned in the indictment; the door was broke off the hinges. Stokes and I, when we went up to the room, left her in care of my wife; when I came down she was gone; I pursued her, took her, and delivered her to a constable.</p>

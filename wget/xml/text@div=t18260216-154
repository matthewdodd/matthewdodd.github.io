On the 13th of January I was employed by Johnson and Co. to remove some rum from the West India Docks - three puncheons were to go to Symonds' wharf, and one to Beals' wharf; I attended at the docks to see it loaded in my waggon - there were eight puncheons in the waggon, which was to be driven by Snellgrove; he returned that night with the waggon, but I did not see him.</p>

            , they live in Savage-gardens. The prisoner, Snellgrove, brought the waggon, with five puncheons of rum, to their door on the 13th of January, about half-past six o'clock in the evening - Frost brought an empty cart at the same time - I knocked the bung out, and guaged four of the puncheons; I guaged three of them the next morning, at Symonds' wharf, between nine and eleven o'clock - there was then a deficiency of fourteen gallons in the three.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you guage them more than once? A. Yes; three of them I guaged again at Symonds' wharf - and there was a deficiency in them of fourteen gallons.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the night of the 13th of January, I was in Cable-street, Whitechapel; I observed a cart stop which took my attention, as the property was covered over in a singular way; it stopped a few doors from Back-church-lane, opposite the door of one Lewis - I saw Dalton go to the cart tail, and take this large stone bottle out - as he went towards the door, I heard Lewis say, "I will have nothing to do with it;" Lewis would have known my if he had seen me - I secured Dalton and the bottle, and put them into Lewis' door - there was a person in the cart when I first perceived it, but as I went toward the door again, a man got out of it in a hurry, and escaped - I went into the cart, and found two more bottles, covered with horse-cloths - I went to Mr. Stones', next morning, and apprehended the two prisoners; I cannot swear to their being in the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Did not Dalton tell you, he was merely unloading it as a porter? A. It was words to that effect - that being on the spot, he was employed to unload the cart; I did not see him in the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ROBERTS. Q. Did not Snellgrove come with you without hesitation? A. He would have come, but Mr. Stones brought him; I saw it was Mr. Stones' cart, and knowing him, I took it there; the place is in the county of Middlesex.</p>
               <p>RICHARD STONES re-examined. Q. You have told us Frost and Snellgrove were your servants, and this cart and waggon both took out rum? A. Yes; the cart took out another puncheon of rum belonging to another merchant; these horse cloths belonged to Snellgrove's horses.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Then the cart was out with another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160076"></xptr>>puncheon of other rum? A. Yes; it was going to Beals' wharf - the cart and horse were mine, but these cloths are never used by other horses.</p>

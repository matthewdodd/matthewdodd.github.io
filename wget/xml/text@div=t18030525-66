             sworn. - On the 25th of April I was sent for to Mr. Mobbs's, on the death of my aunt; the prisoner was in the family as nurse to Mrs. Mobbs; we were sitting at tea, and the second dish I poured out I missed the teaspoon the prisoner was using with her tea; I asked where the spoon was; it could not be found; I called to my husband, who was outside the door; I told him I had missed a tea-spoon from the table, and he immediately went and fetched a constable, James Geary; when I missed the spoon, she went out of my uncle's house to the next door; the constable went after her to the next door.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GEARY sworn. - I am a constable; I was sent for on the 25th of April, about five in the afternoon, to take up the prisoner; I found her at the next door to Mr. Mobbs's; I searched her, and found the things upon her mentioned in the indictment. - (They were produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was employed to look after this woman; I was desired by Mrs. Mobbs's nephew to take care of what things I could when her breath was out of her body; this man and woman came in, and brought a constable; the ring and other things I should have given to the parties, Mrs. Mobbs's relations, who desired me to take care of them; there were three 5l. Bank-notes I gave up.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Porter.) Did she give you the three 5l. notes? - A. No, she gave them to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Constable.) Did she give you the three 5l. notes? - A. She threw them at me with the pocket half an hour before I took her into custody; I was sent for again to take her into custody.</p>

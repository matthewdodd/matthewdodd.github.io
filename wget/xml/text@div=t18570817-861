                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I was in the St. Martin's work-house on 10th July—I slept in the "F" wad that night—the prisoner also slept there that night—he was strapped down to his bed about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—Richard Empson slept in that room—I think I awoke about 5 o'clock on the Saturday morning, but I could not say for certain, as there was no clock in the room—when I awoke, I saw the prisoner struggling with the deceased at the deceased's bed—the prisoner was then up—in his left hand he had one of the straps he had been fastened down with; in the right hand he had a staff or little stick; I do not know whether it was wood or iron, and I saw him with his right hand make a sort of stab towards the head of the deceased, and the blood flowed directly—he struck at his head three or four times—the blood flowed from the deceased on to the prisoner—I ran from the room to get assistance—there were three other persons in the room while this was going on—they were in bed—I cannot say whether a person named Dixon had left the room before the struggle began, but when I awoke he was not in the room—I came back with assistance—the prisoner was then on the staircase—he had not anything in his hand then—I saw him in the yard afterwards; he ran after me—he had a shovel in his hand then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the master of St. Martin's workhouse. On 10th July, about 11 o'clock, the prisoner was brought into that house, by order of the relieving officer—he was soon after seen by the surgeon—I at first</p>

               <p>considered that he was a person capable of being set to work, but he refused to do that—in consequence of a communication made to me by the person who superintends the labour of the paupers, I sent the prisoner to what is called the "F" ward, about 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day—about half past 4 o'clock I was writing at the desk, and he rushed into the office, and laid hold of me by the arms at the back, and said that somebody was after him to murder him—I released myself from him, and directed him to be taken to a ward, and a strait waistcoat to be put upon him—the surgeon was then sent for; he came, and sanctioned the putting the strait waistcoat on him—I allowed Dixon to sit up that night with the prisoner, at the desire of Empson—Empson was about seventy years old—he was wardsman—I saw the prisoner after he had the strait waistcoat on, at about 10 o'clock at night—he then complained to me that some persons wanted to kill him—he was not in an excited state, he talked to me calmly—I stayed there about five or ten minutes, talking to him—he was strapped to the bed; I thought that necessary, to keep him from hurting himself or other people—I saw no more of him after that until 6 o'clock the next morning, when I was aroused—I found him in the yard, with a shovel on his shoulder—he was then in a violent, excited state—the strait waistcoat was still on him, but the straps loosened—he had blood upon him—he was throwing bricks about the yard—I sent for the policeman, and he was taken into custody—I then went up into the "F" ward; I there found Empson lying on his right side, blood was running out of his mouth, and from wounds in his head—he could not speak—I immediately sent far a doctor—I had him lifted upon the bed, and had his wounds washed—he died in about a quarter of an hour from the first time I saw him—I picked up part of a poker in the room, near where he was lying—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—it was covered with blood—I cannot say whether it belonged to the place, I never saw it before—after the prisoner was brought up into the room, and the strait waistcoat fastened to the bed, I asked him why he had done such a thing; he said, "He tried to kill me, and I killed him"—Empson was dead then; his body was there when the prisoner made that observation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of St. Martin's workhouse. On the morning of 10th July I saw the prisoner, about 10 o'clock—I had a long conversation with him, to ascertain the state of his mind; I had understood from the relieving officer that something was amiss with him—the first part of the time he apparently gave quite rational answers—just as I was about leaving him, he said, "I have been accused by persons in the street, who have been following me, of very abominable crimes;" not, perhaps, in those terms, but in more gross ones—I had a little more con<lb></lb>versation with him at that time, and from those delusions I thought he was not right in his mind, but he appeared to be quite calm and quiet, and therefore I did not direct any restraint to be put upon him—later in the day I received a note from the master of the workhouse, to come down, as the prisoner had become very violent, and he did not know what to do with him—I went to the "F" ward; the strait waistcoat was then on him, but I advised a persistence in that restraint, believing, from the answers he gave me, from his violence towards the master, and his incoherent language, that he was a dangerous lunatic—I directed some cooling medicine to be given him—a little before 6 o'clock in the morning I was sent for by the porter of the workhouse—the deceased was still alive when I saw him—there were several punctured wounds about his head; they were such</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185708170045"></xptr>
               <p>wounds as would have been produced by this instrument—he died of that violence about ten minutes after I arrived—I had some farther conversa<lb></lb>tion with the prisoner after he had been put under restraint again; he said that this man had attempted to kill him; that persons were going to kill him; he was prepared to die; he knew he should have to die that day, and that he should have to be fastened on his corpse—judging from what I had seen on the previous day, and what I saw of him that morning, I came to the conclusion that he was perfectly insane, and incapable of controlling his actions by reason.</p>

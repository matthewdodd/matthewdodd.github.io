                  </hi>. I am a jeweller; the prisoner was in my service; he left me about 25th May. On 16th March I missed a valuable diamond ring from the window—on 3rd June I began to take stock, and I missed nine valuable rings, and on the following Thursday I missed thirteen pair of ear<lb></lb>rings; I have seen one of the rings since—this is it—it has my writing on it—I lost it from the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to Mr. Barker, a pawnbroker in Hounds<lb></lb>ditch—I have two brooches, a jet necklace, and four pair of earrings—the necklace and three pair of earrings were pawned on 19th Jan.; another pair of earrings the same day, and the brooch on the 25th, all by the prisoner, with the exception of one pair of earrings, which were pawned by his wife—I know him and his wife perfectly well.</p>

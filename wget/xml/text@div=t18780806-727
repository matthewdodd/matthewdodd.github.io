                  </hi>. I am a plumber, of 11, Acton Street, Gray's Inn Road—on 23rd June I went to bed about 10.30, having locked up the house, and secured the kitchen door into the area—I was awoke about 12.30 by the police, who proceeded through the kitchen into the house, and brought out the prisoner—I found the kitchen door open, and an inner door forced, but nothing was disturbed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 292 <hi rend="italic">G</hi>). I was on duty in Acton Street about 12.25, and saw the prisoner loitering in front of Nos. 11, 12, and 13—I stepped back into another street, where I could see, and saw him walk down two or three times, and then put his hands on the railings of No. 11, and jump down into the area—he had his hat on—I saw no one else in the street—I looked down in two or three minutes, and saw the outer door open, and the prisoner forcing the inner door—he saw me, and laid down beside the door—he got up again, and called out "Charlie," and put his shoulder against the inner door and burst it in—I called the prosecutor up, and went down and found the prisoner in the kitchen, going into the area—I caught hold of him, and asked him what he was doing there—he said that somebody had thrown his hat over—his hat was then on his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The area is the ordinary depth—his hat was on when he jumped over—on the way to the station he said that a man had thrown his hat down the area, and he had no intention of taking anything from the house.</p>

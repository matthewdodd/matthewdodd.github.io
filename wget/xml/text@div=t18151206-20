            . I am an officer of Queen square ofice. I happened to be in the public house when Smithers brought Slate in. In consequences of what pased there, I went with Brown and him to Bureau's stables; I did not before know it was his stable, but I knew him well. When we went there, we found the stable door locked; we asked Bureau whether he had seen any hay that evening? and he said, no I looked behind the counter, and saw Surgery lying upon a kind of bed; and I took him into custody. I sent Smithers away with him, and I staid untill he came back. Bureau at that time was sitting by the fire side, and apparently very ill. When Smithers. returned, I asked Bureau for the key of the stable. Nothing wsa said while Smithers were gone, to ny knowledge. His wife went down to the stable with me. as he was lame' and when we went into the stable I discovered two horses feeding on hay; there was no racks. Looking into a kind of grain hole, which is appeared to be, I saw a whole truss, and at the other end a large dirty great coat spread out; and I suspected some person was under, and on moving it, I found

             re-examined. Q. Blye has told us of a hole which came through from another loft; was that on your master's premises - A. Yes; it was a place coming from the corn loft into the hay loft, and which I fastened up on the Sunday morning.</p>

               <p>THE COURT Then proceeded to sum up the evidence, and informed the jury, that in this case, the principle evidence to criminate the prisoners, was that of an accessary, whose testimony ought upon all occasions to be received with the greatest care and doubt, and ought not to be credited, unless bourae out by a coincidence of facts, and accompanied by corrobirative circumstances. In the first place, no evidence at all had gone so far as to criminate Surgey; and in the next place, the jury would consider whether a case of burglary was established against any of the prisoners. The accomplice Brown, who is the only person who afforded any proof upon that part, had sworn that he was talking with Surgey and Slate, when Wood came up; and then they agreed to go to get some of Mr. Willingham's hay; but when they got down the passage, the loft door was open; in his presence no violence was used, nor had it appeared at all how the partition between the corn room and hay loft had been broken down. In cases of burglary, though a man be at the end of the street watching to prevent detection, and was not at all present at the actual breaking, yet the law would consider him to be full as guilty, as the man who used the crow, or any other house breaking instrument. But in this case, in order to establish a burglary against the three it must be supposed that when they were talking together, and through not present with Wood, they were in contest with him.</p>
               <p>There had been no evidence to that fact, and that was a mere question of probability not supported by any fact.</p>
               <p>The next question would be, like the former, a question of probability, whether Wood broke into the stable!-and then, if he did, whether it was dark at the time. If upon these points, and doubts should arise, it in the duty of the jury to give that doubt to the prisoners. If however they were convinced that the hay was stolen by all or any of the first three prisoner then, and not till then would the question arise, whether Bureau had received the hay with a guilty knowledge of its being stolen.</p>

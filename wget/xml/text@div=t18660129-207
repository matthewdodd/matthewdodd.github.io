                  </hi>. I am the captain of the ship <hi rend="italic">Beautiful Star</hi>, now lying in the London Docks—on Thursday night I was in the Minories on my way home—the prisoner accosted me—I told her to go away, I would have nothing to do with her—I went a little further on, and she accosted me again—she got hold of me by the coat, and dragged me round—I left her, and went into a public-house across and had a glass of beer—while I was there, another woman came in and asked me for something to drink—I did not wish to have anything to do with her, but when I saw I could not get clear of her, I said, "Call for what you want, and 1 will pay for it"—I put my hand in my pocket, and then found I had been robbed of my money—I complained to the police immediately—the next morning a policeman brought me some Bank of England notes—I told him the numbers of the notes I had lost, and he said that they corresponded with those he had got—they were not shown to me.</p>

On Thursday night the pro<lb></lb>secutor came to me about ten minutes past 10—from information he gave me, I took the prisoner in the Minories, about half-past 12—I told her I should charge her with stealing a gold watch and chain and money, amounting to nearly 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a ship's captain—she refused to go to the station—I got the assistance of a metropolitan constable, and took her there—she put her hand to her breast—my brother constable took hold of that hand, and I the other—she threw herself on the ground and we had a struggle, and then. I took these six 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from her—we took her to the station in a cab—at the station she said the captain gave her the things—she gave a false address—the prosecutor identified the notes as his property—when I first saw him he was not intoxicated, but he was very much excited.</p>

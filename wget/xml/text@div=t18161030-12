            . I am a Smithfield drover. I received some beast on the 22nd of September, I received thirty-three from the last witness; they were not all marked the same way; but all had got H; there was a pole heiffer with B on the off rump and H on the off tutt.

I know something of the prisoner. In consequence of missing this, I searched all day on Monday, to no effect. I heard of it the next morning; I was at Smithfield, and a man said, he had found one, and found the man that was along with it. This person told me where she was, at a butcher's shop, in Westminster, named Stent. I went there; there I found the hide of the heiffer I had lost; it was marked, and the same colour. The prisoner was not there. Upon this, I went to the office at Queen-square, and I made an affidavit that that was the hide of the heiffer I lost.</p>

            . On the 21st of September last, I met the prisoner; he asked me if I thought that my master would consent for him to kill some beasts at my master's slaughter-house; I told him I did not know, but he had better go and ask him; he said he would. I remember a beast being brought; the prisoner brought a heiffer; I observed the mark on it H B; I helped him to tie it up in the slaughter-house, and we locked the doors, and went away. In about two hours after, I went, and saw the prisoner at work on it by himself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am charged with stealing a heiffer out of Smithfield-market, and I trust I shall be able to prove my innocence. I met a butcher that I knew perfectly well, and he asked me if I had any thing to do, and I was telling him that I had not, and he asked me if I could kill a heiffer for him, and I told him I could not give him a positive answer then, but I would go to Mr. Stent and ask him if he would let me kill it in his slaughter-house, and I met the young man, and asked him, and he told me that it was half-a-crown for killing it there; and I went to the butcher, and told him that I had seen Mr. Stent's young man, and he said it was half-a-crown for killing it there; he said very well, that would do, and he gave me a glass of liquor; he told me he had twenty-five altogether, and I should have the killing of them all. He then left me, and I went to Mr. Stent, and he told me I might go to his place, and kill it directly, then Mr. Stent's boy came, and helped me to drive her in, and tie her up in the slaughter-house, and then I came back and killed her, and when I came to take her to market, I was taken into custody.</p>

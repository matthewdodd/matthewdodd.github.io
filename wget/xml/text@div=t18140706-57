               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at your house on the 21st of May - A. Yes; she called in. I had known her before. I sent her up into Mr. Elgar's room myself. He was taken ill. She was there about a quarter of an hour. Mr. Elgar was in the room the whole time; he was so ill he could not speak. The prisoner went away when she came down from Mr. Elgar's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give any reason why she went away - A. She said she thought I looked cool upon her; perhaps I might, she appeared to me to be in liquor.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker; I produce the chain and seals.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get that chain and seal - A. I took it on the 23d of May last of the prisoner at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060033"></xptr>r. I am sure the prisoner is the person of whom I took it; she pledged it in the name of Ann Williams; I lent her thirty shillings upon them. They were worth about forty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What would you give for them - A. Not more than two pounds.</p>
               <p>Taunton. I am an officer. I got this watch at No. Little Union-street, Piccadilly. I apprehended the prisoner in Carnaby-street; I told her I suspected she had taken a gold watch belonging to Mr. Elgar. she denied knowing anything about the watch. I searched her, and found nothing about her; afterwards she told me where the watch was, and went with me to find the watch at No. 2, Little Union-street, Piccadilly. She said she had left it with a friend, deposited in a tea-caddy. I have had the watch ever since. She was with me when I took it out of the tea-caddy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Lawrence is a relation of mine. I had been there about a fortnight. Mr. Elgar came home exceeding tipsey; the watch he gave me; and through the death of my child, and its illness, I pledged the chain. I meaned to tell Mr. Elgar of it. He told me in the coach he did not wish to hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Elgar. How long have you known the prisoner - A. About fourteen years. I know nothing of her for the last four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her the watch - A. I am certain I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner before she was apprehended - A. Yes, once she called upon me at the Bank, saying, that she understood some suspicion had attached upon her on account of the watch. She said she had been ill, or she should have been with me before. She gave me her address; she referred me to two places where I might search her boxes; I told her probably I might call on her that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say that she had got the watch - A. She did not; she said she was poor, but honest. She informed me where she lived, that I might search her box. The watch that I lost I was in the habit of using daily.</p>
               <p>Q. to Taunton. Did she mention to you that Mr. Elgar ever gave her the watch - A. Never to me.</p>
               <p>JURY, Q. to Mr. Elgar. What was your illness, was it intoxication - A. I can hardly speak to that. I had been dining with the Governors of Pentonville school. I remember Mrs. Lawrence's daughter lighting me up into the room; I fell down. That is all that I remember. I am subject to the bile.</p>

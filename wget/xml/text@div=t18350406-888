               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Wilson's Defence (written.</hi>) On Saturday, 28th of February last, being in the town of Woolwich, and meeting with George Ellard, my fellow-prisoner, about nine o'clock in the evening, we went into the Hampshire Hog pub<lb></lb>lic-house, to take a glass together; and getting into conversation, we did not retire till near the hour of twelve. When proceeding homewards, in company with my said fellow-prisoner, we began talking of some geraniums I had at my house; when he, my fellow-prisoner, said he had planted two in the garden of the prosecutrix, in whose service he, my fellow-prisoner, had two months back lived as servant, and proposed, if I would accompany him over to the place, he would make me a present of one of them; and it not being far from my home, and at the same time not having proper com<lb></lb>mand of myself, in consequence of the liquor I had taken, I did not at the time see the impropriety of complying with his request, and finally accom<lb></lb>panied him to the place. When we got to the place, we found we could not get the geraniums without getting over the wall, which we accordingly did; but it being rather dark, and being in liquor, he, my fellow-prisoner, could not exactly find the place where he had set them, so we agreed to return back, and go home. Accordingly we left the place, and was proceeding homewards; but at a short distance from the place I came in contact with something, which threw me down; and on recovering my legs, found it to be a bundle, which we took home with us, and on examination we found it to contain wearing apparel; upon which discovery, he, my fellow-prisoner, wished me to keep it in my house till the morning, which I at first hesitated to do; but thinking there was nothing wrong, and my wife being from home, I consented, and in the morning, being Sunday, on my awaking and discovering what I had got, and nothing being mentioned in the neighbour-hood about any thing being lost, it was determined we should dispose of them; but my military duties engaging me the whole of Monday, and on the morning of Tuesday having to attend a concert, which ended at three o'clock in the afternoon, after which we came over the water to try to dis<lb></lb>pose of the property; and on returning home, being a great distance, and fearing to be late, we engaged a cab for our conveyance. When at the turnpike, in consequence of a dispute arising between my fellow-prisoner and the toll-keeper, we were taken into custody; and on arriving at the station-house, my fellow-prisoner being alarmed, he tried to make his es<lb></lb>cape, leaving me alone in the cab, where I remained till the return of the policeman and the cab-driver, who were accompanied by my fellow-pri<lb></lb>soner, whom they had captured. I have held my situation in the army upwards of eight years, and that with propriety and good conduct, which the master of the band and my commanding officer can testify; but through this unforseen circumstance I am fearful I have lost my situation, and my wife and two small children are deprived of a father, and all means of sup<lb></lb>port;</p>

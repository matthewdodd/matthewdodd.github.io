On the morning of the 16th of January we heard a knock at the door, about eight o'clock, before I got up, while my sister was dressing; (it is usual for my servant to answer the private door on week days) - David came into my room, took the key, and went down, and unlocked the cellar door; when she came up I asked her what she had been for - she said to remove some pans- I said I was there on Saturday night and nothing wanted moving; she went up and down several times, and said she had done no harm - my sister then went to the water-closet, and said the door was fast; David was then in the parlour, and said she would go - she went and let Bloomfield out - my sister was standing by the parlour door - no could pass without her seeing them - these articles were taken out of Bloomfield's apron, in my presence, while David was there; I asked her how she dared to do such a thing - she said if she had taken them she meant to return something for them - I said now I know how my other things went - she said she would make me suffer for saying she had taken my salts.</p>

             knocked at the door - David let her in, and then went down stairs, leaving her in the passage; I went and asked who she wanted - she said a person who took in needle-work - I went down the yard, staid some time, and then came back into the parlour; I could see who came from the water-closet, and I saw David let Bloomfield out. I then went to her and said "What have you got in your apron?" she made some answer but I did not hear what, but I felt there were some crockery ware; I took them into the parlour, and took them out - she gave no account how she came by them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BLOOMFIELD. The tea-pot and milk-pot were not in my lap. Witness. Yes, I took them out of your lap.</p>
               <p>Prisoner DAVID. A man came into the shop for half an ounce of tobacco while they were in bed - I had these articles in my hand, and gave them to this young girl to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160080"></xptr>>hold while I went down to get the tobacco, and she asked me to let her go to the water-closet. Did not you receive the money for the tobacco which I took of the man, and gave to you. Witness. No - I have no recollection of taking a farthing - it was earlier than the shop was usually opened - the prisoner got up sooner than usual that morning.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I took the prisoner in charge on the 16th of December - I asked David if there was any more property - she said there was a pair of salts at Mr. Phillips', No. 4, Woodstock-street - she had given them to Davies.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>DAVID's Defence. Davies had a cap and collar made by a woman in the kitchen - she asked for the money, and Davies said "If you will give me a pair of salts I will go and pawn them;" she kept one shilling, and I gave the woman the other shilling. I gave these things to the young woman to hold while I went down stairs - she saw my mistress, and did not want her to see her.</p>

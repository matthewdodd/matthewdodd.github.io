                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mr. Savill, in April last, at No. 7, Somerset-place, Camberwell; the prisoner was my mistress, she was the mother of a girl and a little boy, between three and four months old On Saturday morning, 18th April, I was in the kitchen with Georgiana Savill, the prisoner's niece, who was nursing the baby—the prisoner came down, took the child, and went out into the garden with it, saying that she was going to give it the breast—her eyes seemed very queer to me—she remained in the garden about a quarter of an hour; she then Came back with the child, with a shawl wrapped round it; I could not see whether it was dead or alive—she went up stairs into her bedroom; I do not know how long she remained—she came down, and went out—some time after that I thought I heard the child cry—I went up to the bedroom, and found the door locked—I went down, and got the key of the parlour door, which unlocked the bedroom door—when I first went in I did notice where the child was; I then saw it, with its face and hands in a basin of water—I felt it, it was cold—I screamed out, and the grandmother, who was staying in the house, came up—it was about three quarters of an hour from my mistress going out, to my going up stairs to seek for the child.</p>

The prisoner is my granddaughter—I was staying at her husband's house on 15th April—she came into my bedroom about 8 o'clock on that morning, and said she was going out to chapel—I did not notice anything particular about her then, but on the night before she com<lb></lb>plained much of her head—her brother was present, and she put her hand on her head, and said she felt bad in her head—about 9 o'clock I heard the servant scream out—I went up stairs, and found the child in a basin of water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, living at Camberwell; the prisoner's husband is a tenant of mine. On 15th April, about 11 o'clock, I was called by Dr. Clunie to the prisoner's house, and saw her there—she said she had drowned her child—(the child was up stairs then)—I asked her what for,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185405080128"></xptr>
               <p>but she would not give any reason, only that she thought that it would be better off to be in heaven—she appeared quite beside herself, in a state of madness, and said that some persons, pointing over her shoulder, persuaded her to drown the child, and that she said, "No, I cannot do it;" and they said, "You must do it"—her husband was there at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you occasion to restrain her once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eight or nine days previously she was in a state of madness, I was called in and had to tie her hands behind her to restrain her—she begged me to un<lb></lb>loose her; I did so, and she got out into the street, and ran up into the Walworth road—a large crowd got about her, and she was brought back—I am quite satisfied that she is not herself-—after that I was obliged to pinion her up again, and employed two men to wait three or four hours till her husband came home.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq., M. D. I live at Southampton-street, Camberwell. The prisoner has been a patient of mine for about seven months—on 15th April, about 11 o'clock, I was brought to her husband's house, and saw the deceased child, which in my opinion had been killed by drowning—the mo<lb></lb>ment the prisoner saw me she exclaimed that she had drowned her child—I asked her why she did it; she said that it had been so neglected, and that voices were continually crying to her that she ought to drown it, and that when she attempted to do so, other voices cried out, that she knew she ought to do it, but that she was too great a coward, and with that she drowned the child; put it into a pail of water—my opinion is that she was quite insane at the time—I have frequently before observed symptoms of insanity in her conduct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe she was very kind to the child, according to your observation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very kind—it is quite a delusion of her's that it was neglected—she appeared also to be labouring under some strong reli<lb></lb>gious feeling; she told me she thought she was eternally lost, and when she attempted to pray, innumerable voices told her that they could call upon the name of Christ as well as she, but that she was lost, and it was of no use for her to do so—she is a Roman Catholic.</p>

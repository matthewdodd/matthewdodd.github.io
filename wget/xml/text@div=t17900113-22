               <p>Was you perfectly sober? - I do not know; I had been drinking some at home, and some at the Globe Tavern: I went no where with the prisoner: it was scarcely a minute the prisoner was with me: I had two half guineas, and seventeen shillings, in my pocket; I had one half guinea and seven shillings left; I paid two shillings for the coach, and spent one shilling at the Globe Tavern; I had given the prisoner no money, nor talked of giving her any: I do not know that the money that was found upon her was mine.</p>

               <p>I was constable of the night: the prisoner had been searched before I came in; I proceeded to search her; she had her hand clinched, and was very unwilling to be searched; I saw the half guinea taken out of her hand by the watchman; and I took this silver out of her pocket, two half crown pieces, and two shillings; there were two other shillings taken out, which the prosecutor did not claim.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure I had three half crown pieces in my pocket, and I had but one remaining: I said to the watchman before she was searched, that she had robbed me of half a guinea, and seven shillings, in silver.</p>

               <p>The person I sell fruit for in Covent Garden went out to spend the evening; I had been to take care of her children; I was coming home, within four or five doors; this person met me, and spoke very familiar to me, and asked me how I was; I concluded he knew me extremely well, and I made a full stop; when I looked at him I perceived he was a stranger; I said, I fancy my friend, you have made a mistake; He said, no, I know you very well; and he laid hold of my hand; says he, will you have any thing to drink? I said I would not; it was very late, and was near home, and had a child to mind, and did not want any thing to do with him; he told me he would provide for my child if I would go with him; he still kept hold of this left arm: he put his hand into my bosom, and behaved very ungenteel to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130034"></xptr>me; then he put my right hand to his breeches, but not to his pocket; then I insisted on going from him; when he found I was not agreeable to his wishes, he said, you have robbed me; I said, of what; he did not mention any sum, but said I had robbed him: I had an opportunity of going before the watchman came; but I staid; when the watchman came we went to the watch-house; and I was searched; there was nineteen shillings and sixpence in silver, and nine pennyworth of halfpence, and one bad shilling found upon me. I hope you will take it into consideration, for the sake of my child: I never was here before: my mistress was here yesterday; but she has a delicate constitution, and the weather being bad, I do not know whether she is here to day.</p>

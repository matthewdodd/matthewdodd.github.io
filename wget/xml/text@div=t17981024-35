               <p>HENRY-LOTT MASON sworn. - I live in the parish of Hayes, in the county of Middlesex: On the 21st of September, I went to the mill in the morning, and gave orders for fifteen sacks of flour for Wingfield, in Mount-street; I left the mill, and upon information I received, I found I had been robbed to a very considerable amount; I went from my house to the mill, near Drayton; I armed myself and secreted myself; it was a remarkable moon-shiny night, I could see any thing a very great distance; I got into a shady place, where I could observe the waggon when it came to load, which was about eleven o'clock; I was watching in Mr. Greenfield's garden; I saw the carter come and open the door, and get in at the tail of the waggon; I saw him put in fifteen of Wingfield's sacks, as I found them to be afterwards; the miller was

            ; then he put in two other sacks besides the fifteen that I had ordered; as soon as the miller had done delivering the flour, he went to a man with a candle in his hand, and then I came out of the garden, and for fear I should accuse a man that was innocent, I threw a stone up at the window, and spoke to Mr. Davison, the master of the mill, and then I went after the waggon; says I to Watts, the driver, you have got more sacks than you ought to have; he said he did not know as he had; I counted seventeen sacks, and when Mr. Davison came up, I said to Watts, you are my prisoner, you shall not go to London to night; Mr.Davison said to

            , why, here is a bag of Read's here that is so very different from the rest, that it must be a wilful mistake; we then went to his master to know about it; I had the waggon drawn down to the mill, and told the miller he was my prisoner; I took them into custody, and fat up with them both myself that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a good deal of flour at the mill? - A. Yes, I had forty load grinding off at that time; that, that was in Read's sack, was a sack of household, and that, that was in a sack of mine marked H. Mason, was rough stuff, in an unfinished state.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you in the mill at that time household flour and rough stuff? - A. There might be seventy or one hundred sacks.</p>

             sworn. - I am a miller; Mr. Mason called to me after the waggon went from the mill; he followed the waggon, and so did I; I found seventeen sacks in the waggon; there were fifteen of Wingfield's sacks, of Mount-street; one of the other sacks was Read's, and the other Mason's; then Mason went away to the man's master; I sent my lad to keep watch for the waggon in the night, and we found them to be household and rough stuff; Mr. Bishop ordered us to mark them. I had them under lock and key till I carried them up to Mr. Mason's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you directed either your servant Harrod or Watts to load these two sacks? - A. No; Mason's note expressed fifteen sacks, and what they had over was unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Mason more rough stuff and more flour in the mill? - A. Yes, there was some in what we call the pester, not sacked up; I did not know that there was any more sacked up than that fifteen sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if any body else had any rough stuff in the mill at that time? - A. I cannot pretend to swear, but really I think nobody else had besides Mr. Mason.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you to say very fairly, that you won't swear that no other person had rough stuff in the mill? - A. It was a thing I might not be acquainted with, and therefore I would not wish to swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are employed by a good many of your neighbours? - A. Yes, and I have two men to look after my business when I am out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there are more persons besides the two prisoners that worked in the mill? - A. Only one for the night time.</p>
               <p>Q. It has of course happened to you to have a sack of Read's before? - A.We are never without scarcely.</p>
               <p>Q.You were not present at he delivery of these sacks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it an uncustomary thing, suppose you have an order to deliver goods from your mill to Mason, to send home such sort of articles by your servants in the sacks of Read? - A. Never.</p>

               <p>Watts's defence. I asked him for a sack of twenty-penny, and he gave me this rough stuff, if it was rough stuff, I did not know any difference.</p>

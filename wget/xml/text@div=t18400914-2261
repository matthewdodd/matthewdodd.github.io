                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Chatham-gardens, Hoxton, with James Burkitt—we live together as man and wife, and have done so between five and six months. On Monday night, the 24th of August, about a quarter-past twelve o'clock, I was going home with Bur<lb></lb>kitt, and in Plummer-street, City-road, about four doors from Ebenezer-street, I saw the prisoner—I had hold of Burkitt's arm—I was next the wall—I never saw the prisoner before—he ran very violently round the corner up against me—I said, "Can't you mind where you are driving to?"—he then up with his stick, struck me on the head, cut my head, and laid me senseless against the wall—I supported myself with the shutters as well as I could—I saw Burkitt trying to lay hold of the stick, to pre<lb></lb>vent his striking me, and the stick came across his face—he did not think it had struck me till I called out—when I recovered a little, I saw him and Burkitt struggling—Burkitt was trying to hold him till a policeman came—my head bled very much indeed—somebody loosened the prisoner from Burkitt, but in a few minutes he was in the policeman's arms—I do not know whether he got out of sight—the policeman brought him back, and asked if I gave charge of him—I was led to the station-house between Burkitt and another person—I have been ill a fortnight from the blow—I have not been attended by a doctor—a surgeon dressed my head at the station-house.</p>

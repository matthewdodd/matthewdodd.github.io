On the first occasion the prisoner got 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from me, and on the Monday he came and got a suit of clothes, stockings, and the other things—he left a ship note—he said he belonged to the <hi rend="italic">Roberts,</hi> and was going to he paid on Thursday, and to receive 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was in con<lb></lb>sequence of this statement that I let him have it, and the prisoner stating that my brother always did the same for him when he came to town—I be<lb></lb>lieved that to be true.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I borrowed the shilling, and said I would be down on Mon<lb></lb>day morning—I did not say it was a note for any money whatever. I got the shilling from him on Saturday night, and I took the land<lb></lb>lord to get the note back; and when I could not get the note I took the clothes—he took the note on his own head—I did not offer it for any clothes. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The prisoner called me on one side, and said, "Don't give the lodging-house-keeper the note, it matters not who I deal with, I want a tidy suit of clothes till Thursday.</p>

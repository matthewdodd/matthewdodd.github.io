                  </hi>. I live at 249, Kennington Road—on 31st January,</p>

               <p>about midnight, I was in Long Acre, I was not very sober—I had a gold keyless watch and chain, value 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., fastened with a bar through my waistcoat—I was drinking in a public-house in Neil Street, about I a.m., and I suppose I went out with the rest of the people, and was immedistely knocked or pushed down by down by two men and a woman, and a great deal of violence used to me, as the marks on my forehead showed—they pulled my coat open and tore the buttons off my great coat and my inner coat—I have some slight recollection of seeing the prisoner in the public-house—I after<lb></lb>wards found myself at the police-station, and then missed my watch and chain—that was at 4 a.m.—I had come round a bit then and knew where I was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I may have gone into three public-houses, and I think I stayed in the last about two hours—I was not very tipsy, but I was never worse, because I have always been very moderate—I saw my watch and chain last about 12.10 in the public-house, when I took it out to see how late I was staying out—there were ten or twelve people in the public-house—I do not know whether I said that the policeman had taken my whtch and money—the public-house was about 100 yards down Neil Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Crown and Anchor, Neil Street, Long Acre—on 31st January I was led across the road by the men and the woman, they stopped at the brewery wall on the opposite side about twenty paces from my door, and I saw Johnson suddenly fall, and the three persons ran away towards Long Acre—I ran after them with my friend Phipps, calling "Stop thief," and a policeman stopped the prisoner—he is one of the men who ran from the spot where Johnson fell—we picked Johnson up—he was still lying on his face—he was very drunk indeed—we took him to the station the prisoner is one of three persons who ran away.</p>

On 31st January, about 1.15, I was going off duty in Long Acre and heard cries of "Stop him"—I saw the prisoner leading a woman and an old man on the other side—I was about six yards from the prisoner, he was urging the woman along by her hand—when I heard the cry the prisoner tried to pass me, but I stopped him—we struggled, and he knocked off my helmet—Coulson came up and said in his presence that a man had been knocked down—I took him to the station, searched him, and found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him and an old penknife—the woman and the other man got away—the prosecuter was led to the station, his waistcoat was torn open and his clothes were muddy.</p>

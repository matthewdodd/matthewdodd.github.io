                  </hi>. I reside at No. 5, Clement's-inn, Strand. I am connected with the newspaper press—Mrs. Arnett, the mother of the prisoner Arnett, was the person who ordinarily did the domestic duties of my chambers—she is the wife of the principal porter of the inn—I usually took my tea at chambers, about 7 o'clock—on 28th March, I was in cham<lb></lb>bers during the whole or greater part of the day—I dined at chambers that day—I saw Arnett during that afternoon—I told her I should not want the tea things laid, as I was going out—I went out at 9 o'clock tliat even<lb></lb>ing—I left in a pocket book a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, any a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and a purse con<lb></lb>taining six or eight sovereigns, in a small drawer of a chest of drawers in</p>

               <p>my bedroom; that drawer was locked—I had the key in my pocket, on a bunch—on my going out of the inn that evening, I saw Arnett standing at the door of her father's lodge—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I know the number of it—I returned to chambers between 12 and 1 o'clock, nearly 1 o'clock, I believe; as I came into the inn, an intimation was made to me as to a robbery at my chambers—I found both the outer and inner doors shut—on going into the sitting room, I found every thing as I had left it; the dinner things were still on the table, nothing appeared to have been dis<lb></lb>turbed—I then went into the bedroom, and found the drawer which I had left locked, standing open—there was no light in the room—I afterwards found a small mark on the lock, I believe it had been forced open—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was still left in the pocket book, the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was gone—Mrs. Arnett, the prisoner's mother, had been absent from the inn for some time previously to the robbery, and she was still absent at that time—during her absence the domestic offices at my chambers were usually performed by a charwoman in her employment, and in the evening the prisoner Arnett usually came in—there were duplicate keys of my doors—I had one key for each door, and the others were kept at the lodge—I have seen Foreman at the inn; I do not think she had been there for about three months before this—when she was there, she was there in the capacity of a domestic servant to Arnett, the head porter.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, E</hi> 17). In consequence of information, about the end of March last, I took measures to stop the payment of this 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note at the bank of England, and afterwards saw Foreman on her arrival from the country, having made a previous intimation to her family—I took her to Miss Baines, who said, in her hearing, "That is the person who changed the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—Foreman said, "Miss Baines, I did not do it; I never saw a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—I then took her to Mr. Holdsworth's cham<lb></lb>bers, told her that I was a policeman, and that she must consider herself in custody for stealing a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—she said that about April last, a young person named Betsy Arnett brought her a parcel, sealed up in five different places with black wax, containing a brooch given to her by a young French-man in the Temple-gardens, and asked her to mind it for her, as her mother would not let her wear it; and that about three weeks afterwards, as she was dressing for church one Sunday morning, she missed the parcel, and immediately communicated the loss to Miss Arnett, and when she came she appeared very much grieved at the loss, saying that it contained a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; that they afterwards went to a charwoman in Brydges-street, Covent-garden, where they mentioned the loss of the parcel—in consequence of that state<lb></lb>ment, I went to Arnett's parents, but did not see her—in a few days she returned to town, and I saw her, and asked her if she knew Foreman—she said that she did—I asked her if she ever gave her a parcel—she said that she had not—I asked her if she had ever been to a charwoman in Brydges-street—she said that she had—I asked her for what—she said to have her fortune told—I asked her if she had mentioned to the person in Brydges-street about the loss of the parcel—sue said that she had not—I asked her if she did not tell her what the parcel contained—she said that she did not—after taking Foreman into custody, I took her to the porter's lodge in Clement's-inn, and confronted her with Arnett—I stated to Arnett sub<lb></lb>stantially that which Foreman had told me, and she said, "Oh! Emma, how can you say so?"—Foreman said, "You know, Betsy, you brought me a parcel"—I do not remember what Arnett said, but she denied it—Fore<lb></lb>man said, "You know you went with me to Mrs. Dent's, and mentioned about the loss of the note"—Arnett said, "Oh! Emma, how can you say such a thing?"—she denied the statement altogether—I afterwards put myself in communication with Mrs. Dent—I was present at the police court when this charge was being inquired into before the Magistrate, and heard Mrs. Dent examined; Foreman was then present at the bar—I saw Alice Dent sign this deposition (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I remember it, because she signed</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you first went to Mrs. Arnett's, did you make a great many inquiries, not only about her daughter, but about Foreman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never inquired about her daughter—I made inquiries about Foreman—I ascertained that she had been in service some mouths, and the lady gave her a very good character—this was several days before she was in custody; I was making inquiries—I afterwards went to Mrs. Arnett's, and found that her daughter was in the country; she wrote to her to come up immediately, and she came—I had a conversation with Mr. and Mrs. Arnett before I brought Foreman there, and the girl answered all my questions by way of denial throughout—she knew that I was a policeman—I thought it in course of my duty to bring Foreman, and confront her with Arnett, and she, in the most natural manner, and without hesitation, denied everything, with the exception of going to the charwoman, which she said was to have her fortune told—she did not say that it was a long time ago—when she said, "Emma, how can you say so?" she said it reproachfully, and with vehemence—I did not take her to the police court; I told her father that she had better be there in the morning—she was examined at the police court, in Foreman's presence—she was regularly sworn—I do not believe her statement was taken down—I did not hear it read over to her—she was sworn in the witness box before she made the state<lb></lb>ment before Mr. Henry; Foreman made a statement first, and from that statement Arnett was called into the witness box and sworn—I do not think Mr. Burnaby, the clerk, and the Magistrate, then asked her questions—since she was out on bail I have seen her more than once; I saw her at the Sessions, and one morning, about a fortnight ago, she called at my house, and rang the bell—that was since the last Sessions—I believe she had not been at my house before; I am not aware of it—a great many people call, but I can safely say that she has only been once—I have not been in her company besides—I have never been with her to Mrs. Dent's, nor seen her there—I did not say to Arnett, "Did not you go to the fortune teller in Brydges-street?"—I said, "Did not you go to the charwoman in Brydges-street?"—on my oath, I have not called that unfortunate woman a fortune teller up to to-day—after examining the girl, I never had a private inter<lb></lb>view with Mr. and Mrs. Arnett—I only went once with Foreman to Mr. Holdsworth's chambers.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M'OUBREY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were asked whether Arnett did not vehemently deny that she had ever given a parcel to Foreman; was that after Foreman had said, "Betsy, you left a parcel with me"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she did not hesi<lb></lb>tate in telling me that she had left a parcel—they were both equally firm and decided. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoners received good characters.</hi>)</p>

On the 15th of September I marked two half-crowns, and put them into the till with some other silver; I left him in the shop where the till was - I was absent about a minute; I looked through the window from the yard, and saw him turn from behind the counter - no customer had come in; I came into the shop, looked into the till, and missed the half-crowns; I told him he had robbed me - he denied it - I said he had, and I thought to a very considerable amount, and I would send for a Policeman; he then said he had taken half a pound of sugar; I did not tell him I would give him into custody unless he owned to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Upon your oath, did you not say you would forgive him, or would not proceed against him, if he did any thing? A. No; after I said he had taken the half-crown, he said, would I forgive him - I said "No; if you were to acknowledge all you have taken, probably I might;" he produced the two half-crowns, and I found a C which I had marked on them - I have kept them ever since, wrapped up in paper; the C is scratched in the neck of the head with a pen-knife.</p>

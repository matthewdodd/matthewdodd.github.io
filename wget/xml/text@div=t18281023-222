I lost a pair of springs. a pair of wheels, and an axletree, on the 10th of October, or early on the 11th, from a shed, where they were fixed to a cart; and found them a week afterwards at Mr. Herring's, the original maker of them - I knew them to be mine; I know nothing of the prisoner - these are the springs and axletree - I did not bring the wheels into Court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went to he prisoner's house? A. Yes - he said he bought them openly in the middle of the street, opposite his own house; Herring said if he would tell who he had bought them of nothing would be said about them; I agreed to that; he said they were not mine, but his own - he did not desire to be taken before a Magistrate; he said he would meet us there; I said he could go in my cart - the Magistrate offered to bail him, which I opposed, as his bail was not worth 9d. - but he was bailed, and has surrendered.</p>

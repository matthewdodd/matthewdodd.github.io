               <p>Q. Therefore you put it in the near-pocket inside of the coach - did that parcel come up to London with you? - A.

               <p>Q. Who assisted you in unloading the coach that night? - A. The watchman,

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner employed at times in helping to unload the coach? - A. His place was to mind the horses; sometimes he might take a trunk or so when they came in late, it was not his business; he assisted to move the heavy things; our regular way is, when coaches come in of a night, to lay the parcels on the counter, and the way-bill with them; we do not know what is missing till the book-keeper comes in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Mr. Day knows very well that every horse-keeper that comes in the yard has no time to touch a parcel; he takes his horses off as quick as possible out of the way for other coaches to come in? - A. I had the care of this office, it is my place to see that nobody comes in at improper hours; I do not recollect this parcel coming in; sometimes we have two or three parcels on the bill, and they are left in the country through neglect of the people in the country.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember his applying to you at any time, and when, to pay a debt that he owed you? - A. It was only a trifle of money he owed me; I did not mind it, he spoke to me about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What money did he owe you? - A. Not above seven shillings; I met him by accident in the street; we went in, and had a pint of beer together, and he, after we had drank a pint of beer, said, he was going down to Horn-fair; I said, George, very like you may want a little money; I gave him five shillings then; he gave me this duplicate; he said he wished I would take this watch out of pawn, and if I liked, to dispose of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did he tell you where to go with it? - A. No; the duplicate had Lightfoot on it; I went to Mr. Lightfoot's, the corner of Bulstrode-street, on the 22d of September, and took the watch out; I think it was then, but I have been in prison ever since; I have lost my senses almost; I paid 1 l. 14 s. 8 d. to the pawnbroker's, I took the watch to Mr. Allen's and offered to sell it; Mr. Caithness stopped the watch; I told him I had it from Newman, I told him the truth, and I went my way; he sent the runners after me. I have been in the House of Correction ever since upon bread and water - a very comfortable thing, Gentlemen; I thought Newman was an honest man, and I think he is now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I certainly gave him the duplicate, I found the watch in the park, I told him so, I gave him no liberty to take it out.</p>

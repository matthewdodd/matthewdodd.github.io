When I returned, I found I was locked out. I went to a public house, where I met with a woman who decoyed me to her lodging, I staid there all night. When I came into the lodging, I found the prisoner and a woman in bed; I had part of the bed cloaths and lay on the floor. In the morning I awaked and found the woman in bed with me, but the prisoner was gone. I missed all my cloaths; I went afterwards in search of him and at his lodgings at Edmonton I found my tobacco box, my handkerchief and keys in a bag, but I did not find my cloaths.</p>
               <p>The tobacco box, handkerchief and keys were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

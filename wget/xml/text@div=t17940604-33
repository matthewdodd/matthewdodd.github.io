               <p>Q. What past when he came? - As near as I can recollect, I enquired how Mr. Tuting was, supposing Mr. Tuting, at that time, unwell; for I took the prisoner at the bar, to be Mr. Tuting's servant; he made answer, he was better than he was; and I then enquired, how he would wish to receive the thirty pounds?</p>

            Did he present a draft to you? -  The prisoner at the bar did, I had it then in my hand, in my possession, a draft for thirty pounds. I enquired, how he would chuse to receive the draft? he told me some part in Bank notes, and part in money; I paid him twenty pounds in bank notes, and ten pounds in money; and that is all that passed between us. This is the draft, I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to know the character and hand writing of Mr. Tuting at all? - I do, I believe that not to be Mr. Tuting's writing.</p>

               <p>Jury. At the time you must believe it was, or else you would not have paid the money? - I looked upon the prisoner to be Mr. Tuting's servant, therefore I placed more confidence in him than I otherwise should do.</p>

               <p>Q. You supposed him a very respectable character or else, no doubt, you would not have kept company with him; you permitted him to draw in your name on this Bank. You had so great a reliance on him? - No, I no otherwise authorized him, than by sending him with a draft of mine to receive the money, because I was ill and could not go myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you, at one particular period, which I shall be able to point out to you, given the prisoner permission to draw on the Bank? - No, I have not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what was the reason of Mr. Tuting giving your son free toleration to draw on his banker? - Mr. Tuting not being well, he said, he would thank him to fill up the check, and sign his name on it, as he had been in a counting house in the City he would be better able to do it than himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember when this was? - It was some time in February 1793, I don't know exactly the day.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean February twelve month, or last February? - Last February.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Then, I suppose, last February Mr. Tuting lived in Chelsea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue to live long there? - He lived there all the time I kept the house at Chelsea. I have left it about four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect exactly when you left it? - I did not leave it on a Quarter Day.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Quarter Day before you quitted the house? - I left it about four months.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040056"></xptr>Q. What month did you leave it in? - I cannot tell, but I think it is about four months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave it at March? - I cannot certainly say to a month.</p>
               <p>Court. You say he gave your son liberty to fill up the check, was it to fill up the body or write his name? - He both filled up the check and signed Mr. Tuting's name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby to Dempsey. You have been speaking of debtor and creditor account with Mr. Tuting, of course you keep an account with Mr. Tuting; will you be good enough to tell me whether you credited this sum in consequence of money that you had in your hands at the time, or in consequence of the general credit of Mr. Tuting? - He had always money in our hands.</p>
               <p>Jury to Tuting. How came the prisoner in possession of that check? - I believed I had some checks about where I lodged.</p>

He said "If they pay you in a cheque I do not know how I shall get it cashed; I want the money the same day." The next morning he gave me the bill receipted to get the money, and told me to be sure and bring the money back with me. I got the cheque cashed and took the money to his place at Bermondsey; I waited there for some hours until his little boy went home, and I sent him in to tell his father; I was outside with the money. I waited an hour, and I went myself to his house with the money, and his wife insulted me and slammed the—door in my face; I waited some time to see Mr. Hammond, but I could not, and being out of work at the time I used some of the money and I could not replace it."</p>

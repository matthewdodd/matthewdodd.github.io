               <p>house perfectly secure, about 7 o'clock at night—I had in that warehouse a number of calf skins and neat hides—in consequence of a communication made to me, I returned to town on Sunday morning, and went to that warehouse, about 1 o'clock—it had been broken open, and I missed from my stock four dozen calf skins, from a lot of five down, and three neat hides from another lot—I had left some dogs there—they wan alive when I returned, but one died on the Tuesday—it never ate anything more—the entry had been made at the door—I had a hasp and a hanging lock inside, they broke it off—there were eight different Marks on the door—I saw Jackson put the chisel to the door—I took notice, and can swear that it fitted some of the marks—they broke the outer door of the warehouse open with that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a broker, and live in Hare-street. On Monday, 5th Nov., I was at the Fox and Hounds, in Hare-street, about 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner there—he asked me if I know anybody that wanted to buy any leather, and produced two small samples—I cannot tell what skins they were, one was thick, the other was thin—I said, "I know a shoemaker, I will ask him"—I took the pieces away to show, and in consequence of what was said to me, I went back and told the prisoner he could not buy them by that sample; I asked him to give me a larger sample—he said that he had about 78 lbs. weight to dispose of—on the 6th, I went to the prisoner's house, in company with the prosecutor and a policeman—I saw Jackson find some leather—he was stooping down, and palled it from somewhere, under the bedstead I believe—I saw him find some small pieces—they were not the same as those which had been offered to me.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, H</hi> 11). I went to the prisoner's house in Bath-street, Hackney-road, on the afternoon of 6th Nov.—I was accom<lb></lb>panied by the last witness and the prosecutor—the prisoner was not at home—I left a constable in charge of the place while I went to look for the prisoner—when I came back he was come home—I bad searched the house prior to the prisoner's return—I found one calf skin and part of two sides in this bag under the bed—I found two or three small pieces—there are two places in these skins where there has been a small piece cut off—in a boat under the bed I found these two chisels, a picklock, and a centrebit without a handle—I took the chisel to the prosecutor's warehouse, and compered it with the marks on the door where the entrance had been made—it exactly fitted the marks on the door in four places—when the prisoner came in I showed him the bag, and the leather was in it—I asked him where he got this leather from—he said, "I shall decline answering any questions"—I took him to the station.</p>

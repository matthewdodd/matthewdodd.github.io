             the younger. I live in White-friars, and am son to the prosecutor; the prisoner came to my shop on Saturday was sevennight to inquire for work; he pulled out this saw and said it was his; upon which I challenged it; he appeared to be very drunk, and said he had it up the Mediterranean sea, and my lord Albemarle's son would vouch it to be his property. I knew it when I was apprentice to my father, therefore sent for him; then I sent for an officer and charged him, and when he came before the sitting alderman, he said he knew nothing of the saw.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to young Mr. Case; and have seen the prisoner come to our house to ask for work several times; the prisoner swore in my master's shop it was his saw; but I know it to be my master's father's property.</p>

               <p>I bought that saw at the bottom of Fleet-market; a man asked me where he might get work, I said I was out of work myself; then he asked me to buy this saw, and asked me a shilling for it; I gave him ninepence for it, and he spent threepence and I threepence; then I went with it to Mr. Case's to ask for work.</p>
               <p>He called two witnesses to his former character, who said he had a good one, but had met with misfortunes in the world, and they knew nothing of him lately.</p>

            . I am constable of Cheshunt, where Mr. Bailey lives. Bayford pleaded guilty of stealing these things. On the 22d of April I found them in the stable of the Cock at Bow's Farm - the prisoner kept the stable. I told him I was come to search for Mr. Bailey's harness, he said I was welcome, and that he had none but what he had bought and paid for He shewed me the stable, in which I found these harness hanging up. I found a sack in the manger, with a faint mark of Mr. Bailey's name on it. I told him Bayford and Bell brought them there - he said a man, whom he did not know, brought them one morning, and left them for a few days, and had not come for them. He was committed to Hertford, was afterwards bailed, and has now surrendered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The robbery was in December - A. Yes. The Cock was once a public-house, and lost its licence for being a receptacle for thieves. The prisoner took it afterwards.</p>
               <p>(The record of the conviction of Bayford was then put in and read).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man left them there.</p>

No -I went out about seven o'clock; I left him about half-past eleven, and he met me again about one - after I left him I had three glasses of rum, and we had had a pot of porter before, to drink with our eating - he was soberer than I was; I did deny having any money, and borrowed 6d., but I had put this money away - I was brought here once, but it was only for manslaughter, and I was honourably acquitted.</p>

            . I am a weaver. I met the prosecutor as I was going home - he was on the ground, and the prisoner was getting him up, as I considered - I came up, and the prosecutor's nose was cut and his face smothered with blood - he said the prisoner had got his money, and he said he had not;

             had his hat- I said I would see him home; I then saw the prisoner put his hand against his breast, and draw it away suddenly - I heard him say some words, the last of which were that he had his money; I then saw the Police-officer, who came, and took the prisoner - he gave him three shillings, one by one; the half-crown piece then fell - the prisoner took it up, and said he had more right to keep it as he was a friend of his - at last, with a great deal of persuasion, he gave him a penny - piece instead of the half-crown; several persons said it was a half-crown - the prisoner said so help him God that was all the money he had; the Police-man said if he would not give him the money he would take him into custody - he then took it from some part of his person, and gave it him, saying if he must have it he must.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the prisoner said at once that he had the money? A. He did; he was let off on bail before the Magistrate; but I was not at the first examination; I considered him sober - they said he had been drinking, but I did not believe it; the officer was there at the time he said he had his money, and he refused to give up all the money; he followed us with a great deal of abuse, in a very ridiculous manner.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor together; Gogay was holding up the prosecutor, who said he was robbed - I seized the prisoner with 5s. 6d. in his hand; the half-crown fell from his hand - he took it up, and gave me one penny-piece, and said that was all he had got; I said I had seen a piece of silver, but could not tell whether it was a crown or half-crown - he at last gave it me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say he had the prosecutor's money, and he would keep it? A. He said he took it for fear he would be robbed - he was well aware that I knew he had it, as he did say something to the effect that he would keep his money, as he had as good a right to it as I had; I hardly knew what to think of it - I did not see him strike any body, but I believe he did strike two or three; he was a little gone I believe.</p>

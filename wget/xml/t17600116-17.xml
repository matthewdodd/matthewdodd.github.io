            . The prisoner came into Mr. Parr's shop, and desired me to shew him some silver buckles. I shew'd him some, and he chose out a pair, desiring to know the price of them. He stood at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176001160015"></xptr> the door some time to look at them, then put them into his pocket, and went away with them.</p>

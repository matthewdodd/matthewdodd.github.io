               <p>Examined by Mr. Cullen. I am one of the officers belonging to Marlborough-street: On the 29th of September last, myself, and three officers, in consequence of an information, went to a house, No. <placeName id="t17961026-21-crimeloc125">25, the Crescent, Michael's-place, Knightsbridge</placeName>

I took all three of them into custody, the two men and the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and the prisoners? - A. I don't remember any particular conversation.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know whose house this was? - A. The woman said it was her house. There was a circumstance took place between me and the prisoner, Pratt, at the time we were about to take them away; he had not got his hat in that room, and he went down stairs with one of the officers who is here to fetch his hat out of a room below, which he called his bed-room. I conveyed the things I found, and the prisoners, to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any dies or instruments that would impress the likeness of the current coin of this kingdom? - A. No; I did not. (Produces the cutting engine, and the instrument mentioned in the indictment).</p>
               <p>Q. That instrument is calculated for cutting out different sizes? - A. Yes; we found cutters of three or four different sizes.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand there are two techinical terms called a dabb and a bolster; explain to the Jury the meaning of those words? - A. There is somebody here that will explain that better than I can.</p>
               <p>Q.Mention the different dimensions you found it calculated for cutting out? - A. Here are two cutters of the size of the smaller pieces that I found.</p>
               <p>Q.Between the smaller and larger, is there any intermediate one? - A. None; here is one that runs larger than any of the blanks we found.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are there any calculated for a guinea or half-guinea? - A. No; there are of a leffer size, and a bigger size. (Produces all the articles that were found in the houses).</p>
               <p>Q. Are all these instruments a complete machinery for cutting out blanks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. That<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260025"></xptr>instrument, the cutting-engine, was set when you went into the room? - A. It was fixed.</p>
               <p>Q. What cutter was there to it? - A. The same that is now for the large blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. That is to the size of a joe? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know what a Portuguese coin called a joe is? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q.However, that is set to a large blank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the edger? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that when you went into the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that edger set to the large blanks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That edger was not applicable to any coin of this realm as set? - A. Not to a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Not only in size, but mode of marking? - A. It certainly differs very much.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know what a joe is? - A. I don't know that I ever saw one.</p>

               <p>NICHOLAS CONANT, Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am in possession here of a quantity of gold found by Hamilton in that room, produced before me when the prisoners were taken into custody; they were sealed up in the presence of the prisoners by myself and Hamilton, and I produce them here as being exactly in the same state as they were so given in (produces of great quantity of blanks, which were hundred to the Jury); as far as they come under my inspection there are but two sizes; the small pieces appear to me, upon the best investigation I can make, to be something less than one-sixth part smaller than a guinea, and the large ones exactly the size of a louis; I suppose there are about four hundred of the large ones; they are considerably heavier than a guinea, and worth about 18s. 3d.</p>
               <p>Hamilton. I also found these two papers, (producing them).</p>
               <p>JOHN JOHNSON sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am affay-master; I have made an assay of some pieces I had from Mr. Parker.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PARKER sworn.</p>
               <p>I took two blanks, one large and one small to Mr. Johnson, I had them from Mr. Powell.</p>
               <p>- POWELL sworn.</p>
               <p>I received these blanks from Mr. Conant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Conant. I gave them to Mr. Powell.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Jackson). What was the value of those tow pieces? - A. I cannot determine the value of them; I determined the quality of the gold, only one is standard, about the value of the current coin of this kingdom, and of the current coin of Portugal guineas, and joes are the same kind of gold exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. It appears to be a mixed metal? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gibbs. Q. Does your assay reduce the weight? - A.Rather.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the value of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parker. The large one weighed seven penny weights two grains and the small one, five penny weights one grain; I kept the weight, and delivered Mr. Powell the two blanks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gibbs. Q. There is a great difference in the weight when they came from the cutter, they had a rough edge which must be filed off, and then they receive the impression? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Conant. The large one was filed at seven penny weight two grains.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gibbt. (To Johnson). Q. Do you know of the traffic of sending out reduced half joes to the West-Indies? - A. I have heard of the practice, but I believe the practice was to reduce the real one.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Look at the cutting engine, how does that work? - A. By the sorce of a screw, with a fly.</p>
               <p>Q.Explain to us the parts of it for cutting blanks? - A. This instrument will cut the blanks of any size, they are what we call the dabb and the bolster.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sizes are there of the bolster? - A. Here are four of them, but they appear to be but two sizes; I have in my pocket a guinea blank, and a half-guinea blank from the Mint, but they don't appear to he intended either for guineas or half guineas, one is much larger than a guinea, and the other smaller, and larger than half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Might they not be turned into guineas? - A. Yes; by hammering up, and making use of other cutters.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260026"></xptr>Q. The engine for cutting the blanks is entire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any bolster, or any dabb may apply to that cutting engine? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gibbs. Q. There is no cutting engine here fitted to the blank of a guinea or a half-guinea? - A. No, there is not.</p>
               <p>Q. The cutting engine is not compleat without the cutters? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. And there is no cutter to compleat that cutting engine for the cutting of blanks for guineas or half guineas? - A.None produced.</p>

               <p>Q. It is very unfortunate that such things should happen, but they happen so often as to render you perfectly acquainted with the practice of sending out reduced half-joes to the West-Indies? - A. I have never heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The size of these cutters would suit double louis's, I believe? - A. I don't know, unless I tried it.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you know is, that it will not suit the current coin of this kingdom? - A.It will not.</p>

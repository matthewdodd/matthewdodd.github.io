               <p>On the 16th of this month the prisoner came up to my room, with another woman, and asked me to buy a waistcoat of her; I knew nothing of her before; it was a white sattin waistcoat, I gave her half a crown for it.</p>
               <p>How came you to buy this waistcoat of her at that price? - I thought it a bargain.</p>
               <p>Did you think half a crown near the value of that waistcoat? - She asked no more; she said it was her husband's; I bid the girl that takes care of me in my illness, for I was in bed, take half a crown off the mantle-piece, and pay her; she went down to get two sixpences; the half-guinea was on the mantle-piece; the prisoner went towards the mantle-piece two or three times, and she took the half-guinea.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take it? - No; but I am sure she took it; the girl came up and paid her, and she went away; after she was gone I missed the half-guinea.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was very ill; I was with him to take care of him. On Saturday last the prisoner, and another woman, came up into his room, and sold him a waistcoat; I took three-shillings off the mantle-piece, and went down stairs to get two sixpences to pay her; I saw the half-guinea on the mantle-piece when I took the three shillings; I left the two women in the room when I went down; I returned in about five minutes, and paid the prisoner, and when they were gone I missed the half-guinea; my master had the prisoner taken up that evening; she denied knowing any thing of it; I went after them, and met with them in Bow-street, Westminster; I asked them if they knew any thing of the half-guinea; they both denied knowing any thing of it; I came home and told my master; he got up, and had the prisoner taken up; there was nothing found upon her.</p>

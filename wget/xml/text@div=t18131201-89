She asked me to give her sixpence; I gave it her; and when I had been with her about two minutes, I was coming away from her; she laid hold of me, and said if I went away from her she would pummel my head. I felt her hand at my watch, trying to get my watch out of my pocket. In about two minutes after she went away from me. I felt if I had my watch in my pocket; it was gone. I went to see if I could see her, I could not. The next morning I went round to the pawnbroker's. I told them if they saw an old fashioned watch, to stop it. The watch came to a pawnbroker's in Holborn; there it was stopped.</p>
               <p>MR. BERTON. I am a pawnbroker in Holborn; this is the watch. It was not pledged; the watch was brought by a man; it was given into the hands of the lad; he gave it to me. I sent to Bow-street for an officer; the officer went with the man that brought the watch to the Wheatsheaf, Drury-lane. I was present when the woman said she sent the man.</p>

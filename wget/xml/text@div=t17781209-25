               <p>Was it loose, or in a purse? - Loose. I afterwards gave them my watch.</p>
               <p>Did they ask for it? - No; I did it that they might not fright the ladies; it was a gold watch, with a hair chain; there was a miniature picture to the seal, set in gold; there were two seals to it. I have never found my watch again.</p>

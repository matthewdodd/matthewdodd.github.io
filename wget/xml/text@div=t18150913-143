               <p>"Shepherd and Hine, to be left until called for." We send up a number of trusses at a time. We sent up four on the 17th of December, 1814, directed as I have stated. On the 4th of January, 1815, we sent up three; on the 7th, we sent up one, and afterwards I came up myself, to dispose of them; when I went to the inn, I only found seven there, and those were all I could get; I could tell that the one lost, was one of the three trusses sent up on the 4th of January, or the 12th of January following, I will not be sure. I went in company with Mr. Mills and Mr. Hutchinson, two officers, to the Cock and Horn, the house of the prisoner, in Duke's-place, at the bottom of Creechurch-lane; when I went in, Mr. Mills and Mr. Hutchinson had four bundles of parchment produced, which I knew to be my manufacture; they had passed through my hands so many times, that I could identify them. I never sold any to the defendant; each roll contained sixty skins. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130051"></xptr>officers went in before me, and afterwards made a signal to me to come in; and I went in; after the skins had been produced, the defendant was asked where he got these skins? he said he could immediately tell, he said he had them in the house six months, and afterwards he said he took them for a bad debt, from a person of Liverpool.</p>

               <p>ALEXANDER WILLIAM MILLS. I am a law stationer in Great Shire lane. On the 12th of January, the prisoner called at my house in company with another man; I am quite sure of the prisoner's person; the man who was with him said he had a friend; who had an article which might suit me; and then he pointed to the prisoner, as the person of whom he was speaking. The prisoner then produced a roll of skins, containing sixty, wrapt up in brown holland cloth. I asked him what the price of them was; he told me four and sixpence a skin. I told him he was very young in the business because it was far above the price. I had a quantity of skins by me, each considerably larger in size, than these; for which I only gave one and sixpence per skin. I asked him where he got them from, he said he obtained them in payment of a bad debt. At that time he did not say where the persons lived whom he had got them. I told him what he asked, was above the value. He then asked me, were they worth a shilling a skin; I told him they might be, but not to me, and suspecting something, I told him I did not chuse to buy them; the person's name who came with him was Phillips from whom I had some times purchased pens, and stationary. In about half an hour afterwards Mr. Shepherd came in, to whom I communicated the circumstance. It was afterwards agreed that I should call at the prisoner's house; I never went alone; it was on Friday the 30th of January, I asked him had he disposed of the parchment, he said no, and he produced four rolls. I told him I wished to see it all, and I would call the next morning, with Hutchinsoe and Shepherd, who remained outside; he said he had two or three rolls. I asked him, had he not sold one to a Mr. Waterhouse, he said he had, to a person in Carey street, who in being described, was Mr. Waterhouse. The next morning, there were only two rolls produced to me and Shepherd; which was claimed by Shepherd, as his property. The officers went up stairs with the defendant, and brought down two more; I asked him where he got them, and he said he could not recollect. He then said, he had them in the way of his business, and had had them in the house six months; he then said he took them for a bad debt, of a man at Liverpool, but named nobody, nor the amount of the debt.</p>

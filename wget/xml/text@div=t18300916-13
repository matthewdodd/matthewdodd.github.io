            . I live at Hornsey, near the church. I am beadle and constable. On Monday afternoon, the 16th of August, a few minutes before five o'clock, I saw the three prisoners coming in a direction from Muswell-hill, and followed them - they were near the workhouse; one of them was asking a man the way to Hornsey-wood, but which I cannot say - Gray was carrying a bundle on his head, tied in a gardener's blue apron, filled with grass; I asked him what he had got tied in his bundle - they were altogether; he said he had got a bundle of grass - I asked where he was going to take it, and told him I suspected he had something more than that, and to put it down, which he did; he untied two of the corners, threw them back, then stooped down, took up two handsfull of grass, and said, "Now I suppose you are convinced it is nothing but grass" - he put the grass down, and was going to tie the apron up, but I said untie the other; he refused - I did it, and found the time-piece in it; when I stooped to untie it the other two ran away - I gave an alarm of Stop thief! and they were taken almost immediately; I took them home, and found a letter on Shaw sealed up.</p>

            . I live on Finchley-common, within a quarter of a mile of Mr. Cooper's. On the 16th of August, a little after four o'clock, I stood at my gate, and saw the three prisoners, I believe, and two men coming along the road in company; they were coming towards Muswell-hill - Gray stooped down, and was packing something up; the others stood by the while - they then went over the fields behind a house, about one hundred yards from me; they were there about five minutes, and then went towards Highgate, and I lost them - I was not above sixty yards from them, but could not see what they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160015"></xptr>packing up; there was a hedge between us - next morning I found some bent glass in the ditch where I had seen Gray packing something up, and have it here; there are only three pieces of it.</p>
               <p>Tilsley. Q. Do you say I was one of them? A. I will not swear to any of them, but to the best of my knowledge they appear like the three boys.</p>
               <p>MR. COOPER. This is the time-piece I lost on the 16th of August; the window is about two feet from the ground.</p>
               <p>Gray's Defence. I was going along with three more boys fishing; I met two gentlemen, who called me and asked me to carry that bundle, and said they would give me a shilling, and being hungry and willing to earn a shilling, I took the bundle; they told me to carry it to Hornsey-house.</p>
               <p>Shaw's Defence. In the street Tilsley, lives a cart came to bring some straw to a man - we rode in the cart to Muswell-hill, and when we got out I picked up that letter.</p>
               <p>Tilsley's Defence. We asked a gentleman the nearest way to London - he sent us over Muswell-hill; we met Gray - he asked us the way to Hornsey-house; we did not know, and asked a man, who said straight on - the gentleman met Gray, and called after us; we ran away as we were heaving stones.</p>
               <p>One witness deposed to Gray and Tilsley's good character, and two deposed the same for Shaw.</p>

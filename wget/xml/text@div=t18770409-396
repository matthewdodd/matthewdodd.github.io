                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, of High Street, Deptford, and have been a customer of Mr. Chatwood, of 120, Cannon Street; of whom in 1875, I bought a genuine Chatwood's safe—early in 1876 I required another safe for another business of the same sort—I went to Cannon Street, where I saw Scott—I told him I required a safe for my business premises at Deptford, describing the size I required—he said he had not one at that time but if I waited two or three weeks he probably might hear of one—shortly afterwards he wrote saying he had met with such a safe as I required—I called on him and he gave me the size—I said it was rather larger than I required—I asked him the price and he said 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him; it was more than I expected to pay—he said the price new would be 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he said it was made by the firm of Chatwood, for the Peruvian Government</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090126"></xptr>
               <p>and that it was then in Paris, and he would advise me of its arrival in London—I then left—some two or three weeks after I received a letter from Scott which is destroyed—I have searched for it—it was from Chatwood's Company to the effect that the safe had arrived and to get my place ready for the reception of it—all the letters from Chatwood's Company, bore "120, Cannon Street;"—the place was prepared at 9 o'clock according to instructions—the safe arrived at about 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day—six or seven men came with it with Wagner as the foreman—they were three or four hours fixing it during which time Wagner was there apparently superintending and directing them—the door of the safe was open and I called Wagner's attention to the fact that the name of Chatwood did not appear on the door on the inner part; it should appear on a sort of central plate on the inner part of the door—he said that the safe had been repainted and it was obliterated or erased—I also called attention to the want of the escutcheon on the outer part of the door; and he said that it had been taken off to be re-lacquered—it is a sort of tablet over the keyhole to protect it—I gave him some money for beer and they left—Steel looked on for about an hour while they were putting the safe in its place—I cannot say whether he heard the conversation between Wagner and me—Wagner called the next day but I was not there—an escutcheon was brought the next day or the day after, and put on in my presence—two or three days after, before I saw Scott again, Steel applied for the money with this invoice "to second-hand safe "so much—I objected to it as it did not specify that it was a Chatwood's safe, and I refused to pay—he said he would take the invoice back and report what I said—next day, or the day after, he brought this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) upon which I paid him the money—I saw him sign it—I cannot say whether the body of it is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">The invoice described the safe as one of Chatwood's second-hand Octucple Invincible Steel Banker's Safes, No</hi>. 7643, <hi rend="italic">from the Government of Peru,</hi> 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., expenses of delivery 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and dated May</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1876.) I gave him this cheque, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the rest in notes and gold—It is not my own cheque; but it was paid to me—I saw Scott some two or three days afterwards and asked him how it was there was a Lord's lock on one of the doors and the rest of the locks were made by Chatwood—he said that it was the wish of the Peruvian Government to have one of Lord's locks put on—I parted with my money thinking it was one of Chatwood's safes—I should not have bought it otherwise—I saw Mr. Chatwood about August, who told me that it was not one of his safes—I had never seen him before—I had bought a safe of him previously—I believe he saw the safe at my place, but I was at another shop when I saw him—I mentioned the escutcheon to Scott and he said it had been re-lacquered.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. The safe I bought before was a new one—I concluded that transaction with Scott, I looked upon him as the manager; I knew nothing about Mr. Chatwood not dealing in second-hand safes—I took these proceedings at Greenwich some time in March, I think—I am the prosecutor—Mr. Chatwood has not said that he will be liable for the expense; I hope he will be; he has not said directly that he will be—I was defrauded by his people—the delay in my taking proceedings was because Mr. Chatwood had told me he was going through his books—I heard later on that Chatwood had discharged Scott, or quarrelled with him, and I heard that he had other complaints against Scott—I had not, independently of Mr. Chatwood, had any engineer to look at the safe; I have since, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090127"></xptr>
               <p>not an independent person—I have not the slightest idea whether it is "Chatwood and Co.," or whether Mr. Chatwood is the company—I merely want a safe and go to his place for it—I know nothing of the people—the bolts of the safe fit badly—I am not an engineer—I have not instructed an engineer to look at it—I believe Scott applied to see it and saw it since this inquiry, I was not there at the time; they have never made application at my place to see it since—they asked the Magistrate to make an order for it to be seen, but he refused to makes the order, and I objected to show it unless recommended to do so by my solicitor, Mr. Boardman—I never received an order and they have not applied to see it—I made the objection in the midst of conversation at the police-court—I do not know that an engineer was sent on Scott's behalf to my place of business to see the safe and was refused permission to see it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GLYN</hi>. Wagner appeared to be foreman of the men who brought the safe; the principal conversation I had with him was about the beer for the men—the safe door was open when I asked him about the name—Wagner said the escutcheons had gone to be re-laquered and somebody would come and fix them—he did not tell me where they had gone or who had told him so—I did not ask him what name was going to be on; certainly not my name—I do not remember Wagner saying he supposed my name was to be put on, to the best of my belief he did not, I will not go further than that—I never saw Wagner again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Steel</hi>. The day the safe was delivered you did not come down with the others, but came later on—I did not hear you make any observation; I did not know what your business was-; I do not remember your asking if the safe had been delivered; you stood there looking on while the men fastened the safe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I was not there when the escutcheons came down, which was two or three days afterwards—there was something about the Government of Peru on them—the safe is not in the brickwork, it is merely rested upon timber, it is 6 feet high, it is a very great weight, you would have great difficulty in getting it up here; we are on the ground floor—this is one escutcheon. (<hi rend="italic">This was inscribed "E. Gobierno, Del Peru</hi>") The other is just the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman at Bolton to Chatwood and Co's works, where the patent safes are manufactured—I have been there nine years and knew Wagner as being employed there as safe finisher; he left about four years ago—I have seen the safe at Mr. Carpenter's, which he bought in 1876—it is not a Chatwood,'s safe, nor was it made at the Bolton manufactory; they have no other manufactory—it is not so strong as our patent safes, the material is thinner; the lock is Chatwood's, but it is not intended for a safe lock at all, it is simply intended for a wooden drawer; it would not be proof against burglars—I have tested the composition between the plates, and I believe it not to be fire-proof—I should say the safe as it stands, taking the price of the material and workmanship, would be produced for about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is intended to imitate a Chatwood's safe—there is a T iron frame in the body and the look-case used is to represent Chatwood's, but it is put together in the <hi rend="italic">block</hi>, what we call a <hi rend="italic">block</hi> jib—any man with a ham<lb></lb>mer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090128"></xptr>
               <p>and chisel could put a safe together in that manner; it is not done by machinery; ours are done by special machinery—I have been down to Middlesborough to see a safe at a Mr. Eaton's, a pawnbroker, which is numbered 7,643; that had been manufactured by us in the ordinary course and sent to the London depot as a stock safe in December, 1871; Wagner finished that safe—this escutheon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of our make; not the lock; it goes over the key hole; it would be used as a deed-box escutcheon, not a safe escutcheon at all—this escutcheon marked "E. Gobierno, del Peru" is not our manufacture at all, but it is made out of our material, our 3 inch till lock castings; some of them are in London in stock; they come up as rough castings and are kept in store for repairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. The material and workmanship of the safe might be produced for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a genuine safe of that size fitted up in that manner would be about 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it would be considerably stronger—we should not charge 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be the net price—I cannot Bay that we sometimes allow 50 or 60 per cent.—the frame in question is a T frame and a solid flange lock, an angle iron set in a solid flange lock case without the claw bolts—ours have not claw bolts in that quality but they have in some qualities—the solid flange lock-case is like ours in general appearance, but is not so strong—Mr. Chatwood is not the company, he is managing director and patentee—I cannot say whether this patent has expired or not, but two or three have; the patent includes the solid flange lock-case, T frame body, and invincible lock; I cannot say which have expired—the strength of the door of one of our safes of the quality of the one in question would be three-eighths of an inch—I said that the thickness of this safe was three-eights of an inch, on the first examination; I only saw it on Friday night and made a hasty examination of it—I say now, after a second examination, that it is full quarter—when I said it was three-eighths thickened up to five-eighths I meant the solid flange lock-case; the lock-case and the door of the safe become one; the lock-case is a plate round the edge of the door, making the edge of the door appear to be five-eighths thick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The difference between the safes is that the one in question is of thinner material, not so heavy; is not made by machinery; the difference is in the locks and the composition—we mix sawdust with alum; there is less alum in Mr. Carpenter's safe, and we use hard wood and his is soft wood.</p>

               <p>lock, it is for a wooden drawer, and not made for a safe—these locks were kept in stock at Cannon Street, in pigeon holes, for the purpose of sale-Scott had access to them—this is a blank key, it is not the proper key of that lock—they never make keys to this sort of lock so long as that—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the original length of key for that size lock—this was the original key to that lock before that other key was put to it—it is one of Mr. Chatwood's keys, but not of his finishing to the lock—it differs in a slight alteration to the levers inside the lock—it differs from the original one very little—I think it lifts the levers up a little higher—the escutcheon is screwed on outside the safe door—when the escutcheon is put on the original key is not long enough to open it—the key now here attached to the lock is made to open it when the escutcheon is on—the blank key is to show how the keys are sent up from Bolton—we kept blank keys at the stores in a cupboard, and that is one of Mr. Chatwood's—on the back of this escutoheon you will see marked "Chatwood's three till"—the material it is made of is the same as this, evidently showing that this escutcheon is made out of these castings—this escutcheon which was on Mr. Carpenter's safe, is one of Chatwood's genuine escutcheons used for deed chests only, but never for safes—I generally kept the blank keys locked up in a cupboard—this key appears to be made out of a blank—these castings were not for sale at Cannon Street, they were used for making up safe locks only in the workshops—I have seen the safe at Mr. Carpenter's, and took off some of the locks—this handle was put on in my presence and taken off again to show me that it fitted—this lock I did not take off—it was screwed onin my presence and taken off again the same as the handle—the keys wereattached to it—I only took off these two locks—there were three on the drawers, I believe—this is one of Mr. Chatwood's—those locks are never used for anything but drawers—there were locks then missing from four drawers at the depot in Cannon Street—I do not know when they were taken off—this lock seems to have been taken off this drawer—I produce the drawers from Cannon Street, from which evidently the locks have been taken—they are never sold; I have seen Wagner frequently at the stores after and before business hours—as far as I know he had no business there.</p>

That key is from Mr. Carpenter's and that is the very lock off the safe—on the key there is "Chatwood, 120, Cannon Street, E.C" on one side and "Invincible "on the other—why I say that key is not made by Chatwood, although bearing those words, is because this stamp is ordered for the London shop's use only, but the original key made for this sort of lock is always stamped at Bolton, "Chatwood, Bolton" on one side, and "Chatwood's Invincibles "on the other—there is not the least doubt that that is made out of the same blank as this—the two handles do not come from the same pattern and the heads of the screws are different—I did not fit the key produced to the lock.</p>

               <p>formation of "Chatwood and Co., Limited"—I first began the manufacture of safes nearly twenty years ago—my first patent was dated 1860—a limited company was formed for carrying on the business in 1863, from which time I occupied the position of general manager up to the time of my meeting with a railway accident at the end of 1868, when I was obliged to relinquish the office, and I was away from the business—I was appointed managing director again in 1874 I think—the depot in Cannon Street first came into existence, I think, in 1868, which I believe was first on the company's own account entirely, and afterwards I took the entire responsibility of the commercial part of the business, and the company supplied the safes to me on sale or return—they remained the property of the company until after they were sold, and an account sale was rendered regularly to the company of the parties' names to whom they were sold—I was responsible to the company for the debts, and out of that I paid all commercial charges not only in London but in Bolton, Manchester, and everywhere else—I got a commission on the amount of business done—the people employed in London were at one time the company's servants, and at another time my servants—I think that would be about 1870—in August, 1874, I suspended payment—when I resumed payment I entered into this agreement with Scott—this is the original. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 14th January</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">between Samuel Chat<lb></lb>wood, of Bolton-le-Moor, and James Henry Scott, appointing Scott agent in London</hi>.) Books were kept at Cannon Street, in which sales were entered—it was Scott's duty to make reports daily by post to me at Bolton of everything that was sold—I had on one or two occasions taken safes back of my own manufacture—Scott was competent to take safes back of my own manu<lb></lb>facture in part payment for others, allowing a suitable price for them—that was reported to me and entered in the books—I never gave permission to Scott or knew of his selling second-hand safes without communicating the circumstance to me—I have seen this safe of Mr. Carpenter's—I practically superintend the manufactory at Bolton—the safe in question was not manufactured at Bolton, or anywhere as a Chatwood's patent safe—in the first place it is not fire-proof; it is not of the same strength as those of my make; and not strong as our number 3 quality—the material is not of the same strength—the lock is not a safe lock; it was manufactured at my place, but it is one of very ordinary wooden drawer locks, a cabinet drawer, and the lock called a Lord's lock is a common lock of the same make—the safe is not burglar-proof or fire-proof—it is manufactured by hand; we manufacture ours by machinery—this is not my escutheon, but it is made out of the castings at my establishment—they are for use for 3-inch till locks—we never sell them—I have my books here—no communication was made to me by Scott or anybody else as to this safe at Mr. Carpenter's, neither is there any entry of it in the books—Wagner came into my employ at Bolton six or seven years ago, and left it three or four years ago, I cannot fix my memory—in August last I met Wagner near St. Paul's Churchyard—I told him that I was afraid he bad led Scott into mischief by inducing him to sell new safes of his manufacture as second-hand ones of my manufacture—I said "What right had you to sell one of your new safes to Carpenter, the pawnbroker, as one of my second-hand safes?"—he said "Scott sold it, not me"—he said that he had received 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, that he had not madethe whole of it, but part of it, and that it was made in London; that Scott had not sold a dozen of his safes altogether, and that it was a small matter, and to prove that, he would call at my hotel the next morning with</p>

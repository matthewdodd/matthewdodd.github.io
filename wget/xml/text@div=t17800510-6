               <p>I live in the same house with Hicks, on the back room of the ground floor; my door opens to the stair foot. These people go out to get their bread, and when they are out I generally enquire who goes up and down. I had been ill from the Wednesday till this Friday, then I was up sitting by the fire; my door was open. About three in the afternoon I heard some people go up stairs, but did not see them; I called to know who they were, who they wanted, knowing there was nobody in the house but myself they gave me no answer.</p>
               <p>Did you go up after them? - No, I was not able. They came down in about ten minutes after; hearing them coming down I got up and went to the door as well as I could; I saw two women, the first had passed me, I did not see her face; the last was Hatfield. I do not know whether the first was the evidence or Hickes, they had both brown gowns on. I said to the first of them, whom did you want? she said she had seen them she wanted. Hatfield turned round and smiled, and said the other only wanted her sister.</p>
               <p>How do you know the one that spoke was Hatfield? - By her face.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen her before? - No. They went out.</p>
               <p>How soon after did you see Hatfield? - On the Tuesday after, at the Lord Mayor's.</p>
               <p>Did you know her again immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure Hatfield is one of the persons who came down stairs? - Yes. Soon after they went away somebody else went up. I did not see who it was; I said, is that Poll? I thought it was a girl Hicks had sometimes to do things for her. She said nothing.</p>
               <p>How many went up? - One only,

One of them bid me tell her husband if he came home, she was gone to the Dolphin, and the other bid me tell her husband she was just gone out a little way. There was nobody left in the house but me.</p>

               <p>After you got up did you hear any body go up between one and three o'clock? - No, only the two people that went out. The accomplice said they fetched them out to take them to drink while they committed the robbery.</p>

               <p>I live at the sign of the Cock in Hand-alley, Cock-hill. On the 14th of April, I lived in Gravel-lane; the prisoners both lodged in my house. About half after three o'clock that day I was told Hicks was detected with some stolen things. I went to her room; there I saw Hicks and the other prisoner. The man who was at work with me was ordered by a woman to take them into custody, for that the goods were stolen. I said to my man, you are not an officer, you cannot take charge of her, we will send for Mr. Withers, which I did. Mrs. Hatfield took hold of two gowns which seemed to be quite new, both of a pattern. She said one of these is mine and the other is my sister's. I saw all the things there which are mentioned in the indictment except the woollen cloak. Then Mary Hatfield said her uncle had sent her three guineas and a half to get the things out of pawn, and that she had but one hall guinea left.</p>

               <p>Do not they live together in the same house? - Yes, one in one part of the house and the other in another. I found this apron (producing it) in Hicks's drawer. I found nothing in Hatfield's room.</p>

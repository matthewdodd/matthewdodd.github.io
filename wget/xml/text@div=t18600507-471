                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at Little Ilford, Essex—I was employed by Mr. Dean for the purpose of pulling down the Old Stratford Station—we pulled down part of it on the Saturday previous to 18th April—we had pulled some old lead and gas piping down—the bottom of the drain there, was left in—there were leaden traps in the drain—I believe this lead (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) belongs to the old station, but I cannot swear to it—it is part of the trap of a drain—this gas piping (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is similar to that which was lost—it was all safe on Monday the 16th, it was missed on Wednesday night—I employed Collins at the station—he was there on the 18th—he has been at work for me for four years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and surveyor, carrying on busi<lb></lb>ness at Stratford—I purchased the materials of the Old Stratford Bridge Railway Station, and employed the last witness, Mr. Jex, to pull it down—afterwards, in consequence of information I received, I communicated with police-constable, K 381, and went with him on Wednesday night, 18th April, to the house of Caroline Clarinbull, who keeps a marine-store shop—I believe this copper to be a portion of the copper that was at the station, it being a superior kind to that used in such buildings—this lead is a por<lb></lb>tion of that which went into the drain; these pieces were shown to us by Mrs. Clarinbull.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Edward Thomas Clarinbull, of West Ham, a marine-store dealer—two persons came to my place on 18th April last and offered some lead for sale—I said something to them, and they went out—they afterwards came back with the prisoner—I showed him the lead and asked him if I was to buy it, and he said yes, it was all right, it was only their beer money—he did not say what he was—he did not make use of the word "foreman"—he came as the foreman to me—I then bought what was offered to me—the prisoner was standing by at the time—I gave 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a 1<hi rend="italic">b</hi>, for the lead, and 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the copper—I afterwards gave it up to the policeman—these are the pieces which have been produced.</p>

               <p>At what house? - At the White Swan East Smithfield, I saw them again at three o'clock, that was the place where they fought, in the place called new Rag-fair in the street.</p>
               <p>Who else was in company with them? - Nobody but a girl that the deceased cohabited with.</p>
               <p>You left them drinking together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did you see them next, and at what time? - Nigh upon three o'clock near the Anchor and Crown, the back of the Swan in new Rag-fair.</p>
               <p>Were they together then, or did you see them meet? - They were together.</p>
               <p>What passed between them? - I cannot tell what the deceased said to the prisoner, I did not hear what it was, but the prisoner replied to him, and said <rs id="t17840421-31-deflabel180" type="occupation">

               <p>Did the prisoner return the blow? - No, he said he had rather drink with you than fight, and I will give it up to you, by that time there came up two soldiers and another man together, who said fight it out my lads, and we will see fair play and treat you with a shillings worth, with that they both stripped into their buff to fight.</p>
               <p>What happened after that? - At the first blow the prisoner's foot sliped and he fell at the deceased's feet, and there was no more falls between them, but they kept fighting as hard as they could.</p>
               <p>How long did they fight? - Three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>The deceased was not down at all? - No.</p>

               <p>What happened after that? - I heard the prisoner say some few minutes after that, shipmate, do not use me ill; the deceased did not answer, he seemed very much in liquor; after that there was a few blows passed on both sides.</p>
               <p>How came blows to pass? - By the deceased I believe striking the prisoner first; I saw him strike him as I passed.</p>
               <p>How came they to fight afterwards? - I cannot tell, I saw them fight.</p>
               <p>How did they fight? - I heard no words pass, but after that they seemed pretty sociable, and were going away together, and after that came up two soldiers and a gentleman, and the gentleman said, fight it fairly, and I will give you a shillingsworth; after sometime I saw the deceased come up, and take away his clothes, but what happened after that I cannot say.</p>

               <p>- LESLIE sworn.</p>

               <p>Court. I suppose you know nothing of the fact further than examining the body of the deceased? - No, I examined the body very strictly; I examined the head, and there was no kind of violence, but on the breast, between the belly and breast, near the heart, there were different bruises, like as if it was the knuckles of a hand; there might be about five or six, I examined him further, and found he was troubled with a rupture, but that was not the occasion of his death, that was in a perfect state; I opened the body, and when I opened the body in the internal part of the belly, I found a large portion of coagulated blood, and I went to the breast to see if I could find any thing there, it was perfectly clear of blood, but by the different contusions of the lungs, they were bruised sufficiently.</p>
               <p>Did you discover what vessels were broke? - In the belly I examined the vessels, and there I found one particular vessel was broke, my opinion therefore is, that he could not respire freely, but died in a very languishing state, and I am of opinion that these bruises were the cause of his death.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say, any further than I am a stranger in this place, and came here for my wages, I never was here in my life before.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this case does not seem to be attended with much doubt or difficulty; it is proved by the surgeon, that the bruises which this man received were the probable cause of his death, therefore the prisoner has by these bruises been the occasion of this misfortune; but the circumstances of the case exclude all idea of premeditated malice, or of that general malignant disposition which the law will construe into murder; it is the effect of a quarrel, intirely set on foot by the deceased; the deceased followed them with a declaration, he would give them both a good licking, and the answer of the prisoner in New Rag-fair was a peaceable one, saying, shipmate, do not use me ill; notwithstanding which, the deceased struck him; but even after that the prisoner declined fighting, and said he would rather drink with him than fight; and so it seems they would have parted, if some malignant people had not encourag ed them to fight again; that appearing clearly upon the evidence, you cannot altogether acquit the prisoner of blame, though clearly the case does not go further than manslaughter, nor is it a very unfavourable case of that kind.</p>

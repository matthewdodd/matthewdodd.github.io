               <p>I am a baker, in Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Are you a housekeeper there? - I am.</p>
               <p>Do you remember being present on Tuesday night when Lord Mansfield's house was destroyed? - I believe it was half after twelve on Wednesday morning before I went there. Some of the mob were then in the one-pair-of-stairs rooms, pulling down the wainscoting and throwing the goods out at the window. I observed

             there throwing part of a desk and some small trunks and other goods out at the one-pair-of-stairs window.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing at the time she threw them out? - I did not hear her say any thing. I saw her remove from the one-pair-of-stairs floor to the two-pair-of-stairs floor, and throw out some more goods.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her make use of any expressions? - I did not hear her speak at all. I saw Kent at the same time bringing out some bottles, whether empty or full I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long was it afterwards before they went away? - In less than half an hour. Upon their going away I walked close behind them up Russel-street, through Tottenham-court-road. I heard her declare to Kent, who was with her, that she had loaded herself well. Kent has a wooden leg.</p>
               <p>Was the man who carried out the bottles the man with the wooden leg? - Yes; he was with her.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards do any thing to either of them? - Yes, I watched them to the end of Bambridge-street, turning out of Russel-street. I went down the left-hand side; the prisoners were on the right-hand; they seemed rather to suspect me; they both turned round and set their backs to the house, and faced me. I went across the street and seised the woman by both her hands, and I took her to the watch-house. She asked what I wanted with her? I said, you know you have destroyed a great deal of Lord Mansfield's property, and have some about you. She answered, She would give me the property if I would let her go. I said no, she should go to the watch-house. She said what she had got was given her in the house, and she had not taken it. Before I took her to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280193"></xptr> watch-house she threw a small picture behind her, which I believe was the property of Lord Mansfield; this is it (producing a small oval picture). When I took her to the watch-house, the watch-house-keeper would not take charge of her. She had a great deal of bundling round her. I wanted her to be searched; the watchman said he would not run the risque of losing his life for me. She delivered this book in the watch-house (producing it). I left her there in care of the watch-house-keeper.</p>
               <p>What became of the man? - The man went off directly as I seized her.</p>
               <p>Are you positive that the prisoners are the persons you saw at Lord Mansfield's house doing what you have described? - They are. I called upon Mr. Platt, Lord Mansfield's clerk, the next day, to inform him that these things were in the watch-house. The watch-house-keeper said he knew her very well, and where she lived.</p>

I did not go away from the office, till about three o'clock or a little before, on the Wednesday morning. I went with Mr. Parker, who is a magistrate, and a party of soldiers to Lord Mansfield's, just before three o'clock. A little before four o'clock I was sent for an engine. When I got half way down Dyot-street I saw the prisoners, they crossed into another street; I crossed after them, and went to them; I perceived the woman had something under her arm, which caused me to follow her; it turned out to be this petticoat (producing it) it was wrapped up in a napkin. I asked her whose that was; she said she got it from Lord Mansfield's, but it was given her by the mob. She had this apron on (producing it). I did not say any thing to her about that till I got her into the round-house, then I searched her, and took from her this petticoat (producing it) she had it under her black one.</p>

               <p>I was at the fire but I was never near the house. I do not know of which side the house the door is. I picked these things up, except the green petticoat which the mob gave me. I thought I might as well take it as let the flames consume it. Coming away I met this young man; he was not near the house, nor was I; I was not near the fire myself; I was by the Duke of Bedford's wall.</p>

               <p>I never was near the house; I stood at a distance off, with other people looking at the fire; there were several other people there whom I knew myself; and one or two, I knew myself in the house. I have but one leg, and so he took notice of me.</p>

               <p>At that time were the mob destroying any part of the house? - Yes; they were then in the lower rooms of the house destroying every thing.</p>

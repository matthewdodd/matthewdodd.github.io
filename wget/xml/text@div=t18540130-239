                  </hi>. I am a lighterman and waterman, of Hampton. On a Wednesday, about a fortnight ago, I missed a piece of copper pipe from my shop; it was worth about 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as old copper—I went to Mr. Harriss', a marine store dealer, of Hampton, and asked him if he had bought a piece of pipe—he produced a piece, which I knew to be mine directly he showed it to me—I left it with him, to take care of for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a marine store dealer, of Hampton. One Satur<lb></lb>day in this month the prisoner came and brought me a piece of copper pipe—I think it was last Saturday fortnight—he was alone—William Benn came a day or two afterwards, and I showed him the pipe I had bought of the prisoner—he claimed it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>the prisoner, on Thursday, the 19th—he asked me what I was going to take him for, and I told him for a piece of copper he had sold to Harriss—he told me he had received it from William Glazier, to sell for him—I sent for Glazier—he came to Mr. Benn's shop, and I took him into custody—he was in Mr. Benn's employment at that time—the prisoner said he received the pipe from Glazier on Saturday afternoon, to sell, and he had received 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Glazier for selling it—Glazier denied all knowledge of it, or of having seen it—I took them both to the station, and Glazier was discharged by the Magistrate, there being no evidence against him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read, as follows:</hi> "On Saturday, 14th Jan., about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was crossing the road towards my home, and was called by Glazier; he asked me if I would go and sell this piece of copper for him; I asked him if it was his own, and he said, 'Yes;' I took it to Mr. Harriss's shop, and he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it; he asked me if it was right; I said, 'Yes,' and took the money back to Glazier, and he gave me 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I walked up the lane with him as far as he went, and I saw no more of him, but was taken into cus<lb></lb>tody.

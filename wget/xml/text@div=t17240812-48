The Prosecutor depos'd, that she being to go to Hampstead, about ten or eleven a Clock in the Forenoon, met with the Prisoner at Black Mary's Hole, and inquiring of him the Way to Pancrass, he told her he was going thither, and would conduct her; that they went together through Pancrass-Church-Yard, and coming to an Alehouse, the Prisoner would needs call for Drink, and was very urgent upon her to drink with him; but she refus'd; till at last he sitting down on an Alehouse Bench, and having call'd for Drink, he over-perswaded her, and she did sit down at the other end of the Bench, and did drink part of a Pint of Drink, he very much pressing her, and telling her there could be no harm in it, and taking her by the Hand, constrained her to sit down; that afterwards they went to Kentish-Town, and the Prisoner call'd at the Black Lion for some Brandy, and urged her to drink a Dram with him, which she did; that then she inquiring the Way to Hampstead,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172408120006"></xptr> the Prisoner told her he would show her the Way, and she not knowing it, he carry'd her through by-Fields, that went towards Highgate, and in the Fields opening her Hand by Force, took the Ring off from her Finger, and turned into another Field out of the Way, that she followed him and asked him for her Ring, to which he replyed, he would give it her again presently, but did not, but offered Rudeness to her, that he carried her round about for a great while, telling her, she was in her way to Hampstead, till at last she found to the contrary; that she having a Calamanco Gown in her Handkerchief, he took that from her also, and told her now she was obliged to follow him; that he carried her rambling about, calling at several Places, but she was afraid to charge him with her Ring, &amp;c. for fear he should do her some Injury, because they were People of his Acquaintance, till at last they had wandred till they came into Long Alley, and at the Sign of the Dolphin he went in, and gave the Gown to the Maid, and bid her not deliver it to her till the next Morning, but she being resolved not to go without it, the Gown was given to her again, that after that the Prisoner went with her to the House where she lodg'd, and her Landlord being a Constable, she demanded her Ring of the Prisoner, but he deny'd that he had it, but owned it the next Morning. That he did deny having the Ring, on the over Night, was proved by two Evidences. And that he produc'd it the next Morning in the Counter, was depos'd by the Prosecutor's Landlord, the Constable.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his Defence pleaded, That he having some Business at Kentish Town was going thither, and as he was sitting on a Stile near Pancras, the Prisoner came to him and ask'd him the way to Pancras, that he directed her, and when they came to the Adam and Eve, he sat down on one end of the Bench, and called for a Pint of Drink, and the Prosecutor sat down on the other, and fumbling with her Hand in her Pocket, began to complain that she had the Misfortune to lay her Money down at home, instead of putting it in her Pocket, and so had left it behind her, otherwise she would have had a Pint of Ale and a Cake; that he replyed, she was very welcome to drink with him, that he drank to her, and she drank, edging nearer and nearer to him, from one end of the Bench to the other, that the Landlord brought some Cakes, and she took one; that then they went forward to Kentish Town, and went to the Black Lion, and called for 2 or 3 Pints of Drink, and for 3 half Quarterns of Brandy, which tho' she refused at first, she afterwards drank very freely. That then she enquired the way to Hampstead, that they having staid there 3 or 4 Hours, he then went to speak to some Farmers about putting 2 Horses to Grass, that the Prosecutor went with him, that he went no By-ways, nor did violently take the Ring; but the Prosecutor gave him the King as a Pledge, for her Part of the Expence he had been at, in their long Journey, that she also gave him the Gown to carry for her, which he did, that at length, at Night, arriving in Town, at Long Alley they went in to drink, and had 3 Pots of Drink, and at another Place 2 or 3 half Quarterns of Brandy, and then he went with the Prosecutor to her own Lodgings, it being about 11 a Clock at Night. That this was their Progress, that he did not rob her of her Ring, and he hoped God was above the Devil Still. Another Evidence depos'd, That the Prosecutor and Prisoner came to his House at the Dolphin in Long Alley, about 7 or 8 a-Clock at Night, and staid there till 11, and had three Pints of Drink, that the Prisoner had a Ring on his Finger, and he asked him if it was his own, that he reply'd no, it was the young Women's, that they drank very familiarly together, were very loving; that the Prisoner kissed the Prosecutor, and she again the Prisoner several times, and afterwards he (this Evidence) also kissed the Prosecutor, that after they had drank their Drink with much Pleasaniness, they went away lovingly together, she taking the Prisoner hold by the Arm, and went away like Man and Wife, or like Whore and Rogue, and he took them all the while to be in a sort of Courtship. Another Evidence depos'd, That he was present when the Prisoner and Prosecutor came in, and were very familiar and loving, kissing one another with that Freedom, that tho' he was an old Man, it made him blush, that the Prosecutor said to the Prisoner, my dear, I hope we shall drink together, we have been together all Day, and I am dry, that she said she was a little faint, and Brandy was called for, and they drank together, and afterwards went away very lovingly together.

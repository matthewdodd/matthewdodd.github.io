                  </hi>. I live in Harford-street, Lower-road, Islington. I have known the prisoner many years—I was present at the parish church of Islington on 3d January, 1846, and saw a marriage take place between the prisoner and Elizabeth Craven—she is living, and is now in this court—after they were married, I saw them together frequently for about six weeks, and then he turned her out—the last time I saw them was in 1849, they were quarrelling at my door—she wished to obtain an entrance.</p>

                  </hi>. I was married to the prisoner in 1854—this is the register of the marriage—I got it at the church—I was not aware that the prisoner was married—he said he had been a widower fourteen years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> About the middle of December, 1845, I asked Craven if she was in debt; if she owed any money—she said, "Yes"—I asked if she owed her landlord any rent—she said, "Yes, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I gave her 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay her landlord, and whatever debts she might owe—I said, "If there is anything comes on me after we are married, very likely it will</p>

               <p>make it very uncomfortable—in January, 1846, we were married; she had no furniture; and about the middle of January her sister came and claimed the whole of the furniture—I gave it to her, and she took it away; and Craven had not a bed to lie on, a chair to sit on, a table to eat on, a gown to put on her back, under clothing nor over clothing—I had to buy them—on 14th February, about six weeks after we were married, away she goes—she had run me in debt, at the little chandler's shop right opposite, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; at the butcher's, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi>, and took between 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—I never saw her till 1847, when I allowed her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—I gave a man, named Giles, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he was to pay her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, and take her I O U for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she received that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in 1848 I allowed her again 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week; I paid the money to a boy that is here to take it to her every week—from 1849 till 1856 I never saw her at all—in 1856 I saw her walking with a woman name Rose; they stopped me to tell me that a friend of mine had nearly dropped down dead—in April, 1852, I was ill, and Mr. Lawrence, of Goswell-street-road, gave me an order to go to Clerkenwell Workhouse—I believe I was there about five or six weeks, and about a fortnight after I went there, the master of the workhouse, who is now master of Marylebone Workhouse, sent the porter to me—the porter called me into the yard; he said, "Your wife is dying: if you like to go out and see her you can"—I said, "My wife! I don't know where to find her no more than a child; I have not seen her for three or four years; she robbed me and left me"—he said, "Your wife lies dead; if you like to go out you can"—I said, "If you had brought me a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, you would not have brought me better news"—these facts can be proved by application at Clerkenwell Workhouse—I could have brought those persons, but I had no money, being out of work—I have not had a farthing since November—when I married Elizabeth Lorimer, I never knew but what that woman was actually dead—when I left the workhouse, I was had up before the board, and the master stated before the sixteen guardians that a message had come there respecting my wife, that she was dead—when I went out, the first person I went to was this boy and his brother; I said to him, "Do you know whether Mrs. Craven is dead?"—he said, "I do not know anything about Mrs. Craven; if she had died twenty years ago, all the better for you." I went from there to Greenman-lane, to a person who is now gone to Australia; she told me she did not know whether she was dead; but she said, "I have no doubt that she is dead"—I then went to a person named Probert, who knew her perfectly well; I said to her, "Mrs. Probert, do you know whether Mrs. Craven is dead?"—she said, "I dare say she is; the last time I saw her was a month ago, and I thought she could not live that day out"—I went to the master, and told him, and he said, "You take it for granted that she is dead"—I did not know but what she was actually dead.</p>

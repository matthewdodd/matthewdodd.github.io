                  </hi>. On the afternoon of 22d Sept. I was at a cellar occupied by my brother-in-law, John Baker, who carries on a fire-wood business—the prisoner, who is in my brother's employ, was working there—I left in about half an hour to have some beer, and I asked the prisoner to have some too, and while at the public-house I felt in my waistcoat-pocket for my tobacco-box, which had a sovereign in it, and it was gone—I had taken it out and used some tobacco while at the cellar—my sovereign was then safe—I thought I had put the box into my pocket again, but I am not sure—I left the prisoner at the public-house, went back to my brother's, and there heard something about my box, in consequence of which I went back to the public-house, and the prisoner was gone—that was between two and three in the day—I found the prisoner at twelve the same night in his lodgings—he had not been back to his work, he had no more work to do—I spoke to him about my box, and he said he had not seen it—I gave him into custody—I have never seen the box or money since—in the evening he had a new coat and trowsers on.</p>

I cut up fire-wood in my cellar—the prisoner lodged with me and worked in my cellar—Drake came to me on this afternoon about two o'clock—the prisoner was then there, my youngest son, my eldest son, and another man—I saw my brother with the tobacco-box and the sovereign in it—I picked it up off the floor, and threw it up in the window-ledge—that was before they left for the public-house—I did not think it was my brother's box—I remained in the cellar till my brother came back and made inquiry about the box—I then looked at the ledge, and it was gone—my little boy then told me something about it.</p>

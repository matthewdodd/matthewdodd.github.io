On the 14th of January, about half-past eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160042"></xptr>o'clock in the evening, I was in his shop, and saw a man put his hand inside the door, and take a pair of bellows - I believe it was the prisoner; I alarmed my master, who ran and brought the prisoner back with them.</p>
               <p>MOSES SIMMONS. I heard the alarm, and pursued a man whom I saw running with a pair of bellows into Redlion-street, and then into Dorset-street - he turned back, and was taken by a man - I came up to him, and he hit me three or four times on my head, and said he would not go with me as I was not an officer - I threw him on the ground, and took him; I then got a light, went back to the place, and found the bellows there - I believe the prisoner is the man whom I saw with them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Paternoster-row - a butcher laid hold on me first, and said, "You have stolen a pair of bellows;" I said, "I have not," and he threw me on the ground, and hit me very much - the witness then came up, and I said, "Are you an officer? if you are I will go with you;" in falling I happened to touch him in the face, but not with an intent to hurt him.</p>

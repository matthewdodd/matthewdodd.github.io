                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant R</hi> 4). On Friday morning, 6th October about 2 o'clock, Bray was brought to the station by two men—I believe they made a charge, but I was not there when he was brought in—when I arrived at the station I saw Bray there—I looked at the warrant and his name was not on it; he was allowed to go—subsequently I took him to the Seamen's Hospital to the prosecutor's bedside, with a policeman in plain clothes—I put them on the right side of the bed as the prosecutor was lying and I asked him if he knew me—he said "I do, Mr. Goodwin;"he seemed very ill; he recognised me first—I asked him to look to the right and see if he could recognise anybody there—he did so and said "Yes, that man there," pointing out Bray—I asked him if he was quite sure—he said "Yea, I am "—he said Bray had kicked him in the side—Bray said "Are you quite sure, old fellow, it was me?"—he said "Yes "—Bray said he was not there at all at the place—I apprehended Bailey at 75, Argus Street, Deptford—I asked for him; they said he was not in, and then that he was; we stopped in the passage and he got out at the window; after a severe chase we caught him; I did not see him come out at the window, but he could not come out anywhere else—I told him I should apprehend him on suspicion of being concerned with two others now in custody, viz., Bray and Matthews, for an assault on a man named William Phillips, in Mill Lane, on 5th Occtober—he made no reply; he was very much out of breath—at the station the charge wab read over to him by the inspector and he said "I was not there and know nothing about it."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Attenborough. Some five minutes after he was allowed to go—he was was walking quietly out of Greenwich into Deptford—he had a slight scratch by the side of his nose when brought to the sta<lb></lb>tion—I have heard there is some one about there like Bray; I have known Bray from his childhood; I am told people think the other man like him; I do not think so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Straight. I went to Argns Street, Deptford, with the other officers; they were posted round the house.</p>

On Sunday, 8th October, about 2.30 a.m., I apprehended Matthews at the common lodging-house, Deptford Chambers, and charged him with being concerned with others in the assault at Mill Lane—he did not say anything—one of the men in the adjoining bed said "You had better go and clear yourself, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>"—he said "I don't know anything about it"—I took him to the police-station—I saw the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's wife there, and Walter Wood and John Phillips; they were unable to identify him—we took him to the hospital at 6.30 in the morning—when</p>

               <p>the prosecutor saw him he said "He is one of the men that kicked me "—Matthews said "Was I dressed the same as I am now?"—the prosecutor said "No, you had a lighter coat on."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Metcalfe. I did not go and search for a lighter coat; it was a common lodging-house, and it is a question whether I should find one—he was in custody—when 1 took him to the prosecutor's bedside his brother was with him, the brother is like him; I took him on the 8th—I did not know that he was about Deptford during the interval between the 5th and 8th.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the White Swan, Blackheath Road—I was in the Crown and Sceptre between 11 and 11.30 on the evening of the assault—I know Bray perfectly well; I saw him there on that occasion, he was beastly drunk, speechlessly drunk, lying down on a velvet plush seat 1 and two men were taking his boots off; he was not capable of getting up—I saw him again at 11.30 at my house, the White Swan, about 400 yards distant—he stayed about five minutes and was taken away in a bath chair—I believe there is a man in the neighbourhood resembling Bray, not quite so tall, I think, I do not know him personally.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know him by sight—I did not give this evidence at the police-court—I did not know at the first hearing of Bray that he was there, I did not know whilst he was at the police-court—this is my first appearance in this case—I did it on behalf of Mr. Bray; he has an uncle who sent one of his men to me to ask me; he did not suggest the date to me, I will swear it; it was on Wedneday I know for reasons I could state—I was not spoken to about it until last Monday—I should not have come then but for the uncle—I remember the exact. Hay because my father went to pay some money at the distillery—I met Bray in the public-house afterwards and saw him drunk—he is a regular customer, he makes a habit of using my house at dinner times—it was nothing unusual he should be there on 5th October; he may have been there on the 4th, 3rd, 2nd or any day in Sep<lb></lb>tember—it was not my Bath chair—a man from the Heath came in with it.</p>

I keep the Fountain Inn, Broadway Junction—I heard of this assault the next day—that evening I saw Bray wheeled in a bath chair between 11 and 12 o'clock, I could not say to a few minutes; he was quite intoxicated—he asked me to draw him a pot—I said he had had quite enough—I ordered him out and stood at the door while they wheeled him out—I did not see him go in the fish-shop—I saw the machine go up to the door and stop there—my house is about 300 yards off—I stood at the door with the witness' father, Walter Wood, at about 12.30, and saw thirteen or fourteen men pass and turn up the lane about 12.45—I had shut the house up a few minutes before—I noticed several men I knew in the crowd—I did not see either of the prisoners—I know one or two very like Bray,</p>

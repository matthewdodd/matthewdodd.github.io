                  </hi>. I am a looking-glass frame maker, of 37, Britannia Street, Hoxton—I have lived with the prisoner about fifteen months—we represented ourselves as man and wife—I went to Tottenham with her on Whit-Monday, and we there met a young man named Archer—we all had some drink together, and left Tottenham about 7.30 in the evening—we had been drinking all day at intervals—we were delayed by the train and did not arrive in London till 9—I then went with Archer and the prisoner to the London Apprentice public-house, in Old Street, St. Luke's—we left there about 10—when we got to Pitfield Street, I told Archer I did not want to see him home—I could see myself home—he said he should not like to leave our company—I said I had had enough of him, and if he wanted to please me he would bid us "Good night!"—he did so—I was giving it to the prisoner about making so <hi rend="italic">free</hi> with the young man in my company—she said she had not done so—I hit her across the back with a stick—I might have hit her twice or more—I have brought the stick to show—she was not in liquor—she had had a little drop, but nothing to speak of—when I hit her she halloaed out "Police! murder!" and a mob gathered round, and Archer came back—he asked me why I did not go home and let the woman be—I told him to mind his own business, I said I had had enough of him, and he was the cause of the <hi rend="italic">row,</hi> making so free with her—</p>

               <p>he said I was to go home and not to hit her, and he said to the prisoner "If he hits you any more, you stab the b——,"and with that he went alongside but whether he gave her the knife then, I could not see—I went towards' her, and told her to go home, and then she struck me in the belly—I did not know the knife had gone into me at first—I said afterwards "Why you have stabbed me, what have you done it with?"—I felt for my knife and it was in my pocket—she said she had not stabbed me—the police came up then, and I was taken to the doctor's shop, the prisoner followed—I accused her of stabbing me, and she said she had done so, and she had given the young man the knife back again—I asked her what young man, and she said the young man who had been in her company all day—I was taken to the station, and then to the hospital—I was there a fortnight and three days—the constable showed me the knife in the doctor's shop—when I was hitting the prisoner a mob came round, and Archer came up with the mob—I might have hit her two or three times—I gave her a black eye about a month ago—I have given her a black eye more than once in our fights at home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet maker, and live at Church Street, Bethnal Green—I was at the Ferry House, at Tottenham, last Whit Mon<lb></lb>day, about 3 o'clock—I saw Reeves and the prisoner there—I had never seen them before—I got a pint of half-and-half and went in the grounds where they were sitting—the prisoner asked me to go and get her a pint of ale, and I got it—Reeves was then asleep—he woke about three-quarters of an hour after I had been there—the prisoner said to him "This young man has treated me," and he said "I will treat him;" and we all went to the pext house, kept by Mr. Dabbs—we had three pints of ale there—we arrived in London about 8 o'clock, and went to a public-house in New Inn Yard, and had three pots of half-and-half—we then went to the London Apprentice—while we were there, Reeves asked me for a pocket knife to clean out his pipe—I pulled my knife out, and he said "Never mind, I have got one of my own"—the <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> said "That is a nice knife"—I said "I will give it to you," and I gave it to her as it only cost me 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I bid them "Good night" at the corner of Pitfield Street—I crossed over the road, and as I came back I saw them quarrelling—he was hitting her over the head with a stick he had in his hand—he had been hitting her at Tottenham—I took the stick away from him there, but he would not let me have it only a minute or two, and I gave it back to him—when I got to the corner of Pitfield Street I saw the prisoner run at the man—she then <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the knife into my hand—I closed it, and put it in my pocket—only one blade was open—she said "Here is your knife," and I put it in my pocket—I saw her strike Reeves with it before that—I gave her the knife at the London Apprentice, and not in Pitfield Street—Reeves said "Look what she has done to me, and it is through you."</p>

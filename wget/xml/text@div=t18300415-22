            . I am constable of the Bethnal-green Police-division. I was on duty in North-street, Whitechapel, about two o'clock in the morning of Good Friday- I know the prisoner; I saw him on horsbeack standing still, and asking a private watchman where Mr. Downes lived - the watchman told him there was no such person there, and asked what he wanted with Downes; he said he had brought a pony to be killed by Downes, and he must have him killed before he went away, for it was his master's order; the watchman asked him if anybody besides Downes would do, as there was no such person there, and he could call a person up who would buy it - the prisoner said he dare not let any body else have it but Downes, he must take it back sooner than let any body else have it; I stepped up and asked him who his master was; he said Mr. Rake, of Plaistow - I said I was not satisfied with his story, and should take him into custody and keep him till day light - he then jumped off the horse, but I took hold of him; he did not resist or attempt to run away - I took him to the Police-station, and went to Rake next morning.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left home about twelve o'clock in the morning of the 9th of April - I was going to load a barge of sand, and by the East India Dock warehouse, I saw a man beating the pony with a stick; I asked where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150026"></xptr>he was going, he said to London - I said I knew the pony, that it belonged to Mr. Rake; he said he did not know but he had bought it - I said I knew three persons it had belonged to before; he asked how long I had been with Rake - I said I had left him three weeks; he said he would give me a turn, to take the pony to Downes; he took my shovel out of my hand, and told me if I was asked about the pony, to say I was going to take it to Downes to be killed - he went away; I went on, saw a watchman, and inquired for Downes; he said there had not been such a person there for years - I told him my employer had authorised me to take it there, and he was to meet me there; he wanted me to take it to another person - I said No, I knew the person it formerly belonged to, and should take it back there; the Policeman came up; I told him it belonged to Rake, and I should take it back - he said he thought I had not got it honestly; I said I would go with him any where; I got off the pony - he found a small trowel in my pocket, and a piece of paper which I had from the workhouse; I told him if he would go to Plaistow, and shew master that paper, he would know who had the pony.</p>

I found a man rather close upon my heels all the way up the Strand; a boy ran in after me and said, have not you lost your handkerchief? I felt and missed it; he said a man who was gone up towards Temple-bar had stolen it. I went after him with the boy; we did not find him; we came back; the boy said he often came by of an evening, and he knew him very well, and supposed he would come by again; I ate my supper at the coffee-house; I told the boy if he would give intelligence if the thief came back, I would give him something; the boy afterwards came in and said the thief was gone by; I ran out; he pointed out the prisoner; I took him into the coffee-house, and in the presence of a great many people there he took out and dropped my handkerchief, and kicked it under the box; I am certain it is mine, it has my mark upon it. He was taken to the watch-house, and I was bound over to prosecute him. My lord, when I preferred the indictment, I said it was worth five shillings, as they cost me six shillings and sixpence by the dozen; I find by that means the indictment is laid capital; I was not aware of the consequence when it was so put down. This is the handkerchief (producing it) I sealed it up in a paper, and have had it ever since.</p>

               <p>You said somebody was near you; you do not know who it was? - No, I do not.</p>

               <p>I live at the Union Coffee-house. I was shutting up the shutters on the 9th of July, between nine and ten at night, I observed a man behind Mr. Estcourt, and saw him take something out of his pocket very quick.</p>
               <p>Do you know who that man was? - Yes, if I saw him (looks round) that is the man (pointing to the prisoner).</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150038"></xptr>Was there light enough to see him? - Yes. Myself and a gentleman who keeps an oil shop saw him one night picking pockets. The prisoner ran over the way; I went to ask Mr. Estcourt if he had lost any thing; he went away; I ran towards Temple-bar, but could not find him. Mr. Estcourt desired me, if I saw him again, to let him know. I stood at the door; I saw him again; and informed Mr. Estcourt of it. We went out and laid hold of him, and brought him into the coffee-house; we searched him. The prisoner took out the handkerchief behind his coat and dropped it.</p>
               <p>Did you see that? - No; I saw when he was first taken, that he shifted something into his hand behind his coat.</p>
               <p>From the prisoner. Did you see me near you, or find the property about me? - You was near me.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor laid hold of my collar and bid me pull all I had out of my pocket, which I did. He took me into the coffee-house and made me strip naked; he found nothing about me; he turned round to a bench and picked the handkerchief from under the bench. He had been all day in the coffee-house, as I hear: I am innocent of it.</p>

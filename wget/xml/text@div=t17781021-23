            ; I take in washing. On the 10th of October I asked the prisoner to come and wash for me, which she did; I counted out the linen to her; I went out between nine and ten in the morning and returned about six in the evening, she was then gone and had locked my door and taken the key with her; I went to her lodging and found the door on the latch, but she was not at home; I got a candle of the landlady and went in and found my key on her table; I went and opened my door, and found she had put the linen in the tub and some water on it, but no soap; I did not miss any thing then; being tired I went to bed. The next morning I found my drawers open; and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment, (repeating them). She was taken on the Friday following, and some of my things were found upon her.</p>

               <p>I heard that Mrs. Mildred had been robbed; the prisoner came to the Brown Bear in East-Smithfield to surrender herself; she said the cloak and black crape she had on were Mrs. Mildred's; I asked her how she came to take the things, she said she was in liquor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177810210014"></xptr> that she took a knife out of her pocket and wrenched open the drawers. She had a white petticoat, a pair of white silk stockings, and a white laced cap of the prosecutor's on; she said there was a flowered linen gown at one Davidson's, a pawnbroker's over the water; and that she had pawned a gown in the Minories, and another petticoat in Rosemary-lane, but they were returned to the prosecutor again; Davidson was sent for, he would not come.</p>

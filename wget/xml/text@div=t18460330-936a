                  </hi>. I live in Dyer's-buildings, Holborn. On the 23rd of March, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I left my dress-coat hanging on a peg in the office—there was in it a note-case, in which was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, on a Somersetshire bank, payable at Taunton; and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank note—there was also a silver tablet—one was in one pocket, and one in the other—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, and live in Holborn. About half-past seven o'clock on the evening of the 23rd of March, the prisoner, Peter, came to my house and asked if I bought old silver—he offered me this silver tablet-case, and asked if I would buy that—I looked at it, and immediately I knew it—I asked where he got it—his reply was, "I bought it in Paris five months ago"—the female was not with him when be first came in—I said, "I believe I know this case; I believe it belongs to a friend of mine; are you sure you bought it?"—he then repeated that he was quite sure he bought it in Paris five months ago—I said, "I believe Mr. Moss, the owner of this, lives but a little way off, I will just send for him"—I am not aware that he made any reply, in fact he seemed half intoxicated at the time—I sent for Mr. Moss—he was not at home—the prisoner stopped there until the messenger returned—I said, "I shall retain this case until I see Mr. Moss and ask him"—I gave him a bit of paper, and he put his address, 72, Mark-lane, upon it—I asked his name, and I wrote it, "Mr. Anson, 72, Mark-lane."</p>

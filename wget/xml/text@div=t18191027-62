On Tuesday, the 12th of October, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270039"></xptr>came to my master's shop between two and three o'clock, and said he wanted some calico to repair a shirt or shirts; he shewed me the shirt he had on. I found a piece which measured two yards. He said he would not mind taking a remnant if I put it low - I agreed for 1 s. 9 d. He took out a 1 l. Bank note, I examined it, and thought it looked like a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing written on it - A. I saw W. B. on the back in large letters, and I thought the signature of Draper to the note was more scrawling than he in general writes. Mr. Senier and Mr. Denbigh were at dinner; I knocked at the wainscot, Mr. Denbigh came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he came down had you said any thing to the prisoner - A. I asked his name? he gave me a short name of one syllable, which began with a B - it sounded to me like Blain.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not M'Dermot - A. Quite sure. Mr. Denbigh came down; I told him, in the hearing of the prisoner, that he had given me the note. I presented the note to Mr. Denbigh, and said I believed it to be bad - Mr. Denbigh also said he thought it to be bad; he took it up to Mr. Senier. I was left below with the prisoner. While Mr. Denbigh was gone, I asked him where he had taken it? he said, at No. 47, Harley-street, that Lady Page Turner owed him 1 l., and he had received it of her servant an hour before. Mr. Denbigh and Mr. Senier came down - Mr. Senier had the note in his hand, said he thought it bad, and asked him if he knew where he had taken it? he said he had taken it at No. 47, Harley-street, at Lady Page Turner's. Mr. Senier said,</p>
               <p>"If you have taken it of Lady Page Turner, of course you will get another for it if it is bad." Mr. Senier asked him his name? he gave it as before, in a mumbling manner, but it was the same sound, though he did not speak so distinctly.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Senier told him Lady Page Turner would give him another, what then - A. Mr. Senier said,</p>
               <p>"My young man (meaning me) had better go with you, to see if you have taken it there." He said</p>
               <p>"Very well." Mr. Senier gave me the note, and I put it into my waistcoat pocket - I had no other. He and I went to 47, Harley-street. When we got to Harley-street he asked me for the note - he had asked me for it several times before he came to the door - he said it was his, and he would have it; I refused to give it up - we were then at 49, within two doors of 47. He stopped, and asked me if I was going to give it up? I told him if it was a good one he should have it. I then laid hold of his arm, and walked up to the door of 47 - he himself rang the bell. The man-servant came to the door, I asked him if Lady Page Turner lived there? he said No. I then told him the circumstance in the prisoner's hearing - the prisoner never asked for any one there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the servant say - A. The servant said that he had not been there, and he knew nothing of him. I then turned to him, and asked him how he could tell such falsities? He then said he did not tell me he had taken it No. 47, Harley-street. I said that could not be denied, because he had said it in the presence of Mr. Senier, Mr. Denbigh, and myself. We left - he then kept demanding the note until we came to Cavendish-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his saying any thing about a letter - A. When I asked him how he could tell such falsities, he said he had not told me he took it there, but that he had received it in a letter from Lady Page Turner, and that it said,</p>
               <p>"47, Harley-street." When he got to Cavendish-square, he said he would not go back with me, for he owed Mr. Senier nothing, that he had done him no injury, and there was no occasion for him to return. Instead of going on the pavement he went out towards the rails, I went with him towards Oxford-street, he then stopped, and said he would go no further, and that he would have the note. He then collared me - I told him from his conduct I believed he knew the note to be forged when he offered it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any answer - A. He said he would be d - d if he would not make me give it up. I laid hold of him by the arm, and said I would neither let him nor the note go. When he collared me I was afraid he was going to strike me, and called for help - no person was passing. He seemed frightened, walked a few paces towards Mortimer-street, and before we got out of the square he stopped again, and swore he would go no further. I then interrupted a gentleman who was passing, told him the circumstance, and shewed him the note; he said he thought it a bad one. I told him to mind that the prisoner did not snatch it. The gentleman said he must return with me. Several persons came round - the gentleman returned me the note - it was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. You got home at last - A. Yes. I gave the note to Mr. Denbigh, and told him in the prisoner's presence what had passed. I called Mr. Senier down, he proposed that the prisoner should go with me and Mr. Denbigh to the Bank - the prisoner said he was obliged to be home by appointment by four o'clock, and could not go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where his home was - A. He said somewhere about Grosvenor-square - he had told me on the road that he lived in Grosvenor-street. Mr. Senier proposed his going to Marlborough-street. The prisoner had before said that he was a respectable man, and well known in that neighbourhood - Mr. Senier said if it was so it would not detain him long at Marlborough-street. He then seemed much disturbed, and said he would satisfy Mr. Senier in any way if he would set him at liberty. Mr. Senier went to Marlborough-street and got Plank.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Harley-street what did you learn about Lady Page Turner, in the prisoner's hearing - A. The man said she had not lived there for two years, but I understood that she had formerly lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark the note - A. When the officer came he asked me if I had marked it? I said No, but I knew it by W. B. being on it. I then marked it - (looks at one) - this it. When the officer came, he said he had taken it of a man named Paterson, over Westminster Bridge. The officer asked him if he knew the name of the street? he said No, he should know the house if he saw it.</p>

            . I am shopman and brother-in-law to Mr. Senier. Bullock called me down, I saw the prisoner in the shop. Bullock gave me the note, I looked at it, and said in the prisoner's hearing, that I believed it to be bad. I took it up to Mr. Senier, who was at dinner; he came down with me, having the note in his hand. He asked the prisoner where he had taken it? he said he took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270040"></xptr>it at No. 47, Harley-street, of Lady Page Turner, that day - he said he took it of her servant. Mr. Senier said if he took it there, and it was bad, she would give him another, and proposed Bullock's going to 47, Harley-street, to inquire. They went together - the note was given to Bullock. As soon as they returned, Bullock related to me that Lady Page Turner had not lived there for two years, and that the prisoner had demanded the note to be given up to him - that the prisoner had collared him in Cavendish-square, and insisted on its being given up - that he wanted to get from him, and Bullock laid hold of him, calling out for help; the prisoner then seemed afraid, came on a few paces, then stopped and would go no further; that a gentleman who was passing by came to assist him; he shewed the gentleman the note, who said it was bad, that several persons came round, and they brought the prisoner back.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had stated this had you any conversation with the prisoner - A. Mr. Senier then proposed his going to the Bank with me; he said he had an engagement at four o'clock, and should not he back in time. It was then proposed to go to Marlborough-street. Mr. Senier then fetched an officer unknown to him. Bullock gave the note up to me. I took it and put it in my pocket; in a short time I took it out, got a pen and ink, and asked the prisoner his name he said, as there had been so much to do about it he should not tell me. Plank came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner tell him where he took the note - A. Plank asked him where he had taken it? He said he took it of Paterson, over Westminster Bridge. Plank made a memorandum of it. This is the note (looks at one).</p>

            . I keep the shop in Portland-street, and remember the prisoner being there. I came down stairs, and found him and Bullock in the shop. Denbigh had shewn me the note up stairs, and given it to me. I came down, and gave the same note to Bullock, told the prisoner I suspected it to be forged, and inquired where he took it. I believe he said,</p>
               <p>"I took it of Lady Page Turner." I took very little notice, not expecting to be called here. He said he took it in Harley-street; I proposed that Bullock should go there to ascertain if he took it there. They went, and returned. Bullock related what passed.</p>

            . I am a signing clerk at the Bank. There is no other of my name. The signature is not my writing.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to buy the calico, and offered a note; he recognized it as bad. I said I took it of a servant who lived with Lady Page Turner, not an hour and a half ago. He said,</p>
               <p>"Where does she live?" I said she used to live in Harley-street. I went there, and coming back, demanded the note of him; a gentleman said I had better go back to the shop. He told his master a great deal more than was true - I did not collar him. They asked me to go to the Bank with them - I said it was late. An officer came, and I told him that I lived at Lynch's, No. 24, Reves's-mews, and that I got the note of Paterson. I did not know it was bad.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Are you sure he said that Lady Page Turner lived there, or that she had lived there - A. He said he took the note not half an hour before at No. 47, Harley-street, of Lady Page Turner's servant.</p>

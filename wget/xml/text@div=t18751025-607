                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Amersham Road, Deptford—on the evening of 11th September I was going from Greenwich towards home, about 11 o'clock or 11.30—the heel, of my boot caught in my dress and I fell down—at that time I was wearing a gold watch and an albert chain—a woman came up and brushed the dust from my dress—whilst she was doing that the prisoner was passing by, and the woman said "This appears to be a respectable young man, I should let him go with you, or you might lose your watch and chain"—I said "I am not afraid of that, I am not hurt, and do not require anyone to walk with me"—I was going down the road, and he walked by my side—when we got to the Amersham Road I said to the prisoner "I am at home now"—I was about two doors from my house—he took hold of my chain, which was fastened to my button-hole, and my watch pocket gave way, and he took my watch and chain and went down the Amersham Road to Amersham Villas, where I lost sight sight of him—I went to the police-station the next morning and gave information and a description of the man—the prisoner was afterwards brought by the police to my house, and I recognised him in a moment as the person who had robbed me—I was afterwards shown my watch and chain by the police—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I left my house a little after 9 o'clock that night—I did not get to Greenwich till long after 9 o'clock—I went there to see some friend—I did not say that you could see me home, but I did not object, and you walked by my side—it was near the church at Greenwich where I fell down—the woman did not pick me up—she had no bonnet or shawl on—she said she would accompany me, but she had to take her husband's supper—we left her a little further on—she did not put my hair up—I gave her something out of my purse, either 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or half-a-crown—I very likely told you I was a widow and had a son eleven years of age—I</p>

I am manager to Mr. William Henry Johnson, pawnbroker, at 89, Bermondsey New Road—on 20th September about mid<lb></lb>day, the prisoner came there and offered this gold watch and albert chain in pledge—in the first instance he asked 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I told him I could make it 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he appeared to want the money very much, and said his mother was lying dead at the time—I offered to make it 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said they cost him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. some short time previously—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man—he pledged them in the name of James Montague.</p>

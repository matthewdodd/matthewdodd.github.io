I was present when the prisoner struck the last witness, who is my sister, with the jug and the knife—I was standing near my door, about three doors off—my sister had not said anything to the prisoner before, that I am aware of—the prisoner only struck her once with the knife, that I saw—she might have done it twice—my sister became insensible from loss of blood, and a doctor came to her.</p>

I was on duty in this street, and heard cries of "Murder," and" Police"—I went to the spot, and found the prosecutrix bleeding from several wounds on the head and face, and one on the breast—the prisoner was pointed out to me as the woman who did it, and I took her in custody—directly afterwards somebody from amongst the crowd handed me this sailor's sheath-knife—there was wet blood upon it—they were shouting, "Here is the knife she had"—she heard that and said, "Oh, revenge is sweet"—I took her to the station, and she was charged—she said next day, at the police-court, that the prosecutrix struck her—I was very near the spot when it done—I saw the jug broke, and saw the pieces on the footway.</p>

I am a surgeon—I found the prosecutrix bleeding from a wound on the head, about an inch long, extending to the covering of the bone—a clean out, and another under the left eye, about an inch and a half long; an incised wound, and a superficial wound just through the skin, and another on the upper lip, also a superficial wound—there were two slight scratches on her bosom—they were all such wounds as might have been made by a jog being broken in the way described, and some of them might have been inflicted by such a knife as this—some of them may have been made with one and some with the other—they were not dangerous—she lost a good deal of blood from the wound in the head—I saw the prisoner, but did not take particular notice of her—I think the prosecutrix had been drinking.</p>

On Friday morning, 19th August, I was on duty in the London-road, about a quarter before 4 o'clock, near Mr. Fairhall's—my attention was directed to a house in Mansfield-street—I went through the house No. 129, London-road, which is next door to the prosecutor's—I there found a pair of steps placed against the wall at the back of the house—I went up those steps and found the property stated, on a lead flat belonging to the house No. 127, which is next door to the pro<lb></lb>secutor's—the property was in four different bundles; knives, forks, and</p>

I was called to a smith's shop, in Mansfield-street, near to the prosecutor's, on Friday morning, 19th August, about half-past 4 o'clock—I first went to the prosecutor's, and when I got there, I found two or three other constables coming down with the property—I searched, but I could find no one—we took the property to the station—I then returned back, and went to the smith's shop shortly after 6 o'clock, and as I got to the shop I saw the door move—I went to the door, and the smith opened it, and said, "What do you want?"—(he lives in the house adjoining, and comes in at the back door; the shop is not part of his house)—when I got in the smith said, "Here is a man here"—I found it was the prisoner—I said I had been looking for a man a long while—the prisoner was all over smut and dirt, the same as I was in climbing over the tiles—I took him to the station, and when the cap was produced, the sergeant said, "Here is your cap brought from Mr. Fairhalls"—the prisoner took and put it on, and said, "I am much obliged to you for bringing it"—when I found the prisoner he had no hat or cap on—there were other constables about—I placed one at the smith's shop and another at Mr. Fairhall's—the prisoner could get from Mr. Fairhall's to the smith's shop—he might go along the top, and there was a skylight through which he could get down.</p>

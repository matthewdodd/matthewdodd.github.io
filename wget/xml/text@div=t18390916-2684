                  </hi>. I am the brother of Charles Lines, a coach-maker, who lives in Blackfriars-road. The prisoner was in his service for some years,</p>

               <p>and resided on the premises—previously to the 1st of August we had two coach-springs there, one of Prince's, the other Orwood's and Grant's—I missed the one belonging to Prince, on Monday the 1st of August, and asked the prisoner if he had removed it from against a post in the smiths' shop where I had placed it on the Saturday night—he said he had not removed it, and it was very strange where it was—I was afterwards shown that spring, and the one of Orwood and Grant's, which I had seen a day or two before in the same place—it was shown to me by the officers on the Thursday—Prince's spring was marked with the name in my writing at full length.</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. I live with my father. On the day the spring was lost, the prisoner said it was a d—d strange thing where the spring had got to, and he supposed Jackman had taken it, or the foreman must have lent it to one of the customers.</p>

                  </hi>. I work for Mr. Lines. I saw the prisoner at work clean<lb></lb>ing an axletree—it was one belonging to Prince's carriage—I said it was very strange where Prince's spring was gone—he said the foreman had lent it to Shepherd, of Camberwell, or it was on one of the Camberwell <hi rend="italic">busses.</hi>

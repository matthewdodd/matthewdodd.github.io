                  </hi>. I was living at 4, John-street, Wellington-street—I am now living at 15, Vauxhall-street, Hoxton—I had been living with the prisoner as man and wife for eighteen months before this happened—I left him on the Tuesday afternoon, as this happened on the Wednesday—on Wednesday-night, 10th May, I was with a young woman named Ellen Sampson; we had been to the Britannia theatre, in Hoxton—as we were coming from the theatre we met the prisoner opposite the Downham-road—it was about half-past 11, or it might have been near 12—he asked me where I had been to—I said I would not tell him—he asked me again, and I said I had been to the theatre—he asked what business I had to go to the theatre; what did I want out at that time of night; and he asked me where his goods were—I told him I had sold them—with that I still aggravated him as we went along—he asked me if I would come home with him again—I said no, I did not wish any more to do with him—he asked me where the money was; I told him I had spent the money, I had bought some calico, and some boots—he kept continually asking me if I would come home with him—I said no, and I still kept aggravating him, and telling him to get away, I did not want any more to do with him—with that he said, if I still would aggravate him, he would kill me; he would stab me—he asked me whether I had made up my mind; I said, yes, I would not come home with him any</p>

Wellington-street—I was with Thompson on the night of 10th August, coming from the Britannia theatre—I saw the prisoner speak to her—I could not hear what he said at first—I heard him say, "Sally, where are my things;" she said, "Ask the landlady, she will tell you"—he said, "No, you know where they are"—she said, "Will you hit me"—he said he did not know—she said, "Will you take an oath you won't hit me"—he said, "I don't know," and she said, "Keep your hand in your pocket"—then the boy that was with him told me to go and tell a policeman, which I did, and the policeman followed them a little way, but not far—I left them, and met them again when they got to the Lamb, in Kingsland-road—I heard him continually asking her where his things were, and if she did not tell him he would hang for her—she said, "Will you keep your distance? if you wait till I get home I will tell you where they are"—when we got to Shacklewell-lane, he wanted her to go down there with him—she would not, and we walked on till we came near Wellington-street—he then said he would settle it, and I saw him give her one blow in the mouth; I saw him strike her four times with his left hand—I did not see anything in his hand—I screamed—I assisted in taking her to a surgeon's—I saw that she was bleeding—when the policeman came up I tore open her frock, and saw that she was stabbed once in the head, once in the shoulder, once in the breast, and once in the chest.</p>

I am a surgeon at the German hospital, Dalston—on the night of 10th August, the prosecutrix was brought there—she was suffering from four wounds, one on the right temple, one on the right shoulder, one on the right chest, and one on the left chest—the one on the right chest was a severe wound—they were such wounds as might have been inflicted with an ordinary pen-knife—she was an in patient for eight days, and an out patient for about a fortnight.</p>

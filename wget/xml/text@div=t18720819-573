I am a chemist, of Queen's Terrace, York Road, St. Pancras—on Saturday, 29th June, the prisoner came in for a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bottle of citrate of magnesia—my assistant served him—the prisoner tendered a florin, and I saw the assistant give him change—the prisoner left the shop—the assistant handed me the florin, and I found it was bad—on Saturday,</p>

               <p>20th July, the prisoner came in again for the same article—I recognised him—he tendered a bad florin—I accused him of having tendered that and one previously—he seemed very much confused, and wanted to refund the money, but I gave him in charge with the florins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't recollect that I had seen him before—I was within about two yards of my assistant, waiting on another customer—there were probably four or five customers in the shop, but I am in the habit of watching my assistants to see that the things are properly made up.</p>

I am a turncock—on Sunday, 21st July, I was going along the Camden Road, about 4.40 in the morning, and found this florin alongside the tramway, which I gave to Detective Dalton the following morning—I broke it with my teeth—I pointed the spot out to Dalton and to <hi rend="italic">Y</hi> 450.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I met the police on Monday morning—I had seen them before times out of number; I always meet them on their usual duty, and get into conversation with them—they are not friends of mine; I generally speak to them and pass the time of day with them—one of them addressed me first—I showed him the florin, and told him I had found it, and where I had picked it up.</p>

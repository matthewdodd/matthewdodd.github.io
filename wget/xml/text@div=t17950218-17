            What was the chaise in the street? - In the street. I was gone but a very little while, I said to my fellow servants, let us go and set the chaises to rights, draw them a little closer together; in the mean time, when I came down, I see the chaise door open, and I looked and see the whip and reins gone, and this gentleman came down and said he saw this lad take them out of the chaise, while I was talking about the loss.</p>
               <p>HEADITCH sworn.</p>
               <p>I was looking out of my own window in Holborn, on Monday, the 19th, there were five chaises assembled together for sake of taking some boys down to a school, I see the prisoner at the bar come down the yard, I live only four or five doors off, and he went to the fifth chaise and took the reins out, and the whip; I see him pass the sadler's, which is near there, and it gave me a suspicion; a little while after that I said to my wife, that boy has stole this property, because if they had sent to have them mended, he certainly would have taken them to the sadler's; my wife said, we may as well have our dinner, it is one o'clock; she looks out of window and says, I dare say what you say is right,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180036"></xptr>for they are all assembled about the chaise. I went down and asked the men if they had lost such property or no? they told me they had; and I told them that I see such a person take them out of the chaise, and I went round and I see the prisoner at the bar paying very great attention to the hackney coachmen, about thirty yards from where he took the property; the hostler was with me, and I told him that was the boy that stole his property, and he went and took him up immediately to the public office, Hatton-garden, and he was committed; and that is all I know of the business.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after he had taken the property was it you see the prisoner? - To the best of my recollection it could not be more than three quarters of an hour. I am positive that is the lad.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you see me take the property, why did not you stop me?</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did these reins belong to you as a hostler? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find your own whip and reins? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of them? - I could not replace them for half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am a working lad, I sell fruit about the streets, and I know nothing what they have alledged against me.</p>

            . On the 15th of last Month, between 7 and 8 at Night, I was knocked down in a Field behind the Two Loggerheads , going to Shoreditch, by three Persons. I received a Cut upon the Left-side of my Head, so that you might see my Skull very plain, and they took from me my Shoes, a Pair of Silver Buckles, and this Pocket Book, which my Master gave me that Morning for Memorandums for planting Flowers.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say to you when they first attack'd you?</p>
               <p>Gray. They knock'd me down before they spoke, and then I believe they said, D - him, keep him down.</p>
               <p>Lacock. Ask him how he came by his Pocket-Book again?</p>
               <p>Gray. It was produc'd before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Lacock. It is very hard to swear to such a Book with no Writing in it.</p>

            . On the 15th of Nov. the two Prisoners and I were at Mr. Freeman's, a Publick House in Bishopsgate street, and saw Mr. Gray come in, and he being pretty much in Liquor, we pretended to see him Home. We went as far as the upper End of Brick Lane into Swan-Fields , and I had hold of his Arm when Lacock knock'd him down with a Mopstick, and we both tumbled into the Ditch together. Then they took his Shoes and Buckles, and this Pocket-Book. I have known Shuffle about 12 Months; he is a Velvet-weaver by Trade. Lacock I have known ever since Mackarel Season; he used to sell Things about the Streets, and we had been drinking together, and had no Design to do any Thing before Gray came into the House, and then we took Notice of his Silver Buckles, and agreed to take them.</p>

             . On Wednesday Night last, I was in Company with a Man , and the Prisoner Lacock came and said he had committed some Robberies, and was desirons to leave off this Course of Life, and he made an Evidence , and if we would come next Morning to his Lodging, we should find the other Prisoner and Standley. Accordingly we went and broke the Door open, and found Lacock in one Room, and Standley and Shuffle in the other. He (Lacock) own'd to me, that he himself knock'd the Man down with a Mopstick , and that the Buckles were sold for 4 s. 6 d and the Shoes for 1 s. We carried them before Mr. Deveil , who perceiving that Lacock was the very Person that knock'd Gray down, he refused his Information, and admitted Standley an Evidence. This Pocket-Book I fetch'd from Standley's Wife, according to his Direction; she was very scrupulous to let me have it, but I brought it away with me. Here is a Memorandum in it, knock'd down Sunday Night, and I suppose that relates to this Robbery.</p>
               <p>Standley. I wrote these Words in it myself</p>
               <p>Q. to Wornel. Did Shuffle say any Thing before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Wornel. He desired to be made an Evidence, and said he could make the greatest Discovery. All of them owned it before Mr. Deveil.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Veil. These three Men were brought before me before we knew the Person that was attack'd. They all own'd the Fact, and called him by the Name of Blake, a Gardiner at Walthamstow . I put them into the News, and the next Day the Prosecutor appear'd against them.</p>

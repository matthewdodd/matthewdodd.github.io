             left my service on Christmas day, she left me without any notice between nine and ten at night; about eleven o'clock at night I found two table spoons missing, they were on the table at dinner. There were six table spoons on the table at dinner; they were given into her charge to lay on the table for supper, and when the cloth was laid for supper, there was only four remaining, and she had absented herself. On Friday we traced her to Price's apartments in a court on Saffron hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find her there. - A. The prisoner Thompson and Price were there, they said Kearn had been there a few minutes before. When I came in I said it was of consequence to them to find her, otherwise they would be implicated, for that she had robbed me, I did not say of what. The prisoner Thompson then said she would find her, she could find her in a few minutes (I had Mr. Dobson with me at the time); I told her I would stay till she returned, she said she would be back in a few minutes; the prisoner Price sat in the room but said nothing. This happened at twenty minutes past twelve. I waited in Price's room with Mr. Dobson, till about a quarter past one, I then went home, I left Mr. Dobson in the room. I returned about half past two, and continued there till near five; I at last supposed Thompson had gone to tell the girl to keep out of the way. I told Price they were doing wrong, for I was determined to find her. I then said she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140065"></xptr> had robbed me of two table spoons; Mrs. Price said if she had she was then in the house. If it had been for a trifle she would have concealed her, but she would not for so much as that; with that the girl came out, she had concealed herself behind the fire place in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Kearn came out. - A. Yes. An officer was fetched, he searched her, and found nothing upon her. I saw my spoons on the Saturday before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>MR. DOBSON. Q. Did you go with Mrs. Millington to the lodgings of Price. - A. I did, the prisoners Thompson and Price were in the room, I went away; on Mrs. Millington's return, and on my returning again, I found

On the 26th of December, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to Price's lodgings to apprehend Kearn, I searched her and found nothing on her; I searched Price, and in her apartment I found nothing there. The next morning she confessed to me, and in consequence of what Kearn told me, I found Thompson, she told me she had them of Kearn to pawn for Kearn. The spoons were produced at the office before Kearn; and Mrs. Millington swore to them there.</p>

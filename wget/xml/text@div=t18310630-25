On the 29th of June, about four o'clock, the prisoner and another person came into the shop; neither of them spoke English - they appeared foreigners; they pointed to some rings in the window; I showed them some rings - they purchased one at 1l. 12s.; the prisoner's companion bought it, and paid for it - I had occasion to stoop down to get a paper box, to put the ring in, and some cotton, and as I stooped I heard the rings in the tray being pulled about - the tray of rings was at that time on the counter before them; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300037"></xptr>heard a rattling, as if they were looking at the rings again- they went out of the shop, and I then missed two rings; they were two particular ones which I could miss in a moment - they had looked at a great many rings, and given me more trouble than usual; I sent Davies in pursuit, and the prisoner was taken immediately; on directing my attention to the tray more particularly, I missed seven gold rings altogether, which were safe before in the tray I had shown them - I am sure both the persons were foreigners; the six rings which are found are worth 18l. - we have lost one entirely; the seven are worth 20l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner (through an interpreter). Q. Was I present when you stooped down to get the box? A. Yes, when I stooped for the box he came to the counter.</p>
               <p>EDWARD DAVIES. I am in the prosecutor's employ. -Mr. Rowlands sent me in pursuit of the men, and in Leicester-square I saw the prisoner and his companion trying the rings on their fingers - I saw about half a dozen in their hands; they saw me, and walked off the pavement to the railing of the garden in the middle of the square; I then saw the other man give the rest of the rings to the prisoner - they walked a little way, and then separated; I gave an alarm of Stop thief! one went one way, and the prisoner ran another - I gave an alarm; he ran into Mr. Gregory's, a baker's, in Panton-street, and was taken - the rings were found under the sofa, where he ran.</p>

               <p>MARTIN DYER. I took the prisoner into custody. I went to Gregory, who gave me six rings, which I have had ever since - I was at the office when the prisoner was examined - he did not speak English there.</p>

            . These are my father's rings; I never sold them to the prisoner or his companion.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (through an interpreter.) I got acquainted with the other man on coming over to this country, as I could not speak English; he took me to an hotel, and a few days after he asked me to go with him to buy a ring or two for his wife - I went, and this happened; I do not know any thing about their being stolen, but when I came out the other gave me the rings into my hands; I took them, and he ran away, hearing a cry of Stop thief! I thought something was wrong, and ran away too - I went into the house, and put the rings down, as I saw my companion was not honest - I recommend myself to the mercy of the Court.</p>

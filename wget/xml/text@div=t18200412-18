On the 14th of March, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, (a window had been broken about an hour before by accident - the panes of glass are large), I heard a noise in the window, which drew my attention; that part which was broken was concealed from my sight by a shawl hanging before it. I saw a man rise from under the window, and pass the door; I immediately went out a few paces from the house, and saw a man in the act of covering something over; I followed him a few yards. He then passed another man, I asked that man to pursue him, which he did; he went a very quick pace till he had covered the bundle, and then ran. I followed him into Tavistock-street, and saw him throw an apron down with something in it, in a court which leads to Covent-garden; he threw it down in the street, and turned into the court. A person gave me a piece of bombasin. I afterwards saw the prisoner secured; he is the same stature as the man, but I did not see his face. The pane was broken large enough for the property to be taken out.</p>

            . On the morning of the 14th of March I was going up Southampton-street about ten yards from the shop - the prisoner passed me; he was then wrapping up a piece of bombasin in an old blue apron, which I at first thought was a bag - he appeared very much confused - I took particular notice of him. When he had wrapped the bombasin up he began to run. The prosecutrix came up to me, and I pursued him up Tavistock-street; he threw the bombasin away at the corner of Tavistock-court, I picked it up and gave it to her, and in about a minute the officer stopped him. Neither the bombasin or the prisoner were ever out of my sight.</p>

He was spreading some Butter upon a Roll, and when he had spread one Piece he laid it on the Stall, and begun to spread the other Piece: while he was doing it, the Deceas'd came and took up the Piece that was butter'd, and said, Won't you give me this? And then put it to his Mouth in jest, as if he design'd to eat it, tho' he did not bite a bit of it; but the Prisoner having a Knife in his Hand, struck at the Deceas'd with it. The Deceas'd retreated and fell into a Tub of Blood that stood behind him, and getting out again, he struck the Prisoner, and presently after said, I am a dead Man. Dead, says I, how can that be, I see no Blood? But when I turn'd up his Shirt, I saw his Guts hang out. I carry'd him to Mr. Didier the Surgeon, who sew'd up the Wound, and then he was sent to the Work-House, where he dy'd next Morning.</p>
               <p>- Parker. The Deceas'd took a Piece of the Prisoner's Bread and Butter, and going a little back with it, fell over a Blood-Tub, but got up again, and struck the Prisoner several Blows, and then he said he was dead, and so he went out of the Market. I did not see the Prisoner stab him, for I was over the Way.</p>
               <p>- Boswell. I saw the Prisoner spread half a Roll, and lay it on the Bulk. The Deceas'd took it away, the Prisoner struck at him. He fell over a Tub, got up again, and hit the Prisoner 3 or 4 Blows, and then clapping his Hand to his Belly, said, he was cut. Then get a Surgeon, says I. He went out of the Market, and I saw the Knife in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173212060004"></xptr> the Prisoner's Hand. It was a little dirty at the Point, but it smelt of nothing.</p>

            . I am Nurse at St. James's Work-house. The Deceas'd was brought in near the Evening; I put him to Bed, and ask'd how he came by that Misfortune? He said, by playing the Rogue with a Man about a Piece of Bread and Butter. That he fell back, and coming forward again, the Prisoner stab'd him in the Belly. He died about 8 in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had half spread my Roll, and laid it down: The Deceas'd snatch'd it away; I went to save it, and said, pray let's have it, for I am very hungry. No you sha'n't, says he, and then he punch'd and push'd me about, and some how in struggling, while my Knife was in my Hand, he run against it, and then beat me about. So and please your Worship, Master, if so be he had given me my Bread and Butter there had been no Harm done.</p>
               <p>Will. Percival, again. I was in the Shop when it begun. The Deceas'd was near the Prisoner while he was spreading the Butter, and the Prisoner run his Knife at him. There was no struggling till then, nor any Words. The Deceas'd laid no Hands on him before the Stab was given.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not the Prisoner endeavour to save his Bread and Butter?</p>
               <p>Percival. No, for the Deceased came behind him and took it away.</p>
               <p>A Butcher. I have known the Prisoner several Years. He is a poor foolish Fellow, and all the Boys in the Market used to make Game of him, and play Tricks with him; I have seen 'em black his Face, and carry him about in a Basket, and then throw him out into a Kennel to wash him; but I never saw him provoked or fall in a Passion at such Usage; so far from it, that when he has got from them he would run into a Corner and laugh at them. He had always a very honest Character, and has often been trusted by me and several others in the Market. I never observ'd any thing like a spiteful revengful Temper in him, let what wou'd be done to him. The Deceased was as vile a Lad as any about the Market; he was so idle, that he sold his Knot and Basket because he would not work, and used to loiter about and sleep upon Bulks.</p>
               <p>Several other Butchers belonging to the Market gave the like Account of the Prisoner. The Jury <rs id="t17321206-5-verdict24" type="verdictDescription">

On Christmas-day I found nineteen shillings and sixpences in the prisoner's pocket; he was then in my employ - I did not see him take it, but he owned it was mine; it was near one o'clock in the day, and the shop was shut all but one door; the man went to shut that door - the prisoner followed him; I heard something drop - I said."What is that?" - the prisoner said, "It must be a nail:" I was not satisfied, took a candle, and found a shilling in the passage, through which the prisoner had just passed - I said, "Turrell, my man, have you dropped any thing;" he said No - I said to the prisoner, "Robert, here is a shilling;" he said,"If it is, it must be mine, as I had 13 1/2d. in my pocket, which I have had all the week" - I took the prisoner into the parlour, and said, "If you have any more, show me what you have;" he turned out some of his pockets, but I only found 1 1/2d. -I searched him and found 19s. 6d. on him in different pockets; I gave charge of him to the officer, came back, and found 3s. more in his bed place - when I found the money, I said to the prisoner, "What have you been doing?" he said, "That is your money, and I have taken it" -I did not ask where he took it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you married? A. Yes; there are some stables behind my house -I do not know of any one going into those stables; I do not know of any females going there; upon my oath they never did - I have never given him money when any female went into the stable; females have gone into my parlour after my wife has gone to bed, but that has nothing to do with this.</p>

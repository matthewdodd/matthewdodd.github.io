The prisoner was employed to varnish some furniture at my house on the 6th of June, 1825; I left the house about eight or nine o'clock in the morning of that day - I had four 10l. notes in a small book,(not a pocket-book) which I left on the mantel-piece of the second floor front room, tied round with a piece of tape,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310005"></xptr>with other memorandums; I missed the notes on the following morning. I had put the book on the mantel-piece on Sunday evening, the 5th of June; I saw the book on Monday morning, but did not open it; my family were out of town. I saw my notes at Hatton-garden about a month ago; I had received them from Messrs. Hankeys, my bankers, on the 4th of June, but did not take the numbers of them myself. The prisoner had not finished his work; he was painting - it was his duty to return on the 7th of June, to finish the job, and take away his tools, but he never came for them. My servant is here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you any other servant in your house that day? A. No. My family were at Highgate; my wife was at home on the morning of the 6th, and went out with me; I had occasion to leave town - I was out all day, and returned in the evening. The prisoner had not finished varnishing some furniture as I was informed - he had been working for me under Mr. Shaw's orders, some days before. I am not accustomed to leave my property about; the house had been painted throughout, and every thing of value was locked up. To the best of my knowledge there was no one in the house that day but him and the servant.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You left the book on the mantelpiece on the Sunday evening? A. Yes. The prisoner left a paint-pot and some small brushes behind him; he had been employed by Mr. Shaw to paint, but not to polish the furniture.</p>

            . On the 6th of June, 1825, I was in Mr. Butcher's service; I saw the prisoner at work there on the 6th of June - Mrs. Butcher left about ten o'clock; nobody but the prisoner and I were in the house all day; I saw him leave the house about six o'clock in the evening; he said he had not finished his work, and would come again in the morning to finish - he left the tools behind him, and never came for them, or to finish.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What tools were they? A. Some small brushes, a paint-pot, and a knife; I cannot say whether they were his or Mr. Shaw's. I am positive nobody else was at the house - no tradesman called; there was no carpenter or any other workman there; I did not go out further than into the garden all day - I might be there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I will swear the front door was shut all day; I will not swear there was no knock at the door, but am positive there was nobody in the house. The prisoner went out to dinner, and came back at two o'clock - nobody came while he was at dinner, to the best of my belief, but it is so long ago I cannot recollect; I was asked about the notes; but never suspected myself; I was not searched, nor were my boxes; I was asked if I had been with the man in the different rooms - I had been up and down, backwards and forwards. I had been in the kitchen with him; there is no bed in the kitchen - there was nothing happened between us on any bed that day. I was not examined before the Magistrate. I was the only person who had the care of the house.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you asked to go before the Magistrate? A. Yes, but I was not subpoenaed, and my master and mistress I lived with would not let me go; I had lived with the prosecutor three months. I am sure the prisoner said he would return next morning to his work; he had left the scrutire unfinished - he said he had not finished it, and would come in the morning to do it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What enables you to recollect having four 10l. notes? A. Their being stolen soon after made me recollect it. I heard of the robbery on the Tuesday following; I will not swear this is the cheque, but it was for 50l.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Tremain, a hatter, of King-street, Holborn. I know the prisoner, and remember his coming to our shop on the evening of the 6th of June, 1825, between seven and eight o'clock - he purchased a hat for 24s., and gave me this 10l. note, No. 5278; I knew him before this occurred, and cannot be mistaken in him - he mentioned his name to me in the shop - he waited in the shop while I went to Mr. Young, a baker, in Holborn, to get change; I wrote Mr. Tremain's name on the note, in Young's shop - I never wrote my master's name before on a 10l. note - this is the note, and has my writing on it. The prisoner came again in about two hours afterwards, and ordered a drab hat of my master, and paid 4s. in part of it - he was to call for it on the Saturday, and pay the difference - it was to be 24s.; he never called for it. He called again on the 21st of July, 1826, and had a black hat - he deducted the 4s. which he-had paid the year before out of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Mr. Young here? A. No. I recollect the date - he appeared to have been drinking, and said master could never make him a hat big enough - master said he had not got a block big enough. I recollect it was the 6th of June, because I have the book here in which master made an entry when he came home, and I told him of it- I never changed a note for the prisoner before, and never saw my master change one, to my recollection; I never changed so large a note as a 10l. at Young's before; Young wished me to go back for my master to put his name on it. but he not being at home I wrote it myself.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When your master came home you told him what had happened? A. Yes, and he entered it in the book with the date, and when the prisoner returned I saw my master enter the white hat down - here is the entry: I had seen him frequently at the shop before, but only once since - that was in 1826. I am certain he is the man.</p>

             Was the prisoner in your employ. - A, No, I was in her employ; the prisoner took in linen to make up for warehouses.</p>
               <p>Q. And she employed you. - A. Yes, about a week before Christmas, Miss Stears was taken ill; the prisoner and Miss Stears were in partnership. Miss Stears asked me to come and take care of her lodgings, she was going in the country for a week; in consequence of my being there to take care of the lodging; I had some clothes there; and Jenkins locked them up in a box of hers. I asked her several times to let me have the clothes out of the box, and she always said that she forgot to bring the key of the box from Miss Stears. Friday after Christmas day Jenkins came in the morning; she asked me to take a letter to her brother; the while I was gone she went away with my clothes in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that. - A. Because she went away; on my return I missed the prisoner and the box containing my clothes, I saw no more of her till I saw her at Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that afterwards. - A. I think it might be about five weeks afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any of your property since. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Jenkins going away - A. Yes, on the 26th of December she took the box that contained the clothes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of her clothes, she lent a red net tippet to Miss Stears; I left all the property belonging to the prosecutrix at the lodgings, I should not have left the house till she returned from my brother, but the landlady because I would not quit the lodgings knocked me down stairs.</p>
               <p>MILL. There was not an article left in the lodging but a piece of printed cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you knock her down. - A. No, I insisted upon her quitting my apartment, she bid me defiance, and said she would not quit.</p>

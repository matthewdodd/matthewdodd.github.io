                  </hi>. I live at 11, Wood street, Cromer-street, St. Pancras—I have been living there with the prisoner—on Friday evening, 31st Dec., a little after 7 o'clock, we had a few words about some money that I wanted of her to pay the rent with—she had been out drinking and spending it, and I took her cloak and went and pledged it—I can't exactly say what passed, I know it came to a quarrel—she said I had better go and get the cloak back—I said I should not—I saw her with a penknife in her hand, and I said, "If you attempt to lift such a weapon as that to me I will break your arm with the poker," and I took up the poker—I held it up to her and shook it—I afterwards sat down, it might be for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—my brother and two more young men were in the room, my brother's wife, another young woman, and the prisoner—one of the young women was drunk, and I told her if she did not go out of the room I would put her out—I went to the room-door to put her out, and the prisoner struck me with the knife in the ear—I can not say whether she struck me more than once—I was touched in the breast—I don't know how that got done, or how my rib got broken—I expect that was with the fall—my ear bled, I was taken to the hospital, and feinted—the doctor treated me—I am a costermonger by trade—I have been living with the prisoner about five weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the house surgeons at the Free Hospital, Gray's Inn Road—on the night of the 31st December, the prose<lb></lb>cutor was brought in with a wound in the ear—it extended along the base of the right ear, dividing the lobe—it was about two inches and a half long—he had also a small flesh wound in the right breast, and a fractured rib on the same side—the wound in the ear might have been inflicted with this knife—he lost a considerable quantity of blood—he has perfectly recovered now—I should say he was the worse for liquor when he came in—it was between 8 and 9 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I asked Adam Turner to give me my cape that he took away, or the ticket, if he had pledged it; he said, if I asked him any more he would split my b—head with the b—poker; he then took up the poker to strike me, and his brother told him to put it down, which he did; then he came and struck me, and I fell down. I got up; he then was going to strike me again, and I lifted my hand (which had my penknife in, that I was cutting my nails with) to ward off the blow, and I cut him accidentally. I took away his jacket, and left it with Mrs. Weekly, not for the purpose of making away with it, but thinking he would give me my cape. That is all I can say, and leave my case in the hands of justice, who I hope will deal mercifully with me. (Signed) X <hi rend="smallCaps">AMELIA FRANKLIN</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Her mark.</hi> P.S. I am not the only one that Adam Turner has been the means of bringing to Newgate, and I am very sorry I ever lived with him.</p>

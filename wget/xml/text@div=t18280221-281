I take in washing - the prisoner lodged with us, with a man who took the room. I missed this property on the 14th of February, between ten and eleven o'clock; there was nobody in the house but her - my husband told them to leave next day, and they did so - I have not found my things; I was in my kitchen very ill, and saw the prisoner go out with something brown in her apron, between ten and eleven o'clock; I thought it was like my husband's coat - I found that the key of her room opened my parlour - nobody else was in the house but an independant old gentleman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. She left because you gave her warning? A. Yes. I missed the coat at seven o'clock in the evening - I did not suspect it was gone, as I had the key - it was half under her apron; my daughter was in the kitchen with me, and said it looked like her father's coat - my husband missed it at one o'clock, but said nothing to me about it - I cannot say how many people came to the house that day - I told the prisoner of it at night; she said she had not been out all day.</p>

            . I am ten years old. I saw the prisoner go out on Thursday with a bundle under her apron - I saw something like my father's coat - our parlour door is kept locked, and the street door is kept shut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? A. In the kitchen with my mother; I did not tell her of it, for she saw it herself. My father came home between two and three o'clock - he went to lay down, and the cotton and coat were missed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you then say you thought you saw her take it out? A. No.</p>

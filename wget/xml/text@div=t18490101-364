                  </hi>. I am a horse-dealer, of Pavilion-yard, Whitechapel. On 21st Nov., the prisoner came to my yard with Henry Cook, and asked what I would take for the big brown mare in the stable—I said, "Three sovereigns"—he said, that was too much—I refused to take any less—they told me they could go and sell it for the money—I told them to be sure and be back with the mare or the money in an hour or an hour and a half, for I had got another customer that I could sell it to, that had looked at it on Saturday night—I allowed them to take it—they did not come back—I saw them the next day in Whitechapel-road, and hallooed out "You are pretty fellows; where is my mare?"—they said it was all right—I could not see an officer—I went on to Romford—I saw the prisoner about a fortnight afterwards in a public-house, and gave him in charge—I tried to get Mr. Abbott here, who bought the mare, but he would not come.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, in Sidney-street, Commercial-road. The prisoner and another came, five or six weeks ago, with a big brown mare, and offered it to my father for sale—I took it to Mr. Abbott's, and offered it to him for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I came back and found the prisoner still at my father's—I told him Mr. Abbott would not give more than 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; he told me to take it—I took it back to Mr. Abbott, and took the 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., all in half-crowns—I gave it to the prisoner.</p>

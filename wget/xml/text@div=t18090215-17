            . I am an officer of the city. On Tuesday, the 7th of this month, about half after six o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another against Mr. Boyer's shop; I saw the prisoner go into the shop, he came out and went and spoke to his companion, who was waiting at the end of Skinner street, about two or three doors off; I saw the shopman come to the door, then I heard a whistle; I ran directly and fetched Shephard the constable, I shewed him the prisoner and his companion; the prisoner was then standing at the window, the window was not open, the door was; I was on the other side at a little distance; Shephard crossed the way; in a few minutes I saw the prisoner running with a cheese under his arm, he was about two doors from Mr. Boyer's shop when I first saw him with the cheese; a cart coming by prevented me from seeing whether he went into the shop or not. Shephard ran before me and catched hold of the prisoner; the prisoner twisted about to get away from Shephard, I took hold of him; I requested Shephard to take up the cheese, the cheese was then lying on the ground.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any other cheesemonger's shop nigh there - A. No. I never lost sight of him sufficient for him to go by any other cheesemonger's shop; I took him in the shop and searched him, I found this whistle. I saw him put his hand upon a cheese before I fetched Mr. Shephard.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 7th of January did you lose a cheese from your shop - A. Yes; it was taken from near the door: in less than ten minutes before it was taken I saw it safe. I saw the prisoner come into my shop, there was another man in the shop at the same time; the prisoner went up to where some bacon was and looked at it; I turned myself round to weigh some bacon for the other man and the prisoner was gone; that gave me a suspicion that he had taken something, his not asking for any thing. I came round the counter to see whether I had lost any thing, I perceived the cheese was missing; I then met the two officers with the prisoner and the cheese in their hands; the officers asked me if that cheese was my property; I told them it was. The prisoner asked me to forgive him, he said he was told to do it, and he would never do so again.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of your cheese - A. Thirty shillings; it weighs thirty four pound and a half.</p>
               <p>- SHEPHARD. I am a constable. In consequence of information from Thrubshaw I saw the prisoner next door to Mr. Boyer's shop, passing with a cheese under his arm; I got hold of him; he dropped the cheese.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming past the gentleman's shop between the hours of six and seven, this affair happened; this gentleman took hold of me, and after I went in the house they put me in confinement; another man was brought in, and when I was taken up before the gentlemen that other man was acquitted and I was sent here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

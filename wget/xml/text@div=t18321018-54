            . I was in the prosecutor's employ. About one o'clock that day I was at the top of the workshop, looking through the window, and saw the prisoner take the bobbin of silk, and put it under his waistcoat: then he went to the end of the shop, and put his coat and hat on; I told my mistress, who called him back, and asked if he had any thing - he said No; but after that, he pulled the bobbin out, and gave it to her; he said he would come back after dinner, but he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did your mistress desire him to go away? A. No.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Tottenham-street. I bought this pistol of the prisoner about October or November in last year - I had known him as foreman to Mr. Smith; he did not say how he came by it - it is an old pistol.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you went to Mr. Smith's to purchase a pistol? A. I went and asked Mr. Smith what he would make one for, and he said 25s. or 30s. - I declined that, and the prisoner said he had one to sell; I think Smith was then gone out of the room: then the prisoner said he had something of the sort he thought would suit me; he said it was at home, and he would let me have it on the day following - there was no secrecy or concealment in his dealing with me; any one coming in might have heard it - if there had been any concealment I would not have bought it; I frequently saw Mr. Smith, and attended his family professionally - I believe he never said that he had lost a pistol till he had indicted Allely.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SMITH. I know this pistol, and swear it is mine - there is a mark on the cock, and one under the barrel; I made one of the marks - it was sometimes in the window, and sometimes in a drawer; this and some other things were missed the latter end of November; I got it from Mr. Langley in July last - he had given it to a boy in the country; I told him how I had been robbed, and he said he bought a pistol of Allely - I asked him if he would let me have it to bring down to Allely's trial, and I at last<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280024"></xptr>got it; I knew sometime before he was taken that he had sold Mr. Langley a pistol.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long before? A. Before the July Session; but I did not indict him then, because I had not the property - he had given it to a boy in the country; I made inquiry of every one about it; my young man is here to whom I mentioned it; I have repeatedly told him and others - I cannot tell when; I believe about March -I said I had been robbed of three or four pistols, and I had got two of them; I said one of them was a percussion pistol, but I did not particularly describe it - Allely left me in February, but he had sold this while he was in my service; he sold it in November - I did give him a good character on leaving me; I never said that if two or three indictments would not got the prisoners from their shop, four or five should - I never said it in my life, to, or in the presence of

            . I am a jeweller, and live in Clerkenwell. About two months or nine week ago, I saw the prisoner - he said he had left Mr. Smith, and had commenced business for himself, and he had told Mr. Smith he was going to Ireland, but he had met with a friend, and was gone into business - he said, "Mr. Smith seems very bitter against me, and says I have robbed him of a pistol, and you will do me a service to come and give me a character;" I said,"It is a very hard case for me, as I have known Mr. Smith these twenty years."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he was innocent? A. Yes; he bore an excellent character - I went and asked Mr. Smith, and he said he had given him an excellent character, but had since found out he had robbed him; he gave me the card of his shop, but I have not got it.</p>
               <p>- I am in the prosecutor's employ; he told me he had lost that pistol and another - he did not describe them in any way; he said he had got another indictment out - this was about two months ago; he did not tell me so in March last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Mr. Smith tell you he had preferred another indictment? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. I wish you to ask him whether, on the day this trial was put off, Allely, Green, and his party, did not overtake me in Holborn, collect a mob round me, and put me in bodily fear.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Upon your oath, how came you to swear that you described that pistol to him? A. I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent; I left his service, and he has been determined to get me out of my shop.</p>

            . I am a working-jeweller, and live at No. 8, White Lion-street, Pentonville. I know the prosecutor; I heard him say that he was determined to get the prisoner out of his shop, and if two or three indictments would not do, four or five should, and that such was his connexion, that to carry his point against any man, he would find as many witnesses as he could find half-crowns.</p>

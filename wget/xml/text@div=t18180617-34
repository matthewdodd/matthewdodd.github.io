On the 28th of May, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner hired a bed there, and slept there that night. Next morning I missed three sheets from two different rooms. I went to the room in which she had slept that night, and found her in another bedroom. She saw me in the passage, returned to her own room, and got into her own bed. I sent for an officer, and sent one of the maid servants up, who told her she must get up-the servant found the sheets; I waited outside the room.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Kingsford. About half-past five o'clock in the morning we missed three sheets out of the rooms No. 26 and 27, where families had slept. I went to the prisoner's room, and asked her to get up - She said she could not, because my master and the officer were there - They left. She hesitated for nearly ten minutes after, and then rose in her bed. I turned down the pillow, and found the three sheets under it, which belonged to beds in No. 26 and 27.</p>

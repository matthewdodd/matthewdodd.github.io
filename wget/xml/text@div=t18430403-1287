                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 125.) I was out with Malin on the 16th of March, near the Commercial-road. I saw the prisoner there—I had known him before—I stopped him, and told him I suspected he had some bad money about him—he said he had not—I told Malin to take him into a public-house while I went after another man who had been with him, but he escaped—when I came back Malin said he had found something in the leg of the prisoner's trowsers—the packet which he found was opened in my pre<lb></lb>sence, and contained twenty counterfeit sixpences—in going to the station the prisoner said he picked it up at the back of Whitechapel-church.</p>

I took the prisoner in a public-house, and told him I suspected he had bad money—he said he had nothing of the kind—I searched his pockets and found nothing—I then unbuttoned his trowsers' flap, felt down his leg, and found this packet at the top of his stocking, just inside the knee—there were twenty counterfeit sixpences tied up in a hard parcel.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was going to the West India Docks, and found the parcel—when the officer took me it was knocked out of my hand—I had no pockets, and no stockings on. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was a hole at the bottom of his pocket, and the packet had gone down inside the trowsers—it lodged close to the knee—the stocking would stop it, and the tightness of the trowsers—it appeared to me to be the top of a stocking if there was no foot to it.</p>

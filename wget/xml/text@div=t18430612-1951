                  </hi>. I live in Upper Grafton-street, Fitsroy-square. On the 2nd of June I had been drinking, and about a quarter to three o'clock in the morning, I sat down on a step in Green-street, Hampstead-road, to rest—I dozed off to sleep—in about ten minutes I was awoke by the prisoner draw<lb></lb>ing my scarf off my neck—I said, "Halloo, that is my scarf; where is the pin that was in it?"—she said, "I don't know"—she had my scarf in her hand—I said, "Where is my pin?"—she said, "I have not got it"—I said, "You must have taken it out before you could have taken the scarf off"—the policeman was near, and I gave her in charge—the pin was found in the area of the house where I was sitting.</p>

I saw the prosecutor standing up—in taking the prisoner to the station, I gave the other officer one hand, and I took the other—the prisoner said, "Let me pin my shawl"—I let go of her hand, and she pulled this pocket-handkerchief from her bosom—I came back, and found the pin in the area where the prosecutor had been sitting.</p>

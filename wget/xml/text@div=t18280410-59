On Friday evening, the 11th of April, about ten o'clock at night, I was walking down Ratcliff-highway; I had been drinking with a friend, and was not exactly sober, nor yet much the worse for liquor; I knew what I was about: the prisoner came up to me in Ratcliff-highway, and entered into conversation with me for a little time, and he said he thought I was a little the worse for liquor, and he should be very happy to see me home; I was going to call at Mr. Wardle's, Bell-wharf stairs - I told him so; I meant to sleep on board my ship. I was going in a direction for Wardle's when the prisoner joined me, which was below Wellclose-square - I was walking on when he proposed to see me home; I told him I knew the way very well, and there was no occasion for it - he then pressed me to go and have a glass of something - I refused, saying I had had quite enough: we got further, and he pressed me again, but I still refused, and shortly after that he left me - he had been more than five minutes with me; he joined me again in a few minutes, and said, "Now I will see you home, for I am going past where you are going;" I said, "Very well, I will take your company;" he then took me down a lane: I said, "You are going too soon off Ratcliff-highway;" he said he would take me a nearer road - we walked on; I said, "We are going a long way, and I was never this road before;" he said, "It is quite right." At that time I saw two or three more men along with us - we were along before; I then began to be afraid, and said, "All is not right, and I will go no further;" they all insisted on my going further, as it was the nearest way; more than one of them said so: we moved on a few steps more, and I stopped; they then got all round me - I was going to call out, but they took hold of me, and pulled me down on my back, and I found their hands in my pocket; I am quite sure I had a watch about me at that time; they covered my face; I felt my watch go from me, and then they ran away; I had no money about me. I called out Murder! and Stop thief! I am certain the prisoner is the man who joined me, and kept with me - I should not know the others; the watchman brought the prisoner up to me in a very short time; I said to him, "You are the rascal who has been following me all night down the highway;" I am certain he is the man: which of them took my watch I cannot say, but he was with me till they all ran away together - he was there when I was thrown down. I have not found my watch - it was silver, and worth 4l.; I gave more for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what time did this happen? A. About ten o'clock - it was dark. I met the prisoner when I was walking down the highway - I had been to the King's Head public-house, in Tower-street, before I met him - that was the last house I was in; it was rather before nine o'clock when I left there - I had been to no other public-house; I went there after I came from 'Change, which was about five o'clock; I had dined on board my ship, and drank a glass of rum and water after dinner, but nothing before dinner; I had two glasses of gin and water at the King's Head; I believe I had a glass of ale when I first went in - I forgot that. I sat a considerable time, and then had a glass of gin and water, and afterwards another glass; I am certain that is all I had: I paid 1s. or 1s. 2d. for it; I went to no other house, and drank nothing else that day. I was not drunk, nor yet so sober as if I had drank nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman first brought the prisoner to you, did you say you did not know his person or his dress? A. I never said such a word; I think I told him I had lost my watch and money, but when I came to recollect I had no money - I had some money when I left the King's Head, but lost it in the road; whether it was pulled out of my pocket or not I cannot say, but I found I had no money when the prisoner joined me; I had lost it. The watchman knows I was sober - nobody had been walking with me before the prisoner came up, but people were passing and repassing - nobody was in my company. The money was in my breeches pocket, but when I felt it was gone - I had 17s. or 18s.; I did not feel anybody take it; I missed it some few minutes before I met the prisoner, but I know I had my watch, for I felt for it, and put the ribbon in directly I missed my money; nobody had been near me except people passing; people frequently walked alongside of me, but I felt no hand in my pocket; I cannot say whe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100052"></xptr>ther it was buttoned up; I told the watchman I had lost my money and my watch - I did not say the prisoner had taken my money - they offered me the money they found on the prisoner; I said that was not mine, for I lost it before I met him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the headborough at the watch-house lock you up in the same room with the prisoner? A. He did; I do not recollect his saying he did so that I might gain my senses, and tell my story property; I thought it very strange that he should lock me up; I dare say I was locked up for an hour - I do not know why; I told him it was very strange he should lock me up - I forget what answer he made, but think it was something to the effect that I did not know what I was saying.</p>

            . I live in New Gravel-lane; my father sells things about at public-houses; I live with him, and am going on for twelve years old. (I go to church, and believe there is a God, who will punish wicked people in the next world; people who tell lies or swear false are wicked.) I was coming out of Mr. Randal's public-house, in Gravel-lane, where I had been for my mother, and heard somebody halloo out Murder! I went round the corner to see what it was, and there were four persons round Mr. Clay, who I thought to be thieves: one had hold of his legs, another had hold of his arm; they took his watch out of his pocket; they said, "We have got it all, now let us leave him;" and they ran away - two ran up Milk-yard; I have only seen one of them since. Mr. Peterson and I caught one of them in a corner; that was the prisoner - he had not got far when we caught him, about as far as from here to Newgate. I saw him running, and am sure he is one of the four men who robbed Mr. Clay; he was taken to the watch-house; the robbery was committed in New Gravel-lane, which turns out of Ratcliff-highway. After we took the prisoner, Clay came up, and said what they had done to him; he did not appear very drunk; he appeared to know what he was about. After Peterson and I caught the prisoner he(the prisoner) said, "There is another one run over there, with a white jacket on;" one of the party had a white jacket on; he said, the man in the white jacket was along with him, the man in the white jacket was in sight; the prisoner was not running after him to try to take him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you say your mother was with you? A. No. I was coming out of the Turk's Head public-house; I had been there to my mother, but she did not come out with me; she sells things there. I was very much frightened at the cry; I was afraid something might happen to myself; the prosecutor did not appear to me to be drunk - not much - he was not quite sober; he was locked up in the watch-house - I do not know why; a person belonging to the watch-house locked him up - I do not know whether he is here; I cannot say whether he locked him in the same room as the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured coat had the person on? A. He had a blue dress on; I don't think it was a coat - I am not certain it was a coat; I did not stand behind him; I observed him particularly, though I cannot be sure whether he had a coat on. I did not say at the watch-house, nor any where, that he had a blue coat on. I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long from the time you heard the cry of Murder! did the person go away from Clay? A. Not long; it was a minute or two - that was all the time I had to observe the four men. I noticed a person who had a white coat on, as well as the prisoner - the other three had white jackets on. I was looking at the other three some portion of the minute or two.</p>

            . I go to sea, and am fifteen years old. I know Bell-wharf - I live in New Gravel-lane - you can go that way from Ratcliff-highway to Bell-wharf, but it is out of the way, but not much. On the night this happened I was in doors at my mother's, and heard a man sing out,"Oh, oh! Murder, murder!" I ran out and asked him what was the matter; it was the prosecutor; he said he was knocked down, and had his watch taken - I sang out Stop thief! The last witness was coming up at the time; I just saw a glimmer of somebody running along past the lamp, not very far from the prosecutor; I ran on, and Mangham was behind me. I stopped the watchman, and then went into the opening - I did not see the man after he went past the lamp, till I went into the corner, and saw him up in the corner standing still. I said, "Here he is watchman," and he stepped out, that was the prisoner. The watchman laid hold of him; he had blue clothes on, and a watch-ribbon; he at first said there was a man in the other corner with a white jacket on; the prosecutor came up; the watchman said to him, "Can you swear to this man;" he said, "Yes, this is the man who has followed me all the way down the Highway." I then went to look in the other corner, after the man in a white jacket, but there was nobody there. I had seen nobody running in a white jacket. When the prosecutor said he could swear to the prisoner, he said, "Me! I am not guilty of such a thing." He was taken away. I did not follow to the watch-house. Veale was the watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You would not swear to the person of the man you saw pass? A. No; he was found in the corner of a field called Fox-field, which turns out of Gravel-lane: there is a ditch in the field, and he was over the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had wanted to escape, there was the ditch between him and the watchman? A. Oh! but there are some palings of an orchard at the back, as high as a man's head - he could not get away; he might get over the paling.</p>
               <p>Q. He stepped out the moment he saw you? A. Yes, because he heard the dogs bark; Mangham was with the watchman, who was a little distance from me when I saw the man - he was about as far off as I am from the back of the Jury-box; I was nearer to the prisoner - he came up to us when I spoke, and said, he was not guilty - I did not see him searched.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been a man running in a white jacket, could Mangham see it and you not? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Friday night about quarter-past ten o'clock, I heard a cry of Murder! I looked down the lane - I stood by the Black-horse public-house in Gravel-lane; I looked and saw three or four people, children and men together, running up the lane, and some going towards Fox-fields - the last witness came up and said, a man had gone that way, pointing to Fox-fields; the prosecutor came up about the same time - I walked down towards the field; I asked the prosecutor what he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100053"></xptr>had lost, he said, his watch; I said, "Have you lost anything else?" he said, "I don't know what I have lost;" I went to the corner, which is sixteen or eighteen yards out of the main-street, I found the prisoner there; it is a waste piece of ground, and leads to no place - it is no thoroughfare at all; Peterson said, "Here he is, here is the man in the corner;" I turned and saw him standing there - he came out to me; it was the prisoner - he asked what was the matter? he pointed and said, he had seen a man run towards that corner in a white dress; but I could see nobody - I put my hand on the prisoner's shoulder, and said to the prosecutor, "Can you swear to anybody?" he said, there was three or four of them. I said, "Look round, is this the man?" he said, "That is the rascal who has been dodging me all down the highway;" I took them both to the watch-house - I know Bellwharf; if the prosecutor had gone down High-street, Shadwell to it, he would have saved a quarter of a mile - Gravel-lane was a quarter of a mile out of his way; the prisoner had on a blue jacket, with a coat collar and blue trousers; as soon as I took them into the watch-house, I left, having delivered them up to Ames - the prosecutor was the worse for liquor, but appeared as if he knew what he was talking about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He appeared to know what he was talking about? A. Yes, he talked rational, but I thought he had had rather too much; I had seen the party go off the main road, but cannot swear the prisoner was one of them - when the boy said, "Here he is," he came out directly; the place is not a thoroughfare - a man might retire there for a certain purpose; he stood quietly by me; I put my hand on his shoulder; but when the prosecutor said, he was the man, I called him, and took him to the watch-house; he said, he could not be guilty of such a thing - the prosecutor said, he had lost his watch; I do not recollect his mentioning money to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the prisoner's clothes any appearance of being in disorder, as if he had retired for the purpose alluded to? A. He did not appear so.</p>

            . I am a constable; I was in the watch-house; the prisoner was brought in by the watchman - the prosecutor was also brought in, and charged the prisoner with knocking him down, and robbing him of his watch; he denied it - the prosecutor appeared flurried, and had been drinking - he spoke rational; I locked up the prisoner and left the prosecutor standing by the fire in the officer's-room, and came away myself - the officer of the night is not here; I found a watch on the prisoner, but the prosecutor does not claim that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there some money found on him? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you afterwards set in the same room with the constable? A. I was let out, and the prisoner kept in the lock-up place; I remained among the officers afterwards in a room with a fire to it - I got on board my ship by twelve o'clock I think; I left the room the officers were in not long after I left the lock-up place - I suppose I was the longest time in the lock-up place.</p>

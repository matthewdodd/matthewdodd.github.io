               <p>MATTHEW FINCH. I live in Chapman-street, Cannon-street-road. On the 26th of June I and my wife were going home, up <placeName id="t18260914-84-crimeloc513">Brick-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Were you in a situation to be certain that you are accurate in recollecting the prisoner? A. I certainly am - before I was knocked down, and when I arose I noticed him particularly - he is the man who gave me the last blow; I gave information immediately I got to the watch-house - I saw Barrs, Almond, and the beadle; I described the persons to them, and, among others, described the prisoner; I said one was a tall one, who I could swear to - I did not see him afterwards, till last Thursday, when he was at Worship-street - he was not in custody when I preferred my bill against Stevens.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. What do you suppose to be the distance between where you first saw the croud of men, and where you were robbed? A. I do not think I was ever up Brick-lane before, but I have heard it stated as three hundred yards; I looked repeatedly about me - I turned round and faced them several times - I noticed other persons besides the prisoner - I think I should be able to swear positively to one more, who was with the prisoner, and had a large stick in his hand, the same as him; I do not think I could swear positively to more than one besides the prisoner - there were six or seven of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the person stand who struck you with the stick? A. On the left hand - they kept two together, two behind me, two in the middle, and two on the opposite side - I heard a low whistle, and then they came up; I had not so good an opportunity of observing the face of the man on his knee as I had of the prisoner - I was on my back, and rose up - that man's face was partly over me, but down at my pockets - the other man, who I should know, is the one who laid down on my right side, and who walked with the prisoner behind me - the one, I suppose to be Stevens, was more in the center - the man on my left was standing - that was the prisoner; and he beat Mrs. Finch; Stevens was down on his knee; they were all young men, and most had sticks; I had sense enough to know them; I was not stunned at all.</p>

            . I was with my husband on this night - he was knocked down by some men who followed us; there were six or seven, as near as I can tell; I was knocked down at the same time, and very much cut in the head and about the arms. I have a wound in my head now, which is not quite well. I have every reason to think it took away my senses for a moment, for I cannot say who knocked me down; they followed us from Hare-street to the brewery, and I frequently saw their faces while they were following us; they went backwards and forwards about us several times; the prisoner was one - I think he came round us, and stood nearly opposite us, at the time we were standing at the corner of Hare-street, for my husband was rather alarmed then; I have more recollection of him than of any one, for I saw him striking me; he was beating me when I got up - he struck me several blows on my arm when I got up; I did not see who struck my husband. When I got up the prisoner stood at stick's length from me, and gave me two or three blows - my husband at that time was on the ground, and men holding him. I am positive the prisoner is the man who beat me - I have no doubt whatever of him; I am sure he was one of the party. I looked round at them while they were following us, and have no hesitation in saying so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you almost positive he is the man who struck you? A. I am quite positive; I had a better opportunity of seeing him than any other; I had hold of my husband's arm till he was knocked down. I let go of his arm when they came up, for several took him by the shoulders - he was knocked down before me; I cannot say who knocked him down.</p>

            . I am a conductor of the Bow-street patrol. I received information that Boyce was wanted - I and Dickinson apprehended him in Brick-lane, Bethnal-green, last Wednesday week, about a quarter past nine o'clock at night; the prosecutor saw him next day. Truman's brew-house is in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. When did you receive the information? A. On the 13th, the day I took him; I did not know he was wanted before that day, not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140069"></xptr>for the robbery I took him for - I had met him an hour before I received the information. I know his mother's, but do not know whether he lived with her at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had no dispute with him? A. Some time ago I had.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was with Gooding on the 13th, when he apprehended the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - a previous arraignment, I trust, will not operate against me on this occasion, so far as to induce even a suspicion that I am in the most remote degree guilty in this case, than in the former; however, I feel that anxiety which every unfortunate individual, awfully situated as I am, ought to feel - that is, to exculpate myself, and procure a vindication of my character from a public tribunal of my country, to set at rest the public charge brought against me, placing me in the utmost jeopardy of my life, and at the same time involving my unhappy family in one continued state of disgrace. At the time specified in the indictment I was at the Ship, public-house, in Brick-lane, Spital-fields, and had been there, without removing, the whole of the evening, till the time of my departure to go home, which I did, and immediately went to bed at my mother's house, where I lodge, and whose residence is only the second door from the Ship; and from that period till last Wednesday, although I have been as regularly engaged at following my occupation as a silk weaver, and as easy of access at home, I never heard that even my name was in question, being perfectly conscious that I had not committed any offence against the laws of my country; it will, therefore, be readily conceived how I felt when a second charge of so serious a description was advanced against me, when before the Magistrate, with no other foundation than supposition, originating from the idea of the officer, that I had been one of the party - whereas, I was totally unacquainted that ever an offence of such a description had been committed, until it was thus laid to my charge; therefore, I rely, with full confidence, on that dispassionate view of my case, which it requires in my present situation, and justice demands; thus I submit myself to whatever decision the sacred tribunal before whom I now stand may come to.</p>

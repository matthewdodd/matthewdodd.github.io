               <p>Q. Do you mean the linen wrapper? - A. Yes. And he had made them fast; I had also three pieces to take; I know he had his fast, it contained twenty-eight yards of printed calico; I saw him carry them out of the house, and in about a quarter of an hour after I saw him in Smithfiels, he had his last delivery, he had delivered one; I followed him to Stock and Cooper's, upon Holborn-hill, he came out there, and I took him with another piece upon him he had no bill with; I stopped him in Baldwin's place; it was wrapped in a wrapper; I asked him, what he had got there, and the reply that he made me was, that he was done; I told him, if he would go back with me quietly, I would not call any other assistance; he went with me to the Old-jewry, and there we went in and had a pint of beer, and I sent the waiter for our foreman, and if he was not at home, to tell Mr. Curzons to come; I related the business to him and he proceeded to the warehouse with him and the property as I found it upon him, and it was delivered to the constable. When I was going out with my parcels, I suspected him, because as I went out past the warehouse window, I saw his wrapper undone again, and his head go from one of the piles in the warehouse; and I went back with my goods, and followed him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. He had two deliveries, and you say you found three upon him? - A. Yes; two, and the one that he had no account of.</p>
               <p>Q. And the reason why you say he had no account of it, was, that he did not produce a bill of it to you? - A. No, he told me first, he was done, and then he said, he was going to

             sworn. - I am a constable; I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner and this piece of calico, (produces it); it was delivered to me by Mr. Joseph Peele, on the 30th of March, about three in the afternoon; I have had it ever since. I heard him say to Mr. Peele, afterwards, that he was going to carry it to Mr. Goulding's, in Portpool-lane, or to some pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Peele say any thing to induce him to say that, did he use any threat, or make him any promise? - A. Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peele. This piece of calico is my property, it has our mark upon it, "Peele, Yates, and Co."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see if any was missing? - A. It was impossible for me to miss it.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot undertake to say, of your own knowledge, whether that was one of the pieces that was to be delivered to you customers? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you a piece of the pattern in your house? - A. I cannot say; we had a great many of this pattern in the course of the last year.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had two deliveries of goods; when I came to deliver them, I found I had got one more by mistake, and I intended to carry it back again.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Sorrell.) Q. Can you undertake to swear to the wrapper? - A. I believe it was the same wrapper, but there is no mark upon it, I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

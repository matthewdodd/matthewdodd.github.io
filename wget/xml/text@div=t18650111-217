                  </hi> (through an interpreter). I am a carpenter on board the Russian ship Alert—on 24th December she was lying in the Commercial Dock—the prisoner was an able seaman on board—about 11 or 12 at night I was on deck a little tipsy—the mate came on deck, and said, "The watch must be kept, though it is Christmas Eve"—the prisoner came over another vessel from shore at that moment—I don't think he heard what the mate said—the prisoner was very tipsy—he did not say anything, he only made a noise—I could not see anything in his hand—I did not feel anything before I felt blood running from my forehead into my mouth, and I staggered backwards—he must have had something in his hand—Overarch did something to me; the mate did not see it—I was taken to the hospital next day—I go there every day now—I did not notice any knife at all.</p>

At half-past 8 on Sunday morning, 25th December, I was called on board the Alert, and received charge of the prisoner for stabbing the prosecutor, who was lying in his berth with a cut on his face—it had been bandaged up—I could not understand what the prisoner said—I took him to the station—he was then sober—I found no knife on him.</p>

I am assistant to James Joseph Greene, of Plough-row, Rotherhithe—the injured man was brought to our surgery about midnight on 24th December—I found an extensive incised wound extending from the upper part of the forehead, escaping the left eye down to the chin—it had pierced the forehead to the bone, and the cheek also—the fleshy part of the cheek was not entirely cut through—it was such a wound as a knife could have inflicted—he was in a state of exhaustion from loss of blood when I first saw him—although there were no vessels wounded, it was a very extensive cut—there had been a great deal of hæmorrhage—he is now under treatment at the <hi rend="italic">Dreadnought</hi> hospital-ship—the wound is healing now.</p>

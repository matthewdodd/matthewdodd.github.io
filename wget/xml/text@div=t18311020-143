            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 20th of October, in consequence of information, I went with Vann to the prosecutor's premises, about seven o'clock in the morning - I saw Grubb in a cart; he drove it down Crabtree-walk, from Cambridge-heath way; Grubb stopped the cart, got out, took these six staves now produced, on his shoulder, carried them down a passage, through a garden, and from there to Stocks' house, but he did not go into the house - I went up to him, and said, "What have you got there?" he said some wood which he had brought to Stocks', and at the same time he pitched it, and said, "Mrs. Stocks, I have brought some wood for you;" when I had handcuffed him, he said he was all right, that the wood was bought by Stocks, and he had brought it there - these are the stares.</p>
               <p>Grubb's Defence. He asked me how I came by the staves, and I said that Stocks bought them of master; I used to have staves from the docks, and they sometimes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200058"></xptr>gave me more than my tally, and I put them in the bayloft - Stocks was going to make a bedstead, and he said I might take them there any time I liked.</p>

Just as the chaise got up to the brink of the Bar the other men got up likewise to the chaise, and one of the other two, and the prisoner at the bar, took hold of it and lifted it from behind the chaise, and I immediately ran up to the prisoner, and he and the other man had the trunk in their possession when I took hold of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure when you took hold of them, the prisoner had hold of the trunk? - Positively, I struck the prisoner with a stick, that I had in my hand, and then took hold of him, and he let go and dropped the trunk; taking hold of him he plunged away from me, and I pursued him immediately, and in the high road, opposite Bell-yard, I struck him again with the stick I had in my hand; he still continued running till he came to the end of Apollo-court, where I overtook him again, and knocked him down; I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150019"></xptr>lost sight of him; I never was five yards from him; I took hold of him, and Mr. Greaves came to my assistance, and we took him to the watchhouse of St. Dunstan's; I then went to the bar, and when I came to the bar, a coachman said, here my friend, here is the trunk; he was sitting on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make observation enough of the trunk to know that was the trunk? - I cannot positively say that it was the same I saw behind the chaise; I said to the coachman, I am much obliged to you, and I took hold of it and carried it to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q Should you know it again, was it in court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What sort of a night was it? - A bright star light night, rather remarkable light than otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen the prisoner before? - Yes, I had seen the prisoner before many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Apollo-court? - It is between Temple-bar and Chancery-lane, it turns up by Salkeild, the pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The witness Bird has been in the Bail-dock with me, and he said he knew and would not hurt me.</p>

               <p>I am a glazier; I was in company with Mr. Bird, on Saturday the 20th of October; I was in Fleet-street about seven o'clock in the evening; I saw two men in company with the prisoner come up Fleet-street; I saw a chaise a little way before me, the horse was on a trot, and these people seemed running after the chaise, as I judged; I and Mr. Bird followed them, and when they came within an hundred or an hundred and fifty yards of the bar, the chaise had come to a walk, because it could not go on so fast for the carriages; I then saw two men turn out into the street, out of the path way into the road way; there was an hackney coach standing close by the pavement; I went behind the hackney coach, and the prisoner in company with the others had got the trunk off the chaise; I directly pursued them; one ran through the bar, and two ran back into Fleet-street; the prisoner was one; I pursued the other and he got away; I saw which way the prisoner took, and when I came up, I supposed he had been knocked down, for he was then sitting on the ground, close by Apollo court, on the path way; there was a scuffle ensued about getting him away; they tried to get him away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loose sight of him after that? - Never afterwards till we got him to the watchhouse; the next day we took him before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the trunk? - I saw the trunk standing on the pavement, and a coachman was sitting on it, at Mr. Child's the banker's door; I brought the trunk to the watchhouse; I have kept it ever since Monday, when it was taken before the Lord Mayor, where it was sealed in order to be advertised.</p>

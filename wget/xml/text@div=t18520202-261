                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, R</hi> 38). On 21st Oct., 1850, about half-past 7 o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in plain clothes at Charlton Fair, and saw the prisoner and a man named Hall go into a booth and sit down—the other man took off his gloves—they then came out of the booth and joined a third man named Brindle—I went up the fair after them, and saw Brindle place himself in front of a lady, Hall by her side, and the prisoner behind her, at the side of Hall a little behind him, all close together—I went down on one knee to see what they were doing, and I saw Hall's hand come out of the lady's pocket—they then left and went further up the fair, and when they had got a little further up they placed themselves by another lady in the same position as before—I then saw the prisoner look down between the lady and Hall, apparently to see where Hall's hand was—I kneeled down again, and saw H all's hand come out of that lady's pocket, and they left hurriedly—the lady turned round and gave roe a <hi rend="italic">smack</hi> on my face as I was getting up from my knee, and said, "What are you doing at my pocket?"—I had been close be<lb></lb>hind the prisoners about a yard from the lady—I was alone, but had called the attention of gentlemen to it whom I knew by sight—I then followed them, to the top of the fair, where they placed themselves in the same position again by the side of another lady—they left her in a hurried manner, and went to another part of the fair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you take them into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew one of them to be a thief, and knew they had not committed a felony, as I had asked the ladies whether they bad lost anything, and they said, "No"—we are sent to detect them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. It cannot be the duty of an officer to see several pockets tried, and not take the parties into custody; you ought to take them at the first attempt. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I could not have taken the three.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PLATT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you procure assistance and go after then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202020078"></xptr>
               <p>they were taken into custody, and I charged them with stealing three half-crowns from the person of Mrs. Mason—she was the last female I saw them near—they were by her side about half a moment, but I could not see what they were doing—they left hurriedly, and I asked the lady if she had lost anything—when charged at the station the prisoner said, "I know nothing about it; I have not got a half-crown about me."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon did you get any one to assist you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In five or ten minutes—I got Ovencien first and Walker afterwards—I searched the prisoner and found on him a sovereign, a sixpence, a farthing, and a duplicate, but no half-crown.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Did you say that before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see them picking pockets—I saw them go down the fair and come to a woman; they may have been attempting to pick the woman's pocket, because the moment they went away, I saw the sergeant go and ask her if she had lost anything—that is the best way I can explain it.</p>

The prisoner was employed by him on Saturday, the 11th of June, to serve behind the counter - he has been employed to assist on a busy day for about two months back; I saw him take some silver from a customer - he went to the till to put his change in, and put half a crown into his pocket; he had no change to give the customer - I asked him to walk with me into the warehouse; I there accused him of taking the half-crown: he said he was very sorry for what he had done, that it was owing to the great distress he was in, and he hoped I would not tell Mr. Felix - I said I had suspected him all the evening; he then gave up 1l. 9s. 6d. which he laid on a hogshead - he said he had taken it from the till, and be hoped I would not tell Mr. Felix; there were half-crowns, shillings, and, I believe, a 5s. piece or two - I wished him to walk into the kitchen, and told Mr. Felix to go down; next morning I sat in the same chair as he had sat in the night before, and found a paper under it with 1l. 17s. in it.</p>

            . I live in Tottenham-court-road. I received information and went into the kitchen on the 11th of June - I found the prisoner there: I heard he had given up the 1l. 9s. 6d., and I charged him with having more money - I made no threat or promise, but said, "You may as well give it up to me now as when you are searched;" he then gave me up 1l. 3s. 6d. in silver - I think there were crowns, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences; he confessed he had taken them from my till, and said he hoped I would forgive him, as I had taken him from charity - he was in a great distress, having been long out of a situation.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was called into Mr. Felix's shop on the 11th of June; I received 2l. 13s. in half-crowns and other silver - I took the prisoner, and before we went to the Magistrate he said he had laid some silver on the floor where he sat when I took the charge, and he hoped Mr. Felix would not prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell me that 16s. had been found under a chair in the kitchen? A. I did not - I did not ask you any question,</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell him any precise sum? A.No, my Lord, no sum was mentioned; he only said it was silver - this is my name (looking at his deposition) - it is here stated that I said he told me he put 16s. in a paper, but I did not.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, denying that he had acknowledged putting the paper of silver under the chair.</p>
               <p>MR. FELIX. He had been my occasional servant for a considerable time; his friends are friends of mine; I was told he had been ten years in one situation - he was not under any engagement to attend on Saturdays; he might have got work where he pleased.</p>

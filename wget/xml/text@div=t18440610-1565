                  </hi>. I am a seaman. On Thursday morning, the 6th of June, I went into the Harrow, at Poplar, called for a pint of beer, and asked two females who were there to drink—two other females came in, and the prisoner asked me to give her some beer—I said "No," and told her to go away two or three times—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> one of them away—the prisoner spat in my face, crossed the room, pulled off her cap, and began to show fight—all three began on me, and before I could get out of the door she struck me over the head with a pint or a quart pot—I bled full half a pint—I am sure it was her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Poplar. I dressed the prosecutor's head on the 6th of June—there was a cut down to the bone, about an inch and a quarter long, at the top of the head, it might be in<lb></lb>flicted by a pewter pot, but with considerable violence—the only danger was that erysipelas might follow.</p>

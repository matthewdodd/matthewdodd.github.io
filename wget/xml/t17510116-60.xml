Then Hudson and Cooke both got up, and I gave Hudson my staff; just by the dial they met with the two prisoners, one they knocked down, the other they handed down; I took care of them: they would not tell the constable who they were, or where they were going to. The next day they were brought to Guild-hall, then they formed a story, that they got up for a hat.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Hardley. Because when I took her she own'd it, and carried me to the pawnbroker's house where she had pawn'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she live in the house with you?</p>
               <p>Hardley. No, she did not; she used to come along with a ballad-singer to my house. She came one night and I let her in, and having no place to lie at I permitted her to lie at my bed's feet. I went out in the morning to get myself a pot of beer, and when I came back she and the gown were both gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last?</p>
               <p>Hardley. I had it in my hand about an hour before I went out. The people underneath where I live said they saw the prisoner go out with a bundle under her cloaths, when I was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with her again?</p>
               <p>Hardley. About Broad St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge her with taking the gown?</p>
               <p>Hardley. Yes I did, and she said she got a key, open'd my door, and took the gown out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promises before this?</p>
               <p>Hardley. I promised I would not prosecute her, if she would confess.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came it about that you do prosecute her?</p>
               <p>Hardley. Because I could not get the gown from the pawnbroker without it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say the pawnbroker lived?</p>
               <p>Hardley. She went along with me to the house, and called for it in her own name.</p>

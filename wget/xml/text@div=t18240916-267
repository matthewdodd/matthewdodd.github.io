On the 26th of August I enquired of him for some saddles and bridles; he said they were in the lumber-loft, he had put them there out of the way; I told him to go and look for them. I went up myself half an hour after, and forgetting what I had sent him for, I asked him what he did there. He said the things were not there, and he supposed they were down stairs. I came down, went out, and when I returned, I found he had gone out. He did not return. I searched the premises and missed the articles stated in the indictment; he had had them in his care. The gig harness is worth more than 40 s.; but it might have been taken separately, and the pieces would have been under that value.</p>

I got acquainted with the prisoner last May; he spoke to me about lamps, and he sent some by his little boy; I told him I would not buy of any children, and he came himself. I bought those articles of him, and hung them up in my shop, which is at No. 12, Francis-court, Wigmore-street.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the evening of the 4th, I was going through St. Giles's, in company with Woodroffe, towards a place called the Seven Dials, and I observed the two prisoners; I followed them, suspecting they were going to commit some crime. They went to Crown-street, by the prosecutor's window; they walked to and fro, beside the shop in the court. The old prisoner tried the door several times, kept trying the Jatch, and watching the window. I desired Woodroffe to go to the other end of the court, to prevent the boy from going away. The man attempted the latch several times; then he took both hands and lifted it up, and went into the shop. In about a quarter of a minute, he came out, with something under his coat; Woodroffe apprehended him, and I took the boy; we shoved them both into the shop, and searched them; under the old man's coat we found the brushes, and we handcuffed them both together.</p>

C.—he was at one time at the Western office—he called on me on the 24th November about it—besides being a letter-carrier, I am a ladies' shoemaker—I was cutting out a pair of boots, and I said, "I do not know what to do with this, "and he takes from his pocket a book and said, "What am I to do with this?" and gave me this money-order—I said, "Go and get it cashed" he said, "I do not like to, because they know me there, working there"—he said, "I will give you or any one else five shillings to go and get it—I said "If they know you they know me," because we walked together both on one walk, Piccadilly—I did not notice the name at the moment, because I was engaged—ultimately I took the order, looked at it, and said, "This is made payable in the name of Potter; your name is Manning"—the name of Potter was there then, and I saw it was made payable at the Vere-street post-office—I said, "I should not give five shillings to go and get this cashed, you have been dismissed the office, go and get it yourself; I should be proud to show the order, to show I had friends to send me this money after being dismissed"—he said, "If I get the money I will come back and treat you"—I said, "How is it that it is signed in the name of Potter?"—he said, "It is a betting transaction, and the man knows me by that name"—it often struck me there was something wrong—I had to be on duty just before 2, and I mentioned it to the inspector at the office—the prisoner was sent for next day—I was at Mr. Peacock's office "when be came in—he looked at me and said, "If you have turned informer I will do you an injury"—then the constable took me into the next room.</p>

After being questioned further as to his not finding the order till three o'clock, he said, "I have made a mistake as to time, it must have been about twelve o'clock when I found the order"—he then said that it was at the corner of Duke-street and Oxford-street that he picked it up, and that when he gave the order to the man at the public house it was not signed—he was searched—I did not find any portemonnaie or any stamps—he said he had been out that night and got drunk—he was out till four o'clock the next morning—he could not give any account of the portemonnaie.</p>

I do not know the man's name; I only knew him by sight. I never presented it and never endorsed it, and had nothing further to do with it; placed in the position in which I was many would have done as I thought of doing. I had left the Post-office six months and was in a starving condition, and my wife just on the point of being confined.</p>

I ran to the office, which is within one hundred yards of the house; the officer came with me, and on returning to the house in half an hour I found the prisoner in custody with it.</p>

On the 28th of December, at night, Mr. Hays came to my house, with his trunk, which was put in the passage, opposite to the bar, near the stairs. The prisoner had left my service three weeks or a month, she came to my house about ten minutes after Mr. Hays came in, while he was in the bar, and asked for a Christmas box; I told her I gave no money, but what she liked to eat and drink in the house she was welcome to; she said she wanted nothing, and I left her at the bar door; I do not know what had become of her. The box was missed in a quarter of an hour - she was then gone. I went to the office, and gave information, and met my warehouse-keeper as I returned, and in consequence of what he said, I looked after the prisoner, and found her in about twenty minutes at the lower part of Old Gravel-lane, about three hundred yards from my house, near Hillyer's-court - she was coming towards my house: I told her she had been robbing our house of a trunk - she said,</p>

               <p>"Good God! how could you suspect me?" I said,</p>
               <p>"I have more reasons than one for suspecting you - I have pretty good proof of it, and shall give you in charge;" the watchman was within hail. She said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake don't do that, nor make a noise in the street, and I will tell you about it:" she then led me towards Hillyer's-court, away from the watchman, and when we had got a little distance from the watchman she refused to tell me, saying she knew nothing of it: I said I would not be baffled in that way, and gave her in charge. The watchman was bringing her towards my house, and at the corner of Brewhouse-lane, within sight of my house, she called after me, and said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake take me away from this man - I want to speak to you." I asked the watchman to retire: we went up Brewhouse-lane together; she said she would shew me where the trunk was, but when we got nearly out of the watchman's sight she said she wondered how I could suspect her, what a bad thing it was for her, and she was an innocent woman. I brought her to the watchman, partly by force; they took her to my house, and then to the office. When she came to my bar the trunk was behind her, within two yards. I remained in the bar with Mr. Hays, and cannot say if any one else came in, or when she went out. I thought she was gone into the tap-room, which joins the bar; there might be twelve or fifteen people in the taproom: the trunk could not be seen from there. Hillyer's-court is three hundred yards from my house.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my stand is near the Dundee Arms, about fifty yards from it. On the night of the 28th of December, between ten and eleven o'clock, I saw a young woman pass by on the opposite side, with a trunk, covered over - she turned up Brewer's-lane, which leads to Hillyer's-court; I thought it was a servant going to her place, and in about ten minutes I heard an alarm of a trunk having been stolen. I met Harding, the officer, and told him which way she was gone - he followed, and in about ten minutes returned with the box. I have been ten years on that beat, but did not know the prisoner. I believe her to be the person who had the trunk, for I saw her afterwards. I cannot swear to her.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of an alarm being given I inquired of Goodwin - then went up Brewer's-lane, and into Hillyer's-court, and found the trunk laying on the pavement - I took it to the office. I returned to the same spot in about half an hour, and found the wrapper about ten yards from where the trunk was - I have had both ever since. The trunk had not been opened, but uncorded. The prisoner was afterwards taken, and denied the charge.</p>

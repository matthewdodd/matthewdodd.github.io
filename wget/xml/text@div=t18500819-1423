                  </hi>. I am a hatter, of 131, High-street, Camden-town, and keep the adjoining shop as a clothes shop, where the prisoner was my shopman; he has been in my service a year and a half. On 14th June I tent him out with some goods, and to receive a bill amounting to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, in case he should have one given him—he did not come back till 10th July, when he told me that as he was returning down the Camden-road villas a flower-girl asked him to purchase a bunch of flowers; he declined, she put them into his face; he became sick and insensible, and on recovering found himself in a room without his clothes; that they kept him there twenty days, and brought loaded pistols, put them to his head, and threatened to shoot him if he did not tell them where I lived; that at eleven o'clock at night they brought him down into a court, then into another court, and a man behind made him go on, and gave him some money to get some refreshment, and he found himself in the neighbourhood of the Borough—I asked him why he did not inform the police, and he said he was frightened to do so—I told him to tell the truth, and he persisted in saying that was the truth—I gave him into custody.</p>

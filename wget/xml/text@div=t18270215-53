On the 1st of February, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner called on me, to let me know that a daughter of mine, who is an unfortunate girl, was in trouble - I did not know him before, but I am sure he is the man; he said she wanted me to send to her; I said I did not wish to know any thing about her, or have any thing to do with her; he went away. I went out about two o'clock in the afternoon, leaving nobody in the house - I locked the room door, and shut the street door when I came out; I went home about ten minutes before four, and found the street door wide open, and on going upstairs the room door was open, and the lock broken; we have only one room on the first floor. I saw a strange hat laying on a chair, and my husband's hat was taken out of the box, and carried away. I went down and told the neighbours I was robbed. I missed all this property, which I had seen safe before I went out that afternoon; the hat that was left behind, was the prisoner's, I believe, but when he called in the morning it had a piece of black crape round it, which was not on it then - I cannot say it was his hat, but he was apprehended with my husband's hat on, which then had a piece of crape round that; I am sure it was the prisoner's hat, by a mark which I had noticed on the side of it in the morning - it was a cut down the side; I have found nothing but my husband's hat. I took the crape off, and found the band which my husband used to wear, was taken off; there was no crape on my husband's hat before; I gave 4s. for the hat six months ago - it was not new then; 1 value it at 1s., and the other things at 5s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You never saw the prisoner before? A. No - he did not stop a minute with me, and did not take his hat off; I had the keys of all the rooms in the house, to show them, as they were to be let.</p>

            . I live in Grub-street, and am headborough of St. Luke's. I desired a person to apprehend the prisoner, and he delivered him to me, at the watch-house, on the 2d of February, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning - I searched him, and found 7d. in copper on him, and the hat produced on his head.</p>
               <p>MRS. SHELDRAKE. This is my husband's hat - I went to the hat-box just before I went out, and saw the property safe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Monday night before the robbery I was going to Portsmouth, but returned on the Tuesday, and met a young man, who keeps company with this woman's daughter; I went to sup with him, and an officer took him, me, and this woman's daughter, to the watch-house; they were charged with robbing a room of some stoves - I was discharged, and the man asked me to go and tell this woman her daughter was in trouble; I went - she came out and said Mr. Sheldrake was at home, and if I would go to Rogers she would come up to me, and hear about it; I went - the daughter took me upstairs; I told them about it - Mrs. Sheldrake came up while I was there. I wished them good morning, and went straight from there to Red Lion-square; several people were there, getting tickets for the Mendicity society; I was directed to Mr. Sykes, of Queen-square - the beadle said if I waited in the square I might hear of a ticket; a woman came up, and said she would give me one, but it was too late, that I must come at half-past two o'clock; I went and stopped in Davies-court, and at half-past two o'clock I went to Red Lion-square, and after that went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150040"></xptr>with a young man to the Refuge for the Houseless - I was going to Gravesend next day, when I was taken.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Mendicity Society. We enter in a book all applications for relief - here is the book, and it has the following entry, in my writing, (reads) "John Farley, ticket, 79,730, states he lodged at Kingston the preceeding night, and was a native of Godliman;" being a sailor, I ordered him food, and recommended him to sleep at the Refuge at Wapping - I cannot say the prisoner is that individual, but I have certainly seen him at the office at some time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the position in which that entry stands enable you to form any judgment at what time he presented himself? A. It was certainly in the after-part of the day; we examine females before any men; he must have been there after two; we disposed of one hundred and thirty-four cases that day, and perhaps a young lad of his description might be detained there two or three hours.</p>

             . I was coming thro' St. Paul's church-yard some time last month; the day I have forgot; it was between five and six in the afternoon; I met a gentleman of my acquaintance, and was standing near the toyshop at the corner; the two prisoners came by me, and followed Mr. Bellas close; I said to the gentleman with me, those boys look like pick-pockets, let us see if we can detect them; we followed them through <placeName id="t17550910-4-crimeloc18">Ludgate</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17550910-4-crimeloc18" type="placeName" value="Ludgate"></interp>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners do any thing?</p>
               <p>Nightengale. The crowd was so great at Ludgate we could not see them do any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to them there?</p>
               <p>Nightengale. We were within about 15 yards of them, and they were close behind Mr. Bellas all the way. Mr. Bellas immediately reply'd he had lost his handkerchief; we told him we suspected two lads that had followed him, and if he would turn back we might take them. We ran after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100007"></xptr> them, and when the boys saw that, they run; we pursued them through several alleys, till we came cross Fleet-lane, and took them in an alley; they both run together; we carried them into a publick house, called a coach , and took them before my lord-mayor ; they were searched, but no handkerchief found, neither would they confess any thing . We came back to search where the boys had run; and as we were coming down an alley a man called Mr. Bellas , and said a girl had found a handkerchief .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them drop any thing?</p>
               <p>Nightengale. No ; they ran so fast I could not see that.</p>

            , Esq ; This gentleman that has been giving his evidence, and another , came to me on Ludgate hill , and ask'd me if I had lost any thing; I put my hand in my pocket, and said, yes , my handkerchief. They told me they would shew me the persons that had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you your handkerchief last as you can remember?</p>
               <p>Bellas . I had seen it within a quarter of an hour before ; I had it in my right hand coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your coat open?</p>
               <p>Bellas . My coat generally is open, and I believe might be then. I went back with the gentlemen to the end of the Old-Bailey; I was shewn the two prisoners, a pretty way up the Old-Bailey , together; the gentlemen were both strangers to me at that time; one of them lent me a stick; I ran; the boys seeing me run, they both ran down a court, I believe it is called Black-and-white-court; I followed them down; there was a gateway, where I believe they slung the handkerchief away; they ran cross Fleet-lane, and going up a hill, on the other side, among the narrow places, we stopp'd them, and took them before my lord-mayor, where they both were searched, but no handkerchief found; and they both denied the fact. I was convinced that the handkerchief was either lost, or slung away, in the pursuit. I desired the gentlemen to go back with me, to look for it. When we came to Fleet-lane, one Mr. Evans told us his servant had pick'd up a handkerchief in Black-and-white-court. She gave me the handkerchief; I know it to be my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here?</p>
               <p>Bellas . She is a child of about 12 or 13 years of age, and not of years sufficient to give testimony. I went back again to my lord-mayor. The boys were separately examined. I was in hopes the little one would have confessed the fact, and given evidence against the great one; but he denied it. The great one, which is Blackstone, cried, and fell on his knees, and said they both were concerned in picking my pocket; but the little one did the fact .</p>
               <p>Blackstone's defence.</p>
               <p>I am not guilty of the fact. My father is a shoe-maker, and lives in the Borough; I assist him in his business.</p>

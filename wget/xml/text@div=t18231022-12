            . I saw these stockings a quarter of an hour before they were stolen - they were tied in a handkerchief, and put into a bag, and laid in the hall, up one pair of stairs; the prisoner was a stranger. I was in the warehouse on the ground floor, and saw a man pass through the passage, with a bundle - he went into the street; there is a door at the bottom of the stairs, leading from the warehouse; it was kept locked, and the key hung up by the latch; any one could take it down. I went to the door, which should have been locked, and found it wide open. I went into the street, and saw the prisoner about seven houses off, and another man with him - the prisoner had the bundle; I ran after him; they separated before I came up to him - they walked very fast. The prisoner went towards St. Paul's-church-yard; I never lost sight of him, and came up with him in Cannon-alley, and laid hold of him with the bundle, and asked where he was going with the parcel; he said he was going into the country; he had a riding whip in his hand. I said it was not his, and he must come back with me - he then said he had found it. I brought him back, went for a constable, and gave him in charge. I knew it to be the prosecutor's parcel.</p>

On the 3d of October, about a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner passed me with the bundle, six or seven doors from Mr. Gardner's - there was another man with him. Thomas ran by me; I asked what was the matter; he said nothing. The two separated - the prisoner kept the bundle. I saw Thomas lay hold of him, and assisted in bringing him back. When we got him to the house, he said it was impossible he could have taken it, for that he had a horse waiting for him at the Saraceu's Head, Snow-hill - he was given in charge.</p>

            . I live at Ball's-pond, and am a wholesale jeweller - I live with my father. I do not know the prisoner, but I was passing along Paternoster-row, with my sister, about a fortnight ago, to go to the coach with my sister - the prisoner was walking before me, and turning round the corner of the court into St. Paul's-church-yard, I saw a large bundle; this gentleman stepped into the road and picked it up, and had not got many yards before a gentleman laid hold of him - he said</p>
               <p>"Is it yours?" and he said,</p>
               <p>"I think it belongs to Mr. Gardner." The man who took hold of the prisoner said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that - A. In Paternoster-row, by the corner of the court leading into St. Paul's-church-yard. My sister is at home, very poorly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the young man who laid hold of him - A. I do not know, some working man it appeared to be.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the witness, Thomas - A. I do not recollect, indeed. I think he had a lighter jacket on; he was about the size of Eason; I cannot swear to him. The man took hold of him round the waist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask what it was for - A. No. I was passing with my sister, and heard him say,</p>
               <p>"That is not yours," and I thought they might both be quibbling for the prize. The prisoner was about as far from me as I am from your Lordship, when the person laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in Paternoster-row - A. If I recollect he was turning into the court; I did not take particular notice. He was turning round, going into the alley; I cannot say whether he was in the alley. The bundle was similar to the one produced - it is very large.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you stopped to know how this happened did not you - A. No, your Lordship: the young man came up; the prisoner said he would go back and see who the bundle belonged to.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what you say is taken down, and I caution you, will you swear that the prisoner said he would go back and see to whom it belonged - A. He said he would go back with him. The man said it belonged to Mr. Gardner; he said</p>
               <p>"I will go back with you, and see if it does."</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that - A. Yes. My sister was with me at the time, laying hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What followed then - A. Why, the young man went back. He was laid hold of by one on each arm I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you enquired how this happened - A. Why, I did not think proper to leave my sister unprotected. I asked a person how it was, and he said the parcel was stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. He said the parcel was stolen; of course then you told him, No, this man has not stolen it, for I saw him pick it up - A. I believe I did. I said I saw him pick it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you say you saw him pick it up - A. Yes, I did my Lord. I did not speak to the persons who laid hold of him. I spoke to a few persons who collected afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him pick it up, then he could not have stolen it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the men who laid hold of him so - A. No; he was gone away. A few people came up, and some conversation ensued.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them take him away as the thief, why not tell them that you saw him pick it up - A. I thought they might be quibbling for the prize. A few people came up, and it was to one of them that I said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to the man, what business have you with it - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say he was not the thief, for you saw him pick it up - A. It did not occur to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to tell them you knew he was not the thief, because you saw him pick it up - A. I cannot account for it. The two men came up, and they went off immediately. My sister lives in the same house as myself, at Ball's-pond, Glebe-terrace. I never saw the man before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the house to see where they took him to - A. I asked afterwards, and understood he was sent for trial - I did not go into the house; I asked some porter at the door. I was passing down Paternoster-row last week, and the circumstance came to my recollection - I asked a man (who stood at a bookseller's door, near the passage) what became of that matter - he said the person was sent for trial. I did not go into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go into the house, and state what you knew - A. I thought if I could be of service to the unfortunate man, I would come here and speak, and this morning I called at Giltspur-street Compter, and was told he was going to be tried.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, till about a week ago, you did not know there was any charge of felony - A. Not till I called in Pater-noster-row.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not suppose there was anything of theft in the case - A. No. I asked the porter at the bookseller's door, how the matter rested - I did not know the porter, and cannot tell the number of the shop; it did not concern me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220011"></xptr>Q. Will you swear upon your oath, that you were near that man at the time he was stopped, and your sister with you - A. Yes, certainly. I was going to the coach with my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. There were two men in this transaction - A. Only one came up; the prisoner was alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he alone when you saw him pick it up - A. Yes; nobody was with him. Nobody separated from him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from the time you first saw him he had no companion - A. No. I first learnt that he was going to be tried last week; the man told me he was sent to gaol. I have not been subpoenaed here. I called at the Compter this morning, and they said he was gone to Newgate, and I went to Mr. Wontner, who gave me an order to see if he was the same person. I looked through a window, and saw that he was the same person. I swear positively that I never saw any person near the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the two following him - A. One of them ran past me; they laid hold of him almost immediately.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did you see the man who separated from the prisoner - A. Not to take particular notice of him. I did not see the witness with a lady near the prisoner. I saw no person at all near us.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been a young man, and a young lady with him, must you have seen him - A. I think I must. There was no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say he would go back and see whom it belonged to - A. Mr. Gardner's porter said,</p>
               <p>"You must come back, for it does not belong to you;" I believe he said,</p>
               <p>"I will go." There was no young man or woman near the spot. It took place in Cannon-alley, about half way down.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at the time he was stopped was he just turning out of Paternoter-row into the alley - A. He had got about half way down.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it possible for you to pass a gentleman and lady, close to the prisoner in Cannon-alley, without pushing them aside to take hold of the prisoner - A. There was nobody in the alley but Mr. Gardener's porter, me, and the prisoner; if there had been a lady and gentleman there, I think I could have passed them without pushing against them, but I could not help observing them - there were no such persons. He had got close to the public-house door.</p>

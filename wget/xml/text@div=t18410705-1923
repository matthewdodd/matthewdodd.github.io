                  </hi>. I live with my brother, Dr. Alfred Cather-wood, in Charles-square, Hoxton, in the county of Middlesex. The pri<lb></lb>soner was in his service as housemaid—on the 15th of June a fire broke out in my bed-room, and in consequence of something that occurred, I sent for the policeman—the prisoner's box was searched, (she was to have left the next day,) and some things were found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Bath, a pawnbroker, in Goswell-street. On the 16th of April these two sheets and table-cloth were pledged with me, in the evening, by a woman, but I cannot swear to the party who pledged them—she was in the last box, and it was very dark—they were pawned in the name of Ann Carter, of Crown-court—I have no belief or recollection of the person.</p>

On the night of the 15th of June I was called to Dr. Catherwood's, in consequence of a fire that occur<lb></lb>red in the house—I suggested that the prisoner's box should be searched—the prisoner was called, and I told her I intended to search her box—I got the key from her, and went into the room—she pointed out the box to me, and I unlocked it in her presence—I round a variety of articles in it, and some duplicates, one of which relates to this pair of sheets and table cloth—I examined a band-box, and found in it a carpenter's gouge—by the prisoner's request, I tried her fellow-servant's key, and that opened the prisoner's box also.</p>

I desired her to sit down, and if any body came in for her to awake me; I thought I could have trusted her, and while I was fast asleep, my hand, with my wedding ring on my finger, being on the outside the bed, she took my ring off, it was rather too big for my finger, and she took the other things<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100006"></xptr> mentioned, and went away; when I awaked I miss 'd her and them.</p>

               <p>J. Wood. I might sleep near 3 hours; I awak'd before my husband came in; I was so astonished at missing my shoes and buckles, and ring, that I did not look for the other things till after my husband came home. After this, the prisoner had the impudence to come the next night, and went up stairs to bed, knowing I had beds in the house; I had her secur'd and taken to the watchhouse, and they let her go again; and I being ill, could not get her again for several days; when I charg'd her with taking them, she own'd, she went to pawn the things that same afternoon that she took them.</p>

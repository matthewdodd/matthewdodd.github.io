                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live in Paul-street, Finsbury. On the 31st of December, I was passing down Essex-street, Hoxton, and saw two persons standing at the prosecutor's window—I am sure Biddle is one of them, and I should say Walker was the other, but I did not see hit face—I heard something like a pane of glass fall, which caused me to turn round, and I saw them leave—they walked a little way, and then ran down Cross-street, which divides Huntingdon-street from Essex-street—as I was crossing Gloucester-street, Biddle was doing the same, and I knew him directly as one I had seen at the window—he looked up at the corner where the name of the street was, and said, "Oh, it is the wrong street," and ran away—he had an apron on, and threw something away from it, on the sill of a door of a butter-shop—I asked the woman what they were, and finding they were boots, I ran after him and caught him by the Kings<lb></lb>land-road, without losing sight of him—I am sure he is the person I saw throw something away—I gave him in charge to the policeman for com<lb></lb>mitting the robbery, and said, I would show him where it was done—Bid<lb></lb>dle immediately said he had not been in Essex-street that night—I gave the boots to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable No</hi>. 277.) On Thursday night, the 31st of December, I was on duty in Kingsland-road. Mr. Saxon gave Biddle into my custody for breaking a window and stealing some boots and shoes—Biddle said, "I am quite innocent, I don't know any thing of it," or words to that effect—Saxon immediately said, "Come with me, and I will show you where he has done it"—as we were going along Kingsland road, Bid<lb></lb>dle said, "I am sure I am innocent, for I have not been in Essex-street to-night"—I took him to the prosecutor's shop—I noticed a pane of glass there—one corner of it was apparently cut out, the putty cut away from the wood, and the glass gone—I left Biddle at the shop, and went to a cheesemonger's in Hoxton—I there received a pair of boots—on my return to the prosecutor's, he told me that he had met the prisoner about ten minutes previously, about twenty yards from his house—Biddle said, "I have not been in Hoxton to-night"—he afterwards admitted that he had for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco—I apprehended Walker on the Sunday morning fol<lb></lb>lowing—I asked who, and what he was—he did not answer my questions properly, and I suspected, from the description I had received, that he was the other person—I asked, if he would walk along with me a little way, as I wanted to speak with him—he said he would—in going along, I asked if he knew a man named Biddle—he hesitated for a moment, and then said he did not—I looked him full in the face, he coloured up very much, and I was then sure he was the other man.</p>

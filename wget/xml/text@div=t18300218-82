            . I am a constable of Southwark. On the 1st of February I was on duty at the watch-house, and was applied to to take the prisoner in Union-street, Lambeth-road - I found on him a bag, with 38s. in it, which he said he had sold meat for - that was all that passed: I did not go to the eating-house.</p>

            . Has not the prisoner been a master butcher himself? A. Yes, but he never bought meat of me - he portered for me, and I paid him; he was not to receive money for me - he was only employed to carry this meat.</p>

               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Rosemary-lane. On Thursday, the 1st of November, the prisoner came to my house, and offered a copper lock for sale for 5s. - I told him I did not like the look of it, and asked if he would take half-a-crown; he said it was worth more, but agreed to take it; he said it was his own; I asked where he lived, and he wrote his address, "Jonathan Davey, New Charlton;" while he was writing it, I told a man to go and get change for a half-crown, and I sent for a headborough - I had shot the lock, and seen the broad arrow on it; the man returned with the change, and I gave the prisoner four sixpences, and 6d. worth of copper; I then asked him how he came by it, as it was a King's lock, he again said it was his own; I said he must go with me, and I took him to the Thames Police-office; in going there, he said he would give me the lock and 5s. if I would let him go; I said it was a trick played upon me, and he must go before the Magistrate, who might do as he pleased about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is it a perfect lock? A. Yes; there is nothing wanting but the key, and the box which the lock goes into - it is worth about 2s. 4d. as old metal, but it might be used as a lock, with a key; as a lock it is worth about 1l.; I did offer half-a-crown for it; I knew it was a King's lock as soon as I saw it, as I have been in the King's service myself - I could swear to it without seeing the broad arrow on it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What were you in the King's service? A. Carpenter on board the Semiramis.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police constable. The prisoner was given into my custody by Operman, with this lock; I asked what ship he belonged to, and he said the Weymouth frigate, lying at Deptford, in ordinary; I asked how he got the lock; he said a peterman had been dredging at the bottom of the river, that he came alongside, and said this was a good lock fit for use, which he had got up from the bottom, and he should have it for 6d.; but here is whitewash on it, and I have seen it opened - it has never been in the water at all.</p>

            . I was carpenter of the Weymouth; the prisoner succeeded me in that capacity. On quitting the ship I went over the stores, and gave the prisoner an inventory of them; there was a lock like this on board, and on the 7th of September he asked me where the copper lock was; I said down in the store-room: I got a light, and showed it him - it was the only lock of this description - there were other locks; on the 10th of September I showed it to him again; and on the 2d of November I was desired to go on board to see if this lock was there, and it was not; on the 19th of November I was ordered there again on a general survey; the lock was then missing, but I found the key in the place where the lock had been - I know this lock to be the King's property, and I believe this whitewash has been dropped upon it - all the other stores were there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you now? A. I am carpenter of his Majesty's ship Inconstant. I cannot exactly swear that this is the same lock, but it is a magazine lock, and there was such a one on board the Weymouth - they are all copper locks, and I have seen many others like this.</p>

            . I was boatswain of the Weymouth about three years ago, and had charge of the carpenter's stores for about six months; I remember a copper door-lock on the magazine; I was asked by Mr. White if I knew any thing about this lock, and I asked if there were spots of lime on it, as I had a faint recollection of the circumstance.</p>

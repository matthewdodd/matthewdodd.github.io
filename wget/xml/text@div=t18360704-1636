                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On the 14th of June I was at the Cross Keys public-house in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, with my wife—we were drinking there—the prisoner was there—I was in another part of the room—I had had a quarrel with the prisoner on Easter Tuesday last, about his wife abusing my sister—on Tuesday, the 14th of June, I went into the tap-room, and had been there about twenty minutes when the prisoner got up and began in his usual way, and challenged me to fight him—asked me would I fight him, and he was saying he did not care and—about any man in the house—he did not strike me—he stripped to fight—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Mike</hi>, you owe me an old grudge, ever since Easter Tuesday"—I said I would fight him in fair play, in the middle of the tap-room—the publican of the house heard the noise, came down, and, knowing what sort of a man he was, he put him out of the house—he did not put me out—I did not see the prisoner come in again—no blows had been struck by him or me before he went—I said there about half an hour, and my wife and I then went home together—this was between twelve and one o'clock—I had to go about two minutes' walk to my home—I live in Hobbs'-court, Castle-street—when I got up to the end of the narrow part of the court I saw one of the prisoner's legs—he was standing at a corner, at the end of the narrow part of the court—he was concealed—it is a dark court, and has no lamp in it—I know it was the prisoner—I knew him perfectly well, because he had been a neighbour, and his brother-in-law lived next door to me—the prisoner lives in Castle-street—the place I saw him in was not in his way home—the court is no thoroughfare—he was behind a wooden partition, which divides the yard from the court where I live—when I first saw his leg I had just time to look at him, and he had a weapon in his hand, holding it with his two hands—it seemed much like the weapon the officer has in his custody—I had only time to see him with the blow—I was struck on the left side of my head—I became insensible, and can not remember any thing that happened afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital. On the 14th of June, I remember Creighton being brought to the hospital—I think it was nearly half-past one or two o'clock—his head and face were covered with blood—I examined it, and found a wound about an inch above the ear, about an inch and a half in extent, on the right side of the head—it might have been attended with dangerous consequences, if he had been of a bad constitution—his eye was black, and his face slightly bruised—he was discharged from the hospital last Tuesday—I have seen the iron produced—it was a wound such as might be inflicted by an instrument of that description—it is of consider<lb></lb>ble weight.</p>

This man and I had been drinking Monday and Tuesday together, all the two days, at different places in Whitechapel—we came to the Cross Keys and had a drink there—he wanted to quarrel with me—I said he had better keep out of my company, I wanted no quar<lb></lb>relling, and not to be hindered from my work—he followed me to my own place, and wanted me to fight—I came out and told him to be off, for I wanted to go to bed, but he would have me fight—so I came out, and he hit me—I hit him in the face, and he fell on the curb—he being so drunk, was not able to stand—he was more drunk than I was—he has been dif<lb></lb>ferent times in prison for quarrels—he is always kicking up <hi rend="italic">rows</hi> with different persons.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Cross Keys. On the Tuesday night in question, the prisoner and Creighton were going to fight—I saw them standing up—my wife coaxed the prisoner out—he said, "Mrs. Finney, I will go home with you"—I staid in the house—I sent the prosecutor and his wife out in a quarter of an hour, or it might be ten minutes after—when I told them they should go out, they went out voluntarily—I did not turn them out the same time as the prisoner, because I thought they might quarrel together, for the prosecutor was very violent—I did not wish them to come in contact together—I sent the prosecutor out, it did not exceed ten minutes after the prisoner left—I sent him and four or five more out—I would not draw any more beer, and turned every body out.</p>

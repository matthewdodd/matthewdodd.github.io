                  </hi>. I am an omnibus conductor, of 142, Portman Road, Notting Hill—on 30th May, about 3.15, I was with my omnibus near the Mansion House—I hailed the last witness—she assented—I stopped the omnibus, and crossed the road to assist her to it—I saw the prisoner close to her, with his hand close to her pocket; his left hand was towards her right hand—she had a child under each arm, and I could not perceive whether his hand was in her pocket—she led one of the children to the omnibus, and I carried the other, keeping my eye in the meantime on the prisoner—I then asked the lady if she had lost her purse—she said, "Yes"—the prisoner was then four or five yards from the omnibus door—I gave chase, and took hold of him; he immediately produced the purse from his right-hand trousers pocket, and said, "Here it is; we found it"—I had said nothing to him about a purse.</p>

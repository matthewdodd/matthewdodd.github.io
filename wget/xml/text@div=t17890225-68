               <p>I am a clergyman, a doctor in divinity, I live adjoining to the house where this lad works, I have known him between three or four years, he is a parish apprentice, put out to a master who could not employ him in his business; there was no care taken of the boy of any sort or kind, the boy was forced to run of errands, I have entrusted him often, my servants did the same, he was often in my house, in the kitchen, among my servants, where he might have stolen many things, if he had been so disposed; he was remarkable for activity and the best of tempers, as far as I know of him, he was always honest; the boy did not ask me to come, I thought it my duty, I always had a good opinion of him; the boy is of a remarkable sweet temper and good behaviour.</p>
               <p>Court. What parish did he come from? - I believe St. George's parish.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. ROSE sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known him about three years, I am enabled to give him the best of characters, and so far enabled that I have commissioned him with money which he has carried to considerable distances, and has fetched money from a considerable distance, and has always been honest, punctual and upright.</p>
               <p>- MUNDAY, Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - I am no business, I live on my fortune, I have known the boy four or five years; I always found him very honest and sober, I have entrusted him with several pieces of money; if he is acquitted I will willingly take him into my service.</p>

               <p>Court. At the same time we must enquire what would be best for him. Does any of the gentlemen who has been so good as to appear for this poor boy, point out a way of disposing of him.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Rose. My lord, provided this boy is acquitted, there are more than one, two, or three that would take him into their service.</p>
               <p>Court. Have any of you, gentlemen, any employ for this lad; he has been found guilty, but if you can find any way of employing him, that is likely to prevent him from falling into these courses again, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250089"></xptr>can not withstanding that verdict put it into your power to do so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Munday. I have that opinion of him, I will willingly take him into my service.</p>
               <p>Court. That is very humane of you Sir, I hope you will never have any reason to repent your goodness. Let him be <rs id="t17890225-68-punish315" type="punishmentDescription">

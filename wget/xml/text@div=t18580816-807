                  </hi>. I live at 6, Hale-street, Deptford, and work at an iron-foundry—the prisoner was my lodger—he occupied the front room up-stairs—I slept in the front room down stairs—on Tuesday, 3d August, the prisoner and his wife came home together: they were tipsy—nothing had passed between us, but his wife had used disgusting language in the street, and I gave them notice to quit—on the next day, Wednesday, the prisoner and his wife came to my room at nearly 11 o'clock at night—I was in bed—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160092"></xptr>
               <p>they came to my door—they were swearing how they would serve me if I came out—the prisoner's wife said, "Come out"—they remained at my door I suppose 10 minutes—I got up and put on my trowsers and boots—I opened my room door, and, in entering the passage, the prisoner's wife struck at me with a poker; I grasped the poker and wrenched it from her—the prisoner was then standing at my back, with a knife over my head—I turned my head and saw the knife in his hand—I turned myself round with the poker, and he struck me three or four times on the top of the head, and over the eye, in the passage, with the knife—I scuffled and got into the street—I found I could do no more than defend myself with the poker—I struck him several times across the arm to make him loose the knife—Mrs. Reeves came up and got the knife from him, and I went as well as I could for the police<lb></lb>man, and he and I got the prisoner to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a labourer—we live at 2, Hale-street—on Wednesday night, 4th August, my attention was attracted by hearing a disturbance at 6—I went there, and saw the prisoner and the prose<lb></lb>cutor—I saw Mr. Evans strike Ashdown with the poker; I can't say where be struck him, but he struck him till he got him under the lamp, and I saw a knife glittering in the prisoner's hand—I said, "My God, he has got a knife"—I got it out of his hand, and put it in my pocket—I told Evans to leave off beating Ashdown, and get a policeman—Ashdown had been drink<lb></lb>ing from the Monday before, he was quite stupid.</p>

I am a surgeon—on Wednesday night, 4th August, I was sent for to see the prosecutor—he was bleeding from two or three in<lb></lb>cised wounds on the top of the head and one on the eyebrow—one of the wounds on the head was between three and four inches long, the rest were smaller—there was one on the right side of the forehead—they might have been produced by this knife—the wounds were considered serious at the time, but he got on very well afterwards—if erysipelas had come on there would have been danger.</p>

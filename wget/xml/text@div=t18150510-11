I am a married woman; I saw the poney at the stable keepers, faceing the office, not so long as a fortnight ago, I think it was last week; one of the officers shewed it me, Mr. Gleed he is here; I bought that poney of the prisoner at he bar I cannot say positively it is the same poney, it is so much altered. On the 30th of December last I saw my two sons at my door with a poney they had been to Charles-court to

When he was gone, my son cried after the poney; I sent my man after him, he brought Mr. Shovell along with him; I said, Mr. Showel you may as well come back with the poney, I had told him what the boys were crying after; I asked what was the lowest he would take for it, he said thirty shillings, he came into the counting house, and I paid him thirty shillings for it. My son, and the man took it to the stable, I think I kept it about a fortnight, I sold it to a customer of the name of Richardson.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember seeing a poney at Mrs. Mitchells - A. Yes, I cannot tell the day of the month. it was a small poney a stone-horse; I sent a man of the name of Hasland he bought the poney for thirty shillings, of Mrs. Mitchell, or there abouts, I saw it delivered to Harland; I saw the poney after Harland had it about fourteen days or thereabouts; afterwards I bought it of Harland myself, I was to give him two guineas for it. I had it about a month, and when it was out one day, a man, Hambridge was going by, he said to me it is my poney, this was about the end of February; he asked me where I had got it, I saw the poney after it was delivered to the officer, I saw it in the street, with Hambridge's letters upon it. I thought the poney was the same that I bought, but I was not sure of it. As I am upon my oath, when I say it is the poney, I mean, I think it is, I had no doubt it is the same poney, none at all, I have never seen the poney since.</p>

I took him to the office. On the Tuesday following the poney was brought over the way to the stable. I took Mrs. Mitchell over the way to see it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you in the Company's warehouse in Billiter-lane? - A. I am commodore: In consequence of information, I informed the assistant elder, and I was directed to keep my eyes upon him; I saw the prisoner in the act of unbuttoning his breeches; there was a noise of something falling on the floor, and I immediately stepped up to the prisoner, and said to him, I am very sorry for what I see, but it is too late now; he turned and seemed very much affected, and began crying; I picked up the indigo; there was some on the floor occasioned by his letting the bag fall; I gave the bag with the indigo to the assistant elder, William Stinton. He was then taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You, who are a very honest man, I take it for granted, would be very much affected if you were accused of a robbery; the place where you found this indigo was very dark? - A. Rather dark.</p>
               <p>Q. It often happens that pieces are thrown out of the cask on the ground; does it happen so? - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a number of people there while the prisoner was there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. If indigo drops on the ground, they do not generally drop it in bags? - A. No.</p>

He said he could not see what possessed him to do it.</p>
               <p>- RIGG sworn. - I produce the indigo: I received it from Stinton.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Stinton.) Is that the indigo? - A. Yes, the same sort and quality; indigo is about sixteen shillings a pound; the prisoner had three shillings a day for working in the indigo from eight in the morning till two in the afternoon.</p>

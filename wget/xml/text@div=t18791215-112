                  </hi>. I am a clerk, living at Netherton House, Kidbrook Park, Blackbeath—on the night of 22nd October I retired to bed somewhere after 12 o'clock, leaving my brother William Henry Southwell up, and two servants—I was called up at 7 the following morning by the servants—I went downstairs and found the window in the hall at the foot of the stairs open about 2 inches—the hasp of the window had been wrenched and broken inside the window with a spade, which had been used to wrench it open—a large stone vase which stood inside, 14 feet high, was</p>

               <p>pushed away so as to help the descent into the house—the dining-room was in confusion, and things were removed from it into the drawing-room—my writing-desk was broken open, and the poker and shovel were on the settee in the centre of the room—the shovel was bent nearly doable—I compared it with the marks on the writing-desk, and they corresponded—I missed some dessert knives and forks, fish knives and forks, 13 spoons, my umbrella, boots, and several other things—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my property, and what I missed that morning—there are several other articles missing which have not been found—the value of that which has been found is about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—outside the house were some boards, partially imbedded in the ground, and resting close to the window at which the entrance was made—that window was shut and locked when I went to bed—it is a window which was never opened above once or twice a year—the knives and forks were kept in two boxes—both the boxes were on the dining-room table—they had only opened the top tray—the bottom part was full—that had evidently been overlooked—I do'not know the prisoners.</p>

On the night of 31st October I went with Inspector Fox and Sergeant Walsh to 42, Bed Cross Street, Boro'—it was a shoemaker's shop of the lowest degree, which you entered directly from the street—we found the male prisoner and another man sitting in the shop—Fox asked the prisoner if his name was White—he said "Yes"—he said "You have, been pledging some plated articles at different pawn-shops; if you have any stolen property in the house you had better give it up"—I did not bear him make any reply—I went and stood at the back door—the male prisoner and the inspector went upstairs—I went back into the shop, and stood there near the front door—the female prisoner came downstairs and caught hold of the front door to pull it open to go out—she merely had a loose dress on over her chemise—she walked through the shop hurriedly towards me and attempted to open the door—I stopped her and said "Where are you going? you will not go out; you must stop"—I caught hold of her—she struggled to get out, 1 struggled to keep her in—I sat her down in a chair—I saw a piece of paper protruding from her bosom, inside her dress—I took it out, and it contained these knives, forks, and spoons produced—I called for Walsh, and he came down—she put her hand in her pocket, and I heard some paper tearing in her pocket—I pulled her hand out, and some paper came oat with it and some pawn-tickets, one of them relating to the spoon and reading-glass produced by Hilstead, and which has been identified by the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Q. Being out of place, and Sunday being an idle day you and your companion had been drinking together? - We had been but not so as not to know what we were about.</p>
               <p>Q What time of the Sunday was it you first went into a public house? - I did not go into any public house in the day till I came to the ship in Swallow-street about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you had not been in any house before to drink? - We might have liquor in the garden.</p>
               <p>Q How much might you have in the garden? - We had some in one place and some in another.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to evade the answer. These gardens belong to public houses, do not they? - They do.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what time in the morning did you go to these gardens? - It was between eleven and twelve when I set out from my lodgings, and I got to the gardens about an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the gardens - Somewhere about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank in the gardens I suppose? - We did.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before dinner, and on an empty stomach, and a little liquor will then do a good deal of execution. Now where else did you get drink next? - We did not drink any thing till we came back to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q Where did you dine? - At a cook's shop; after that we drank together again for about an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. No, the person does not dispense good liquor, he only gives good advice. Where did you go next? - We walked to Kentish Town, we went to a house that belonged to my master, a house that he keeps there, a private house, my master is not there, the house is empty; we went to look into the gardens; we went after that into a garden over the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the house? - We did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why the garden did not produce any liquor whatever? - But the liquor can be brought in though.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I take it for granted it was brought in; how much did you take there? - About two pints or three pints of cider.</p>
               <p>Q. Cider alone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing else with the cider, because the cider is apt to disagree with the bowels? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go next? - We came home again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go after that? - We came to Swallow-street again, we went to a house there and drank tea, and sat there the evening till about ten o'clock, when we went into the Ship; and came out again at half after ten.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had parted with your friend Colebert and came out of the last public house, was you in your way home? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your home? - No. 161, Oxford-street, directly opposite Davis-street; I was going from home when this man came up to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you been at supper at the Ship? - We had been drinking at the Ship, but not getting our supper.</p>
               <p>Q. You then had been drinking again at the Ship, and after that was going to get your supper at eleven o'clock at night? - I suppose when we went out of the Ship it was half after ten; when we are out of place we sup when we like; it was in my way to supper when this man came up to us; he was a perfect stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. He was pretty drinky, was not he? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not he stagger against you or your friend Colebert? - He assaulted

               <p>Q. Now you have told us all the truth on this occasion; was not you in company with bad women? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you was not in the whole course of your walking with him, in company with any bad women? - There was a bad woman came into the house while I was there; but there was no woman with me all the way I was coming home not coming up or going down only the woman that came into the house while I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was at the corner of Stratford-place there was a watch box close by you? - Yes, I believe there was.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner began pulling you there? - He began pushing me across the road.</p>
               <p>Q. You began then to suspect him; why did not you call out to the watchman who was in the box? - I did call out, and the watchman was standing at the corner of the market, and told me the prisoner ran down James's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then though you called watch, the watch did not come up? - There was no watchman came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at what time did the watchman tell you that the man was gone down James's-street? - This was after I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. As you was quite sober you got up the moment you was pushed down. What was that watchman's name? - I don't know; I asked them why they did not come, they told me they did not hear me call, not one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come up at all? - They were coming from the door when I was coming to them.</p>
               <p>Q. On what beat was this watchman that you spoke to? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath have you ever applied to any watchman to come forward on this occasion? did you ask these watchmen to pursue or spring their rattles? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not desire them to make any alarm or make any pursuit, and in fact they did not? - They did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were they from you when he pushed you down? - I was pushed down the corner of Davis-street, and the watchmen were all standing in the middle of Oxford market.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him the moment when you got up; which way did the prisoner run? - Across the road down James's-street; so they told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him run? - I did not, when I got up he was out of sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say just now, that you got up immediately almost as you was pushed down? - I got up as soon as I could; he knocked me down, and I could not get up directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray where did the blow hit you? - On the side of the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it knock your hat off? - It did not; when I fell against the wall my hat fell off, my hat was off when I was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a violent blow? - I don't know, it was very violent.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you produce any kind of mark to the watchmen on this head of your's? - No, it was a blow on the temple, on the side of the head.</p>
               <p>Q. No bruise, no bump at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how was the other side that fell against the wall? perhaps a wall will not bruise a head like your's? - It was not hurted.</p>
               <p>Q. This head of your's, I wish you would go with the Duke of York's army, for according to your account of it, a cannon ball would not hurt it. Nor you never found any bruise nor bump; he seems to be a very good stout man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290121"></xptr>which could hit a hard blow? - He knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you was quite sober? - I don't say I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how far you was gone towards drunkenness? - I knew very well what I was about.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that you had your watch about you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it? - I felt him pulling the chain before he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before he knocked you down? - Directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you call watch? did you call up the street? - I was out of Oxford-road then, it was in Davis-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You came down the Stratford side of the way, and you said just now that the moment he began to push you you suspected him, and called out? - I did not suspect him till he got hold of the chain of my watch; I called out as soon as I felt he got hold of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not call out, till he had hawled you from Stratford-place side of the way, into this place by the timber yard? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out while you was in Oxford-road or not? - I believe I was off the road getting on the stones.</p>
               <p>Q. The moment he began to push you you suspected him? - I did the moment he got hold of the chain of my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you call out before you got to Davis-street? - I did, I called out as soon as he got hold of the chain of the watch; he shoved me across instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not call out all the time he was pushing you across Oxford-road? - I did not till he got hold of the chain of my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Then direct opposite to Stratford-place is South Moulton-street, Davis-street goes aslant? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you suffered him to be pushing you all that way, and never called out; you say you got up directly; was you stunned by the blow? - I cannot say I was much stunned by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you, or was you not? - I was not stunned by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing to prevent you from getting up, and yet you could not see which way the prisoner went? - I saw a man running down the corner of James's-street, whom I suspected to be the prisoner, when I went to the watchmen I asked them, and they said a man ran down James's street; I asked them if they did not see a man? and I asked them why they did not come when I first called? and they said they did not hear.</p>
               <p>Q. And they made no pursuit after him, nor did you; and you have not called any one of these watchmen to be a witness here to day. Have you had any conversation with Cole about this business? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. You charge him with a highway robbery, and you are out of place; how long have you been out of place? - Between two and three months.</p>
               <p>Q. So this force; this knocking down, and this violence, makes it altogether an highway robbery? - It is an highway robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you get, how much by it? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard that there is a forty pounds reward on the conviction of any one for an highway robbery? - I have heard it since the prisoner was taken; I never heard it in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear it since, and who told you? - I heard it in this Court by the counsel of a person that was tried.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he the first that you heard it from? - My master was the first that informed me of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When, how long ago? - I cannot say what day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a month ago? - Not a month ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290122"></xptr>Q. Was it before you preferred your indictment? - I cannot say exactly when I was before the grand jury, but I heard of it before I was before them.</p>
               <p>Q. In the drunken state in which you was you would have trusted your friend Colebert with your watch I have no doubt? - He had a watch of his own.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been going any where for any particular purpose, you would have had no objection to have trusted your friend Colebert to have kept your watch for you? - I was quite sober enough to keep it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner taken up? - At the Cross Keys, Mary-le-bone lane, at his pay table; I went to the house where we were drinking, and asked a person if they knew the prisoner, and where he worked, and I found his master, and I went to him, and his master told me he was at work on a job for him in the country, and he came back to his pay table on Saturday night, and there he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, man, when he was taken and asked about the watch, did not he tell you if you would describe the watch you should have it? - He did not; I had been there a quarter of an hour before he came in there.</p>
               <p>Q. This man is not out of place? - His master told me he was gone down to work at Woodford.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it not your constant business to be there? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you was ever absent three days in a week? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. When? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you or are you not in the character of a runner? - I don't know whether I am or not; I am not confined there.</p>
               <p>Q. You are constantly attending there? - Sometimes I am not there from morning till night.</p>
               <p>Q. I find you have introduced a great deal of conversation which we did not hear from the others. Do you know there is a reward of forty pounds if this man is convicted? - But what of that, sir? I have no more thought about the forty pounds than I have about this here.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a good deal of conversation before you got there? - The man came to me about seven o'clock in the evening on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Not before? - They came to me on the Tuesday, and then Mr. Hurd told me he had been robbed; about seven o'clock on Saturday they came again, and we took him about eight o'clock; I don't suppose we could be in the house above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all that conversation which you have related of the prisoner, passed in the presence of the two witnesses; - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are then not ignorant of this forty pounds? - I have spoke nothing but truth.</p>
               <p>Q. If this man had described to you that he had been robbed, and a man was seen running you would have thought it your duty to pursue? - I had no occasion to pursue, because the man was present.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you would not have done such a thing if this man had described to you he had been robbed, and a man was running? - I don't know whether I should or not; very likely I should; I know it is my duty to do so.</p>

               <p>I keep a chandler's shop below Tyburn Turnpike, between that and Bazewater. On the 18th of May the constable Cole charged me to assist him in apprehending the prisoner; I went with Cole into Mary-le-bone-lane, to a public house called the sign of the Cross Keys; the prosecutor pointed out a man to Cole, and said, that was the man that robbed him; Mr. Cole took him into the parlour,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290125"></xptr>and took a watch from his pocket which the prosecutor said that is my watch; the prisoner said, I never saw you before in my life, that is my watch I can prove I had it this four years. I assisted Mr. Cole to take him to the watch-house; that is all I know of it; Mr. Cole had the watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you an officer? - I assisted Mr. Cole.</p>

             about three weeks or a month; I changed with him for the watch that he has now in his pocket, which was mine, a metal one, he has it now by him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You could not describe it by its number when you was in this house? - I could not.</p>
               <p>Court to Colebert. Is that the watch you sold to Hurd? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any watch of your own? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Hurd. Look at that; is that the watch you changed for his? - It is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have to say a couple of words. Please your worship, I want to ask the prosecutor whether at the time he picked up the woman, he did not ask me to keep the watch for him twice over.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was with no woman, only the woman that came into the house, and that woman I left in the house.</p>

               <p>My father is a plaisterer; I manage my father's business in part; I know the man at the bar, he worked for my father when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know at what time he came to work on Monday preceeding the Saturday he was taken up? - I cannot say exactly, because he was at work in the country, at Woodford-bridge, at Mr. Naylor's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know at what time he ought to have attended on that job, on the Monday prior to his being taken up on the Saturday? - At five o'clock in the morning; he was paid according to that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What character has he borne? - A very hard working industrious man; a man trusted by us with the direction of the jobs in the country at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any authority to say whether your father would again receive this man into his employ, was he discharged from this bar? - I would employ him to night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot blocker, and live in Trinity-court. On the morning of 20th Dec., between 1 and 2 o'clock, I saw the prisoner in a public house in Old-street; I was with her about half an hour—I came out and went with her in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> up to the Strand—I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, went in a house, and had something to drink—I stopped a few minutes, and came out, and we got to Newgate-street in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I then found my money was gone out of my pocket—it was safe when I got in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> the last time—I had 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a stocking—I stopped the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and gave the prisoner in charge—I had not given her any money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When I first met him in Old-street, there was another gentle<lb></lb>man with him—he asked me three times to go in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> before I consented, and he said he would make me a handsome present. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not</p>

I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> driver; I took the prosecutor and the pri<lb></lb>soner on the morning of 20th Dec.—there was another person with them—at first they were all three in together, and afterwards the other person came outside—I afterwards heard the prosecutor call to me to stop, which I did momentarily—he said, "I want a policeman;" a policeman was close handy—I and the policeman afterwards searched my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—we did not find any<lb></lb>thing; the prosecutor's friend gave me a shilling—the prosecutor pulled a stocking out of his pocket, and in it was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his breeches were undone and his shirt was hanging out.</p>

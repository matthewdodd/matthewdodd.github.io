            . I am a licensed Hawker - I had been travelling with my cloth, in a pack from Kensington to Hammersmith on the 6th of September; there were some navigators sitting on the side of the road at their dinner; they told me to let them see a piece of cloth, and the prisoner asked for a piece to look at; he said,</p>
               <p>"Let me show it to this woman," and ran across the way with it. I could not run after him, as my pack was loose, and I was afraid the others would take the rest of the things - it was dowlas cloth.</p>

            . I was at work at Kensington, near Lord Holland's, with the prisoner, and near one hundred other men. I was sitting down, between twelve and one o'clock, having my dinner; the young man was coming down the foot-path, and one of the men asked him to let us look at his cloth, and he came and handed his cloth to me and another, and gave a bit to a man whom we called Lankey, he is about five feet ten inches high; he took it to show to a woman, and never came back - not even for his money; his money is now in Mr. Wood's hands - I saw the young man give the cloth into his hands - the prisoner was not there, he came a few minutes after.</p>

               <p>and am a wearer. On 31st May I had some silk in my loom in the course of manufacturing—I covered it over, and left home at 11 o'clock in the forenoon—the silk was not finished—there was as near as possible about thirty yards—I had also some shute on bobbins—I lost about seven ounces of crimson shute, and about eight ounces of green—when I left home I left no one in the house—I double-locked my door—I returned about a quarter past 12 at night—as soon as I placed the key in the door, and gave it one turn, the door flew open—it was only single-locked then, not double-locked—I instantly got a light, and perceived my door had been broken open—I went up stairs, and found my work cut out and gone, and the breast roll standing about a yard from the loom—I missed seven ounces of crimson shute on ten bobbins, and about eight ounces of green shute taken off a machine—the value of the silk in the loom was about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the amount of the fifteen ounces of shute was about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not see any of my property again till 3rd June, at Worship-street—I did not see all I had lost, only the ready-made work out of the loom—this is it—I do not know either of the prisoners.</p>

On Wednesday, 2nd June, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the middle of the ware-house, and May came in, and said he had some silk for sale—it was wrapped up in a pocket handkerchief—I told him we did not want any—he wished me to purchase it—my father and brother were in the counting-house, having their tea—I told him I should not disturb them—he begged me to do so—I went in and asked them, and they declined it—May kept on begging me to purchase it—I asked him the price—he said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—I said no, I would not purchase it—he said I might have it at my own price—(the value of it was about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard)—I told him we were not in the habit of purchasing of strangers over the counter in the state that was in—in proof of his respec<lb></lb>tability, he referred me to Bull and Wilson, in St. Martin's-lane, and some other persons, whom I do not know—I know Bull and Wilson—he said that we had purchased before of his brother—I asked him who his brother was—he said, Mr. May—we knew his brother very well, and had purchased of him—I still declined to purchase, and he went away—in consequence of something passing in my mind, I directed my brother to follow him—the silk was displayed—it was for curtains or blinds for carriages—that was the only goods I saw.</p>

RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know silk from velret? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes! it was silk that Wallis brought—when he first came he said it was velvet—that was before it was opened—I said it was silk, and told him he said it was velvet—he said, "Did I?"—it was crimson colour, like this sort (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the braid was all manner of colours—there was some green, and some Adelaide, and some drab—I cannot say whether there was any crimson—I do not think his hat was quite full.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in the prisoner May's house—I remember Wallis coming on Whit-Monday, 2nd June, about 9 o'clock in the morning—he brought the silk about 1 o'clock—Mr. May's daughter opened the door to him—he said he wanted to see her father—she went up stairs to her father, and he told her to ask him in—he went up stairs—I do not know what took place—I saw a parcel tied in a handkerchief, but what was in it I do not know—I was on the stairs, and saw the two prisoners leave together—Wallis had called twice on that day before he brought the parcel.</p>

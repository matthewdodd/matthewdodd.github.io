             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I live in the same court, at the back of the Jolly Weavers.</p>
               <p>Q. On Sunday night the 13th of July, in consequence of any thing that Mrs. Richards said, did you go to the prisoner's lodgings. - A. I did, towards eleven or twelve o'clock, Mrs. Richards and me together examined a closet in her room, the prisoner was in the room at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she awake or asleep. - A. She was very soon asleep after we came in; we saw on the right<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170035"></xptr>hand side of the cupboard there lay some dirty clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the clothes in such a condition that you suspected there had been a child. - A. Yes, upon that we sent for a midwife, she came and saw these things; after the midwife had looked at them, I awaked the prisoner, I said Hannah awake, she made some reply, but what she said I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. When she awoke in what state did she appear to be. - A. She appeared as if she had been drinking, I fancy in the course of the evening she had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to have been drinking, so as not to be able to understand your questions. - A. She did; I asked her where the child was, she replied she had had no child; I said to her Hannah you lay in an indecent posture, get up and have your bed made, she said she would not get up, her bed did not want making, I said you must get up your bed does want making, and another thing, I know there must be a child about; I told her if she would not get off the bed by fair means we must take her off; the midwife took hold of one arm and I took hold of the other, we got her off the bed, and sat her on a chair, there were two or three more people in the room, they lit a candle, I took the bed, and began to throw what I thought was the bed from the head to the foot.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that that you thought was the bed. A. It was something in a sack, I saw nothing then, I took the other that lay against the ground, and the last thing that I took off the ground I saw something lay all of a heap, it lay upon that part of the bed where her arms and her head was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find that matter to be. - A. Why a child.</p>
               <p>Q. Alive or dead. - A. Dead, it was wrapped up in a piece of coarse flannel.</p>
               <p>Q. But what was laying upon it at the time that she was laying her head and arms upon it. - A. Nothing but these two sacks that were stuffed with something, it lay under them two sacks, it was completely covered.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it sewed up in a cloth. - A. No, it was folded up in a cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that cloth wet or dry. - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any water about in her room. - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at her person. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had children yourself. - A. Sixteen.</p>
               <p>Q. In your opinion had she lately been delivered of a child. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a boy or a girl. - A. A female.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing about the child, how it was born. - A. She told me on the following day that it was born on a Saturday; that night I shewed her the child, she said she had no child, it was not her's.</p>
               <p>Q. But the next day she told you that she was delivered of a Saturday. - A. Yes, she told me it was by a married man, which was the reason of her denying it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at all suspected before that that she was with child. - A. O yes, she lived in the neighbourhood some time, and I have suspected is many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any baby linen in the room. - A. No, I found no one thing; we searched first for the child, and then we searched for them.</p>
               <p>Court. When you awoke this woman she appeared to have been in liquor. - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. After she had awaked herself, then she said she had no child, then she understood your question. A. She seemingly to me was very much overcome in liquor as she lay asleep, I then roused her and awakened her, and then I did not think she was so much in liquor as I thought she was, I shook her and asked her what she had done with the child, she said that she had no child, I said I was sure that she had.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker by business—I now live at 10, Grafton-place, Euston-square—in the beginning of February last, I was residing at Church-street, Soho—there is a public-house in Richmond-street, Soho, called the Three Crowns—it is a house-of-call for bakers—I was in the habit of going there occasionally—in the early part of February I met the prisoner Bramwell there—I never knew him before that—an intimacy sprang up between us; we used to drink and play dominoes together—after knowing him a short time, a conversation took place between us on the</p>

               <p>subject of cheques—he asked me If I would nave any objection to present a cheque that was <hi rend="italic">on the cross;</hi> that everything should be made right to prove my innocence, if the forgery was detected; that they would advertise for a baker, so that I should have a letter to prove that I was engaged; that I should have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my share; that I should take the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold for my share, and the rest bring in notes, because they could easily dispose of these notes by getting foreign money, and so change them about, and we could meet in the evening after it was all over and enjoy ourselves—I said I would give him an answer to-morrow—this was on the last Sunday evening in February—I don't remember anything else that occurred at that time—on the Monday morning I went to the Vine-street Police-station, and placed myself in communication with Inspector Webb, and from that day I acted under his cognisance, and with his knowledge—on the same day, the Monday, after seeing the inspector, I went to the Three Crowns public-house, somewhere about 12 o'clock in the day—I saw Bramwell there—we went for a walk—he asked me, was I prepared?—I said, yes; I was—he said, "I do not know in which paper the advertisement will appear, but I will bring it to you at the Three Crowns in the morning"—he said he would put it in that day—he said they could have first-class apartments for me to apply to—he said that he had presented cheques, but that he had been stopped, and that he could not go again—up to this time I knew Bramwell by the name of Brown—an appointment was made between us to meet at the Three Crowns the following morning—I went, but he did not come—I next saw him on the following Saturday evening—I told him that I had been expecting him on the Tuesday, and every day after—he said, "We have been too busy, and were not prepared; you shall advertise, and I will bring you the money to-morrow night"—he did not come the next night according to his appoint<lb></lb>ment—I saw him again on the following Saturday (that was a week after), at the Three Crowns—I did not speak to him on that occasion; I saw him there, but had no conversation with him—I did not see him all the next week until Monday, 21st March, that was at the end of Grafton-place, Euston-square—I had heard of him on the Sunday previous, and had an appointment to meet him at Swinton-street, but I did not see him there—a man named Lambourne, at the Three Crowns, gave me a message; that was on the 20th—in consequence of that, I went to my late lodgings in Church-street—the landlady told me that some one had been there, which I had no doubt was Bramwell—I then went to Swinton-street; that was not in consequence of what she told me, but of what I heard from my present landlady—Bramwell was not at Swinton-street—it was about 11 o'clock in the day that I got there—I went back home, and he was there waiting—he said, "Meet me at Swinton-street, at two o'clock" I did so, and we went into a beer shop kept by one Hammond—he pro<lb></lb>duced this piece of paper to me at that time (<hi rend="italic">read,</hi> "Wanted, by a respectable married man, a situation as light porter, or messenger, at a first-class-house. George Watkins, 10, Graft on street, Euston-square"—he desired me to take a copy of that in my own hand-writing—I did so, and gave it to him; the other I kept—he kept me there from 2 to 3 o'clock, with the pretence that he was waiting for some one to bring the money for the advertisement—while I was waiting there, some gentleman came in and had a glass of beer, and went out again—I did not observe whether he took any particular notice of me—I was in such a position that he could see me—not above two or three minutes after he had left, Bramwell said, "Now we will go"—we walked together a short distance, and then parted—an</p>

               <p>appointment was made to meet at the same place, Swinton-street, if I re<lb></lb>member right, at 11 o'clock next day—I went there, but he did not come—I went home, and soon afterwards received this letter; it came by the two o'clock post, and contained this card (<hi rend="italic">read,</hi> "To G. W., 10, Grafton-place, Euston-square. 22d March, 1859. Cottage-place.—Sir,—If you apply to the address given on the enclosed card, you probably may hear of something to your advantage. William Wyatt." (<hi rend="italic">Card read,</hi> "C.H. Yarston, 2, Cottage-place, City-road"—up to that time I was not aware that the advertisement had appeared—about ten minutes after receiving that letter, Bramwell called upon me—he handed me the receipt for this advertisement in the Daily Telegraph—I believe I afterwards offered that receipt to Joy, he said it was of no use, and I think it got lost—it was a receipt for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for an insertion in the Daily Telegraph—this is the adver<lb></lb>tisement (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I showed Bramwell the letter and the card which I had just received—I told him I had received it by post—he said he could not tell me whether it came from their party or not; but, if he was me, he would go and see; it might be a journeyman's situation—he then said, "You remember that gentleman that came in just before we left on Saturday?"—I said I did remember some gentleman coming in, but I did not take any notice of him—Bramwell was at the time rather the worse for liquor—he said he had kept me there on purpose for that gentle-man to see me—he said, "You were not punctual to your appointment," or something to that effect—I said, "How do you know I was not there"—he said, "If I was not there, some one else was"—I think what he said to me was, "Who was that man you spoke to/' and I said, "How do you know I spoke to a man"—he did on one occasion say that I was not punc<lb></lb>tual, but I don't think it was on this occasion, I cannot be positive—I know on one occasion he said, "To show you I was there, I saw two bakers talking together at the end of Swinton-street;" and on another occasion he said, "Who was that man you spoke to;"—I don't exactly remember upon which occasion either of these conversations occurred—he made an appoint<lb></lb>ment to meet me at 5 o'clock on Tuesday evening at the corner of Swinton-street—I kept the appointment, but he did not—I went to the Three Crowns that same evening—the potman there made some communication to me, in consequence of which I went at 8 o'clock that evening to Red Lion-street, Holborn, and met Bramwell there in the street at the corner of Red Lion-street, Holborn; I found him standing there—we had been standing a quarter of an hour I should say, when he said, "Come and stand here," meaning on the kerb, "they have arrived; take no notice of any one"—the next minute I saw some one taking great notice of me; after he had walked backwards and forwards on the opposite side of the way, Bramwell and I stood back by the public-house, and that person passed backwards and forwards close to me, on the pavement between me and other persons—that was the prisoner Humphreys—after that the prisoner Foster came and shook hands with Bramwell, and Bramwell introduced him to me—he said, "Mr. Watkins, a friend of mine"—Foster then said to Bramwell, "You can go now, be back in an hour; you had better sleep at my house to-night"—I then saw Foster go across the road and shake hands, or rather was in com<lb></lb>munication with Humphreys—Bramwell observed me looking at them, and he said, "Don't look that way, look the other way"—Bramwell then left, and Foster took me up Red Lion-street—Foster said, "Now I am a very particular man; I do not allow a second person to know my business; and if you go into this affair with me you must be as strict"—he took me into a</p>

               <p>public-house at the corner of Bed Lion-court—I did not see any more of Humphreys; we remained there somewhere about half an hour—while there I showed him the card I had received by post in the envelope—I said, "I have received this letter and card; is it from your party?"—he said, "I cannot say; I don't know"—he then left, leaving me in the public-house; he took the card away with him; he returned in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, gave me the card, and said, "It is not from our party; we have posted a letter for you; you will receive it in the morning"—while I was in the public-house with him, persons came and pushed the door a little way open and looked in, that occurred more than once while I was there; it was a very small box that I was in, a person putting his head in in that way would have an opportunity of seeing me directly—I noticed this done several times, and Foster said, "You must excuse our people, they are naturally mistrustful lest I should be engaging a wrong man"—Foster went out again and returned in a few minutes, and said, "You are to do this little affair to-morrow"—this was on Tuesday, 22d March—he then made an appointment for me at a quarter-past 10 next morning at the Orange Tree, New-road; he said, "If you have not received the letter in the morning, come at the appointed time, you can easily go back for that"—we parted at night; after that I made a communication that same night to Serjeant Joy—Next morning, 23d March, I received a letter by post before I left my lodgings; this is the envelope of it it is directed "G. W., 10 Grafton-place, Euston-road"—I took the envelope, and the letter that was in it, to the Orange Tree—I there met Bram well; I first saw him outside the house, and went in with him—Foster arrived about a quarter of an hour after<lb></lb>wards; he asked me if I had received the letter—I said I had, and showed it him—he took the letter out, and gave the envelope back to me—he kept the letter.—(<hi rend="italic">William Base, clerk to Messrs. Mullens, the solicitors for the pro<lb></lb>secution, proved the service of a notice upon all the prisoners, in Newgate, on Saturday last, to produce, amongst other documents, the letter in question.</hi>)—The letter stated "If G. W. will meet Mr. Curtis at the Boar and Castle, Oxford-street, at 11 o'clock this day; he will probably hear of a situation that will suit him"—Foster said, "I shall not be ready for half an hour, what will you do?"—I said, "I will go for a walk for half an hour"—I was to be back at 11 o'clock at the Orange Tree; I was so—Foster came there; Bramwell was there all the time, before I went out and when I returned—Foster came in directly after me; he gave me a letter to put in the envelope—this is it; it was not the letter I handed to him originally (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Tues<lb></lb>day evening, March 22d, 1859—If G. W. will call on Mr. Curtis to-morrow morning at 11 o'clock or a little before, at the University Hotel, Grafton-street, he will very likely hear of a situation to suit him, provided G.W.s references are satisfactory"—When Foster gave me that, I read it, and said, "Yes"—Bramwell was present—Foster said, "Come on, are you ready—I said, "Yes"—Bramwell was present when he said that—Foster and I then started, and came from the Orange Tree up Gower-street; we left Bramwell there—as we were going along Gower-street Foster said, "Now, my boy, I feel confident we shall bring this off, and when I do, it generally comes off right"—when we got to the University Hotel Foster said, "Go in, and ask for Mr. Curtis"—he remained outside—I went into the coffee-room, and saw a gentleman sitting in one of the boxes; he had a black coat on, his hat was on, and he had a black bandage about his head tied under the chin, it came down on both sides of the face—it was very similar to this (<hi rend="italic">looking at a piece of black serge produced by Funnell the officer</hi>)—he wore it in this way (the</p>

Smith's house—it was a very busy time, both the barman and the landlord were very busy; it was supper-time, and it was in the jug department—I saw the landlord; I am not sure whether it was he or the barman that waited upon us; it was one or the other I believe—there was an elderly gentleman and a stout lady there—I had two pennyworth of gin and water—I had it standing at the bar—we were there about half an</p>

At the Orange Tree I did not see the land-lord; I saw his brother; he is barman there—I have known him several years—he supplied us with part of the beer there—I could not recognise any one else who served us—I saw several people there—I have not been in a position to take a situation since I have been employed by the police—my wife earns a little money at a laundry—she has a friend close by that she can go to sometimes three days in a week; a boarding-house, kept by her sister, where she can get anything that is necessary—I don't know what they pay her—I have received some money since this has been going on; two sovereigns and a half during the whole time; and on one occasion I was in attendance nearly the whole of the day, and the clerk gave me two shillings to get refreshment—I have had nothing besides money—I was dressed as I am now when I first went to Bramwell, unless I had on my working clothes; this has been my best suit for months, I had them new when I went to Mr. Miller's—I was living in the front kitchen in Church-street, Soho—I bad been some time in Grafton-place when I communicated with the police; I had one room on the second floor there—I am there still; I moved there before I received anything from the police—I think I had communicated with them—I never received any promise from them—I was at Mr. Mullen's office when Bateman was brought there—I have been there several times; it might be a dozen, I should not think it was more—the money I have mentioned is all I have received from any one.</p>

Coutts' with the forged cheque or bill—I could not at that time say what cause it was that induced him to speak to me—it was not looking at the account of Chandler's case in the newspaper that first led to the conversation about forgeries—he spoke to me about a case that was remanded at Bow-street, I believe, from Tuesday to Tues<lb></lb>day—I did not know what case it was at the time—he did not refer to the report of Chandler's case—he spoke of a case, showing that he was not afraid to go to a police-court, although he had been stopped—he did not say, that seeing Chandler's case remanded, he would go down to see if he was the man that had given him the forged cheque—I do not believe that it was then that I told him I had been unfortunate enough to present a forged cheque—I believe no such conversation occurred; I have no recollection of it; I will swear no such conversation occurred—what I have told you was the way in which he spoke of the case—he said he was determined to go, and he would go to hear a case that was remanded on the Tuesday—he never told me whether it was or was not</p>

               <p>the person who had entrapped him in presenting a forged cheque, or any thing of the kind—the conversation about his putting on a bold face and appearing at this case that was remanded, occurred after I had spoken of presenting the cheque or bill—I mentioned it in the public tap-room, not in any private conversation with Bramwell—it was at the end of three weeks that he made the proposal to me—he told me at once that he wanted me to present a cheque <hi rend="italic">on the cross</hi>—I thought it was not very straightforward—I knew the meaning of the words "on the cross;" he must be a very ignorant man that does not know that; I am not quite so ignorant as that—he said that everything should be done to show my innocence; it was all said at once; I don't say that he kept on <hi rend="italic">spirting</hi> it out straight on—when he asked me if I would present a cheque <hi rend="italic">on the cross,</hi> he explained it, and I said I would give him Ian answer to-morrow—I might have said something as he went on—I might have answered him various questions; I don't remember, I allowed him to have it all his own way—I have stated as nearly as possible what he said—very probably I do not remember all he said—he suggested the advertising for a baker—he said the amount of the cheque would be a good one, and I was to have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the conversation about the advertisement occurred at Hammond's—I don't know why he got me to copy it, and left the original in my possession—I did not ask him to write an advertisement for me for a porter's place—he said he should do it; I did not ask him—he did not ask why I wanted a porter's place—I might have told him I was tired of night work, because I really am—I never wished him to Write air advertisement for me—I deny it on my oath—I took very good care not to lose the adver<lb></lb>tisement that he wrote; he turned out of the door, leaving this on the counter, and I picked it up, and put it in my pocket, I thought it would be useful—I gave him the one I wrote—I never could see any object in having it copied—there was some conversation respecting whether it should be in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Advertiser,</hi> he never spoke of the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>—I was not well acquainted with the Orange Tree—T knew the landlord's brother when he was in a different line of business—I do not know that I was ever in the Orange Tree before that time, I might have been; I don't remember I had never been there with Bramwell previous to Wednesday, the 23d—Foster made the appointment at that house—I don't think I made it with Bramwell—I don't recollect seeing Bramwell after the appointment was made by Foster, until I met him there—I have never borrowed money from Bramwell; I have no recollection of ever borrowing a farthing of him—I will swear I have not—I will swear positively that he did not go to my lodging on the Sunday evening to get back five shillings that he had lent me—he never lent me five shillings while we were playing at skittles—I have played at skittles; not a great deal, not for money; perhaps I have played at domi<lb></lb>noes for a penny or twopence—I never won money from Bramwell at dominoes; I think I gave him up best—I mean he was a better player than I—I never played him at skittles—I am really married—my wife is a laun<lb></lb>dress—she washes for Nos. 2 and 3, Euston-square, which are lodging-houses, and a few journeyman bakers—she washes at 10, Grafton-place—she has the use of the wash-house.</p>

I am waiter at the Three Crowns in Richmond-street, Soho—I know Bramwell—he has been in the habit of frequenting the Three Crowns many times; I can answer for within the last four months—I have known Watkins six or seven years—he was in the habit of coming to the Three Crowns in the early part of this year—I have seen him and Bramwell there at the same time, and in conversation together—in my occupation I might not have noticed it particularly; but I have seen them on several occasions talking together and in company—on Tuesday evening, 22d March, I remember Bramwell calling and asking if Watkins had been there—I said he had not—he told me if he came to tell him that he had made the appointment to meet him at the corner of Red Lion-street at 8 o'clock that evening, to the minute—I told him there were two ends to Red Lion-street, the Theobald's-road end, and the Holborn, and he said it was the Holborn end—he called again a second time that same evening before I saw Watkins, and left the same message—I subsequently saw Wat<lb></lb>kins before 8 o'clock, and gave him the message.</p>

Adams."—he came again after that, after Foster was locked up—I will not be positive when it was—it was the next day, or the day after—he asked for Watkins as usual.</p>

On 23d March last I was in the New-road, near the Orange Tree—I saw Watkins there—I was there for the purpose of observing what passed—I saw him when he first came up—he was alone—I next saw Bramwell—he and Watkins went into the Orange Tree—I did not hear what they said—they spoke together before they went in—in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour Watkins came out, and went away alone—I watched him home to Grafton-place—I went again to the Orange Tree at 11 o'clock—I saw Watkins go into the house—a few minutes afterwards I saw Foster and Watkins come out together—they went down Grower-street, towards the University hotel—when they got near there Foster pointed towards the hotel—Watkins then went on by himself, and went into the hotel—he was there about a minute and a half—he then came out again—I did not see any one follow him out—Foster was outside, a little way from the hotel—he did not go in at all—they went away together—when I was at the Orange Tree, before they went towards the University Hotel, I saw the prisoner Humphreys—he came out of the Orange Tree with another man—I cannot tell who that man was, he is not present—they followed in the same direction that Watkins and Foster went—they went down Grafton-street and University-street into Tottenham-court-road—they waited outside the University hotel until Watkins came out, and then they followed after Watkins and Foster—I noticed them as far as the corner of London-street, Tottenham-court-road, and then I lost sight of them—they were both together, arm in arm—I then continued to follow and watch Watkins and Foster—I saw some paper in Watkins' hand in Grafton-street—he handed it to Foster—I then got into a shop, and I saw that it was the same colour as the cheque that I afterwards found at the bank—there was writing on it—Foster kept it, walked on a few steps, and then he returned it again—it was a piece of paper about the size of this cheque, and it had the same stamp apparently as this represents—I was in a shop when I saw it—by the stamp, I mean this mark in the corner where the pounds are, the letter "L"—I was looking through the window of the shop, and they were close to the window, standing talking together—Foster had it entirely in his own hands for about half a minute—I saw him examine it and return it—he did not return it while they were stand<lb></lb>ing there—they walked on—I followed them to the Union Bank, Argyll-place—Foster remained outside, and Watkins went in—he was inside, I should say, for five or six minutes—I was looking at Foster—he was walk<lb></lb>ing backwards and forwards in front of the bank, looking in that direction—at last he appeared to be very uneasy, and walked away very rapidly towards Great-Marlborough-street—finding that he was was going away, I followed him, and took him into custody—I brought him back to the Union bank—Watkins was there—I asked Foster if he knew Watkins—he said "No"—I said, "Are you certain?"—he said, "No, I never saw him in my life"—I told him he must consider himself in custody for the cheque, and that I had seen him in company with Watkins in the New-road—he said, "No, I have not been in the New-road, and I don't know</p>

               <p>forgery, I believe you to be the most proper persons to write to, as I wish to make very useful propositions for the benefit of bankers. The accounts in the newspapers every week sufficiently show, that by all care the bank<lb></lb>ers lose large sums, which, in the course of a year, must necessarily amount to something considerable. Being confident that I am introduce to the bankers, without additional labour or expense, a simple contrivance to reduce forgery on them at least 90 per cent., I beg to ask you, gentlemen, if you will be good enough to communicate with the bankers, and to make them my offer. Further, I beg to say that as I am (to say the least of it) a marked man, whom the police would never allow to earn in London, or even Eng<lb></lb>land, an honest living—although I and in no fear whatever to be mixed up with any forgery, as I have never forged—never sent anybody with a forgery—never presented any forgery for payment—never changed the produce of a forgery, &amp;c., since my liberation in 1856. I wish to leave England with my family forever, provided I can get a handsome remune<lb></lb>ration for my secret. Besides, as no doubt you wish to get at the fountain head; that is to say, you wish to know who manufacture nearly all forgeries on bankers within the last fifteen years, I am willing to give such informa<lb></lb>tion, and assist you in every possible way to lay hold of a whole gang, whose intentions are to commit a good many more forgeries, and who are able to do so, &amp;c.; but only on certain conditions. The conditions are:—Firstly.—My name must not transpire in any way whatever, as such would spoil my services in toto. Secondly.—Myself, as well as my brother-in-law (Mr. Bateman), must receive a guarantee in writing not to be mixed up or prosecuted for anything that may transpire by such information; and <hi rend="italic">Thirdly.</hi>—I want 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (a small percentage on the sums yearly lost) for my secret and full information. If my offer and conditions should be considered by you worthy of acceptance, an answer directed to me under the above mentioned direction and marked "private," would, in the course of the week, be forwarded to me, when, without any delay, I shall arrange everything to your satisfaction through my solicitor.—I am, Gentlemen, your most obedient and most humble servant, W. Wagner." It was six weeks after receiving that letter that I saw Wagner, after he was in custody—I received that letter in February; I did not answer it; I took no notice of it whatever—when he was in custody I received a message requesting me to go to the Vine-street station—I went there, and went into the large room that has been spoken of, where he was walking about—he addressed me by name, and asked me if it was not better worth my while to avail myself of his services than to prosecute him—I said that under the circumstances, which were known to both of us, it was quite impossible that I could listen to any such request—he said that I had formed a prejudice against him; that he could assure me he had nothing to do with any forgeries whatever—I said it was very well for him to say so, but how could he give me the information he had promised if he were not connected with them in some way—he said he might very well know about it; but whatever he had done, he had done nothing that the law could lay hold of—I said, "It is no use your talking to me in that way; why did you run away when Chandler was taken into custody?—you left York-buildings on that morning, and have never been back since"—he said, "I did not wish my name to be mixed up with Chandler; he was only my clerk"—I said I did not think if my clerk had committed a forgery, that I should run away unless I was mixed up with it—he said he thought it better to go away—he then asked me again if I would avail myself of his services instead of prose<lb></lb>cuting</p>

                  </hi>. I am now in custody in Newgate—I pleaded guilty at the last session to several charges of forgery—I know the prisoner Wagner—I became acquainted with him about May or June, 1857—I was very poorly off at that time—I was introduced to him for the purpose of discounting a bill—he was represented to me as a person who discounted; that was my first introduction to him—I explained to him what I wanted,—he took the particulars, and that interview ended without anything being done—I did not get the bill discounted; I saw him soon after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Shortly after that, in the summer of 1857, was there any other trans<lb></lb>action in which you and Wagner were both engaged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first trans<lb></lb>action with Wagner was some forgery in the city; I think on the Union Bank, in Princes'-street—I do not think that was Mr. Aitkins' cheque—I recollect this cheque perfectly well (<hi rend="italic">looking at one for</hi> 375<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated 11th Sept.</hi> 1858)—I got that from Wagner: I did not get it cashed—there were several forged before that—I recollect Mr. Aitkins' cheque perfectly well; it was given to me by Wagner—an arrangement was made that some man should be sent for the money—Humphreys was to find a man to go with the cheque; that was arranged between Wagner, myself and Humphreys; and to protect that man from any difficulty, he was to advertise for a situation, and it was arranged that I should answer the advertisement, and meet him at some hotel—I do not know that man—I should know him again—there was a man whom I met, it was on the day following this arrangement; he put in an advertisement, and I met him the following day in St. Martin's-court, in the neighbourhood of Leicester-square, at the Crown coffee-house, I think it was—I gave that man the cheque and started him into the city—Bateman and Wagner followed, watching my movements with this man—I went into the city to meet Humphreys in Monument-yard—I did meet him, and Wagner and Bateman came presently and told Humphreys that the man had re<lb></lb>ceived the money—Humphreys then went to the place appointed, where he had previously arranged to meet that man, and received a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I know it by the name at the back, in my handwriting—this note was taken into the Bank of England by myself first, for the purpose of getting it changed, but I saw some one there that I knew, and I did not get it changed, I returned it to Wagner; he gave it to Bateman, and Bate<lb></lb>man went into the Bank of England and got it changed—by Wagner's direc<lb></lb>tion I afterwards went to Spielman's, the moneychanger's, in Lombard-street, with part of the proceeds of that note in notes, and I received foreign money for them, part gold and part notes; part of that foreign money was a 1000 franc note—I gave the whole of the money to Wagner, and he gave the notes to Bateman, who went to Smart's, in Leicester-square, and received a cheque for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a copy of this cheque was taken by Bate-man; myself and Wagner were present at the time—it was taken by Wagner's direction and the consent of all parties, in fact; it was taken by the arrange<lb></lb>ment of us all, I mean Wagner, myself, and Bateman—Bateman made the copy—before this Wagner had said, he knew Smart to be a man of property, but he did not know exactly where he banked—the copy was taken on tracing-paper—shortly afterwards a blank form of cheque was taken by Humphreys on Drummond's, it was a printed form; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at that time no stamp was impressed upon it; we had ascertained that stamps were in general use at this time—we made no particular inquiries about Messrs. Drummonds using stamped forms of cheques, it was generally known at that time—Smart's cheque had the stamp on, and we knew it was generally the case—when this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090071"></xptr>
               <p>cheque was prepared ready for filling up, a stamp was made for the purpose—I mean a die to make a stamp for the purpose of using the cheque—that was agreed amongst ourselves,—the stamp was afterwards impressed on this cheque by that die—the body of the cheque was filled up by Bateman, as it now is, leaving out the date until it was agreed to be used—the word January was pat to it, but not the day of the month—it was filled up in the presence of Wagner and myself, by Bateman—Bateman said, in Wagner's presence, that he knew a man of the name of Jones who would find a man to go for the money—after two or three interviews with Jones, he proposed a man of the name of Bramwell, who would fetch the money—Jones came down; I saw him at York-buildings, Wagner's house; I and Bateman and Wagner were present—Jones said that Bramwell was taking care of an empty house, somewhere in the neighbourhood of Soho, and that the house was to be let upon the terms that whoever took it was to pay 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, and to protect Bramwell from any difficulty—it was proposed that a letter should be written to him as if from some one who had seen the house and liked it, and would take it—I saw the letter written by Bateman; this is it; it was sent by post (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>),—"January 19th, 1859. To Mr. Bramwell Sir, I saw your wife this day about the house, but cannot call to-morrow as intended. I shall not fail to see you on Friday morning; I hardly see what 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit is required for. Yours, G. Wilson."—It was afterwards proposed that another letter should be Written—Jones proposed it—it was written in Wagner and Bateman's presence, at York-buildings—that letter was making it appear that the cheque was in. closed in it,—both these letters were put into the post; I posted one; they were not put in at the same time—I can hardly say how soon after the first the second was posted—I don't recollect;—this is it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>), "January 20th, 1859. To Mr. Bramwell. Dear sir, I beg to inclose you a cheque for 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which you will oblige by getting cashed, deducting your 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the house, and I will call early in the morning for the remainder. Yours, G. Wilson,"—That letter purports to contain the cheque, but it did not in fact contain it—the cheque was given to Jones, the date was first put on it, the 20th January, that is the same date as the second letter that was written; that was done at York-buildings—Jones was to give the cheque to Bramwell to send him with it for the money, and it was arranged that, on the road from Bramwell's house to Drummond's, he should come through Trafalgar-square, past the Nelson column, in order that Wagner and Bateman might see Bramwell and watch his movements at Drummond's—next morning, 21st, I went to York-buildings (I was daily there), Wagner and Bateman were out when I got there; they came in to the best of my recollection about 12 o'clock—Jones came back first to York-buildings; he made some communication to me—when Wagner and Bateman came in they entered into conversation, and Jones told them that Bramwell had not received the money, that he was given into custody, or rather that an officer had gone with Bramwell to the house—a good deal of conversation took place between Jones, Bateman, Wagner, and myself; and Wagner would not believe but what the man had the money—he said he believed that Jones and Bramwell were putting their heads together to rob him of the money—he said that in the presence of Jones, Bateman, and myself; and he at last proposed that he and Bateman should go and look over the house in Soho that Bramwell was taking care of, to see if there really was an officer there or not; and they went from York-buildings for the purpose of going to Bramwell's house—they were absent nearly two hours—when they returned Bateman was smoking a cigar—he said that he had been</p>

               <p>over the house and there really was a man there who they presumed to be an officer; that he was smoking a pipe; and Bateman laughed and said, "Well, let him bean officer or not I have lighted my cigar from his pipe"—a female, named Fairbairn, was living in York-buildings at that time—I remember some time ago a forged order being prepared to get a pass book of Mr. Feetum's—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the order; it was prepared by a man of the name of Kerp—it is upon the Union-bank, Argyll-place—I cannot say whether Kerp brought it to York-buildings—I saw him give it to Wagner—Wagner gave it to me, and wished me to send some boy for the book—I sent a boy; he and I went up into the neighbourhood of the bank; Wagner followed the boy to see whether he really got the book or not—he stood outside the bank; I stopped at an appointed place which Wagner and I had arranged, I think it was in King's-street opposite the bank, looking down into Beak-street at the back of Regent-street—Wagner came to me there in a short time, and told me that a clerk had come out of the bank with the boy—I had stopped at my appointed place; I had employed the boy, and I was to receive the book from the boy, but upon this Wagner and I walked away, and nothing further took place—Kerp lived in John-street, Fitzroy-square, at the house of a Mrs. Skelton—that was not the only occasion upon which Kerp's services were used—his services were used repeatedly by Wagner; Wagner employed him—Mr. Aitkin's cheque was prepared by Kerp, it was the one actually used—Mr. Aitkin's signature was obtained in this way, two letters were brought to Wagner by Humphreys, written by Mr. Aitkin with reference to some hounds, and in that way we got the signature—I remember a cheque being prepared of a person named Chambers—Kerp prepared the original one in that case; it was a check for 440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Drummond's—the one that Kerp pre<lb></lb>pared was not the one that was actually used, for Wagner had had some quarrel with Kerp about something or other, and he wished to defraud him of his share of the cheque, and he proposed that Bateman and I should try if we could take a copy of the forged cheque which Kerp had prepared—Bateman and I accordingly made several copies, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them, and it was upon this that the money was obtained; this was written by me—Wagner considered it the best; it was an exact copy—the words, lf No effects," were written upon Kerp's cheque, and it was given back to him—Wagner had several interviews with Kerp about it, at his house, I believe; but I was not present—Wagner told me that he had returned the cheque—he was constantly at Kerp's lodging, ever since I have known him—I knew that Kerp had a place of concealment for articles of this character; it was the bottom of a slop-pail; it was an ordinary slop-pail, but the bottom of it unscrewed; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was kept in actual use as a slop-pail in Kerp's lodging; I have seen Wagner open it at Kerp's lodging—there was also a rolling-pin, which was used as a place of concealment, at Wagner's house; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>),—it unscrews—the cheques were wound round it—it was kept in actual use at Wagner's house (<hi rend="italic">the witness here unscrewed both the articles</hi>)—last summer some wire blinds were put up at the house, 10, York-buildings, Adelphi, and upon them was "Bateman &amp; Co., Law, Parliamentary, and General Stationers;" and at the bottom, the word, "Agents, etc."—a little law-stationery business was carried on there, and also as money agents, dis<lb></lb>counting bills—I was there constantly since October last, and also Bateman and Wagner—I only went there in October, 1858; I continued to be in attendance there until I was taken into custody on the 1st February last.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there some gentleman connected with the department who makes the dies? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have an engraver—there would be no difficulty in having him here—I have the custody of the dies—my reason for saying this is not genuine is, that it is so exceedingly faint and indefinite, that I have great difficulty in comparing it—I have brought impressions of Government stamps to compare with it—I have examined it with a magnifier, and compared it with other stamps; but it is so exceedingly faint and indefinite—I believe we never sent a stamp out of the office in so imperfect a state as that—I have the strongest possible belief on the subject—I superintend the making of the impressions—we make something like 400,000 per day—I do not stand by and see every one made, but I have a general superintendence—I am prepared to express my strongest belief that it never could have been issued in that state, because we take such precau<lb></lb>tions, and have them so rigorously examined, that I think the thing is im<lb></lb>possible, this is so widely different from anything we ever sent out—some are struck by band with a fly press, and some by a steam-engine.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you detect any other inaccuracy in the impression. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My examination gives rather negative results; I do not find things there that ought to be there, if genuine; but, being so faint, it confuses me—I have never observed the effect of damp upon these stamps.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>) I went to Humphrey's house, and went up-stairs to a back room, where, amongst other things, I found this die—Hum<lb></lb>phreys seized it, and we seized Humphreys, and took it from his hand—it was on the table, Humphreys sprang from us and seized it, and I and Funnell then put him against the wall and took it from his left hand—he said, "It is no use now; I will be quiet"—I told him it was no use to resist—I have also some impressions which I found in a drawer of a chest of drawers in Humphreys' bedroom—they are impressions from this die.</p>

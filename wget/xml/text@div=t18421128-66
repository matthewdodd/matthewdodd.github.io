                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Thomas Lowe, a screw-manufacturer, at Birmingham. On the 14th of Nov. I made up a brown paper parcel, of twenty-one gross of brass screws, and a quantity of iron ones, and directed it to "Mr. Lowther, cabinet-maker, Clerkenwell, London"—I generally put the word "Paid" on parcels, but I cannot say that I did on this—I gave it to Crowley and Co., the Birmingham carriers, who would in due course convey it by railway to London, where it should arrive the same evening—a letter was sent by post before to announce that they were forwarded—the screws were in small parcels, with a sample screw outside each gross—it made one parcel.</p>

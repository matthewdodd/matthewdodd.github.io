               <p>Q. Had he any stick, or arms in his hand?</p>
               <p>Woodman. I can't say. I said it was no business of his to stop me on the highway; he fell a rumaging of me, and asked what I had got in my pocket; he took my pocket from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What besides?</p>
               <p>Woodman. A pocket handkerchief, a knife, and about 2 s. in money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he give you every thing back but the tea?</p>
               <p>Woodman. No; I ask'd him for my money; he said no; I might keep what I had, and he would keep what he had, and went away, I have never had them again. On the Tuesday following I was offered them again at Justice Sherwood's.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't imagine this man intended to rob you, do you?</p>
               <p>Woodman. I can't tell.</p>

               <p>Woodman. I can't tell; I paid for it.</p>
               <p>On her cross examination she said she had bought the tea and half a dozen china on board a ship; that she did not know the prisoner was a custom-house officer; that when he stopt her he asked her what was in her handkerchief; that he did not call her back and offer her the money again; and that she did not say to him, now you dog that is what I wanted, that is a highway robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I live near Soho-square—on Good Friday I was on Blackheath; I was at the back of a crowd, I felt a tug at my waistcoat, and found my watch was gone—I turned and saw the prisoner near me; he saw me looking at him, and he ran away—I followed him and cried, "Stop thief;" and he threw the watch in some grass, a young man picked it up and gave it me—I saw it picked up—I am quite confident the prisoner is the person; I did not lose sight of him one moment—this is my watch.</p>

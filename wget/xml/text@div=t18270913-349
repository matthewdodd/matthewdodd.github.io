            . I am a watchman. I went with Evans to the Bull's Head public-house, and told the prisoner what he was charged with; he denied it, but afterwards said he had taken the prosecutrix home to where she lodged, and the landlord refused to take her in.</p>
               <p>MATILDA WILLIAMS re-examined. I raised an alarm, but it is a bye place, near the pig-market; my forehead was bleeding, and my left eye.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I assure your Honour, that I am perfectly innocent, not withstanding the false allegations made to prove my guilt, of the charge, and which evidence, were I sufficiently competent, or enabled to employ counsel, I feel confident, would clearly be made to appear, in the course of the investigation, as completely false; and a case made up between the parties against me, who are of the most abandoned character, and whose manner of obtaining a livelihood, is by the most base means; as to the above-named person (Williams) I know her to keep a house of the most abandoned character, it being a common receptacle for prostitutes; and the witness, that she has caused to appear against me, I am totally unacquainted with; but I have no doubt, if questioned, that she would appear to be one connected with the prosecutrix in those, her abandoned pursuits, by which means I have, in the present instance, tallen an unfortunate victim. I, however, trust that by the following statement, you will see the case against me is altogether a false charge:- In the month of July, at about twelve o'clock at night, I had (on Saturday) been spending the evening with some of my workmates, at the sign of the Horse and Groom public-house, Cow-cross, and in leaving the company, and passing through Smithfield, on my way home, I met the prosecutrix, in company with a watchman, who I asked what he was going to do with her; he said he was going to take her to the watch-house, she being then in a state of intoxication - I told the watchman I would see her home, if he would allow me; and accordingly, knowing where she lived, from being in the habit of passing and repassing her house, I proceeded to take her home, where, after a deal of trouble, I arrived, and the woman belonging to the house came to the door, who, on telling her I had brought home on of her lodgers, denied that she (Williams) was a lodger of hers, and refused to admit her - with this I left her at the door, and went home.</p>

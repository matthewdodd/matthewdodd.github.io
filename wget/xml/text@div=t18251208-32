I shoved one of them off the pavement, thinking it was a lark, and that they were drunk. I am certain the prisoner was one of them; immediately after that he came up and said, "Sir, you have been abused." I said, "It appears so;" he instantly snatched my watch out - I got hold of the watch and of him by the collar - one of his companions put out his foot to trip me up, I immediately sung out for the watchman; they struck me on the left ear, and I lost my hold of the watch and him also; they got away - there was a light at some distance - the prisoner's face was so close to me I pulled him down, and held so heavily on him, that I had an opportunity of seeing him - he had a blue or a black coat on, and was in a working dress - nobody came to my assistance. I went up to the top of the street in four or five minutes, and saw the watchman in company with a man, and in three quarters of an hour I saw Downes and Davis; they took me to a public-house, where I saw the prisoner, with sixteen or eighteen other persons, and the instant I entered the room I pointed him out. I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you dined? A. I had two glasses of grog between eleven and twelve o'clock, but nothing else. I never said I should not know him - he had a kind of coatee on, and I think a white handkerchief - it was partly white; I was not alarmed, having no idea of a robbery - the nearest light was sixty or seventy yards off; there was singing going on at the public-house; a number of persons told me he had not been out of the house. I am a stranger in town.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the night of the 2d of December I and Davis saw Mills at Webster's public-house, Back-lane, between ten and eleven o'clock - I was fetched there - he told me and Davis that he had been robbed in Dock-street; I took him to the Sidney Smith public-house, in Dock-street; Davis went in first - Mills followed: I was behind. There were fourteen or fifteen persons in the tap-room - Mills pointed out the prisoner, saying, "That is the man who took my watch;" he was sitting down among others, with beer on the table. Davis beckoned him out, and Mills charged him with the robbery - he said Mills must be wrong, for he had not left the house; other persons in the room also said so; he was dressed like a painter, and I think wore a blue coat; 5s. or 6s. were found upon him, but no watch.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Downes. Mills described the prisoner to me, as wearing a dark coat, very much like a Jew, and of a low statute; several persons in the room said he had been out, and the landlady said she thought he had not. Mills persisted in saying he was the man, and he continued to say he was wrong. Mills was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not several persons declare he had not been out? A. Yes. I have brought nobody here who said he was out.</p>

               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What part of the taproom were you in? A. In the box, near the fire and the yard door; four young men, and I believe, two women were in the box. There was a long bench; the prisoner sat by my side; he is a painter.</p>

No. I set in the tap-room when I am not serving - he might go out for a minute or two, and I not see him; he sat in the box by the fire, near the yard door, on a form - some women were in the room. About twenty minutes past ten o'clock some neighbours were saying a man had been robbed in the street, and when I returned to the room, the prisoner had just finished a song.</p>

I am a clerk in a stockbroker's office, and live at High<lb></lb>bury—on 1st August I was coming over London-bridge about a quarter past 3 o'clock—I stopped at the middle of the bridge for about half a minute to see a boat-race, and found my chain hanging loose—a woman told me some<lb></lb>thing, in consequence of which I took Chambers about half-a-dozen yards off, and told him he had got my watch—he said that he had not, and pointed</p>

               <p>to somebody else—he took a few steps backwards, and endeavoured to pass it to Smith—I saw it distinctly in his hand, and he dropped it—Smith was turning towards him—I picked it up, and handed it to a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the service of the Peninsula and Oriental Steam-Packet Company—I was on London-bridge, and saw the prisoners—Chambers walked away, rapidly pursued by the prosecutor, who came up, and accused him of having his watch—he took a few steps towards Smith, who was with two other men, and I saw the watch fall from Chambers's right hand—I believe Smith put his hand out, but more than one hand was put out—I cannot swear that one was his—he was quite as close to Chambers as the others—I saw them taken.</p>

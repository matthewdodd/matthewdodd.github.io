               <p>Was the glass cut out? - There was a jar in it; I had put a piece of putty to it; the putty was taken off and a piece of glass taken out.</p>
               <p>Did you see it done yourself? - No, I did not see it done. I missed the watch about six o'clock. There were three boys; I was sitting at tea with my wife; I heard the boys say d - n your eyes, now is the time, they are all in the kitchen; that is a room I have partitioned off the shop. I said to my wife, I will take the show-glasses in, there will be some of the glass broke and something stolen. I went immediately and took the show-glasses in which were on the other side; I went after I had taken the show-glasses in to the other side, where the watches were, to see if they were safe.</p>
               <p>Is it a corner shop? - Yes. I hung a watch upon the pin the other was stolen off, not knowing a watch had been stolen, and felt the wind come through the window.</p>
               <p>Then you missed the watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it in the show-glass or in the window? - It was in the window in the inside of the shop, beside my work-board, within six or seven inches of the show-glasses. It is a kind of a bow window, I found the watch was gone, and immediately remembered whose watch it was.</p>
               <p>When had you put it there? - At dusk.</p>
               <p>How long was that before the time you missed it? - About forty minutes or more.</p>
               <p>Was it quite dark when you missed it? - Yes. I heard no more of it till the 16th of February, when I had an information that it was pawned that evening. I went up to the pawnbroker's; they owned it had been pawned. One of the evidences had bought it out of pawn. The next day I found it in the possession of

               <p>The woman was offering a watch to sell? - The duplicate of a watch. I went up to her and asked her what she had got to sell; she told me she had got a watch in pawn for half a guinea, and she wanted to sell it out; she wanted a little money to go to Billingsgate to buy her some fish. I went with her to the pawnbroker's, and looked at it. I gave her six shillings and left it in pawn for the half guinea.</p>
               <p>To Marshall. How much do you look upon this watch to be worth? - About seven or eight and twenty shillings.</p>

               <p>Did you ask her how she came by it? - Yes; she said it was her brother's, that he gave her leave to sell it. I little thought it was a stolen watch while it was in pawn.</p>
               <p>Did not you make any enquiry of the pawnbroker if he knew the woman or how she came by it? - No, I made no further enquiries about it. The watch-maker and Farrel came to me and asked me if I had such a watch; I said I had; and went with them to Justice Sherwood's, and delivered up the watch.</p>

               <p>I am headborough of St. Paul's, Shadwell. On the 16th of February Mr. Marshall sent a man for an officer; I went and took Griffin out of bed, and she told me to take Davison, and said he was the lad who gave her the watch; I went to his mother's lodging; she would not let me into the room for some time; at last she let me in, but I could find nobody in the room but her, at last I looked up the chimney, and found Davison half way up the chimney.</p>
               <p>You took him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the boy or his mother? - I know his mother, she used to deal in fish. The next day I went down to Thompson to Mr. Greaves's yard, and asked him about the watch; he delivered the watch to me, and I brought him in custody to Mr. Sherwood's.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>GRIFFIN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>One night, after I had sold my sprats, I went into a house, and this boy and one Gardiner came in and said he had found a watch in some mud; I did not know it was stolen, or I would not have pawned it in my neighbourhood, in my own name.</p>

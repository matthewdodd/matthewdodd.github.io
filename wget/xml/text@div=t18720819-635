                  </hi>. I live at 19, Ryan Place, Poplar, and am a seaman—on the night of 31st July, just after 11 o'clock, I went into a public-house at the corner of Blackman Street to have a glass of ale—I was a little bit elevated; I had had a glass or two, but I knew what I was about—when I got outside I saw the prisoner standing with two more men—I went up and asked him the way to London Bridge—he said he would show me—he took hold of my arm—I said "There is a lot of girls about here"—he said "Yes; will you have one?"—I said "I don't care"—he went down the Borough with me as far as Red Cross Square, took me about a dozen yards up a passage, got hold of me by the throat, put his hand into my trousers pocket and took out my purse and money—I had a struggle with him for about two minutes; he was too strong for me, I bad to let go—he tried to throw me several times—I lost my cap—I got to the top of the court and saw a policeman coming up—the prisoner ran away—I told the constable I had lost my cap and had been robbed—he came down the passage with me, put his light on and found my cap—I am sure my money was safe when I came out of the public-house, and I am sure the prisoner was the man that took it.</p>

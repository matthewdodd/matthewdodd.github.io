                  </hi>. I was ten years old last Feb., and live with my father andmother. One Friday, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I was sentby my father to take home some paper he had sold, and in crossing a fieldnear Peckham Rye, a number of boys came up to me—Marshall was withthem—one of them, named Tilbrook, pulled up my petticoats and threw medown—another boy told him to let me be, and then they left me—I walkedon for two or three minutes—Wicks then came up to me and said, "I mean to—you"—he threw me down and threw me over a ditch, pulled up myclothes, and pinched me, and knelt upon me—I hallooed—he told me to holdmy tongue, or he would cut my head off; and said, if I would let him do—it, hewould give me a bird's-nest which he had in his band—I kept hallooing—heundid his clothes and called Marshall to hold my mouth and hands—Marshall came up and held my mouth and hands—as Wicks was pull<lb></lb>ingup my petticoats, he saw my pocket—he turned me round, felt inmy pocket, and got my purse out—I saw it in his hand—there was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it, a half-farthing, and a new copper penny with a bit of silver init—Marshall could see what he did—they ran away together—I got up andwent straight across the field—I went to a policeman, and told him what hadhappened—I saw Wicks again in about a fortnight at the station—I am surehe is the boy, and I am sure of Marshall too.</p>

The child came up to me near thefield crying, made a complaint, and described the boy that had done this, isconsequence of which I looked after Wicks, but could not find him for a fort-night—I had generally seen him about the neighbourhood before that—I atlast found him playing in a street in Camberwell—I had made inquiries forhim of boys and persons in the neighbourhood—I inquired for him where helived—I did not go to his father's house, but one of our constables did—Itook Marshall the same day—I did not tell him what I took him for—he saidnothing to me—a gentleman had sent a man to stop him for destroyingmangel-wurtzell in the field, but he did not give him into custody—I hap<lb></lb>penedto be present, and I said in Marshall's presence that I wanted a boynamed Wicks, and I should not let him go until I had been to see the littlegirl, as I had had information from her that she had been robbed, and threeboys had pone away, and I thought he might probably be one—hesaid he knew nothing about it—I took him to the station, fetched the little girl, andshe identified him—I afterwards took the little girl to identify Wicks, whenshe pointed him out he said he did not have the purse, he knew nothingabout it—I had told him I took him for taking the little girl's purse—hesaid nothing else—he said afterwards before the Magistrate that a boy named Strutt had done it.</p>

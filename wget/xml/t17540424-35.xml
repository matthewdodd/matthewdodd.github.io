            . I live in Kingsland Road, and am a pawnbroker. I was sitting by my fireside in the kitchen, and hearing a noise turned about and saw an arm reaching cross the counter. My child said, Mamma, mamma, there is a woman reaching two gowns with a long iron fork. I saw a woman go out with something under her arm. I ran to the door and saw the prisoner go in at Mr. Martin's, a publick house next door to me but two. I called her; she went in, and after some time she came to me. I told her she had taken two gowns from me, she said I might search her. We found one of the gowns in Mr. Martin's house of office about a quarter of an hour after this. The other we did not find.</p>

            . On the 16th of March the prisoner came into my house, and ran back into the yard. There was nobody in our house but the prisoner and her sister between that time and the finding of the gown.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner stay when she went into your yard?</p>
               <p>Martin. She staid about as long as is common for persons in the necessary house, and the prosecutrix was in my house before she returned. The prisoner was then in the yard.</p>

               <p>Martin. She lives about 100 yards from me. I never knew any business she followed. I saw her and her sister straitening an iron fork at my fire just before the prisoner went out.</p>

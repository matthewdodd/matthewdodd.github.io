On the 7th of Jan. about a quarter of an hour before six in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man; they went up Queen's-head-alley into Newgate-street, one turn'd towards Newgate, the prisoner towards St. Martin's Le grand. I laid my hand on his shoulder and said, friend, what have you got here? said he some old iron, and that he was going to the golden hall in aldersgate street, and if I would go with him he'd give me six pence; said I it is lead, then I collar'd him, he threw it down, and struggled with me, and he offer'd me a shilling to let him go: then another watchman came up, and we brought him to the watch house going through Newgate-market, where he dropp'd these shoemakers pinchers. I went back to Panyer-alley for the lead; and there were found in it two pieces of lead; we weigh'd them and there were five score and six pounds weight.</p>

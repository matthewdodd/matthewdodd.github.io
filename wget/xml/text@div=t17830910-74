               <p>I live at Edmonton, I am one of the church wardens.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the sale of this wood? - Yes, the sale of this wood was the 20th of February last, we had always lost a vast deal of wood every year after the sales were over, not less than one hundred pounds a year, I have been under the necessity of being under a private agreement, that if there was any proof of any wood being stolen, I would not only make good that deficiency for the purchasers, but likewise be at the expence of the prosecution; this wood was bought by one Green, we sell five stacks in a lot, and these five stacks were sold for four pounds seven shillings and six pence; out of the five we lost one stack and and an half.</p>
               <p>How do you know that this wood was taken from these five lots? - The man that saw the prisoner at the bar loading it, shewed me the very spot where the prisoner was loading it from, and by that I am very certain that it was lot 15; the man's name was

               <p>Court. Is not he here? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how do you know that is the place? - The wood was forfeited again to the parish, at the time it was stolen it became the property of the parish, by not being taken away according to the conditions of the sale; it should have been taken away in two months, Edey that saw him loading the wood did not come to me first, but it was told to other people that told me of it, I heard of it by mere accident, they did not like to tell me, they knew I would prosecute if they did; when I heard of it I sent for Edey, and desired him to go with me to show me the spot where he saw him loading it from, and he went with me and shewed it me; when I came there I knew it to be lot 15, which was bought by one Green a baker at Tottenham, I then went to that Green.</p>
               <p>Court to Edey. Did you show Mr. Erwood the place where this wood was taken from? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that the place where you saw the prisoner? - Yes it was, the mark of the cartwheels were there.</p>
               <p>Erwood. I went to Green and asked him if he had fetched away any of the wood, and he said he had not, I asked him why he did not fetch it away within the time, his answer was, the weather had been so bad, and he kept no teams of his own, I said I want to know whether you have lost any of your wood; accordingly he went on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100113"></xptr> the Chace, and came to me and told me he had lost a stack and an half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. No, no, bring him here.</p>
               <p>Erwood. I told him the wood was become the property of the parish again; he said he hoped I would not take the advantage, I told him I would not, and I paid him for the wood he had lost, as I have done to many other persons, for there was not one customer but had lost, who bought at the four sales.</p>
               <p>You are employed to sell it besides being church warden? - Yes, I was chosen surveyor of the Chace at the first allotment.</p>
               <p>And you say this is one of the lots? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How came Mr. Green not to be here? - He would have been here if we had desired him.</p>
               <p>Why did you not, you only know what he told you? - I know I paid him for the wood he lost.</p>
               <p>Are not your conditions that the parish will not be answerable for any wood that is lost after one day of the sale? - Yes, that is to prevent bad people coming to buy, but I am under a private agreement.</p>
               <p>You do not know of your own knowledge that Green lost any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you commence this prosecution? - The warrant was taken out the 23d of May.</p>
               <p>Was not that after Hall had brought an action against you for impounding his horse? - He brought an action against me the 30th of May, which was a good many days after that.</p>
               <p>There have been some disputes and lawsuits between you and Hall? - You know very well.</p>
               <p>Did you never ask any body to assist you in finding evidence to prosecute Hall, and promise them a reward? - I did not.</p>

               <p>That is so? - That is the truth upon my soul; when he took up Hall it was the time of the sessions sitting, and I said, take him to town at once, but he begged for a further examination, and the prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100114"></xptr> sent to New Prison, and then he waved the felony and lodged him for a misdemeanor: Erwood suffered execution for the payment of the money, and he told me, he wanted nothing else but to punish the prisoner; I was sent for by Hall in the cage, he was taken up just before the indictment was preferred.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. When was the writ served? - I did not serve it myself.</p>
               <p>But you knew of it? - It was just before the return of the writ, I did not see it, I do not tell you I did; Erwood himself said, he was served with a copy of a writ; it is dated the 30th, the warrant was the 23d, the man was tried here once, and was honourably acquitted, and the prosecutor gave a release and spent three pounds, and asked pardon for forswearing himself: I believe the man is very poor, but he is respected: The other was a most wicked prosecution, and it was proved perjury.</p>

               <p>I live near Winchmore-hill; I have known the prisoner twenty years; I know nothing of him but honesty, he is a very hard working man, he keeps a team and makes the best shift he can to maintain his family.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Did you ever hear of the Prisoner's stealing wood?</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. That ought not to be asked.</p>
               <p>Court. That is an improper question.</p>

               <p>Council for the Prosecution to Howison. You are a Marshalsea Court officer, are you not? - No, Sir, I have done with business these nineteen years, I was serjeant at mace after that.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your watch when you went into Privy-gardens? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find it again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Between eleven and twelve o'clock on Sunday night, he charged another woman with it, she was here just now, but she is gone home till six o'clock, I did not expect my trial to come on so soon; he used us both very ill, he charged her first, and then struck me violently with that stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was but this one woman, I saw no other till afterwards; when I charged her with the watch, she struck me, and called a great many more about her, and they knocked me down, and used me very ill, I lost my hat and my shoe; I called the watch, and desired him to take care of that woman, for it was her that had taken my watch. <rs id="t17970426-76-verdict423" type="verdictDescription">

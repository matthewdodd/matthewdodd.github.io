In consequence of information, I watched on Sunday, 30th Sept., and saw the prisoners, about ten o'clock, coming in a direction from the workhouse in Dean-street, Westminster—Strachan had a parcel tied up in a white cloth under her left arm, and Pike was carrying a basket—I followed them down Tothill-street to Cartwright-street—there</p>

               <p>Strachan took the parcel from under her arm, and put it into Pike's basket—she then put her hand to her pocket, but I could not see that she took anything out—they separated, and Pike went to her house—I followed, and asked what she had got—she said, "Some broken meat"—I said she must go to the station—in going down Gardener's-lane she said it was meat that the other woman had bought for her—I found it was a shoulder of mutton—she then said it was meat that was allowed—I found a piece of soap in the basket—I searched Pike's house, which she gave me the direction to, 13 Arthur-street, Chelsea, and found a memorandum there—Mr. Surtees took some papers off a shelf and gave me one, which I believe was one of them—he said he wrote it—it is a memorandum of mutton and other meat, amounting to 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

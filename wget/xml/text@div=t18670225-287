                  </hi>. I am a shipowner at Bermondsey, and own the Bri<lb></lb>tish ship Ann Lucy—the prisoner was a seaman on board her, to come from New York to London—the ship arrived at Gravesend on the 6th February—I went on board and missed a mahogany jolly-boat—I gave information to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I was master of the Ann Lucy—I shipped the pri<lb></lb>soner as boatswain at New York—he came as far as Sandy Hook—I gave him in charge of the gig and four men to go on board a ship lying close to, for a nautical almanack—he went and procured it, and, instead of returning, he pulled away on shore—I was not able to pursue him, and that was the last I saw of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> There were four men against one—how could I pull back and they pulling against me?—they would not go back; they said the ship was not seaworthy, and they would go ashore. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I could not see that he was resisting the other men in any way, but I could not positively say—he was steering the boat.</p>

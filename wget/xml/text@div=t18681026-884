                  </hi>. I am in the service of Stephen Sadler, of Brick Lane, a sweetstuff shopkeeper—on 18th September, the prisoner came in for one pennyworth of sweets, and gave me a shilling, which I put in the till, where there was no other shilling—about an hour afterwards, Mary Ann Sadler found two bad shillings in the till in my presence, one was nailed down to the counter, the other was broken to pieces, and thrown away—the prisoner came again next day for a halfpenny worth of biscuits, and gave me a shilling, I tried it in the detector, and told her it was bad—she said she did not know it—I gave it to Mrs. Sadler, who asked the prisoner where she got it—she said she had been cleaning steps—she was given into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you not say before the Magistrate, Mr. Sadler asked her where she got it, and she said that she worked for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I had never seen the prisoner before—it was between 6 and 7 o'clock when she came on Friday evening, and about 11 on Saturday evening—two or three other persons serve in the shop as well as me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had any money been put in in the mean time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we did not sell anything for the whole hour—I was there the whole time and did not take any silver, only halfpence—if the other persons took silver, they would put it in the till.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a confectioner's shop—on Friday evening, 18th September, two bad shillings were shown to me, a piece was broken out of one of them, and when we went to nail it to the counter, it broke again, and we chucked it away—next night, about 11.15, I was called into the shop, the prisoner was there; the last witness gave me a bad shilling and I said to the prisoner, "What a bad girl you are to bring a bad shilling"—she said, "That she did not know it was bad, she had been at work for it"—I said, "How could you work for such money as this?"—Brown said, "You were here last night"—she said, "No, I was not"—she was given in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you given change for a sovereign out of the till on Friday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that is the way the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were found—we had taken 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in an hour, we often take 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

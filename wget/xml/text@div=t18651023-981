                  </hi>. I am a butcher at Charlton—on Sunday night, 17th September, about half-past 9, I was going through Charlton, and met the prisoners—I spoke to Day—I mistook him for a friend—I asked them if they would have some drink, and we all went to the Bugle Horn public-house, and I treated them to some beer—we left before 11, and Day asked me to go and sleep at the camp, which is on Woolwich Common, and we went through Hanger Wood, towards Woolwich—I was walking with Day, the other two were behind—Day and I sat down on a bank, and while there Day cut my chain and took my watch—I said, "What are your doing, you have got my watch," and laid hold of him by the collar—he did not say anything, but one of the other prisoner's came up and took hold of him, saying, "I have go him, he is all right," and took him away—the third one came up immediately afterwards and picked up a piece of my chain, and <hi rend="italic">said</hi>, "We will go after the other two" and he went over an opening in the hedge and went away—when I got over I could not see him—I am sure about the prisoners being the men—I was in their company an hour and a half—I was sober—I saw them afterwards at the barracks—I knew Day more particularly than the other two—I pointed out the others as the men—I believe now they are the men—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

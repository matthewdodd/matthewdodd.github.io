I was tried and convicted at the last session of stealing this heifer—I do not know how I originally became possessed of that heifer—I saw it at Kingston on Wednesday, 12th Nov., about 10 o'clock in the morning, in the meadow, along with the other beasts—Mr. Beauchamp let me into the meadow—I first saw the other beasts that the heifer was with, in the meadow; I saw them all in the meadow together that morning—I recollect seeing Mr. Beauchamp on the 13th; we were then getting them out of the field to take them to the fair—that was on the Thursday; I was acting for Missenden—I saw Missenden that Wednesday morning, he was along with me; there were five or six of us together—I had come from Kingsbury on the Tuesday morning, the 11th—I went to meet some beasts at the Harrow station; they were Missenden's beasts—I did not see Missenden on the Tuesday; he sent his man down to me from London to tell me to go to Harrow to meet the beasts; that was a drover of his, Joseph Hosier—on the Tuesday I drove those beasts from the Harrow Station to Hampton Wick—a gentleman they called Mr. Beau<lb></lb>champ took them away from me on the bridge, some of them; there were</p>

               <p>person named Goodchild helped me to drive the first lot, and helped me to put them into the field—the two lots were not put into the same field—I believe the second lot was put into the field where I counted the fifty next morning—the first lot arrived at Harrow station about 2 o'clock—they got to my place about 4 o'clock, I believe—I was abed when the second lot arrived; I believe it was about 11 o'clock when they called up at my window—I went into the field next morning where the fifty beasts were, but the boy never went with me, I will swear that—the boy was not in the field with me—I did not ask the boy next day how many he had brought—James Barton helped bring the second lot, I believe—I am sure the boy did not say to me, "Why, here are fifty, and only forty-nine are my master's; that bull is not ours"—I believe that was the only bull among that lot—I saw the heifer at Kingston, but I did not know but it belonged to Mis<lb></lb>senden—I know the description of heifer—I cannot undertake to say whether she was among the fifty that morning; I will not say one way or the other—there were Borne of all sorts among the fifty—I think there were some half—bred heifers—the first I saw of the heifer was at Kingston—Barton, and Hosier, and Mark Richardson drove one lot; Barton and Hosier drove the fifty, among which was the bull; Mark Richardson drove the thirty-four—I went to the Harrow station, to meet his man with some more; that was on the Tuesday—I do not know what number I received on the Tuesday—there were some bullocks and some heifers, some of all sorts—we took them straight from the station to Kingston; the other two lots had started from my place at 8 o'clock, and this lot did not arrive from the Harrow station till 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon—the first lot started between 7 and 8 o'clock, and the other about 8 o'clock or a little after—I saw them; they were counted; I counted thirty—four in one lot, and fifty in another, and then I went to the station for the others—I had not seen Missenden since the Friday before—he had made arrangements that whatever number of cattle there was, they should stop at my place, and that I was to assist in driving them to the fair——I arrived at Kingston on the Tuesday night—there were three lots put into Mr. Beauchamp's field—the two lots that started from my place were put into the same field—there were some cattle of Mr. Beauchamp's in the field, I believe, I do not know how many there were of them j the rest were taken to a field, some of them were bulls—the bulls were separated from the rest—we divided them on Kingston bridge—I separated all the bulls that were in that lot—we took them on, I helped to drive them; there was myself and three or four more—Mr. Beauchamp took the oxen and heifers away from me, and drove them into his field, I suppose—I do not know what he did with them, they were there in the morning—that was on the Tuesday—I did not see Missenden on the Wednesday—I was trimming bulls on the Wednesday—I went to Mr. Beauchamp's on the Wednesday, to see if there was a dead one among them, or anything the matter—Mr. Beauchamp and I had no conversation about the number—I mean to say, that although I was driving Mr. Missenden's cattle, I did not know what the exact number was, because his own men came up with them by rail; they knew the number, I did not—I saw Mr. Beauchamp on the Thursday morning in the field, between 7 and 8 o'clock—I saw Missenden—that was before the cattle were driven out of the field—he had got more men there to attend to the bulls; there were eleven or twelve men alto<lb></lb>gether.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you hear Mr. Gibson give any description of the heifer to Missenden? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he described it as a half bred heifer, with a speckled face—after that I heard Missenden say that he had bought some half bred heifers of a man named Shadrach Tomkins, and he fancied he might have bought it among them—I asked him if they were marked—he said, "No"——I said, "This heifer was not marked"—he said, "No"—they had not all a private mark; this heifer had a mark by which I should know her again, because it was a remarkable one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dairyman of Hampton Wick; I let out my field to persons having cattle for the fair. In November last Missenden came and asked if I had got some grass to let; he looked at it, took it, and said that he was going to turn some cattle in to grass for the fair—he was to pay 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, and the remainder when he took the <hi rend="italic">things</hi> out—I cannot say how many he turned in, as it is so long ago; but not so many as he had agreed—I afterwards saw Tomkins driving some bulls and heifers—I separated them, and put the heifers on my land—Mr. Gibson's heifer was not among them—some bulls came with the heifers, but I cannot say whether this particular bull came—I recollect the bull and</p>

               <p>heifer which were left, not taken into the fair—I cannot tell when the bull came—I recollect the morning of the fair; I went to open the gate to let the <hi rend="italic">things</hi> out, and <hi rend="italic">Missenden</hi> said that he should not take the heifer out, because she had taken the bull the night before, and was not fit to go—a bull was also left; that was the same bull which three weeks afterwards was taken away by Tomkins—he gave no reason why he left the bull; he never said a word about it—the bull and heifer having been left at my place, I saw some of the cattle which were not sold, brought hack in the evening—they were taken out again on the next morning, but the bull and heifer were left in my field still—on 14th Nov., the second day of the fair, I saw John Smith, and took him down from his own house, when I was going into the field—we saw Missenden there, but what we said was not in his hearing, as there are eighty-six acres of land there; I just got into the field, and said, "There is Mr. Missenden, he will tell you all about it," and then walked away, and left them talking together—after Smith went away, I went and looked at the cattle, and said to Missenden, if he had anything left, to put them in the field; and when I went over to the fair, Missenden said, "What I have left I will pay you 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per head per week for; and whatever I put in the field, I will send one of my men or a note"—the same bull and heifer were left there three weeks and a half; Tomkins and another man then came for them, and Tomkins paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was right, and I receipted the bill in pencil, which is the bill found on Tomkins.</p>

I was at Kingston on the second day of the fair, the 14th—Beauchamp called on me, and I went down to the field with him—he first pointed out the heifer which was for sale, and then pointed out Missenden, and said to him, "Here is Mr. Smith, and he will buy the heifer"—I asked Missenden the price; he said, "11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" I said, "Oh, no; I cannot think of giving that price;" he said that he could not take less, and I walked out again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there other cattle in the field? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a good many—I was 300 yards from the heifer—I did not draw his attention to this particular heifer; nothing was said but, "the heifer"—Missenden and another man were driving some other beasts out of the field, and there were other beasts in the field; I do not know whether they were heifers or what—the bull might have been there, but I did not see him to my knowledge.</p>

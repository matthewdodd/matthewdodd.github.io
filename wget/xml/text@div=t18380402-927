                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Dover-place, New Kent-road, and am a surgeon. About nine o'clock at night, on Saturday, the 3rd of March, I was near St. Bride's church, in Fleet-street—I felt a sudden twitch at my pocket—I turned round, and saw three men behind me—I collared one—that was not the prisoner—I saw the prisoner turn up Bride-lane—I immediately pursued, stopped him, and charged him with having picked my pocket, and on searching him I found my handkerchief tucked inside his breast—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

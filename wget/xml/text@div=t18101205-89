            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. On the 26th of last month, at seven in the morning, I apprehended the prisoner in Rotherhithe, close by Church-stairs. He had a bag carrying into a tallow-chandlers shop. I asked him where he got the hemp? he told me he picked it up. I took him in custody, and conveyed him to the office. Frognell was close by him at the time.</p>

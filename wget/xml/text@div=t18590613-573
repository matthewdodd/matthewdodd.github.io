                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry John White, of 5, Grosvenor-road, Highbury New Park—on Saturday, 21st May, about two o'clock, I was returning home, and was within a few houses of my own door, when I saw the prisoner meeting me; and when within a few yards of me, he dodged me, then gave me a slap across the eyes; and I found my eyes and mouth full of what seemed to be snuff—it was very hot—he then snatched violently from my hand my purse, which contained two half-sovereigns—I ran after him, calling, "Stop thief"—the powder inflamed my eyes, and caused them to be very painful—I saw the prisoner knocked down and taken, a hundred yards off, but did not see who by—it was outside a shop—he had ran away, but I had not lost sight of him—this is my purse (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—it was given me by a person—it had half-a-sovereign in it when I received it back—the powder in my eyes did not disable me from seeing the prisoner as he ran away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It did not enable you to see better, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; this was all done in a moment—I saw the prisoner on the ground, about 100 yards from where I was robbed, in a turning into High<lb></lb>bury-grove—I saw him running till he was knocked down—there were other people in the Grove, and I was close after him—there were a great many persons about him—I cried "Stop thief!"—the powder pained my eyes, and I took out my handkerchief and rubbed them—some of it re<lb></lb>mained on my face afterwards—it was black—I suffered pain all the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lath-render of No. 9, Coleman-street, New North road—on Saturday, 21st May, about 2 o'clock, I was going up High<lb></lb>bury-grove, saw a crowd, and heard cries of "Stop thief! stop him!"—I saw some people running, and a lady—the prisoner was running first, and I caught him—there was nobody running before him—he requested me to let him go—then he struggled very violently, and next he tried to hit me in the face—I tripped him down, and he was held by two men till assist<lb></lb>ance came, and was then given in custody—while he was struggling I saw a boy pick up a purse about two yards from the prisoner, with a half-sovereign in it—he handed it over to Mrs. White immediately.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What distance were you from Highbury-grove? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Highbury-grove, from eighty to ninety yards from the corner of the Grosvenor-road—it was on the railway bridge—there were six or seven people altogether, and I caught the first—I did not hear him call "Stop thief!"—the lady came up in about ten minutes or less—I saw her face—it was darkened over with some stuff—I thought she had been tumbling down in the dust when I saw her first.</p>

I went to Highbury-grove at a few minutes after 2 o'clock, and found the prisoner and two men—I took him in charge, searched him at the station, and found on him this small bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), containing a dark powder similar to what I noticed on the lady's face, who I saw waiting in a shop, and her face was smeared with black—the prisoner's fingers were black.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the bag in this state when you found it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there is a trifling quantity of powder in it now—the lady was sitting in a grocer's shop in a state of exhaustion—I saw her again after she had washed her face, and it had a very different appearance.</p>

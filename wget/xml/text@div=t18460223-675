                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Moore Walker, of North-place, Cromer-street. I lodged at No. 7, Manchester-street, before that. On the 31st of Jan., 1845, about a quarter past twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner there—I knew her before—she came down and sat by my fire till near four o'clock—I left her in the room alone for about three minutes—I went to my drawers about four o'clock, and I missed my shawl, which I had seen safe three mi<lb></lb>nutes before she came into the room—she was also gone—I did not see any<lb></lb>thing of her till the May following, and before I said anything to her she said, as I went to speak to her, "I did not take your shawl"—I had not mentioned it to her—I then asked her what she had done with it—she said she had pawned it, and promised me the ticket the next day—I went with my husband that evening and a policeman, but she was gone—I did not see her again till last Friday week—I then told her she had told me a great story as to where she had pawned it—she said yes she had, but it was pledged at Brown's.</p>

               <p>On the 26th of September, between eleven and twelve at night, coming over London-bridge, the prisoner asked me to treat her to part of a pint of beer, and begged for charity; and said, she had got three small children; I went into a public-house, and we had one pint, and then I called for another; afterwards I came away over London-bridge, to see how my craft lay; this woman followed me, and then I had another pint of beer, or two, at the bottom of Miles's-lane; and she drank with me; I came away from there to <placeName id="t17881022-41-crimeloc189">Thames-street</placeName>

               <p>Is it possible that a sober man could lose his handkerchief, without feeling it taken off his neck? - My lord, she struck me on my breast, which took away my attention; when I got my handkerchief, I charged the watch with her, and she was taken to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>On the 26th of September, about twelve o'clock at night, the prosecutor and the watchman brought this woman in; and I searched her; she denied having any thing but a saw halfpence about her; I then threatened to take her to the counter; and she said, if you will let us go to the place where we were, perhaps we may find it; says! ah! do you think so? yes, says she, perhaps we may; then I, the prosecutor, and a watchman went with her; and she took us into a court, and we could not find any thing; then we went up Martin-street; and she said, I want to make water; I will be glad if you will step on a little; I had stept from her a few yards or so, and stopped, but she did not do any thing at all; I took her to the watch-house again, and found two guineas in her left hand; I asked her how she came by it; she said, she picked them up, and said, she had as much right to pick them up as we had, if she had not picked them up we should; another time, she said, she had borrowed them to go to market, and another time, she said, they were her own; she was in three stories.</p>

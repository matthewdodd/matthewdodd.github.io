               <p>"Dear Ann,—you have no doubt suffered much uneasiness and distress of mind at my sudden disappearance from town, the cause (a singular one) I will endeavour to explain; but the real fact is, J am so confused and wretched that I am not able to give you the particulars, and I fear much that what I am going to relate will only be considered a fabrication by all parties, with the exception of yourself; what I tell you is true. Mr. Ruff handed me two checks to get cash for, in order to discharge some bills. I went to the banks (two) and got cash for the checks, and unfortunately I put 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with the bills I had to pay, and some letters, in some brown paper; the other money I had in my trowsers pocket; the 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and letters in my coat pocket. It is not far from the banks to White and Greenwell's, the first parties I intended to pay. Oh, Ann what was my consternation and surprise, when I got to White's, my parcel was gone—yes, gone, and for ever I did not go into White's. I retraced my steps to the banks; that was useless, there were thousands walking to and fro. I certainly did look into one auction-room for about half a minute, on the road to White's, but I cannot swear that I lost the money there; How it went it is impossible for me to say. Expecting im<lb></lb>mediate dismissal or a prison, I wandered about in a state of distraction that I cannot well describe. I knew not, nor did I care whither I went. I really thought that I should have gone mad. If the scoundrel who robbed me had felt what I felt, he would, I think, have altered his course of life. I cannot enter into the detail of my journey here, it would exceed my limits; to be brief, I made the best of my way for Cambridge; the Miss Jones's were at Yarmouth. I stated my case; they have been kind, very kind. One gen<lb></lb>tleman, when he heard of my misfortune, gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but would not give me his name or address. I am in rather better spirits. I hope I shall be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184608170021"></xptr>
               <p>able to make up all the money to my kind employers. I send you 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Mr. Ruff; take it to him; tell him, Ann, my case; he may, perhaps, allow me time to get up the money; I will beg, borrow, I will do any thing but steal, to make it up; sell or pawn my things for your immediate wants. I leave Yarmouth this day. I shall endeavour to reach Darlington, and try my friends there. Ann, keep up your heart, my dear, all may be well yet; we have had many severe trials through this uncertain life, but this is the most awful blow I ever experienced; may it be the last. Poor Ann, my eyes are now swimming with tears, I cannot write more; if I succeed in Durham I will write.—yours, ever truly, G. <hi rend="smallCaps">WRIGHT</hi>. I can say nothing about my children. The letter for Mr. Ruff you may take with the inclosed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the letter contains 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or at least an order for that amount."</p>

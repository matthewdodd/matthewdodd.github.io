             sworn. - On Tuesday morning, about half past ten o'clock, Meeking came with his tools to work in our shop, and about half past eleven, Mr. Dawes and another young man came into the shop; there was John Cripps (my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030048"></xptr>son) and his wife; it was a regular rule to pay a gallon of beer, for what we call stool pots, upon a new workman coming to the manufactory;

            , John Cripps, and his wife, were new people, and when we were all together, they thought proper to have it in; I was going home to dinner, and I ordered it; when I went back, it was gone, and we had more to the amount of fourteen pots. About half past eight at night, I went to Mr. Mills's, the sign of the China ship, with my son; I saw Mr. Mills, and he said, you have got a very quarrelsome man, I think, coming to work with you, meaning Mecking, the deceased; I placed myself in the opposite side of the room, with my son, in the box; there was Mr. Dawes, Meeking, Mr. James Tyne, and Edward Jackson, all shop-mates; at this time, Meeking was challenging

The whole of this quarrel was owing to the deceased, that is as true as God is in heaven, for a quarrelsome man he was.</p>

            , and challenged him; then Mr. Mills, the publican, came, and said, if you don't be quiet, I will turn you out of doors; I persuaded Meeking, all I could, to be quiet; he went out of the box about five minutes after that, and what arose between the prisoner and him, I cannot say, but they went out of doors; I set with my back towards the door; in about ten minutes after, a man came into the house, and said, there were two shopmates fighting; I went out, and they were in the dark, both in the mud; there was nobody by to pick either up; I went and assisted Dawes, who was uppermost; being a little intoxicated, I and Dawes fell down together; a person says, pipe-maker, you are not capable of picking the man up, let me do it; I staid by near a quarter of an hour, and I saw them have several heavy falls; the deceased was stronger than the prisoner; I heard it said that the deceased would not fight any more, and Dawes went into the house; I followed him, and about three minutes after that, the deceased was brought in, and I heard the words said, they thought he was no more; immediately Dawes said, for God's sake send for a surgeon; he was sent for, and came in about five minutes; he endeavoured to bleed him, but no blood would come; I have known the prisoner these twenty four years; and from a boy to a man, I have never seen him wranglesome, fighting, or quarrelling, but always a civil young man; the deceased, whenever he had a drop of liquor, was always quarrelsome and fighting.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say he squared at you? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>CHARLES HEBRON sworn. - I am surgeon, and attended the deceased at Mr. Mills's house; I considered him to be dead; upon examining him, I found seven bruises on the chest, but one in particular on the back part of the head; a concussion from the blow on the back part of the head, I think was the cause of his death; I opened his chest, and examined it to see if he was hurt inwardly by the bruises, but he was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I declare I never in my life had the least malice or intention to injure the man, but always would have done any thing to serve him, as, I believe, he would me; the accident has hurt me so much, that I have been very unhappy, and can say no more.</p>

I have known the prisoner nearly twenty years, but I had dropped her acquaintance; but on the 18th of June, I met her accidentally, and took her home to tea - I then came and brought my boy's tea to Hackney-road - when I went home, I laid down and dropped asleep, and the prisoner took the key, and got the property, and went away; I am sure the property was all safe in my drawer when I went to sleep, in this little box, and the drawer was locked - the prisoner had seen me take 1s., out of this box, to lend to a witness who had asked me for one, and I said I had no money but my child's, which I had saved up - I have seen the watch and the spoons since, but the two shillings are lost.</p>

               <p>JURY to COLLS. Q. Did you see what the box contained? A. Yes, I looked in and saw two silver spoons, a watch, and half-a-crown in money - I left the house as soon as she had locked up the box again; I asked the prisoner if she was going home - she said "No, but to stop all night," the prosecutrix said she might, and then the prosecutrix laid down.</p>

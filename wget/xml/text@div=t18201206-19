I knew all the prisoners before - they are labourers. I had left the property part in a small round box, and part in a flat box - the boxes were in two drawers, which were not locked.

            . I am a constable of Edmonton. On Monday, the 27th of November, I was coming to town with a man in custody on another charge. Lawrence came into a public-house where we were waiting for the commitment, with a woman, and drank with my prisoner, and directly after Clayton came in I left the public-house, took a coach, and brought my prisoner to town. Lawrence and Clayton came away from Edmonton with me. We passed Head on the road, and my prisoner beckoned to them. In consequence of what he said I returned at five o'clock, got information, apprehended Head, and afterwards Lawrence. I searched them - on Head I found two guineas, two 1 l. Bank notes, two sixpences, and fivepence three-farthings. I then went to the King's Head, public-house, at Edmonton, and found Lawrence and Clayton there. I secured Lawrence, and found one guinea, a 1 l. Bank note 25 s. 6 d. in silver, and a new casting net, which he said he bought for 36 s. on him. I took him before the Magistrate next morning, what he said was taken down, and he was sworn to it; after he left the Magistrate he said he would save himself. On Wednesday night I got a warrant to apprehend Clayton, waited a long time at his house, and at last got admittance; on Saturday I found him at Rickford, he said he knew nothing of the robbery, but was afraid he was taken for stealing Mr. Nash's pigs two years ago. I produce what I found on Head and Lawrence, also a 5 l. Bank note, No. 3475, given me by King, and two 1 l. Bank notes, Nos. 36436, and 47159, which I received from Sheaf.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 7th of February, between seven and eight o'clock. the prisoner came and asked to look at a hunting watch, which hung in the window; I shewed him two - he did not approve of either, and asked to see one which hung in the window with a gold chain and two seals attached to it; I shewed it to him - he said he had a friend who would come and look at it, and if he approved of it, he would pay 1 l, of the amount. He went away, returned in an hour and a half, and asked if his friend had been, and desired me to shew him the watch again - he held it in his hand some time, and suddenly threw a quantity of snuff into my face, and ran out of the house with the watch and seals; he ran down Castle-street, and I after him; he stumbled and fell. I saw some person pick him up. I went back to look for the watch, as I saw his arm move, and thought I saw him throw it down; some person in the crowd picked it up; it was taken to the watch-house, and returned to me at Bow-street - I am sure it is the watch I shewed him; but the two gold seals, a key, and part of the chain are gone. I am sure he is the man - he was half an hour with me the first time. The value of the watch, chain, and seals is full 4 l.; I would not take that for them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I solemnly declare, with a clear conscience, I am as innocent of this charge as one who never saw London, and I am as positive as the persons who prosecute me, however positive that they may feel that I am the person. I was in company with some persons from half-past seven o'clock, until a quarter to ten; and scarcely had left one of the party, when I proceeded down Castle-street, towards the Haymarket, and on hearing the cry behind me, of Stop thief! I was in the act of turning round, and was knocked down by a man that was in full speed; he passed on, and I imagined he entered a public-house, and about one minute afterwards, I was picked up by some people, and conveyed to the watch-house, where I was charged with this. It was not until the next morning that I was sensible of the nature of the charge, because at the time I was knocked down, I was nearly intoxicated, which together with the effects of the fall, rendered me quite insensible for a time; but should I be convicted of this shameful charge, I hope your Lordship will in pity sake, send me out of the country, where I can reap unmolested, the benefits arising from industry - for believe me, my Lord, was I found guilty of this false charge, and the gates of this prison thrown open to me, it would be constant misery to me, for all my prospects in this country are blasted.</p>

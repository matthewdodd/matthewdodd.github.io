               <p>I am a sail-maker, I saw the man take the things, on Tuesday, in the afternoon, the 25th of February, I was in my warehouse, attending my people, which were opening a sail, which having laid by some while in the house was dusty; I ordered them to throw my window open, soon after which I heard a carriage draw up the street, and pass by the warehouse, I thought it had stopped at my door, and might be goods for myself, it drew my attention to the window; soon after I saw the prisoner at the bar come to the off side of the cart, went to the off wheel, put his hand through the spokes of it, and with one hand took hold of a sack which lay in the cart, and in the other hand having a knife, he was cutting the tyer, or whatever it consisted of; in the act of doing this, he cast his eyes up to my warehouse window, which enabled me to take a full view of his countenance; in the moment it struck me, it was the carman robbing his master; I thought I would go and see who the cart belonged to, and drop them a line of their servant's conduct, but to my amaze, in about ten minutes time, I saw another person come up with a whip in his hand. I believe, I fogot to tell you, that after he had cut the sack, he took a sack out of that sack, and put it under his arm, and walked down the street; I observed there were letters on that sack, but what I could not tell, the man when he came up with the whip in his hand, had two other men with him; I called to him, and asked him if he was the carman belonging to the cart? he said yes; I said, my friend, your cart has been robbed; the man looked up with amaze at me, and he and one of the men that were with him jumped up into the cart, shoot the sacks that remained out of that sack that the prisoner cut open, and one of them said, d-n it be has got the money; I told him that I had taken very particular notice of the man that committed the robbery, that he was a tall man, very aukwardly made. I know him to be the prisoner, I can swear it; they got him and brought him to my house the next morning, and I told them that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me cut the sack? - I saw him cut the tyer, a string of some sort, but what I cannot tell, off that sack, that he took the sack out of.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable, I have got a corn sack and fifteen shillingsworth of halfpence; I took the prisoner and he took me to his lodgings, and he went and leaned over a bedstead with the bed on, and there he took these halfpence down, the bag was on another bed, and he took that from under two mens heads, in the same room, that laid on the bed, he gave me the bag and the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were other men in that room? - There were.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this lodging? - On Salt-Petersbank.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go there? - About nine o'clock, the man came to me, I suppose it was between eleven and twelve, by the time I got there, it was the 26th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a lodging house, or what place was it? - It was a very infamous place indeed, it appeared so to me, one man was sadly cut indeed that lay in bed, the prisoner told me, at the time he gave up the sack, that he wanted the sack, and had he known the halfpence had been in it he would not have taken it at all; I have kept these things till now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You say how that there were two men in bed, it was a man and his wife? - They were both without caps.</p>
               <p>Court to Jessop. Was the halfpence in that sack? - Yes, four papers of five shillingsworth done up. This is the sack that was in the other, and lost out of the cart, I cannot speak about the papers of halfpence, but I know there were four.</p>
               <p>STANBRIDGE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a corn chandler, I delivered the halfpence to this carman myself, four crown papers bound up in another paper.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the carman to do with them? - To take them to his master, Mr. Houlditch, the prosecutor, he is in the corn way, we deal with him for corn, the money was in part of payment, for his servant to give to his master.</p>
               <p>Q. You pay in halfpence sometimes? - I did on this occasion, and had done before; when the papers were first brought to our house they appeared to be the same, but it is impossible to know them now, because they are all to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did the sack belong to? - It was given as one of Mr. Houlditch's, but it was given in mistake, but I did not know that till my husband came home, but a young girl that lives with me can swear to the sack, because she took particular notice of a mark on it.</p>
               <p>sworn.</p>
               <p>I live with Mrs. Stanbridge, that sack was delivered to the carman, the money was in it. I know it is the same by a red mark that is on it, a red star, I remarked it very particularly when it stood in our shop with some barley in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down the Wharf with a waggon load of coals, and this cart stood right facing Bushell's-rents, and the carman said to me, put that cart up, that I may come bye, and my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300130"></xptr>breeches being torn I took this sack out to mend them.</p>

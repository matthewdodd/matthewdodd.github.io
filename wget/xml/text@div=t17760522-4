One of the two back parlour windows, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220005"></xptr> is next the fields the people came in at that robbed the house; the screw of that window was forced, the pin was out, and the bar was forced out, so that the shutters were open: I did not hear them breaking in, but I heard the door of the room next me unlock, and in a quarter of a minute after that I heard the door shut again; then I heard somebody trying at my own chamber-door, upon which I jumped up, being much alarmed, and called out, Who is there? No answer being made to me, I was very much terrified, and immediately screamed out to Mr. Penleaze, who jumped up, and in a loud voice called out, Who is there? but before he had well said it the door was forced open, and four men rushed into the room with a kind of a yell; one had a dark lanthorn in his hand, and one had a bit of gauze under his nose over his mouth, tied behind his head: they were upon the bed almost immediately; two of them mounted up upon the bed at the feet, and came almost close up to me. Green was one of these two men; he came up on my side of the bed; his hat was fitted up in a peak, and stood high upon his head, so that I had a fair view of his face. Bates, the other prisoner, was on Mr. Penleaze's side; his hair hung lank upon his face. The other two went to the head of the bed, one on each side, and one of them held a pistol to my head, and the other stood with a cutlass before me. They said, Your money, your money, tell us where your money is. Four pistols were at this time held at Mr. Penleaze's head and mine, each of them having a pistol in his hand. They said, They came for money, and would have it; and the two prisoners said, They would not have notes, but only money: they then asked what money we had in the house? Mr. Penleaze said, we had but little, but what we had lies on the slab in the next room: they asked what slab? Immediately recollecting that that was the room where what we had of any value was kept, I had the presence of mind to direct them to another room in order to divert their attention, as it was then three o'clock, and I trusted to somebody's coming to our relief: I said, in the next room they might find a chest of drawers, and advised them to look for a bag which had some money in it in one of those drawers: they asked me which room? I directed them to that they opened first: three accordingly went out of my room, and one staid behind to keep guard with a pistol and cutlass at my head: two of them came back in less than two minutes, and said, they could find none there; then they addressed themselves to Mr. Penleaze, and said, Whereabouts did you say, Sir, the money lay, upon the slab? what slab is it you mean? he said again, the slab in the room on the right hand; at the same time he said, his son had received a little money yesterday which he had not accounted to him for: they immediately asked him where his son lay? he said, up another pair of stairs you will find him. They then left the room a second time, and two of them went up stairs; one still kept guard, but that one was neither of the prisoners. I afterwards found they had opened three chests; that they had tumbled the things about, and finding nothing in them, went away; but they did not go into my son's room. They then came down again, and just looked into the room where Mr. Penleaze and I were, and then went to the study door on the right hand of our room, and finding they could not open it easily, the man who was standing guard at the head of my bed called out to them, What are you about? they answered, We cannot open the door. One who is not yet taken opened a little drawing table that stood in my room, but found nothing in it; and one of the prisoners opened a little bureau that was also in my room, but found nothing. The study door was soon after broke open, and I heard the plate rattle as if it was putting into something. I have no doubt of the persons of the men; they were not above a foot and a half from us upon the bed. Bates was taken up that evening, and I saw him the next day with the other prisoner, and immediately knew them; I saw Green the next day coming with the officer that took him, and I knew him immediately, and he trembled like an aspin leaf as soon as he saw me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Had you no doubt of the persons of the prisoners at the office? - No, I never did doubt about them at the office. The light that enabled me to distinguish them was, besides the dark lanthorn, a wax candle that was taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177605220006"></xptr> out of one of the rooms; it might be behind, for I am certain there was more light than the dark lanthorn gave, for there was no light in my room; when the others went up stairs to the room where my son lay, when they went for that purpose there was no light left in my room; there was no light of any kind in the house, therefore they could not have found their way up stairs unless they had a light with them; before they went up stairs they covered me up with the bedclothes; but the man who staid as guard left one side of my face free, so that I could see with one eye; I made a proposition to them to go away from the house; I said, if they would go I would give them some money at any time and place they should appoint, and no enquiry should be made after them; the man at the head of the bed seemed to listen to this proposal, and said to the others, what will you do? one of them said, we had best search the house; they struck at me with a cutlass when I screamed, damning me for screaming and making a noise; the cutlass missed my head and struck into the head of the bed.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Penleaze; as I was going down stairs, upon hearing my mistress scream, I saw three men coming out of my mistress's room; Bates was upon the staircase; I went back to my own room immediately upon seeing them; two of them came up and passed my room door, but turned down again to my mistress's door; I heard them engage their words that nobody should be hurt if the money was given quietly; the men came up again to the young gentleman's room; I saw them rifle his breeches pocket and take out his money and his watch; one had a candle in his hand without a candlestick: they searched the boxes in the other rooms; Bates searched the young gentleman's pockets; they came then into a room next mine, and I heard them opening the boxes: one said to the other, come along, here is nothing here; then they went away again: I saw them twice go behind my room; I stood with the door open from the first of my seeing them till the last, which might be about twenty minutes; I saw the shadow of spoons as if they were putting them into something covered; they went down to the study from me; while they were there, I heard a voice say, what are you about? they answered, we cannot open the door.</p>
               <p>How were you enabled to see these persons so distinctly? - I could see them in my young master's room, I believe, without their seeing me; I stood with the door ajar; my reason for it was, that I purposed to have gone down stairs to have alarmed the neighbourhood, if I could have gone down. Bates was the person that took the candle out of the other man's hand; but I will not swear to Green being one of the persons.</p>

               <p>On the Saturday, which was the night before my house was broke open, I saw all the things mentioned in the indictment; my loss amounts to between 4 and 500 l. I believe Bates to be the person that put a pistol to my head in the bed, but I will not swear positively to him, because I am near-sighted; the account Mrs. Penleaze has given of the robbery, is a circumstantial account of facts. I saw four men coming into the room, one came on my side and struck me with the muzzle of his pistol on my head as I was sitting up in the bed, and two were at the foot of the bed; one stayed on my wife's side of the bed all the time.</p>

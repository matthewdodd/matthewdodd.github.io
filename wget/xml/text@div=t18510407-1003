On 31st March, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I went to the Fishmongers' Arms—I came out about two hours afterwards—I had been drinking a little—I was not drunk—I knew perfectly well what I was doing—I bad had two or three drinks of stout and two glasses of rum—I went out to make water, and as I was returning in again the prisoner caught me by the coat and waistcoat, and struck me on the forehead—I then received a kick over the eye which took away my senses—I recollect nothing more—I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

I am the prosecutor's sister—he went out with my husband, about one o'clock on Monday morning, and finding they were gone a long time, my sister and I went out after them to the Fishmongers' Arms, and there found them drinking stout—between three and four my brother went outside the house, and seeing him the worse for liquor, I followed him and saw him knocked down by the prisoner—I instantly seized the prisoner by the hair and took his hand from my brother's right-hand pocket, it was clenched—I did not leave go of his hair till the policeman came and loosened it—there were several of the prisoner's associates round him, and I received a blow in the mouth—I did not know him before—he did not appear drunk.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody by Mrs. Burrell—she had hold of him by the hair when I came up—I took him a short distance, and found that the prosecutor was kept back by a lot of the prisoner's companions—he told me that the prisoner bad robbed him—he was drunk—I told him at the station to search his pockets and see what money he had lost—he said he had lost a half-sovereign, and afterwards he said be had lost some more—he could not say how much—next day, before the Magistrate, he said he had lost two half-crowns—he had a severe wound on the left eye, which was bleeding very much.</p>

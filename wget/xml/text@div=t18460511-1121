                  </hi>. I keep a lodging-house in George-street, St. Giles's—I live there. Catharine Divatt had been employed by me a little time, as a char-woman, but she was put off on the 25th of April—on the 26th of April, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, she came to my house—I think she was sober—I was up stairs on the bed, and had dozed off to sleep—she came up, and hit the door against the bed, and awoke me—I saw her in the room—I said, "If you don't go down stairs I will kick you out"—she shut the door and went off—in three or four minutes afterwards I got up to see what time it was, and missed my watch and chain from off the table—I</p>

               <p>went after her to every public-house in the neighbourhood—I asked the po<lb></lb>liceman to walk with me, and I found both the prisoners in King-street—before I came to them I saw Anthony Divatt make a motion to Catharine Divatt, and he said something to her—I came up, and gave her in charge to the policeman—Anthony Divatt ran off—I went and caught him—when they were at the station Anthony Divatt said, "It is correct, Master Hall, I have got your watch; she gave it me"—he gave me the watch—this is it.</p>

I was on duty in Georgt-street, on the 26th of April—the prosecutor called me—we went to several public-houses, and afterwards saw the two prisoners walking together—the man turned and spoke to the woman, but I did not hear what he said—I took the woman—the prosecutor took the man, and while the prosecutor was mak<lb></lb>ing the charge at the station, the man produced this watch and chain and said, "It is quite correct, Master Hall, here is your watch, and I was bringing it back to give it you, when I was taken"—the woman appeared to have beta drinking.</p>

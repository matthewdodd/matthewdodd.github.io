                  </hi>. I am a news agent, and live in Bow<lb></lb>common-lane. On Monday night, 7th July, I closed my dwelling house, about half past 10 o'clock—everything was then safe—I came down next morning, just upon half past 4 o'clock—I discovered my parlour window open—I called my</p>

               <p>son, and then I discovered my kitchen window open—both the windows were fastened over night—I saw two youngsters, one in the adjoining yard, and the other just getting over the wall from my house—I saw them distinctly, they were the two prisoners—on the over night there had been a tea caddy on the sideboard in the parlour—I found that tea caddy in the morning on a little table in the kitchen, and it was open—I missed a pair of buckles which had been in the caddy—I missed a teapot—it was in the kitchen the night before, and was not there in the morning—all those articles were my property.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 350). On the morning of 8th June I saw the two prisoners, about half past 4 o'clock, in St. Ann's-road, which is nearly a quarter of a mile from Bow-common-lane—I did not speak to them—in a few minutes afterwards, in consequence of information, I went after them—McCarthy was with me, we came up with Melville, who had got from a mile to a mile and a half from the place where I saw him before—that was the distance I ran round to take him, if I had gone straight it would be something less—I stopped him, and said he must go with me on a charge of breaking into a man's house on my beat—he said, "I have not done anything"—I took him to Mr. Brown—he said, "They are the vagabonds"—the prisoners were together at that time—I took Melville, and McCarthy took Davis—the house next door to Mr. Brown's is empty—I searched it after the prisoners were locked up, and found this teapot and this lead pipe, which is not mentioned in the indictment.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 372). I went with Smith in pursuit of these lads—they were running across a field—I directed Smith to go one way, and I went another, and intercepted them—I took Davis, and Smith took Melville—I told Davis that some gentleman had made a complaint to my brother officer of a burglary having been committed, and they were suspected of it—he said he was not there at all, he was at the Mazeppa coffee house in Whitechapel—I went with the prisoners to Mr. Brown, and he said, "Those are the vagabonds that broke into my house, I saw them in the yard"—I took them to the station, and afterwards examined Mr. Brown's house—there were marks both inside and outside the back parlour, which appeared to me to be of a chisel, it was some cutting instrument—the mark was where the catch of the window was, and it is my opinion that with this instrument they removed the catch, and opened the window, and got in that way—I did not find anything about the prisoners that I</p>

               <p>could compare with the window—I found these silver buckles, which the prosecutor sets great value on, in the dust heap of the empty house—I asked Davis to take his shoe or boot off, and I made an impression with it, which exactly corresponded with other marks that were in the yard or garden—I made an impression by the side of one, and they exactly tallied—Smith asked Melville to take his shoe off, and he made an impression with it, which exactly corresponded with the smaller footsteps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see marks that would lead you to suppose that there was more than one instrument? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I cannot say that—there were footmarks in the yard—part of it is a garden, a few yards round—it is a clayey soil—there were marks in the clay; it is very soft indeed—there had not been rain, it was a very fine night—one of them was a very large boot, the other a small shoe—my prisoner had the largest foot; I think what he had they call a Blucher—I think there were nails in it—I cannot tell how many, or which part the nails were in—I think he had an iron tip on the heel of the boot—I made only one impression, and my brother officer made the other—I tried the right boot—it was a large sice, I thought it was much larger than mine.</p>

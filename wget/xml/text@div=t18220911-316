            . I live in Blue Anchor-yard, at the corner of New-court. On the 18th of September, about eight o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and another in the Court, and said they had better be off. I could not see the watchman. I waited till eleven o'clock; the watchman did not come; so I went to the prisoner and told him to be off - and at three quarters past eleven o'clock I was at my window; I went to the street door, and heard somebody jump; I went up the court, and the prisoner was coming out of the court with a bundle of clothes under his arm. I laid hold of him; the other man came up, and being afraid, I let him go, but followed him into East Smithfield, and then he was taken; he threw the bundle at me; I picked it up, and found the trowsers on the ground. He told the Magistrate that Hall had enticed him into it, and that he had been with him.</p>

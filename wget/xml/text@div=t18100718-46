On the 17th of January, between eight and nine o'clock, I saw my mare in my stable in my yard; the yard is fenced in with the building, with a gate, the gate has no lock, nor the stable door. On the morning of the 18th, about five o'clock, I went to my stable and perceived the mare gone; I went into my field and traced the mare's feet, and a man's feet on the ground; the snow lay on the ground, I traced it from the dung in my yard by the stable, into the field; there is an adjoining field, they put dung in the ditch and got the mare into the next field; I traced the mare's feet perfectly across the next two fields into the open road, and there I could not trace her no further for the tracks of the carts.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you see your mare again - A. On the 3d of February, the Saturday fortnight after; I saw her in Goswell-street, in Mr. Cumberland's cart; I knew her directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was your mare - A. A brown mare, with a star in her forehead, she was aged, I gave sixteen guineas for her; I worked her very hard and got her poor, she was worth ten pound; after I lost her they used her very ill, she never did me an hours work, they drove a nail in her foot, the foot came off, she mortified, that day month I carried her away dead.</p>

            . I live at Ealand, in Walthamstow; I am in the jobbing way, with two or three horses in a cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the man at the bar - A. I know that he sold me the mare, I did not know him before. On the 18th of January, about twelve o'clock at noon, I saw the prisoner, he was coming along the Ealand road, where I was at work at a dung cart, he had this known mare, nobody was in company with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same brown mare that was claimed by Baker afterwards - A. The very same. I asked him whether he would sell the horse; he kept going on, and after he had got a little way he called me to him; I went to him, he said he would sell the horse for four pound, or four pound ten shillings; it was very poor in flesh, I told him I would give him two pounds for it; we tried her in my cart with a load of dung into the field; the mare had only a halter on her, and no saddle; I asked where he had her from, he told me he lived at Walthamstow, below Mr. Juff's, the blacksmith, that is in Marsh-street; he said she had been in the country to a straw yard. After I tried her, the prisoner agreed that she was lame, I told him she was broken winded, she appeared rather lame but not in that foot he told me; I told him it was a bad time to sell horses; I dare say she was seventeen or eighteen years old. I agreed at last to give a guinea and a half for it; we were together about half an hour. I am quite certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the 18th of January, did you ever see him between that time and the time that the mare was claimed in your cart by Baker - A. No; I was with the cart when the mare was claimed by Baker. I took the prisoner up myself, it is not three weeks ago; I went to Southgate, the prisoner lived there, I told the constable, as soon as I saw him, that was the man, and gave charge of him. I told the prisoner I took him for selling me a mare that they suspected was stolen; he said, he knew nothing about it, he was not the man; I told him he was certainly the man, and it was no other man, he continued to deny it. At the time that I bought the mare of him at Ealand,

Yes; and afterwards they went a little distance; I heard a great many words that passed between them, I cannot say I did all. I was in the hold when they drawed the dung with the mare in the field. I heard them at last agree for a guinea and a half; he gave him the guinea first in the field, and the half a guinea in the road. I am sure he is the same man, I was with him more than a quarter of an hour. It was a brown mare, with a star in her forehead.</p>

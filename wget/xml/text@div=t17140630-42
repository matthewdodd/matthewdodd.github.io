Four Surgeons, who were concer'd in the opening of the Body, depos'd, That they examin'd it as exactly as they could, and that there was no Bruise in any part of it, but that his Lungs were inflam'd, and stuck to his Chest, in which they found a Spoonful of Matter; from whence they gave their several opinions, that he dy'd of a Pluretick Fever; And Dr. Sloan, who visited him, declar'd upon Oath he was of the same Opinion, and prescrib'd him Medicines accordingly. The Prisoner said in his Defence, That the Coachman took him up, and carry'd him to Covent-Garden, and from thence to Coventry-street, at the upper end of the Haymarket, in doing which he was not half an Hour, and when he sat him down, he gave him 18d. but that he demanded 6 d. more, and was very insolent; whereupon he struck him a Blow or two; and the Deceas'd catching him by the Collar, tore his Linnen, and would have done him further Mischief; but he got clear of him, and then thrash'd him again; and that having taken the Number of his Coach, he readily told him, where he liv'd, but never heard anything of him till he was dead, and then this Prosecution was brought on, as he believ'd, to get Money out of him. The Cane was produc'd in Court, and sworn to be that which the Prisoner had with him that Day, which was a small light Thing, without a Ferril. and had been split about 3 Inches, two Months before this Accident happen'd, so there was no room to believe that could be the Instrument of such a Bruise as was set forth in the Indictment.

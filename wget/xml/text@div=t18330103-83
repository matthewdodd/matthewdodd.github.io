I was in the tap at Cranford bridge on the 9th of December; I went down there about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, and continued there till near six in the evening; I went down there to receive some money, and had been drinking but very little; the prisoners, Biggs and George, came in, as near as I can remember, about half-past three o'clock, and remained there till within a quarter of an hour of my going away - I was never in their company before - I cannot say whether Hodges was there; I went out a little before six o'clock, and went on towards Hounslow; I cannot exactly say the time, as the clock in the room did not go; as I came upon the bridge, going towards <placeName id="t18330103-83-crimeloc486">Hounslow</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many public-houses had you been to that night? A. Only that one, I am certain; it is the White Hart; I was in no other house before the robbery - I was not turned out of any public-house, and refused any liquor; I was not altogether sober, but was not drunk; I cannot say how much I drank, to a pint or two - I paid 1s. 6d. for it, but the prisoners had part of it; I recollect saying I was the best body-snatcher in England; I should not have said that, but when I came in Biggs said, "There is that body-snatcher;" George said, "I'll lay a pot of beer he never took a body in his life" - Biggs said, "Oh, Yes, he has many a score, ayn't you old boy?" I said, "Yes, to be sure, many a one," &amp;c.; I said so in order not to have any words; the tap-room was nearly full of people; I do not know the man I met on the bridge: I said to him,"Here they are coming," but it was some boys I mistook for them - I have a perfect recollection of all the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not cursing and swearing, and so tipsy that the man you spoke to left you to follow your own devices? A. No; I said to him, "Here are the b - rs coming who have robbed me;" the persons might be ten or twelve yards off at that time - I will not swear they were within five yards; the witness Williams is not the man I spoke to - it was a taller man; there might be a person behind the man I spoke to, but I only saw him - I was much more sober then, through the fright; I was not in the Hare and Hounds that night - I know Knivton, the landlord - it was not at his house I said I was a body snatcher.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are the White Hart and Hare and Hounds on the same side of the way? A. No - I am not certain that Hodges was there, but more than three partook of what I had.</p>

            . I deal in potatoes, and live at Cranford. I was on the bridge on Monday, the 9th of December, about seven o'clock at night; I cannot say whether the clock had struck or not; I saw the prosecutor on the bridge, and before he got to the bridge - I knew Hodges and Biggs from children - we are all neighbours together- I was going towards the bridge, and saw Hodges and Biggs; I live towards Hounslow, just before you come to the bridge - I saw them about two hundred yards, as near as I could guess: they came and walked by the side of me - I said to Hodges, "Jem, is that you?" and I said"Bill, is that you?" Biggs said Yes, and I tapped him on the shoulder; they passed me, and walked too fast for me -Hodges said, "He has got him in the road;" Hodges then set out running, and Biggs after him - I went near to them, and saw some man before they got up to the prosecutor, but I could not swear it was George; there were four together, and the three dragged the prosecutor on the bridge- as they drew him on the bridge, New said, "You are picking my pocket; "Hodges said "No, I am putting your handkerchief into your pocket;" they dragged him right on the top of the bridge - New had a white and black Newfoundland dog with him; Biggs asked where the strap was - I cannot tell what strap he meant; Biggs had the dog in his hand - as I passed close to them on the bridge I went a little way; I then stood and listened, and heard New halloo out, "You are picking my pocket - you are robbing me;" he cried very much at the time, and hallooed out, "You have got my money," and then he hallooed out Patrol! Patrol! six or seven times, and up came a postboy, Harry Burt, who lives at the bridge; I said, "Harry, let us go, perhaps they will drag him into the ditch;" we went up to the top of the bridge, to New, and Harry said,"Where are they?" they were gone then; New said,"Here they come;" there was a lot of boys coming along then, one of whom I saw in the yard to-day; the boys were not the persons who had been pulling New about - they were coming, and he thought it was the men coming along, and said, "Here they come back; I shall know them" - New was standing up when we got to him, he crossed the road to me - I said, "How much have they robbed you of?" he said 17s. and a watch - he was tipsy, but sensible - it was not very dark, it was moon-light -I did not interface to prevent it, because I knew if I had gone near them they would as soon have knocked me down as him; I went down to the White Hart to have a pint of beer at the tap, where the prosecutor had been, and told them what had happened - I told them the men's names.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a costermonger? A. Yes - I was not drinking at the White Hart, and never saw the prosecutor before: there was nobody on the road when I first saw them - they dragged him to the top of the bridge, about fifty yards from the houses, and one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards from the White Hart; I did not see Williams there - I know him; I do not think I met any body between the bridge and the White Hart; New did not point out two persons, and say "There are the two b-rs who robbed me;" if he did it was before I went up - Burt, the post-boy, and I went up together; I was quite sober.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol. I was on duty in the road near Cranford-bridge on the 19th of December about ten o'clock at night - I was called to disperse the three prisoners and another man, who were fighting. on the Hounslow-side of the bridge - they separated before I got up to them, Hodges and another man, insulted a man and woman, who were travelling on the footpath; the man stopped, looked at Hodges, and said,"I suppose you wish to serve me as you served that poor man on the bridge to-night, by drawing his money;" I then inquired whether there had been a robbery - I was informed there had been one, and that the prisoners were the three men; in consequence of what I heard, I went in pursuit of George and another, and found him at the White Hart-tap, and hearing a watch had been lost, I searched him, but found no watch - I left him then until I had seen the prosecutor; after I came off duty the prosecutor said he had lost a watch and about 10s. - I asked him why he did not make it known at the time that he had been robbed; his excuse was that he had some gold about him, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030052"></xptr>and my partner found two sovereigns in his pocket - he described the prisoners, and we apprehended them according to the description he gave; the robbery was on Sunday - I apprehended them on Monday; I took George again on the Monday, in Harlington, at work, and took him to the prosecutor, at the Halfway-house at Windsor; he said he was one, but he had a different dress on at that time - I did not take Hodges that night, as I had not seen the prosecutor; the other officer was with me on the Sunday evening - he apprehended the other two prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were called in consequence of their fighting with a man? A. They were fighting when I came up: the White Hart is about one hundred and fifty yards from the bridge - I found George there, but finding nothing on him, let him go; I found two sovereigns in New's breeches pocket - he said his silver was taken from his waistcoat pocket; he said he had received 13s. or 14s. at the White Hart, and it was all gone but half a crown, and he went away to make sure of his gold - I could see he had been on the ground; it was reported on the bridge that he had five sovereigns in his possession, but I did not hear him say so,</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know either of the prisoners before? A. Yes, and knew them from his description - he described one as tall, the other short, and that one man in a dark coat was stouter than the rest, and shorter than the other stout one; that description answered to the prisoner's- George had a dark coat on on the Sunday evening, and Biggs is stouter - he described Hodges as the tallest.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was with Emmerson on the Sunday night, when he saw the prosecutor; he described the persons who he said had robbed him, as Emmerson has stated - I apprehended Hodges and George in consequence of that description; I took Hodges at work at Cranford - he answered the prosecutor's description; I did not search him then - I brought him to the prosecutor, and asked if he knew him; he said, "Yes, I will swear to him - he was one of the men who robbed me;" I left him with my partner, and then went and took George, at Harlington, at work, cutting down a hedge, about half a mile from Cranford - I bought him to the prosecutor, who said,"That is another of them, I will swear to him;" I was with Emmerson when he apprehended Biggs on the Monday morning (before I took the others) - the prosecutor said, "He is one of them" - Emmerson searched Biggs; nothing was found on any of them.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN NEW re-examined. I had two sovereigns that night, in my left-hand breeches pocket - I had 6d. in my right-hand waistcoat pocket, and I think a 1d.; the silver I was robbed of, was three half-crowns and three shillings; they were in my left-hand waistcoat pocket - I felt George's hand in my waistcoat pocket; I had a Newfoundland dog with me, and missed the dog all at once; I thought it was gone down to the water under the bridge to drink - I was dragged some distance before I was robbed.</p>

            . I keep the Hare and Hounds, near Cranford-bridge. I know all three of the prisoners, and New perfectly well - I recollect the night of Sunday, when the alarm of the robbery was raised; before that the three prisoners and New were at my house: I am certain New was there, and will swear he was very much intoxicated - he was very abusive indeed: he wanted more drink; I told him I would not fill him any more, on account of his bad language, and bad behaviour - he was not fit to drink any more; he had had too much: he said he was the best body-snatcher in this country, there was no one equal to him - this was at my house; I heard an alarm of robbery the same Sunday night - he was at my house a little before six o'clock, between half-past five and six; my wife pressed him to go away several times, but he wanted to stop, and dropped his cap off, which I picked up, and put on his head as I wished him to go - my house is on the London side of Cranford-bridge: the White Hart is on the other side, on a different side of the road.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did he come to your house that evening? A. From half-past five to six o'clock; all three of the prisoners were there, two of them were in the house before he was (Hodges and Biggs), and when I had drawn them a pot of beer, New came in - George came in a few minutes after, they had conversation together; merely romancing with each other - I do not know on what occasion he said he was the best body-snatcher; they were talking with him about it, but did not ask him any questions about it - it was his own voluntary discourse; they all four went out of my house together, and went towards London - it was about six o'clock, as near as I can guess; I have seen New before, I do not know that I ever saw him in my house before - he gave me half a crown to pay for a pot of beer: he was only once in my house that day; he did not come back.</p>

            . I am a labourer.

As near six o'clock as I can guess, it might be five minutes after - I was about fifty yards from him, when he said, "Here are the two that robbed me;" I could not see him till I got upon the crown of the bridge - I do not know who he al luded to; I saw no boys about: when we came up he said we were the two who robbed him, but not before - but he was swearing when we were fifty yards off: I know Bonsey, I did not see him there - I saw a Newfoundland dog on the bridge with him; John Ayers was with me.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Harlington. On the night of the robbery I found New laying by the side of the road, very drunk - it was about half-past six o'clock; I took him to Hounslow: I drank part of two pints of beer with him - he went up to a woman, and wanted to shake hands with her, and asked her who she was, and where she was going; I pulled him away: he did not annoy her - he did not tell me he had been robbed; it was near half-past six o'clock when I found him, as near as I can say; I had no watch - I went to Hounslow with him, to the King William the Fourth, and left him there: he was very drunk - I wanted him to go, but he said as I had brought him so far, he would treat me with some drink, and insisted on my going in; I drank twice with him, and came out, leaving him there -I had seen him before, he used to cry oranges, coals, and fish, with his father when I knew him before; I think he changed 6d. when he treated me.</p>

            . I am a farmer and gardener. I have known George from a child; I always understood him to be an honest character - he worked for me until I left off farming six years ago; since that he has worked for a neighbour of mine - he has lived there the last two years, up to this time - he is willing to take him again.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN NEW. My Lord, Coleman told me he would get me my watch for half a crown last week; I was in the Coach and Horses, at Harlington, and several others of the prisoner's friends were in the house - I sat eating my bread and cheese, and this man was in liquor; he very much ill-used me, though I never said a word to any of them, and he said he knew where my watch was, and he would get it me if I gave him half a crown.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How many people were there? A. Seven or eight; I told Emmerson of it the same night.</p>

            . After seeing what I did, I left New on the bridge; I went to the White Hart, and stopped there about an hour - the prosecutor did not come back into the tap-room while I was there; he might have come into the house: neither of the prisoners came there while I was - I saw Biggs and Hodges, I think as near seven o'clock as I can guess; it might be earlier - I am sure it was after six; I should think it was about eight when I got back, after I came from the bridge - I left the bridge to go to the tap about seven o'clock; it was more than half-past six.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN NEW. I went to Hounslow after it happened; a man went with me to the George the Fourth - I staid at Hounslow till about a quarter after nine o'clock, and then went on towards home - after being robbed, I went to the White Hart tap to give an alarm, but did not go into the house; I then went on to Hounslow, which is my way home.</p>

On the 4th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in my kitchen, which joins the shop, and hearing a noise, I went to the door, and somebody exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"They are robbing your shop." There was a mob at the door. I went round to the window outside - (a pane of glass had been cracked, and mended with putty,) a piece of it had been moved on one side. I missed a pair of lady's boots, which had been near the pane - I had seen them there a little before three o'clock. The prisoner Fry was brought to me in two minutes by Hill; he was accused by Ryan, of putting his hand through my windows, and denied it, and said he had just come up Tothill-street, which is at the corner of my house.</p>

            . I am a constable. I came up to the prosecutor's shop almost immediately after this happened. Paterson said he had been robbed - Ryan pointed out Fry, who was mixing in the crowd. I took him, but found nothing on him. I did not see Ward there; I took him on the Sunday, in the Almonry.</p>

            . I was eleven years old in September last. On the night of the 4th of October, between seven and eight o'clock, I was running by the shop, and heard the noise of the glass breaking. I saw Ward with his hand in the window, and he had the glass in his hand. Fry and Ward were both standing together, and then they went to a post and stopped - Fry then went to the window, put his hand in, and took something out, and put it under his coat; he went over the way. I could not see what it was. I was just by the curb when I heard the glass break. Fry went over to the baker's shop, and gave the things from under his coat to another boy, (not Ward) - he came back, put his hand in the window again, and took something out; I could not tell what, and then went over and gave it to the same boy. I saw the window was quite close, and puttied the day before. There was a candle in the window.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230010"></xptr>I did not know them before. I am sure they are the boys.</p>

            . I am eleven years old. I was by Mr. Paterson's shop on this night, going on an errand. I saw Ward put his hand into the window; he then went into the middle of the road, and called another boy to him, who is not here. Fry followed him over to a tobacco shop - they stopped there; then both the prisoners came back to the window, and stood there. I saw no more. I did not see them take anything out. I did not see Fry's hand in the window. I was there all the time they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you said you saw Ward put his hand into the window, and take something out, but what you could not say - A. Yes. I did not see him take anything out.</p>

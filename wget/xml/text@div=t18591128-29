                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Dearlove of Uxbridge—the prisoner Jane was our servant for about three months prior to 31st October, when I discharged her—after she was gone I missed a black cloth mantle, a silver pencil case, 4 towels, 2 plates, some egg cups, and a variety of articles—I accompanied the policeman to John Robinson's house and saw the prisoner Eliza, who is Jane's mother—I asked if Jane was at home; she said she was, and called her, and Jane came forward—I saw a linen pocket hand<lb></lb>kerchief lying on the table—I said "That is mine," and gave it to the inspector—I saw a pair of drawers lying on the shelf, and said "Those are mine," and gave them to the inspector—Jane's box was searched in my presence, and contained a black silk mantle, a photographic portrait, 2 China crape shawls, a wool bag, a silk pocket handkerchief, a piece of glazed lining, a pink sash, a muslin collar, 7 books, 6 pieces of lace, a pincushion, and a lot of other things which were all mine—I had not given them to her</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector</hi>). On 8th November, I went with Mrs. Dearlove to John Robinson's house—I saw the prisoners; told them that I held a search warrant and produced it—after searching the corners of the room, I asked Jane where her box was—she said, "Up stairs"—I accompanied the mother and daughter up stairs, and asked them both if they had anything in the house which did not belong to them—Jane said, "Nothing;" she pointed out her box to me and gave me the keys—I unlocked it and found a pin cushion, a cloth mantle, a coloured handkerchief, a silver pencil-case, two table mats, a wool mat, a photographic portrait of Mrs. Dearlove, two china crape shawls, three pairs of embroidered sleeves, one d'oyley, six pieces of lace, a piece of embroidery, two diaper napkins, a pink sash, a muslin collar, one book, and one pair of drawers—I asked the mother how it could be possible for these things to be in her house without her knowing something of it, and that I should feel it my duty to search her boxes and look if she had anything that did not belong to her—she said, "No; everything that is there belongs to me," pointing to a large box in the corner of the room; and there was also another box in the room, which she claimed—I searched them both, and found these four towels marked with Mrs. Dearlove's initials, one pillow-case, live pairs of childrens' drawers marked, two pinafores, a night-cap marked, a night-shirt marked, a white frock, an embroidered collar, two pieces of embroidery, a piece of new chintz, three brown holland jackets, a calico chemise marked, six china-plates, a china cup and saucer, a dessert-plate, two table-covers, two pairs of socks marked, a boy's shirt, and a coloured frock, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I showed them separately to Mrs. Dearlove as I found them, and she identified them—on further searching the room I found a counterpane, a pair of gloves, two pieces of crape, a shawl, a pair of Angola socks, and also a number of articles which there was a doubt about at the time—they were shown to Mrs. Dearlove, and she said they were her's—I told Eliza that I should take her in custody for receiving them, knowing them to be stolen—she said that she knew nothing about it; Jane told her that she had them given to her—I took her in custody and then made a further search, and found in a tea-caddy in the room down stairs seven duplicates; among which was one for a sheet and a shirt, pledged for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I obtained them, and Mrs. Dearlove identified them—there was another on August 8th for three shirts, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; one on 19th September for a sheet and table-cover, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; one on 27th September for a black silk handkerchief and a remnant of silk, for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; one on 24th October of a table-cloth for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; one on 25th October of two shirts for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and one on 17th October of a table-cloth for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was advanced altogether—the whole of the articles stolen was valued at 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

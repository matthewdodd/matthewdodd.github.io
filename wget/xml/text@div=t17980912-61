               <p>Prisoner. What kind of a coat had I on? - A. In Oxford-road he had a blue coat on, when I saw him before he had no coat on, he had a jacket and an apron on; there was a boy saw him talking to me at Newman-street, and another boy, and I asked them to go to the office, and they said, no, they would be out of the mess.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man that took the coat? - A. Yes; it was a good while ago, but I knew him as soon as ever he came up to me when I had the cloth.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. What coloured coat did the boy say I had on? - A. He said you had a brown coat on, he made several hesitations about it, he was not quite certain.</p>

               <p>Q. You have not told us a word of his running away? - A. A young man laid hold of him from me, and asked him what business he had to stop or be taken, and he ran away down Poland-street, and there he was stopped by a constable, and then I went back with him to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Hammond.) Did you ever say any thing about his having a brown coat? - A. No; I went into the crowd, and said, it was a blue coat; this Mr. Brown has been to see him in Clerkenwell prison.</p>

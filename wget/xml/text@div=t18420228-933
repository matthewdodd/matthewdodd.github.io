                  </hi>. I am a master-carrier, living at Hornchurch, in Essex—I have employed the prisoner between six and seven years occa<lb></lb>sionally, to take care of my cart—I have employed him for three days at a time. On the 4th of January I gave him one sovereign, a half-crown, and a shilling, to pay for half-a-ton of salt—he was to go with another man to Bridge-wharf, City-road, to buy the salt—I do not know what became of him till the 15th of February, when I saw him at Lambeth-street—I do not know what became of the money—the man knowing who the salt was for, sent it by the other man who I sent with the cart.</p>

On the 4th of January I had orders from the prosecutor to go with the prisoner to get half-a-ton of salt—I saw the prosecutor give the prisoner a sovereign, half-a-crown, and a shilling to pay for the salt—I and the prisoner set off with the cart—he told me he was going to get half-a-pint of coffee, and said he would follow me down to the wharf—I went down to the wharf, and loaded the salt—I went on—he did not follow me—I did not see him again that day—I got the salt, and took it home—I did not pay the money.</p>

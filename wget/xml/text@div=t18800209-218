                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I am a sailor, a Russian Fin—on 20th January I was living at a boarding-house in High Street, Shadwell—about 12.30 that night I was going with a girl—I met the two prisoners; Hurley caught hold of me by the throat, and Murphy put his hand in my right trousers pocket, and took out my purse, containing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I struck them and knocked them down, and picked up my purse from the ground, but the money was gone—the prisoners got up and ran away—I had had my purse and money safe about five minutes before—I ran after them, and came up to Murphy; the policeman had hold of him—I did not lose sight of them; I am quite sure they are the men—I was quite sober—I had a knife in my pocket; I did not take it out or use it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Hurley.</hi> I am sure it was you caught hold of my neck; you came from behind, and caught me by the throat—I kicked you, and you ran away—I struck you, and you fell down—I found my purse bout a yard from where you ran away; it was closed—you did not say I had stabbed Murphy—I can't recollect whether he was bleeding.</p>

Between 12 and 1 o'clock on the morning of 21st January I heard a disturbance in Cable Street, and saw the prisoners in Antony Street; Hurley was at the corner of Cornwall Street—I did not know him before—he said that he would give the prose<lb></lb>cutor, who came up with Murphy, in custody for stabbing Murphy—I could not understand the prosecutor—I asked him if he had a knife; he said "No," as I understood, and slipped a knife inside his trousers, which fell on the ground closed—there was blood on Murphy's eye, which appeared rather like the cut of a knife—Hurley was urging Murphy to give him in custody for stabbing him, and the prosecutor was trying to explain some<lb></lb>thing all the time, but I could not understand him, and Murphy said that he would not charge him—the prosecutor took his purse out of his pocket and threw it on the ground, and by signs explained to me how he had been robbed; I thought he meant that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was taken—I took Hurley in custody—Murphy had gone away—I wrote this down afterwards; Hurley said "I should not remain here and talk to you if I had done it"—Brown and I went to the Great Eastern Chambers, which is a common lodging-house, and took Murphy in custody there—Hurley said to him at the station "Through being in your company I have got into this"—Murphy made no answer, and they were both locked up—the prosecutor appeared quite sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Hurley.</hi> You wanted Murphy to charge the prosecutor, and I said "Go away"—when he took out his purse he opened it and threw it on the ground, and then I understood that he had been robbed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 311). I came up to where the last witness was—Hurley was there talking to the prosecutor, and Murphy came up a second or two afterwards—Hurley said "Give him in charge, George, for stabbing you"—Murphy said "No, I will forgive him," and went away—the prosecutor then complained, in Hurley's presence, of losing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—as well as I could understand him, he said "These two men came up, Hurley caught me by the back of the neck, and Murphy put his hands in my pockets, and took my purse out and my 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said that he picked the purse up off the ground—I did not see it thrown on the ground—he did not show it till we got to the station—I went with Robert Brown to Great Eastern Chambers, took Murphy, and told him the sailor charged him with the other man of robbing him of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said "Why should not he forgive me for robbing him, when I forgave him for stabbing me?"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I took them down—there was a little blood on you, not much; it might have been from your being struck by a fist—I found 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on you—the prosecutor was perfectly sober—you were not running when I met you—you turned back when you saw me and the prosecutor together—you were bleeding from your eye—you did not say "This man has stabbed me"—you said "Give him in charge, George, for stabbing you," and he said "No, I will forgive him for what he has done"—the other policeman told you to go away, and Hurley said "Lock him up"—you never said "He has stabbed me"—when the prosecutor's knife was picked up he said that he never struck you with a knife, but that the knife belonged to him—I went to the door of the lodging-house and said "Where is the man who has got his eye cut 1"—you shouted out "Here I am," and I said "You will have to come to the station with me," and you said "I will forgive the man, 1 don't wish to lock him up; he ought to forgive me for robbing him."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prosecutor said that he had no knife, but the police<lb></lb>man picked the knife up at the same time—I wrote this as soon as I got to the station, and it has been filed there ever since—I have not read it through.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoners' Statements before the Magistrate. Hurley says:</hi> "A girl was present with the man, and she saw whether I attempted to jump on the man's back. The prosecutor is swearing my life away. I tried to stop him from cutting Murphy, and he hit me and knocked me down, but when 1 was asked to give the prosecutor in charge I did not touch him. He shut up the knife when he saw the constable." Murphy says: "I have got nothing to say. What the prosecutor says is false. I want my witnesses to prove that the prosecutor was blind drunk."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Murphy in his defence stated that the prosecutor, who was with a girl, pushed against him, and he said "what are you doing?" and the pro<lb></lb>secutor pulled out a knife and cut him across the eye, which bled a. great deal, but he could not say whether the knife was open or shut. That he went to the station with the policeman, thinking he was wanted to charge the pro<lb></lb>secutor, but denied saying anything about forgiving him for robbing him. Hurley stated that the prosecutor was telling lies to save himself from being locked up, and that he had never been locked up before.</hi>

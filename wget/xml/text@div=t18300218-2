On the 2nd of February, about seven o'clock in the evening I was in a parlour behind the shop - my shop door was on the latch; it was closed - the windows were all safe and unbroken at five o'clock - about seven some young men were thumping at the door; I went out, and they gave me information - I had seen Douglass' paper shortly before; a person breaking the window could get at it; on receiving the information, I went to the window, and found it was broken; a small pile of paper, and a small pile of books were knocked down, and part of the paper was gone - I could not speak to the precise number of quires, but about the same quantity has been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any other Christian name? A. No - I am in the habit of selling in Douglass' shop; I am his son-in-law, and act as his assistant - there is no private mark on the paper - the dwelling-house is mine.</p>

            . I am an officer of Walbrook. About seven o'clock on the evening in question, I received information that a window was broken in Budge-row - I was on duty; I pursued, and apprehended the prisoner in Size-lane, about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's house - I took him to the house, and then to the watch-house; I searched him, and in his hat found this writing paper, and a crooked wire, this is note paper - the wire would draw any thing out of a shop, or perhaps a gentleman's pocket, or go through a bolt hole; he gave no account how he got the paper - it was claimed by Mr. Douglass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear him claim it? A. Yes; I have been twisting this wire since I found it - I did not hear Douglass say any thing about a private mark on the paper; he claimed it as his, and said he had lost it from the window - it was loose, and not in any wrapper.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you found the wire in the prisoner's hat, was it fixed to this bit of stick, as it is now? A. Yes, and the hook was at the end of it - I have only bent it in the middle.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This would hook out a quire of paper, would it? A. I do not suppose it would; the wire has been nealed in the fire - it would not make a mark unless it was dirty.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH DOUGLASS. I saw this paper next day at the Mansion-house - it is small note paper, and is mine, there are four quires and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe there is no water-mark on it? A. There is on some of it - here is, "Simmons, 1827;" he is an extensive maker - it is the same make, and the same stamp as mine; I always have mine stamped"Superfine Bath."</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have claimed it if you had seen it on the table of an inn ten miles off? A. No, certainly - I might have bought it six months before; I have taken stock since, and have not sold four quires and a half of this altogether; I value it at 1s.</p>

            . I live at No. 20, Tooley-street - I am now out of place; I lived with an optician. I was in Budge-row on the 2nd of February, and saw two men at Mr. Matthews' window, and as I walked past I heard the glass crack: that was while the two men were at the window - I walked back, and saw one man put his hand in and take out some paper; the other man said to me,"How do you do?" I saw the man who took it at the Mansion-house two days after, and knew him again - it was the same man as put his hand into the window; the prisoner is that man; I gave information to an officer who I saw in the street, and was present when he laid hold of him - I am sure he laid hold of the same man as put his hand into the window; I did not lose sight of him before the officer took him - the other man ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to say, the next time you saw him was two days after at the Mansion-house? A. Because they did not come for me to go there the next day; I saw him taken, and had never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you went away to get an officer? A. I was going home, and told the officer; I left him by the window; I found the officer about two hundred yards off; I turned my back on them to go to find the officer - I lost sight of them during that time; I mean I never lost sight of him while we were running after him - I had never seen either of them before they were at the window; I did not stop at the window - I walked on; I did not walk very quick; I was about five minutes going to the officer- both the men wore hats; the other had a red neckhandkerchief, and had got it round his mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. You paid more attention to him than to the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180006"></xptr>soner? A. He came up and spoke to me; I observed him the most - I do not think I could swear to him if I saw him, but I saw the prisoner at the watch-house, and saw him running away; he could have got away if he liked while I was going for the officer - I am turned thirteen years old.</p>

            . I saw the paper at the Mansion-house; it appears to make up the quantity missing, as near as I can judge - I am sure about that quantity of paper was there about five o'clock, after that I cannot state; it was not in any wrapper - there was an outside quire, which is very much soiled.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does nobody but yourself sell in the shop - does not your wife? A. Occasionally - she is not here; I had been at home from five o'clock - whatever is sold is entered in a book, which is not here - it is possible for a trifle not to be entered, but I do not call a quire of paper a trifle - it is 1s. a quire; it would come to 4s. to sell retail - I have no mark on it; no doubt there are thousands of quires of the same sort.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had any of this paper ever been sold? A. No - that portion of paper had never been disturbed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking up Budge-row towards home, and saw the paper laying in the kennel -I picked it up, and put it into my hat, not knowing the value of it; in two or three minutes I heard a cry of Stop thief!

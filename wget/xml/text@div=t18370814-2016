                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Hillier. The prisoner was in my employ to nurse me when I was ill—about the 20th of June I lost a cap, towel, half a yard of jean, and a handkerchief—these are the things I lost.</p>

               <p>I lent her the towel to defend her, as the called me to the back garden when the officer found the things, and begged of me not to own them—the cap was washed, starched, and rough dried, preparatory to being ironed, when it was found—I value this at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she did not say she had it to wash, and would not return it till I paid another shilling—she never had it to wash for me—this is the piece of jean, it is worth 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this handkerchief 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—all these things were put by rough dried—I had two collars belonging to the prisoner that she gave me—she asked for them again, and I returned them—she asked me for a pair of gloves.</p>

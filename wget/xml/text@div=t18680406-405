                  </hi>. I live with my father, an engineer, at 9, New Street, Rotherhithe—on Thursday morning, 26th March, I was sleeping in the house, which was not quite finished; only a few articles were brought in—I was awoke about 6.30 or 6.45, and saw the prisoners in my room, standing by the drawers—the furniture was all in the room where I was, but there were some tools downstairs—I asked them what they were doing there—they said they had only been having a sleep downstairs—I said that they had better <hi rend="italic">slope</hi>, and they went out and slammed the door—I dressed and went down, but could see nothing of them—I sent my brother,</p>

On Saturday morning, 23rd Dec., I was at work in my premises, in Barrow's-place, at half past 6 o'clock—my premises are opposite Mr. Harris's warehouse—my attention was attracted by a noise of footsteps walking on the pathway—I went in at a side door of my shop, looked, and saw the small door of Mr. Harris's harness room open—it opens into the street—I saw a person there, there might have been two—I went to the station, and gave information.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Haddon-street, Waterloo-road, and am a rag merchant. I have a warehouse in Barrow's-place—the gate of the harness room opens into the street—there is a bar placed across the door; it goes into a square hole on one side, and on the other into a hook—any one could open the gate by inserting a knife from the outside, and lifting up the bar—the harness room leads to the stable; over that is a hay loft, in which there is an opening, which was formerly a window, and through that you could get into the warehouse, where I had rags of all descriptions—on 23rd Dec. a policeman came, and I went to my warehouse—I found the gates closed, and the bar down in its place—I got the keys of the stable, and my son and the policeman went in—neither of the prisoners had any right to be there—the carman, Durrant, should have come about 8 or 9 o'clock that morning, to clean and feed his horse—Randall had no business there at all, as we never have any work done on the sabbath.</p>

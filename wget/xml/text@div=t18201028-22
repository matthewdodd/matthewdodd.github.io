On the 30th of September, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw a gun being taken out of the shop - the door leads into the passage. I ran to the door and laid hold of the prisoner, the gun was then in the passage, and he was close to it - he denied taking it. Paytou came, he then asked for Gibson, who was called down, and said he had seen him once or twice. The prisoner was asked what he had to say to him? he hesitated, and said it was about his wife.</p>

About half an hour before the prisoner was taken, I was going to the Gloucester Coffee-house, and saw the prisoner about my master's door, he asked if that was Mr. Manton's? I said Yes. He asked if Gibson worked there, and said he wanted to speak to him. I told the clerk, and then came out and said he was not at work. He walked away.</p>

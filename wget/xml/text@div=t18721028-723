                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 26th August; about 1.30, I saw the prisoner and another man in Broad Street; I watched them in a crowd in front of a shop window, and saw the prisoner feel several gentle<lb></lb>men's pockets—they then went to London Wall, where some persons were assembled in front of a music shop—the man not in custody placed him<lb></lb>self on the right side of a gentleman, and Lynch stood behind; they left in half-a-minute rather hurriedly—I spoke to Mr. Kerzey, who made a commu<lb></lb>nication to me—the men proceeded to Spitalfields, where I saw Burroughs, and told him the two men I wanted, and at that time we saw them crossing the road—Burroughs went one way and I went another, to each end of a court which goes from Fashion Street to Flower and Dean Street—Burroughs took Drissell, but he succeeded in getting away; the mob was so great that I was obliged to let him go to save myself from being injured.</p>

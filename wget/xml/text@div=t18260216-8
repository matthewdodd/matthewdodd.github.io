            . I am head constable of Worship-street-office. On Wednesday, the 25th of January, I received information at the office, which I communicated to the Magistrate, who directed me to go to Mr. Edward Lawson's house, <placeName id="t18260216-8-crimeloc43">Brown's-lane, Spitalfields</placeName>

We proceeded to the front of the house in Brown's-lane - it was shut up - we went to the side door, in a wall in Corbett's-court, leading to the back premises; there is a yard on the other side of the wall - Armstrong tried to obtain admittance at the side door, but no answer was given; at that time I heard a great noise, as if they were placing heavy articles against the door. I went into Mr. Bennison's hay-loft, adjoining the premises, and looked through several holes into Lawson's premises, saw eight or ten persons walking up and down Lawson's second floor loft, which adjoins Mr. Bennison's loft - it is an open loft, where they dry leather; the holes were so small I could not ascertain how many there were; I heard a great noise, as if they were moving tables to the side of the shed, to barricade it - that hindered our view. Attfield called me to look through a hole - I there saw a pole, with something at the end of it, standing against a post in the shed; Armstrong had a dog which went through one of the holes, as far as his head and shoulders - it immediately yelped and drew back - next morning I found it had received a cut in the right shoulder; we then left the loft; I went to the office, to Mr. Bennett, and on returning, met Armstrong, and from what he said, I went with him, Kennedy, Attfield, and several officers, into the hay-loft again. I looked through a hole, and saw several men in the loft; I asked them to kneel down that I might speak to them more conveniently - two of them did so; I told them what I had come about, and charged them, in the King's name, to aid and assist; after that I left the loft, went to the side door, got my officers round, and ordered them to draw their cutlasses, which they did - there were eight of us - but I had no cutlass at that time. I tried to break open the side door with two crow bars, but could not succeed. I fetched a ladder from Mr. Bennison's yard, and placed it against the top of the wall - Armstrong immediately went up the ladder, with his warrant in his left hand, and his constable's staff in his right, and when he got to the top of the ladder I observed a pole, with a sharp instrument at the end of it, jobbing at his head and neck - he standing on the ladder, with his head above the wall; the jobbing was repeated, and he parried it off as well as he could; Hanley then gave Armstrong a pistol, which he fired. I then heard a noise in front of the house, and immediately went to see what was the matter; I saw the first floor window up, and a female standing there - she said to the mob"My brother is shot, why don't you come forward and protect him;" she then put the window down, and withdrew. I went to the office, and as I returned met the officers in Spital-square, with the prisoners, and one of Lawson's men in custody; I took them to the office, and sent for a surgeon to Lawson, who had a slight wound in the thigh, as I afterwards found. Vann, Hanley, Attfield, and I, returned to the premises, and in different parts of the premises found twenty-four of these poles, with sharp instruments at the end of them; also fourteen currier's knifes, with the cross ends broken off. In front of the house were currier's tables heaped up from the floor to the ceiling, and behind them were hogsheads, filled with bricks and stones - it was blockaded every where to prevent access.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had your first communication with the Magistrate any thing to do with the execution of the assault warrant? A. No; my instructions were to fetch away the placard - the Magistrate afterwards ordered me to go and execute the assault warrant. I believe it was granted on the 29th of December - it was the duty of the officer who had it to execute it immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not arranged that you should use this warrant as the ostensible reason of your going there, when your real reason was on account of the placard, and the people being gathered? A. I received my instructions from the Magistrate, and cannot state their reasons. I had no warrant when I went to take the placard down, and did not then know of the house being fastened furthen then the shutters being up; I had not heard that it was barri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160011"></xptr>caded. I had heard that Lawson had turned the taxgatherer and exciseman out. I stood about two yards from the bottom of the ladder when Armstrong went up- the wall is above twelve feet high; the ends of the ladder were a foot or more above the wall. Armstrong's head and shoulders, and part of his breast and arms, were above the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not go up the lndder with a cutlass in his hand? A. I will not, for my attention was divided with the men above and below; I saw his hands scuffling with the pole, but will not swear whether he had a cutlass or not. I did not hear him say "I have killed one man, and now give me another pistol."</p>
               <p>JOSHUA ARMSTRONG. I am an <rs id="t18260216-8-viclabel44" type="occupation">officer</rs>

On the 29th of December this warrant was given to me to execute against Edward Lawson (read); I attempted to put it in force several times but could not, because the premises were shut up. On the 25th of January Mr. Twyford and Mr. Bennett inquired about it - I said I could not find the man; they directed Garton to take all the officers with him; I went with them; I went into Mr. Bennison's loft, and, after remaining there some time, Adams and Hanley came, and in about twenty minutes Adams pointed out Edward Lawson to me in the loft - several others were there; the warrant was then in my hand; I said "Mr. Lawson, I have a warrant against you for assaulting and beating Mr. William Smith;" there is an open board all along the loft, about nine inches wide - I read it through the hole quite loud, and mentioned my name, with the name of every officer with me, and then said "Mr. Lawson, if you will give me your word, as a gentleman, that you will come to the office with two housekeepers, and put in bail, we will leave, and send the mob away;" he said "I will not;" I said I would give him ten minutes to consider of it, and if he did not I would break open the promises. He said "You may do as you like;" I then went down from the hay-loft, with the other officers, to the side door in Corbett's-court. Two of Lawson's men were on the wall; I told one to come down and I would shew him the warrant; he came down and read it; I assisted him over the wall, to acquaint Lawson; I waited ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, then kicked the door loudly, and knocked twenty or thirty times - a ladder was then brought - it reached about four feet above the wall; I went up with my warrant in my left hand and my staff in the right - I had nothing else. When I got to the top of the wall I perceived Mr. Edward Lawson and three men, in the yard - the prisoner, James Lawson, was one of them; but I did not then know who he was. I said "Mr. Lawson, here is the warrant against you, and surrender;" he had a long pike in his hand - this is the very one (pointing it out); it has a knite at the end of it- he pushed at me, and the first push missed me; he gave a second push, aiming at the hand with the warrant in it, and cut my hand just at the back of my little finger - it went into the palm of my hand - he pushed at my head and body, and pushed at me four or five times afterwards - he did not say a word to me, nor I to him, during this time. The wound did not affect me at all - it bled for two or three hours - he made two or three other thrusts at me - one came very near my head - I warded it off with my staff - Vann was at the bottom of the ladder, and said"Josh, why don't you shoot him?" I said I had no pistol - Hanley came half way up the ladder, and gave me one - it was ready cocked; I saw Lawson making another attempt at me, and I shot him; he ran backward into his house - I thought he was stunned - he staggered - I said"I have shot him, but keep on breaking the wall that we may apprehend him." In less than two minutes he came out of the house, and said "Armstrong, you have shot me;" he then took up the pike which he had left against the wall; I said "Ah, and if you come out of that door I will shoot you again;" his brother was walking about, close to him, with his hands in his pockets - he had never offered to come near at all. The wall was nearly broken down, and Edward Lawson said "Armstrong, come down and I will surrender to you;" I said "Put that pike out of your hand, and I will;" he gave it to his brother, who came to the door and gave it to Vann. I said to the officers "Mr. Lawson has surrendered to me - I will go in;" I jumped off the ladder; he said "I put myself under your protection," and walked to the office with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You shook hands together? A. Yes, and drank together. I received the warrant on the evening it was signed. Mr. Smith never directed me to withdraw it; about a week after it was issued he told me the business was in the hands of the commissioners, and I had no occasion to execute it. I did not see him afterwards till Lawson was in custody; if I had met Lawson in the street I should have taken him, because the Magistrates never allow an officer to discharge a warrant; it was the same warrant as I at first received, for I kept it all the time - when warrants are discharged we file them in the office, but never destroy them.</p>
               <p>Q. James was walking about with his hands in his pocket - was he in agitation? A. He was, and he appeared interfering to prevent any thing; he spoke to the men, and they went away; he spoke to his brother several times - I cannot say what he said, but there is no doubt of his wishing his brother to give in.</p>

            . On the 25th of January I went with Garton and other officers to Mr. Lawson's premises - we at last forced through the door in Corbet's-court, got into the yard, and saw both the prisoners there; we brought away two or three pikes from the yard; I seized James Lawson, took hold of a pike which stood in the yard, and said to him, "You villain, what made you use such a villainous instrument as this?" he said, "I thought," or "I considered I had a right to do it, in defence of my brother"- he made no resistance.</p>

I accompanied the others to execute this warrant - I stood at the door in Corbett's-court, with my cutlass; some persons were breaking the door down with crow-bars, and as soon as a hole was broken through at the bottom a spike darted through the hole, and went very near the legs of the person who was breaking the wall down; he broke the knife off the end of it with the crow-bar. On the 30th of January I saw Edward Lawson in the public-house next door to the office - some conversation took place, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160012"></xptr>said he was very sorry we did not fire at the first onset, for if we had, his men would all have been staunch to him - I mentioned to him about the spear coming through the hole in the wall - he said, "That was me - the knife was broken off, and I got another spear."</p>

I made my escape through the window into a neighbour's house.</p>

            . I am a brush-maker, and live at the corner of Corbett's-court - my premises overlook a great part of Lawson's. On the 25th of January I saw the officer come, with some papers in his hand; I stood at my window, which was open, opposite the wall where the ladder was placed; the window is on the ground floor, but a little elevated, as the pavement is above the road; I was above many of the people's heads. When the ladder was brought I saw Armstrong go up, with the papers in his hand; the ladder projected above the wall, and while he was going up I saw a dirty looking pole put up, from behind the wall; the person using it was endeavouring to push the ladder aside from the wall; this was while Armstrong was going up, for he slipped in going up - the pole worked up and down to catch the step of the ladder; when Armstrong got to the top of the ladder I saw him perfectly clear - he had his staff slung on his wrist, and a cutlass in his hand, and in his left hand were some papers - the staff hung on his wrist, by a piece of string, and the moment he got to the top he cut at the pole, and hit it, and, I think, he cut it; he then grasped at the pole with his left hand, and caught it in his hand at the third grasp; he immediately let go, and turned his hand round to shew his brother officers, and I saw the blood - I am certain he got the cut by grasping at the pole; his shoulders were not above the wall; he had to raise himself to chop at the pole; he peeped as it were into the yard; his head was a little above the wall; there was nothing to prevent their poking the pike into his face if they were so disposed; he came half way down the ladder, and got a pistol from another officer.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Armstrong's back was to you? - A. Yes. I am quite positive he had a cutlass in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when he came down the ladder for a pistol, in which hand did he take it? A. I am not certain, but he had it in his right hand when he went up; he shifted the cutlass out of his right hand under his arm; when he got to the top of the ladder he had the pistol and cutlass also, both in one hand; I cannot say where the staff was then; it hung to his wrist when he cut at the pole.</p>

            . I am a plumber. I was in the street when the officers came to Mr. Lawson's door - I went up to the first floor window of a neighbour's house, which is opposite, about thirty yards from the house, and could see plainly - I was about two feet higher than the wall; the ladder was placed considerably above the wall; I then saw a pole, with some instrument at the end, pushed against the ladder, trying to push it away; the shoulder part came against the step of the ladder - this was before the officer went up. I then saw Armstrong run up very fast - he slipped in going up, he ran so fast; he had a cutlass in his right hand, a staff and a paper in his left; I saw nothing in his right hand but the cutlass; I was looking at him in an oblique direction; his left arm was nearest to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it easy for you to tell in that direction whether the staff was on his right or left arm? A. I think so; immediately as he got to the top he saw the pole, and made a cut at it; he attempted to cut it again, and with his left hand tried to catch at something, and succeeded in grasping it - he immediately turned round, and said something to the people, and came down partly; a pistol was handed to him, which he afterwards fired.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was his head above the wall? A. About midway.</p>
               <p>Mr. BOLLAND. Q. What did he do with the catlass when he took the pistol? A. I think he had both in one hand, but I was agitated at the time, and seeing the pistol I directed my eye down into the yard, to see the consequence. I live in Lamb-street; I have nothing to do with the prisoner, except being a creditor of his.</p>

            . I am fifteen years old, and live with my mother, next door to these premises. I was at our first floor back window, looking into Lawson's yard, and saw a sword or cutlass and a staff in the officer's right hand, and a paper in the left; as he ascended the ladder I saw a staff slinging, I think, to his right wrist; I was about five yards from where Lawson stood; when the ladder was put to the wall Edward Lawson put up a pole, and pushed it, before Armstrong shewed himself on the wall, and when he came up Lawson put up the pole two or three times, as with intent to push at the ladder; Armstrong tried to lay hold of the pole, and at last he laid hold of the knife part of it, and tried to wrest it from Lawson's hand - Lawson held it fast, but did not attempt to pull it away; Armstrong let go, and his hand bled; he descended the ladder, and returned with the pistol; he cocked it when he was on the wall.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What did he do with the cutlass when he took the pistol in his hand? A. I believe he took it in his right hand, which had the cutlass; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160013"></xptr>were both in his right hand - he had nothing in the left when he fired.</p>
               <p>Q. If he held both in his right hand how could he cock the pistol? A. He fell back, and pulled the cock back cautiously, for fear the pole should come up again.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was there any thing to prevent Lawson stabbing him in his head or breast? A. Nothing - he did not attempt it, but lodged the pole on the wall, and pushed it two or three times.</p>

            . I am a scale-maker, and live in Brown's-lane. I was on Lawson's back wall, which parts his premises from Butcher's; I heard something said about a ladder, and saw one three or four feet above the wall; I could only see the part which was above the wall; I could see into Lawson's yard - I saw him take up a pole to shove the ladder aside; I then saw Armstrong get up the ladder, and make a chop at the pole with his cutlass; he then put his hand out to try and catch hold of the pole once or twice, and at last caught hold of it - I observed nothing further.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What were you doing on the wall? A. Looking on, the same as others; I was not on Lawson's premises before I got on the wall. I saw the pistol in Armstrong's hand on the top of the wall; I do not know whether he had it in his right or left hand; the pistol was in one hand, and the cutlass and staff in the other. I am certain he had a cutlass or sword, and his staff on his wrist.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Lamb-street, Spitalfields. I was in Brown's-lane, at the top of Corbett's-court, about thirty feet from the spot, and saw the ladder put against the wall - the spear was put up with a view, as I thought, of putting away the ladder, or to intimidate any person from coming up. I saw Armstrong ascend the ladder, with a cutlass in his hand, and, I believe, a staff; I am positive of the cutlass - I was on his left side. The moment he reached the top of the wall he chopped at the spear, and then made a grasp at it with his left hand, and at last got hold of it; he let go, shook his hand, and I saw a stain of blood; he then received a pistol from below, and fired it over the wall, with his right hand. I saw him cock it first.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What did he do with the cutlass? A. I will not swear what he did with it - he cocked the pistol with the thumb of the same hand as he had it in.</p>

            . I am a silk manufacturer, and live in Brown's-lane, directly opposite Mr. Lawson's. I was present all the time the officers were there, in my first floor room, directly opposite Corbett's-court. I was about twenty yards from the ladder, and was on the second floor part of the time. When the ladder was put against the wall I saw a pike put up, and on Armstrong's ascending it was slightly moved - he then struck at it with a sword or dagger, once or twice, and then grasped it with his left hand; he let go, reached down, and received a pistol from a brother officer, and fired; his head and shoulders were above the wall when he cut at the pike; they could have struck at his head or body; I think I could have run it through his body if I had been there; I was astonished he did not strike it through his head; it appeared to be directed strait to his head - it only appeared to be placed there for defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. BOLLAND. Q. Which hand did he take the pistol in? A. The right - I think he still held the cutlass, but really I cannot say; I could not see whether the pistol was cocked. The pike being so long I was astonished he did not run it through his head, having an opportunity to do it.</p>

            . I am a brush-maker, and live at No. 59, Crown-street, Westminster. I was by Lawson's premises when the officers were there; I was in Mr. Gardener's workshop, where I work, and could see where the ladder was placed; I saw a pole, with a knife at the end of it, put up; Armstrong got to the top, and called out for somebody to hold it, for attempts were then making to poke it away; after that he made two or three cuts at it with his cutlass - he then ascended higher, and grasped at the pole, to wrest it away; he turned his hand round, and I perceived it all over blood; he came down, and received a pistol, which he fired.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Had he any thing in his left hand? A. When he first went up the ladder I believe he had the cutlass in his right hand, and the staff in his left, and, I think, the warrant was in his right; he fired the pistol with his right hand. I believe he had given the cutlass and warrant to the person below.</p>

             re-examined. I cocked the pistol myself, and then handed it to Armstrong; he had his staff and warrant in his left hand then - I believe he shifted his staff from his right to his left hand, to take the pistol - he had no cutlass then; one was handed up the ladder to him after he fired the pistol.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did Garton order you all to draw your cutlasses? A. Yes, when he had broken in - I believe we all drew them. After he had fired he came down and gave me the pistol; I had no ammunition, and shortly after handed him up my cutlass; I had not seen him with one of his own; he beat at the pike with his staff.</p>

               <p>I attend the rotation-office in White-Chapel. On Sunday the 23d of November, I was informed by a man that three suspicious persons were gone into the Bull with three bundles. I looked through the window, and saw Cloak and Hawes in the room. I went in and asked where the 3 d man was, they said he was gone up stairs. I desired them not to let any one out. I went up stairs, and saw Minsher in the chamber with three bundles. I told him he was my prisoner. I secured them. Hawes asked to be admitted an evidence. He took me to No. 10, in New-Court, Fleet-Market, where we found the rest of the silk. I locked up the prisoners, and the next morning I saw the silk advertised.</p>

               <p>Cloak, and Minsher, and I were at the sign of the Butcher's Arms in Chick-Lane; we agreed to go out together. We saw a coachman take a hamper down the inn-yard. When the coachman and the man went down the yard, Minsher opened the other door of the coach and took the truss out. We went to No. 10, in New-Court, Fleet-Market, with it. We afterwards took it to the Bull in Petticoat-Lane to dispose of, and there we were secured.</p>

               <p>While I was sitting in a public house Hawes came up to m e. He asked me to take a walk with him. I went with him to No. 10, New-Court, Fleet-Market. He tied some silk up in a handerchief of Cloak's. He told me he got the silk from on board a ship. I went with him to the Bull in Petticoat-Lane.</p>

               <p>I met Hawes. He asked me to have part of a pot of beer with him. I went with him to the Bull's-Head. I never saw him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a meat salesman in Newgate-market. I know the prisoner—I also know the brothers of the prisoner's wife, George and Henry Bond; they are highly respectable farmers in Leicestershire—the prisoner brought me this bill two months back yesterday, it was just in the state it now is—I paid him 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it; 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 8th Dec., and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 23rd—I have the cancelled cheques—(<hi rend="italic">The bill was at two months, drawn by Thomas Stevenson, and accepted by George Bond and Henry Bond, payable at Messrs. Hill's and Sons, bankers</hi>, No. 17, <hi rend="italic">West Smithfield</hi>.)</p>

Hill's, but the bill was not there to meet it—it was due yesterday—I am not prosecuting this case—I have no notion that there was any intention to defraud me, I have every reason to believe it would have been paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bittesby, in Leicestershire, and am a fanner. The prisoner married my sister—this acceptance is not my handwriting—I did not give the prisoner or any other person any authority to write it.</p>

                  </hi> I live at No. 8, Hare-court, Aldersgate-street, and am an ivory-worker. On the night of the 6th of Dec. I was at the bottom of Snow-hill—the prisoners came and pinioned my arms, one on each side of me—as soon as I could extricate myself I put my hand to my pocket, and found I had lost six ivory tablets with pearl counters—I had felt them safe just before—there was another person with the prisoners.</p>

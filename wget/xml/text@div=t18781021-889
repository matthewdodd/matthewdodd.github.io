On 26th September last, in consequence of communications and instructions I received, I went to the prosecutor's place of business, 8, Hart' Street, City—Mr. Beaumetz, one of the principals, was present—I saw the' prisoner, and said to him, "Mr. Sherrock, I am an officer of the City Police, I wish to speak to you with reference to postage stamps that have been perforated belonging to the firm, and which have been sold at a public-house. Have you any about yon now?"—he said "Yes," and produced 14, also perforated with "C. D.," the initials of the firm—I said, "How did you get these?"—he said, "Two clerks," pointing to two gentlemen in the office, "let me have them to write letters for the firm when I am at home of a night"—I said, "You have sold six at a public-house"—he said, "That is a mistake"—I then produced three and said, "Here is three of them; you had half a quartern of gin and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change"—I took him into custody for stealing six—I said that I had known there had been a—thief in the place for the last 12 months, and I should search his place—I went to his place in Balmoral Road, Islington—I found in this flowerpot 19 duplicates and various articles of property; one relates to two flower<lb></lb>pots, one to a timepiece, one to a drum clock—he said, "Those are all yours, Mr. Beaumetz"—I said, "Here are two relating to—two</p>

               <p>watches"—he made no reply—I then went into the back parlour with him—while I was pulling a box out that was partly under the bed he ran into the front room—I saw him pass something to a female—I took this watch from his hand—Mr. Beaumetz said, "That is one of ours"—the prisoner said to Mr. Beaumetz, "Do not charge me, sir?"—I said, "It is out of his hands; you will have to go with me"—I put his hat on, and he made a rush at the door; we had a scuffle, the door-handle came off, I threatened to strike him with it; he went afterwards to the station with the property, with me, in a esb—on getting out he tried to get away—he said to Mr. Beaumetz, "Will you withdraw the charge?"—I searched him, and found on him a halfpenny.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to the prosecutor and have practically the control of the business—the prisoner has been in the service from 1874, and had been our town traveller for over six months previous to 26th September last—this watch belongs to the firm—it had not been sold to the prisoner, nor had he authority to take it—it was a sample—the flower-pot was theirs also—I have seen the timepiece represented by this ticket at the pawnbroker's—it is our property; also the watch and opera-glass which were pawned—the prisoner had no authority to take these articles, only as samples, and had no right to appropriate them.</p>

I do not know when you got the things—I said "The spring of the present year" at the police-court, bus that referred to the gold watch—these flower-pots are sold to different dealers in London, other firms import them—I have given watches to you and to the clerks—in that case they would be booked—I did not suspect you—I never found you wrong in your quantity or prices—I have no complaint to make—you have collected accounts for the firm—you had a case of watches entrusted to you for a few days—I am aware you have been put to heavy expenses for a long time owing to your wife's illness, and I have advanced you money.</p>

            . I took in some bread of the prisoner, and paid for it - we began to pay on the 7th of June - bread was brought every day by the prisoner - we paid for it as we had it; it was from the 7th to the 14th of June - I cannot tell any sum; I paid him, but I paid him some shillings.</p>
               <p>JOHN MANNING re-examined. Q. During that week were you at home? A. Yes, the prisoner came and accounted for monies he had received, but he brought none from Kent's; he said he had not received it, and it was booked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I bring you any money? A. Yes, and said it was from several customers; but never during that week did I take so much of him as was received from the Kent's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not customary for those employed by you to keep back part of the money they received as part of their wages? A. No, it was not customary, but you said sometimes that you wanted 1s. or 2s., and I put it down when you told me of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was advised when I was acquitted here last Sessions to go to my prosecutor for my wages, and then he made this charge against me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. But did he come for wages? A. I did not conceive I owed him any; I had paid him some money due, but I did not know of his having received this money at that time, till I took the bill to Kent's on the 14th of June.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was remanded to Tothill-fields to see if there was any other charge against me.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. No, he was remanded to bring up other witnesses - it was on a charge of theft - for taking bread and selling it.</p>

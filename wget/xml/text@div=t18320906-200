On the 24th of July, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw her safe, and missed her at six next morning; the gates of the field were locked, as I had left them, but there was a gap broken down, communicating with a field next to a wood - I traced the mare's feet through the wood, and there was grey hair scraped off on the gate-post - this was a grey mare; I saw her next in Gray's possession; she had two fore-shoes on when stolen, but no hind-shoes.</p>

            . I keep the Tiger's Head, in the New North-road, four or five miles from Crouch-end. On Wednesday morning, the 26th of July, I saw the prisoner in my skittle-ground, behind my house, about half-past eight o'clock, and he had a grey mare there - there is a side door to the ground, communicating with the street; it was fastened, but a person climbing over the wall could unfasten it inside; I have since seen a mare at Worship-street, in the officer's possession, which I believe to be the same - I told the prisoner there was no room for any thing there - I went out in about half an hour, leaving him and the mare there, but desired him to go away -I was out all day; Larman, the farrier, lives about a quarter of a mile from my house; I did not send any horse to him to be shod.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know a man named Taylor in this transaction? A. He was charged with this at Worship-street; the prisoner said

            . I am a farrier, and live in Philip-street, Kingsland-road. On Tuesday morning, the 25th of July, the prisoner brought a grey mare to my place to have two hind-shoes put on; he said it was Cox's mare - I said I had been with Cox the day before, and he had got none like it; he then said it had come home early that morning; my man put the shoes on, and booked them to Cox; he took the mare away - I saw the same mare afterwards at Worship-street.</p>

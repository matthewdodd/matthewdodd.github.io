I am roaster of the brig <hi rend="italic">Indefatigable</hi>—she was lying at Cherry Qarden Tier on the 14th of June—the prisoner was the mate—on that day, in consequence of something 1 was told, I went to the Thames police-office, and got an officer—he went, on board with me, and I gave the prisoner into custody, for opening a case or box and taking some eggs out—he said he did not take any of them—we had one case of eggs on board.</p>

                  </hi>. I was one of the seamen on board this vessel, from Trnlee to London—Roose was the master, and the prisoner mate—on the 14th of June she was at Cherry-garden Tier—the chest of eggs was kept aft, near the companion—the mate came to me on board that day, about one o'clock, and</p>

               <p>asked me to join along with him to get some eggs out of the box—I refused—about eight o'clock at night I was standing near the windlass, and saw the prisoner take some eggs out of the box—he had an axe in his hand, and prized the cover up, put his hands in, and took some eggs out—I do not know howmany—he put them into a basin—he <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out to a boy to come and bring a hammer to him to nail down the box—I saw him put some eggs into a basin behind the companion—the next day I saw him with three boiled eggs in his hand—he brought them down into the kitchen, and put them into his berth.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner—she lodged at the back of a brick-field, in the parish of Harefield. On the 2nd of June, in consequence of information, I went to search a privy at that place, and found the body of a male child in the soil, quite naked—I took it up and afterwards washed it—it was quite dead—there was a mark on the right arm, and rather a dark mark round the neck—when I first took it out it was of a white colour—it changed within ten minutes to a dark green—it was taken to the Police-station—Mr. Kidd, a surgeon, saw it next day, but not in my presence—on the same day I saw the prisoner haymaking in the field—I took her into custody—I told her I took her for concealing the birth of a child—I cautioned her to be very particular what she said, as it might be brought in evidence against her—she said no<lb></lb>thing then, but about an hour afterwards she spoke to me at the station—she had been in my charge all the time—I did not ask her any question—she said it was through distress and want that brought it on, and asked me whether she should plead guilty or not—she understood the charge was concealing the birth—I told her I could not persuade her either way, and told her to be very cautious what she said—she said she should not plead guilty to the murder; that it would be the death of her poor mother—that was all she said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Harefield. On the 3rd of June I was called to the police-station, to examine the body of the child—it was a male child, full grown—it was born at maturity—it was in a state of decomposition—I examined it carefully—I could not find any mark of external violence—on opening the chest, I found the cavity well filled by its organs—I examined the lungs, and found them healthy—they were not decomposed—they were florid, and fully inflated, even to their margins—on supplying the hydrostatic test, I found they were buoyant in clear rain-water, with the heart and gland attached—I examined the head, and found no frac<lb></lb>ture or contusion—the vessels of the scalp and pericranium were extremely congested—the brain had become fluid by decomposition, but the vessels were very much congested—the vascular membrane of the brain still remained very much congested—the umbilical cord was cast round the neck, and crossed over the breast—it was untied, and ruptured at the distance of eighteen inches—it was simply cast round the neck—it did not form a circumvolution of the neck, it simply passed round—from my experience, I judge, that the child was born alive—I am unable to state the cause of death, because the appearances in the head might have resulted, after death, from gravitation, and there was no other morbid appearance—the appearances about the lunge might be accounted for by the child breathing before it was entirely born, but not so fully, I think, as I found them—the lungs were more developed than are ever found in partial birth—the development of the lungs was sufficient to conceal the greater portion of the pericardium—I cannot say what was the cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The conclusion you arrive at is, that it was born alive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that opinion rests on the development of the lungs, and their complete inflation—the congestion of the head proves nothing—there was nothing about the position of the umbilical cord to lead me to suppose it had been strangled by that—it is possible that the child might be strangled with it during birth, and the cord afterwards separate or burst—it is not uncommon for a child to be strangled by the umbilical cord getting entangled round its throat while it is being born, and that would be much more likely in a delivery without assistance—the child would respire when partially born, and that respiration produces the inflation of the lungs—the longer it was being born, the more the lungs would become inflated—according to my conviction, it is impossible they could be inflated to the extent they were, during the time the child was being born—I cannot swear to that as a matter of medical science—I think the child might have been dead five weeks when I saw it—decomposition frequently produces inflation of the lungs—they do not show putrefaction so early as other parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there not cases in which you judge of their putrefaction because you find other parts of the body putrefied? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the lungs would float in water, if slightly putrefied—putrefaction would inflate them, and cause them to occupy more room in the chest, but not so as to conceal the pericardium; but I can swear no part of the appearance of the lungs resulted from putre<lb></lb>faction; it could not, because the lungs presented a perfectly healthy appear<lb></lb>ance, and none of the appearances of putrefaction—I judge, by the appear<lb></lb>ance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140032"></xptr>
               <p>of lungs, whether they are putrefied or not—if they were putrefied they would present that appearance—it is difficult to ascertain whether the lungs are inflated by putrefaction or respiration—floating them in water is not of itself a sufficient test—I can swear that these lungs did not present any ap<lb></lb>pearance of putrefaction—(I speak of their external appearance)—it would be quite impossible for them to be in any degree putrefied without my seeing it—I subdivided the lungs, and caused each portion to float, and those portions would have presented different appearances if one was putrefied—supposing them to be partially putrefied, it would be extremely difficult to detect whether the result was from that partial putrefaction or from respiration—if inflated from partial putrefaction, they would not float after being subject to pressure, which these did—they were not decomposed in the slightest degree; that is extraordinary, and I can only account for it by the body being perfectly pre<lb></lb>served from the atmosphere—we cannot at all times distinguish whether lungs are inflated from putrefaction or respiration—it is not the opinion of all the profession that the hydrostatic test will alone detect it—it is stated by some authors to be deceptive, and by some not so—it is not considered certain as a matter of science—I consider it is so—it is a matter of certainty, that lungs presenting these appearances had respired—I do not know of any exception to that opinion by authors of the present day—I have read Mr. Tayler's book—he does not state the hydrostatic test to be infallible, nor do I; but, from all the tests, I can swear respiration alone produced the appearances I saw—there are methods of telling whether it is from decomposition or not—I cannot be deceived, there being no decomposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It could not be from decomposition, unless decomposition existed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I am satisfied there was no decomposition of the lungs—if the child was strangled during birth by the umbilical cord, it would have left a mark till decomposition obliterated it—I could not see a mark on the throat.</p>

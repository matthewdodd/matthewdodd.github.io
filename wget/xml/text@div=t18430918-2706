                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Green; he is porter to the Honour<lb></lb>able Charles Compton Cavendish, of Burlington-house, Piccadilly—about five o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th of Sept., my husband went, to the post<lb></lb>office—the prisoner came directly after; she rang—I ran and opened the door—she asked to see the housemaid, and asked if she had been there many years—I said, "No, not more than five or six years"—she said, "It is more than twelve years since I lived here; I wanted to ask her about some of the old servants"—I said I could tell her as much as they could, and she wanted to go in—I said Mr. Cavendish was very particular—she laid down her umbrella and said, "I shall go and see the housekeeper"—I said, "I shall go with you"—she went across the court yard—I left her in the still-room, while I went to the housekeeper and told her—I returned soon after, and the prisoner was sitting down—I then heard a knock at the gate; I went, and my husband came in—the prisoner came down to the lodge where I was sit<lb></lb>ting, and said, "The housekeeper cannot give me any information, I shall go and ask John Hartley"—she took her umbrella and a parcel that she had left, and went away—soon after, the housemaid came to know where the woman was that I took up the yard, and an alarm was given.</p>

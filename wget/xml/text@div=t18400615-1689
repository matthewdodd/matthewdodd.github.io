On the 25th of May, about ten o'clock at night, I was on duty in St. James's-street, in plain clothes—I saw the two prisoners and another person with them—they tried seve<lb></lb>ral gentlemen's pockets—I then saw Foxcroft put his right hand into Mr. Ireland's pocket, and take this handkerchief out—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I seized him, touched the prosecutor on the shoulder, and asked if he had lost any thing—Jordan was close by Foxcroft, and covering him.</p>

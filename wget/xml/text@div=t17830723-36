               <p>I was going to market with my cart; on Tuesday the 17th of June, about four o'clock in the morning, I was robbed of some pigeons.</p>

               <p>What did you lose out? - A hamper of pigeons.</p>
               <p>How soon did you miss them? - As soon as they were taken out, some people cry'd out Stop thief!</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him after the crying out Stop thief? - Yes, Sir, when the watchman had taken him.</p>
               <p>Did you see the pigeons after? - Yes, I took them to market, there were nine dozen and three pigeons.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner and another take the basket out of the cart, and was running round Pye-corner, I saw the prisoner and another man taking it; the prisoner took hold of one handle, and the other person the other handle, they was going to take it into Cock-lane; I called out Stop thief! and ran after them.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they run away? - Yes, and when I got up to the prisoner I caught hold of his collar and said, he must go back with me; he had dropped the basket.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he ever out of your sight? - No, I am quite sure this man is one of them; he dropped the basket, and he asked me what I wanted with him, I said, if he would go back I would let him know, and as I was taking him back, he put his hand into his pocket and said he would stab me; there was a knife afterwards found in his pocket, but I prevented his getting at it; the basket has been in my possession ever since; this is the same, I am sure of it.</p>

I live at 5, Wyndham Villas, Acton, and am assistant clerk in the accountant's office of the Metropolitan District Railway at Westminster—I am thoroughly conversant with the practice as regards issuing tickets on the Metropolitan Railway—the ticket col<lb></lb>lectors are stationed at each of the stations for the purpose of collecting tickets, which it is their duty to put into a bag provided for the purpose, and return the bag by train at distances of three to four hours to the ticket department, Blackfriars—trains of the Metropolitan Railway run on the Metropolitan District Railway, and trains of the London and North-Western Railway—the tickets are sorted into stations at the chief ticket office, Blackfriars, and checked by the returns from the stations, in order to see that they are properly accounted for—they are kept for three weeks, after which it is the practice to destroy them—the practice is the same with the Metropolitan tickets—the practice is different with regard to the mixed tickets issued by the Great Western Railway and the London and North-Western Railway—in the case of the latter it is the practice, after having examined them at our office, to forward them to the Railway Clearance House month by month—with the Great Western it is also the same practice, with a few exceptions, those exceptions being tickets issued from Addison Road, Uxbridge Road, Latimer Road, Notting Hill, Westbourne Park, and Bishop's Road, which tickets are dealt with in the same way as those of the Metropolitan and Metropolitan District tickets.</p>

London and North-Western train, giving up a ticket from Uxbridge Road to Gloucester Road, a forward half, and returned by the 11.38, forward half, from Charing Cross to Earl's Court—the fare between those stations and is 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. single, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. return—on the 7th July he arrived by the 10.17, with" a proper ticket that day, and returned by the 11.4 Sloane Square to Earl's Court, backward half—the next occasion was July 9th, when he arrived by the 10.50—he had no ticket, and I charged him the third-class fare from Earl's Court, 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I next saw him on the 10th, by the 11.50 North End to Gloucester Road, Hammersmith train, which was the right one—he returned with an ordinary parliamentary ticket from Gloucester Road to Earl's Court—the next occasion was July 11th, when I saw him get out of a second-class carriage, walk up the platform into a third, and go on towards the Mansion House—on the 12th he came by the 11.50 with a Hammersmith ticket to Gloucester Road, forward half—he did not use the return half that day—it would be only available for one day—on the 13th I saw him arrive with a single ticket from Westbourne Park to South Kensington, by a London and North-Western train—those trains do not call at West-bourne Park—the fare is the same between Westbourne Park and Gloucester Road as between Westbourne Park and South Kensington, id. single and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. return—on the 14th July he arrived at 10.8, by the Richmond train, with the first or forward half of a return ticket from Uxbridge Road to Gloucester Road—the Richmond trains neither pass through nor stop at Uxbridge Road—he returned at 10.25 with a single ticket from Gloucester Road to Earl's Court, so that he did not use the second or backward half of the ticket he had used early in the day—the same day he arrived a second time at Gloucester Road with a single ticket from South Kensington to Earl's Court at 12.45, which ticket was cancelled at South Kensington—he was travelling towards Earl's Court—on the 17th July he arrived at Gloucester Road by the 12.17 train with a proper single ticket—I saw him return that day at 12.47, and he came down the ordinary exit staircase—he did not go to the booking office; he could not get to it that way—he passed straight to the platform without showing his ticket to any inspector—I did not see what ticket he had in his possession at that time—on the 18th July I saw him arrive by</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The rules and directions are that no passenger is to go away from the station without delivering up his ticket, and that is universally followed—I find it very seldom that a person alights at any station and waits for the next train.</p>

I am a ticket-collector at Gloucester Road, in the service of the Metropolitan District Railway Company, and was on duty on the 17th July last, when my attention was called to Tilke, who entered the station by the usual exit and passed direct to the platform without showing his ticket to a collector—I followed him on to the Hammersmith platform, and asked to see his ticket, which he showed me—it was a return half from Sloane Square to Earl's Court already cancelled—it should be cancelled at Sloane Square, that is snipping it—the wrong half might be cut by mistake—I cannot say what it would convey to my mind—I ex<lb></lb>amined his ticket and gave it to him back—when I went back I made a com<lb></lb>munication to Osborne—Finch had drawn my attention to him—on the 30th I again saw Tilke at Gloucester Road, when he arrived by the 11.38 train with the first half of a return ticket from Hammersmith to Gloucester Road—I did not see the return half of the. ticket on that day—on the 31st July he arrived by the 1.1 North-Western train, and gave me a ticket from Hammersmith to Gloucester Road, first half—I did not see him use the return half—on the 30th August something similar happened—I have seen him frequently at Gloucester Road, and have had my attention called to irregularities connected with him.</p>

               <p>and saw me watching him and put down the bag and went to the head of the stairs—Tilke was then standing at the door—I went by the train and waited at the Gloucester Road station some time and saw him come and go to a house in Queen's Gate—then I gave up watching for that day—on the 24th July I again watched him and saw him leave the same place with the same basket and go to the same station—Prior was on duty at that time—Tilke held his basket under his arm when he got to the station—he went near to Prior, and Prior gave him a ticket or tickets—I was standing at the window of the booking-office some few paces off and saw the tickets pass—to the best of my belief there were two tickets—they might have spoken, but I was too far off to hear what they said—Tilke passed to the platform without going to the booking-office to get a ticket—I followed him down and went in the same train as he did to Gloucester Road, where he appeared to give up a ticket—he passed something to a collector—I followed him to the house in Queen's Gate, but saw him no more that day—on the 26th July I again watched him—Prior was on duty, and Tilke passed direct to the platform without taking a ticket, and at Gloucester Road he gave up what was presumably a ticket which I had never seen him take—I watched him to Queen's Gate and he returned to Gloucester Road—he passed to the Hammersmith platform without going to the booking office—he travelled back to Earl's Court and gave up a ticket—neither going nor returning did he take a ticket—on the 27th July I again we watched him, and exactly the same thing occurred—Prior was collector that day—on the 28th July he was again collector—Tilke arrived at the Earl's Court station—I saw Prior go to his ticket table and remove a newspaper, under which there were two tickets—he removed one and took it to Tilke on the platform without going to the booking office—I went to Gloucester Road with the object of watching Tilke again—he did not get out at Gloucester Road that day, but I believe went on to South Kensington—I watched him return from the direction of Queen's Gate—he went to Gloucester Road, I following him—I don't know whether be showed a ticket at Earl's Court—he made a motion to Prior—at Gloucester Road he showed a ticket to Finch and passed on to the platform without going to the booking office—I watched him back to Earl's Court—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him from the station to a public-house, where he remained a few minutes, and left—directly he had left Prior arrived and went into the public-house, and after a short time came and looked out of the door as though looking for some one—he then went in and remained.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I watched Tilke I went to the place of business, Mr. Scarlett's—I never lost sight of him—his taking a ticket was the exception—I don't recollect any other occasion than I have given—on that occasion I saw him speaking to Brooks, and then he left the station—I went in the train and he followed by the next—he might have taken a ticket in the interval, and if so it would be necessary for him to take one on his return journey—sometimes there is a good deal of traffic at Earl's Court, and sometimes it is quite clear—he could not have obtained a ticket except on the one occasion without my seeing him—I have seen him carrying meat in the ordinary course of business and deliver it at the house in Queen's Gate.</p>

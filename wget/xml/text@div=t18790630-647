                  </hi>. I live at 43, Scott Street, Plaistow Marshes, and have lived with the prisoner for about seven years as his wife—he works in the brickfields in summer time—he came home on 20th May between 10 and 11 p.m., neither he nor I were sober—I knew what I was about, and was getting his supper ready—I don't think he knew what he was about; he came in disagreeable, and began swearing at me, and I threw the fork down and told him to cook his own supper—I turned to go out of the room, and turned back to say something, when he threw a pocket-knife at me—he was using it to cut a piece of bread—it stuck in me just above the left breast, and I bled freely—I pulled the knife out, and the doctor was sent for—the prisoner ran out, and I saw nothing more of him until he was taken into custody—I aggravated him because I would not cook his supper; we had lived on good terms; we had a few words sometimes; he has never done anything of the sort before or struck me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner, of 74, Victoria Dock Road, West Ham—at the time of this occurrence I was doing temporary duty for Mr. Dimmer, surgeon, of Plaistow—I was called to the last witness, who was in bed suffering from an incised wound on the left breast—it was not serious, and as the bleeding had stopped I did not probe the wound, not wishing to bring on the hæmorrhage again—this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would pro<lb></lb>duce such a wound—I saw her the next morning, and she was going on favourably.</p>

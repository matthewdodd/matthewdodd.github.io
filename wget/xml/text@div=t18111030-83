               <p>Q. Had you been to bed. - A. No. I was perfectly sober. I had been to see a person home, that was not capable of seeing himself home. I had been spending my evening at Paddington, till twelve o'clock, from there I went to see my friend home, in Crown Street, it was then about two o'clock</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be two hours coming from Crown Street into Oxford Street, how many minutes would that take a man that was not drunk. - A. If I must speak I was coming up Oxford Steeet when I met this woman. I had been at a watering house in Oxford Street, by St. Giles's, from there I went up to my home, I found I could not get in, then I went into a market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the women in your way. - A. I saw the woman in Oxford Street. I had then a crown, a half crown, a three shilling piece, and two shillings in my pocket. This woman asked me to give her something to drink, I went to the Watering House, Oxford Road. I went afterwards towards my home as far as a market, I forgot the name of the market. I there lost my money out of my breeches pocket. I fell asleep in a cart while the woman was with me. Taylor is a watchman, he came and awoke me in the market.</p>
               <p>Q. You fell asleep in the cart in an open market, any body else might have stolen it. - A. The money was taken out of the watchman's pocket.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WAKEMAN I am a watchman, in South Molton Street. Hart and Fox passed me about four o'clock in the morning, he was intoxicated, they went up towards Grosvenor Market. I saw them in a passage about ten minutes, they were talking together. I saw the woman afterwards, she said she had left Fox sleeping in a cart. I went and awoke him, he said he had been robbed, I told him he should keep better company. We went to Taylor's box, we found Hart in Taylor's box. We took her to the watch-house, Taylor followed, they were both searched, on Hart was found nine-pence halfpenny, and upon Taylor a crown piece, half a crown, and two shillings.</p>

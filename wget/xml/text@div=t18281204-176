            . I am an officer. On the 15th of November, I had information, and saw the prisoner go down Golden-lane, with another lad, who is called the sailor boy - the prisoner had this paper in his hand; I said "I want you, what have you got here?" he said"They are not mine, they belong to the sailor boy;" the sailor boy then ran away - the prisoner said he did not know what he was; when I got to the watch-house I was told to open it - the prisoner said "It is paper;" I saw the name Smith on it, and took it to that place - they said they could not say any thing to it till the foreman came, but it was their paper. The sailor was a bigger lad - I have not seen him since.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Eaton, a chandler, in Henry-street, Portland Town—in the afternoon of the 26th of May, the prisoner came to my shop for half an ounce of tobacco, and a pennyworth of cheese—he put a shilling on the counter—I said I did not like the look of it—he took up the change while I was looking at the shilling, and went away—I marked it, put it in paper, and gave it to my husband—next day the prisoner came again, and asked for a pennyworth of tobacco—he put down a penny—I knew he was the man, and told my husband.</p>

            , she was a lodger of mine; I live in Short's-gardens, near Drury-lane, she has lodged with me near four months; and she lodged with me about four years ago too; I remember the time of her being taken up.</p>
               <p>Do you remember where she was, the night before she was taken up? - She was with me the 30th day of October; she came down in the morning and brought a petticoat to mend it, she asked me for some pieces to mend it with, I searched the drawer for some, she sat down till near twelve o'clock; says she I have some things to boil for dinner, they are not done and it is late, she came afterwards about two o'clock; she went out and was gone a great while, and came in about eight, and said, I must go and make my bed, and make a fire; I said but don't go till you tell me what o'clock it is, go to the snuff-shop and ask; she went, and came back to the back door; I live in the back house, and she lives in the street house, and says she it was past eight.</p>
               <p>How long was she gone to the snuff-shop? - Not two minutes; she had all these four months, and I can justify it, she had nothing but the linen gown and a thing like striped.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050100"></xptr>Has she any dark-coloured gown? - Not one; if she has, I never saw it upon her, and no other person saw any thing upon her, but something like a laylock stripe upon it.</p>
               <p>What day was it you was at home, and came down in the morning as you have described? - It was the 30th day of October.</p>
               <p>How came you to remark it? - Because she was taken up the night following by a schoolmaster and a little boy. I had it put down upon this bit of paper.</p>
               <p>Why then, after she came back from the snuff-shop, did she go out again that night? - Sir, she lighted a candle, and went up to her own apartment; I had a full view of her as I have of your face in lighting her candle; a few minutes after I said, will you make your bed, she said yes, and it was near ten o'clock, and after I asked if she was going to bed, yes, says she; it is true, it is fact and true, gentlemen and lords together, and I believe her as innocent as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Court. What curiosity had you to know what o'clock it was that evening? - It is a common thing with us in the house, as we are not able to keep a clock in the house, to ask one another what it is.</p>
               <p>But every evening do you send somebody to know what o'clock it is? - Sometimes I do, and sometimes I do not; I did just ask her as she was going down, says I, Jenny, what o'clock is it, go to the shop-snuff, they keeps their clock very regular, it is more true than many great clocks and watches either.</p>
               <p>Do you enquire every night when she goes to bed? - No; may be I might that night, but not other nights; she has ne'er a brown gown; it was put down the very day she was committed, I had it put down upon this bit of paper.</p>
               <p>Who put it down for you? - Why, a man that knew how to write.</p>
               <p>That man had a name probably? - Yes; that man is my husband, his name is Mc. Connel, he is a little taylor, and works journey work.</p>
               <p>He put it down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was to put you in mind of the day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The paper handed up to Mr. Recorder.)</p>
               <p>Is your husband a lawyer? - No; he is a little taylor.</p>
               <p>Your husband put this down at your desire, to put you in mind of the day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he put it down the day that you was examined before the Justice? - He put down that the very evening.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No, please your honour, he knows nothing at all about it, but as I told him.</p>
               <p>Did you give your husband the paper to put it down upon? - I don't know whether that is what I looked for in the drawer; I forget how I got the paper.</p>
               <p>Was it the snuff paper she brought from the snuff-shop; - No; I take snuff, and the snuff may have dropped upon it.</p>
               <p>And you gave the paper to him to put it down upon? - The paper was partly new when he put it down.</p>
               <p>Can you write yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you read writing? - No.</p>
               <p>How can this tell you the day of the month then? - Because any gentleman that can read, can tell me the day very well.</p>
               <p>It was your husband that wrote it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He is a very good scholar, is he? - He can scribble a little.</p>
               <p>Have you any more of his hand-writing about you? - No; I have not.</p>

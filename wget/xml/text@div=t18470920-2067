About four o'clock last Sunday morning I saw the prosecutor—he said he had been robbed of his watch—the prisoner came along—I went and stopped her—I found this watch and hand<lb></lb>kerchief in her right hand—the prosecutor said, "Give me my watch"—she said she knew nothing about it, and had not got it—I took it from it from her, and asked him if it was his—he said it was—she then said he had given it her.</p>

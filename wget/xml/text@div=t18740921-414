                  </hi>. I live at Falcoln Mews, Marylebone—I had a son named William Henry Dabbs, who was ten years old on the 11th May—he had attended St. Mary's School, York Road, Marylebone for about three years—I believe it is a national school—on Friday, 4th September, I saw him at 8.45, when he came in to wash to go to school—he was then in excellent health and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187409210042"></xptr>
               <p>as cheerful as ever I saw him in my life—I got home between 3 and 4 o'clock and he was at home and asleep, and by 6 o'clock I saw him and some tea was given to him—I saw him again at 9.45, when he sat up and wanted to go down to the closet—he slept in the same bed with his elder brother who had carried him home on his back, and who about 3 o'clock in the morning called me up, and I found the deceased quite delirious—I sent for Dr. Lewis who came, and who called in Dr. Drew, who only came once—the child never recovered consciousness, and died at 1 o'clock in the day on Saturday, 5th September—he had always enjoyed excellent health except when he had the measles about eighteen months ago—he was not a dull, lethargic boy, quite the reverse—more than six years ago he fell from a loft window on to a butcher's block, and then to the ground—he was quite a little fellow, quite a baby—he pitched on his left hand, being left handed—his wrist was hurt and he had a severe black eye, the left eye—those were the only visible marks of injury—he was taken to the hospital, but was not there more than a week, and was then discharged cured—he was running about in three days—I have never known him to suffer from any disease of the head, and he has lived with me from his birth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was between three and four when he fell from the loft—I say that it was about six years ago, and I go by a neighbour's child being born about a month afterwards—my son found that out—I never measured the height of the loft, but I guessed it at 14 feet—he did not pitch on his head—I think the butcher's block was more than 3 feet high, and from that block he pitched on the ground.</p>

I live at 72, York Street—I made this model of the class room at St. Mary's National School (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is on a scale of three-quarters of an inch to a foot—this rail projects three inches from the wall—the space from the wall to the nearest seat is 8 1/2 inches, and the seat itself is 8 1/2 inches, and the space between this seat and the desk, where the boys' legs go, is 4 inches—the desks on which the boys write are 13 inches wide and 2 feet 5 inches high—it is 21 inches from the wall to the front of the desk—the rail is slightly worn by the boys' hands—a chalk mark was made where the boy stood, and one of the boys sat down and said "Dabbs sat here."</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, a paper-maker, at 100, Seymour Place—I shall be ten years old on the 28th of this month—I went to St. Mary's School—Dabbs was in my class, which the prisoner had charge of—when we were in class the prisoner called Dabbs out for talking and playing, and hit him on the hand with a cane, one blow—Dabbs then went back to his place in the school—(J was present when Mr. Bunker took the drawing for the model)—this was about 11.15; we begin school at 9 o'clock—I sat just in front of Dabbs—after he had been hit on the hand and had gone back to his seat the prisoner required the boys to show copies—that was nearly 11.30—the boys have to stand up between the seat and the desk and hold up their copies, and the prisoner passes along the desks and examines them—he began here, he had examined my copy and gone to the row behind and came to where Dabbs was standing and struck him between the ear and the eye, but a little above the ear—I did not hear the prisoner say anything—it was a pretty hard blow with his hand half, open and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187409210043"></xptr>
               <p>Dabbs was knocked against the wall—the back of his head went against the wall—he leant back for a few minutes—the prisoner said nothing to him, but went on along the row and came to his usual place in front of the class—Dabbs then sat down in his own place and the prisoner asked him what was the matter—that was five minutes after the blow—Dabbs said that he was not very well, and asked to go down, to leave the room—that was before the prisoner asked what was the matter—they ask to go down by holding up their hands—the prisoner did not let Dabbs go down at first, and then he asked again a second time and it was then that the prisoner asked him what was the matter—he said that he was not very well, and the prisoner told him to go and stand down at the street door, but he did not go there, he was sick on the stairs and then he went into the yard and I saw him no more—he was about the same size as me and when I stand up the rail at the back of the desk reaches my head—when Dabbs <hi rend="italic">fell</hi> back his head knocked up against the rail.</p>

Dabbs when we showed copies to the teacher—the "teacher struck him on the head with his knuckles and he. fell back <hi rend="italic">again</hi> the wall and the back of his head struck against the rail, but not very-hard—he afterwards asked twice, by putting his hand up, to go into the yard—he went into the yard and I did not see him again.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187409210044"></xptr>
               <p>and struck against the wall—Howard then went on looking at the other boys' copies, and then went in front of the class—he has no desk, he stands there—Dabbs kept against the wall about five or ten minutes—he sat down, and when he went back to his place, Howard called out that he was to go more towards the right, to close up, and he did so, and that made two classes into one—Dabbs then put up his hand to go out; that was five minutes after the blow; and the second time he did so Howard asked him what was the matter—he said that he felt ill—I did not hear Howard tell him to go to the street door—he told him to go to the yard, and he did so; that was about 11.30—he was sick on the stairs before he went into the yard; and at 12.30, when I went out of school, I saw him on a bus in the yard, and he seemed very ill and white—he had never come back into the schoolroom—the prisoner did not send to inquire after him that I know of—it is a rule that before we break up at 12.30, every boy shall be in his place in the class, but Howard did not send out for Dabbs to take his place in the class before breaking up—before I saw Dabbs on the box in the yard, I saw him in the closet—I left him on the box, and went straight home at about 12.35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have heard Dabbs complain many times of headaches—he looked very white when he complained—when he was playing he often got tired, and had to leave off; he felt giddy, and then he would look white and complain of his head—I said before the Magistrate "He fell back gently, and not with force."</p>

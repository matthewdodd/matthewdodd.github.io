            . I belong to the printing office at Chelmsford. I come up every Wednesday, and go down every Thursday, for news. I was coming from Whitechapel, on the 5th of October, instant, to go to Mr. Bedford's, in St. Paul's church-yard. I met with a man in Cheapside; he said, Pray what part of the country do you come from? I said, Why do you ask? He said, he had an uncle, that lived in London, who had a servant gone away who had stole a mare, and he would be very glad of a person that would carry bills into the country of the mare. I gave but little heed to it. He asked me where I was going; I said but a little farther, to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180033"></xptr> Bedford's, in St. Paul's alley, by the church yard. He said, I'll go along with you. He went with me, and called for a pint of purl. When I had delivered up my bags, I asked him where his uncle lived; he said he often was in Smithfield, and there was a house he used near there, and perhaps we might meet with him there. I went at his desire with him into Smithfield, then through a little place to the sign of the Blue Coat Boy. He looked at the dial, and said, It is very often about this time he comes into this house. I saw nobody at all. He ordered a pint of purl, and it was brought in. I do not know whether we had drank or no, when in came a man dressed in black. He seemed to be in liquor. Then in a minute in came another man. They began discoursing with each other. They talked of some fray the man that seemed to be in liquor had been in. Sir, said the man to one of the others, I am obliged to you for bringing me here, and taking care of me, will you please to drink any thing? What you desire to drink, you shall have. They were saying, this man that was in liquor had a man took him in for 10 l. I think they said it was by a butcher. Then the man that was with me asked him which way it was done; they said it was in this, that he could not name three things. The man with me replied to him, No, nor no more can you, and he would lay him a shilling he could not. They laid, he won the shilling. Then the man that appeared drunk pulled out a large purse, and said, Though I have been taken in, I have got so much left still, and I have so much more to receive. The man along with me wanted me to go his halves, or to lend him some money. I told him I would have no concern in it at all. I wanted to go away; I put my hand into my pocket, to take out some halfpence, to pay for the beer. My gold was wrapped up in paper. I could not get my half-pence out, without taking that out. The man said, D - n it, you said you had got no money. You have plenty of money. (There were four guineas, and four half guineas in one paper, and three half guineas in another, all wrapped up in one paper.) I got up directly, and said I want to know the reason why he took it out of my hand; he said, D - n you, hold your tongue; I'll double your money; you shall not lose your money. I said, Don't pretend to take it; I'll have my money. I'll have nothing to do to play. The others went on in the scheme they were about; they past my money over from one to the other. The time I was talking to him, he delivered it to one of the others, and he got it in his hat, and before I could say a very few words, they said it was lost. It was received by the prisoner. I saw it in his hands last, and there was one half guinea found upon him that I swore to. The prisoner is the man that was in black, and who seemed to be fuddled. At the time I was disputing with him for it, the other men got away. I called for help. I believe a woman came to the door first; after some time a constable came. Just before the constable came to the door, the prisoner did not know what to do with his purse that he had in his pocket. I saw him conceal it under the seat where he sat. I said to the constable, He has a purse concealed under such a place, see what it is. The prisoner hearing me say so, took up the purse, and put it in his pocket. He was asked whose purse it was; he said it was his own. Before he went out of the house, he asked leave to go to the necessary house. The constable let him. We did not miss the purse till we came before my lord mayor. We found upon him three half guineas, and two watches. The constable was ordered to go to search the necessary. I went with him. We found in it a purse; we counted the pieces. They were all yellow counters. He pretended to be a captain, and said he had taken some money on board a ship. When the prisoner took my money out of the hat, there were something fell on the floor, but I was in such confusion, I do not know what it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Who took the money out of your hand?</p>
               <p>Ellison. The person that went in with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long from the time he took it out of your hand to the time they said it was lost?</p>
               <p>Ellison. I do not know that it was a minute. There were four people met me at a house where I used, and offered me my money again, and to pay the 20 l. that I am bound in to appear here, if I would not prosecute.</p>

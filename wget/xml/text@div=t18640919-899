                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. John Hatcher, linendraper of Stratford-row—on 15th last month, I missed a piece of cotton print from a chair in front of our door—I saw the prisoner outside with two other females before that, for about an hour in the afternoon—after I missed the piece I followed them up to High-street, saw a constable, told him of the circum<lb></lb>stance, and he went and charged the prisoner—she then had this bundle, containing the 53 yards of cotton print, the piece which I missed.</p>

From information I received from the last witness, I went after the prisoner, stopped her, and asked her what she had got in a bundle which she had in front her—she said it was work she was going to take home—I asked her to let me see it, and the last witness identified it as his master's property.</p>

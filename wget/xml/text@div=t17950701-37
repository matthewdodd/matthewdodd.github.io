               <p>Q. What time was this? - Thursday sevenight, a little before two o'clock in the morning, when the watchman took him. I know that there were nine geese in the field the day before, and I see them fed, nine on Wednesday, and six on Thursday.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know his name? - Yes; Moses.</p>

               <p>Q. How old is he, twelve or fourteen years of age? - Older than that. I went down into the poultry yard after the watchman was gone; I missed three.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know there geese again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you could venture to swear to them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them again in the course of that day? - Yes, I see them at the watch-house, three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them to be lady Grosvenor's geese? - I know them to the best of my knowledge; I knew them ever since they were hatched, about three months; one is a darkish one, with a mark half round its neck, and two black feathers on its back; the other was a brown, not quite so dark as that there, a brown head, and much the same mark on its back; the other was all white all over.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say positively, or only to the best of your knowledge, that they were the three? - I have said to the best of my knowledge that they belong to lady Grosvenor. They were left in the watch house; two were alive; and one he killed; the live ones are brought here.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was killed? - The lightest of the speckled ones.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How is your court yard situated? - It is before the house, and the poultry yard is by the side of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it senced off? - It opens with two gates, it is senced all round with paling; the paling is a pretty good height, and there are laths over the paling.</p>
               <p>Q. Not so high as you are? - Yes, very near; I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the geese may now and then get over? - It is two high for any geese to get over.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see these geese fly No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were their wings cut? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if they were inclined to sly from a good place, they had the liberty to do so. Now you say very fairly, that you cannot go beyond saying, that these may be lady Grosvenor's to the best of your knowledge, but you may be mistaken in them; that is the furthest you can go. What kind of gates are they secured by? - It is a gate wide enough to let a carriage go through; it is made of close paling the same as the court yard.</p>

            Which way was he going? - Towards London, from the house. There were two more men coming after, and I let that man go on, and I searched them two men, and they had nothing, and I let them go forward; by that time the prisoner got from my beat, from my premises, and I went to the other watchman, Grant, and I told him I believed the man had got something on his back which he should not have. That is all I know about it till the next morning; I went the next morning to lady Grosvenor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010088"></xptr>about nine o'clock; I asked the maid if she had lost any geese? - I did not know any body that had any geese besides.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after you had heard something in that house? - I went to the watch-house, and the geese were there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get to the watch-house? - I cannot say rightly because we went to justice Bond before that; it might be before twelve o'clock; I see three geese.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man that you see in the watch-house detained, with the geese, was the same man that you see passing with something on his back? - To the best of my knowledge it is; I suspect that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. That something that he carried on his back, was it in a sack, or how? - No, it was butioned in his coat, a common close bodied coat.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I observe that your's is a close bodied coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you could button up two or three greese, independent of your own person? - I don't know, I never tried.</p>

They were in his coat, his coat was off; then I looked at him, and told him it was not a proper hour to have such things about him; then I told him he must go to the watch-house.

               <p>Prisoner. I went to see my wife that lived at Brompton, and I stopped at the White Hart public house. When I returned to town, in the road I see two men, and I was in a hurry running along, I saw these geese, I thought I see them fall from their backs, and I picked them up, thinking that morning to enquire out an owner for them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character; he was a gentleman's coachman and in place then.</p>

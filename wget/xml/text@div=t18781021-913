                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker at 19, Plumstead Road—on the evening of 13th August the prisoner and Sherwood, who has been dis<lb></lb>charged, came and offered to sell a miniature set in gold, with a carbuncle, some silver bracelets, and Clasps, and a quantity of jewellery—the prisoner asked 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I asked him where they got them—he said that they had been stolen from the Docks—I informed the police at once—the prisoner first asked me what they were worth—I said I could not tell him the exact amount, as I was not sure of the miniature, and he told me he could let me have 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth more.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant R</hi>). About 7 o'clock on 13th August I was passing Mr. Salter's door—he called me in and made a state<lb></lb>ment to me—the prisoner and Sherwood had left—I west in search of them and found them at the Puke of York beershop in the New Road—I went in and told the prisoner I had been given to understand that he had some valu<lb></lb>able jewellery in his possession—he said "Yes"—I said "<hi rend="italic">Let me-see it</hi>," and he handed me this locket in a leather case—I said "You have some more"—he said "Yes," and pulled out this pocket-handkerchief with it in—I said "Where did you get it from?"—he said "I bought it off a man last night about 10 o'clock at the Bull public-house," which is close by there—I said "Who is he? Do you know him?"—he said "No"—I said "You can give me some description of him"—he said "I can do as I like about that"—I then took him to the station, and charged him with having this jewellery in his possession, supposed to be stolen, and not giving a satisfactory account of it—he said that he did not steal it—he bought it of a man last night, and gave 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, who told him it was stolen from the Docks from a ship that was gone abroad, and they would not find it out for two or three months, and he thought he could make a pound or two of it—I locked Sherwood up at the same time, and he was discharged by the Magistrate the next day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I told you I made inquiries and had been told that you had borrowed some money on the evening in question—several persons said they could not tell whether you bought it—I did not say at Woolwich that I could fetch several witnesses to prove you bought it—you gave me the names of three persons—I went to them, and each of them denied knowing anything about your buying it—you were let out on bail immediately and rearrested after I found an owner for the property.</p>

               <p>left on board to come on to the Victoria Docks—the articles produced are my property—they were in a jewel case when I last saw them, inside a large tin box, in one of the five cases—on 31ST of August I opened the case and found the property was gone—this is only a very small portion of what I missed—my entire loss is about £800.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I bought the jewellery. I gave all the information I could give to Sergeant Morgan, according to the description of the man I bought them of. I had only just come out of my work when I bought them—I had been working till 8 o'clock every night for the Government from breakfast-time every morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, residing at Lingfield, Surrey, that is adjoining the parish of Edenbridge—on Tuesday, 8th August, about 6 o'clock, I was drinking outside the Wheat Sheaf—a man named Budgen was there, and a woman who lived with him as his wife—the prisoner came there from 7.30 to 8 o'clock with a bagging hook which he put under the seat outside the house and said "That is a mark on some one to-night"—he called for a pint of beer, the landlord served him; he got into conversation with John Budgen and Phillis Palmer—Budgen was sober when he came in, but Phillis Palmer was not—there was some singing—the conversation was principally between the prisoner and Budgen, it was in some tongue unknown to me; they did not call it Indian; the other people called it French—I heard no remark from Budgen to the prisoner or from the prisoner to Bud<lb></lb>gen about being in India; they talked in the unknown tongue for half an hour, it seemed familiar to them, but not to me—they all three left together at 9.57, because that is the time for closing; that is Budgen, the prisoner, and the woman—after they had gone about a minute I took up the bagging hook; the prisoner had only then got about 3 yards away from the house; it was bound with a small hay band as he had left it; the landlord ordered me to give it to John Hickey, and I did so; the hay band was then on it the same as before; I did not try it to see that it was tight, but it was appa<lb></lb>rently tight; the prisoner was so near to me that I saw Hickey give it to him—I stood" in front of the Wheat Sheaf talking to my two mates, I bade them good night and went on my way home, which was the same way that the prisoner and the others had gone; they went on up the road and I saw John Budgen and the prisoner at Grayberry Lane.</p>

They stopped at the corner of Grayberry Lane—I saw them standing and talking together and could hear that they were talking, but was not close enough to hear their conversation—I got about 3 rods from them; I did not hear any quarrelling—I saw the prisoner take this bagging hook (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand and strike John Budgen on the back of the left leg; they were standing facing each ether—it was a very moonlight night and I could see very clearly—I saw the bagging hook in the prisoner's hand before he raised it over his head; I cannot tell you in what position he was carrying it till he brought it over his head; I did not see it till it was over his head and I cannot say whather he stood with it on his arm or by his side—I was not looking at them all the while, but I had. seen nothing done by the prisoner until I saw the bagging hook over his head—when he had struck the blow Budgen fell down on his back at the end of the lane, and called "Murder!" three times—he said "Oh, my life is taken away, murder!" and I never heard him speak afterwards—the pri<lb></lb>soner walked away a short distance and then he ran in the direction of Dorman's Land—he did not attempt to render any assistance, nor did he offer any explanation, so far as I heard he said nothing—I helped the deceased and called "John "two or three times, but he made no reply, and I believe he was dead—I knelt down by his side to see whether I could hear him breathe, but I could not—I then saw and heard blood flowing from his leg—i called Phillis Palmer—s in advance 6 or 7 rods up Gray<lb></lb>berry Lane; she left them talking; she came back to me—I did not find the hay band by the deceased, nor did I see any more of the hook that night—Phillis Palmer followed the prisoner along Dorman's Land Road about 150 yards, and she ultimately came back to the 'dead man—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the same description of hay band, but this is not the whole.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>, I am accustomed to work in the fields, and have worked with a bagging hook—it is usual to put a hay band round the hook while it is being carried, for the protection of the blade when travelling from one job to another; here is *a notch on the blade—when I saw the hay band round the blade it was right up to the handle, and this portion which has the notch was covered by the hay band—I did not take hold of the implement by the hay band, only by the handle—I did not notice when I had hold of the handle whether, in moving it about the hay band slipped at all—the two men stood in the road sideways to me, and about 3 or 4 feet from me, at near as I can tell.</p>

Green, near Edenbridge on 8th August, I was drinking in front of the Wheat Sheaf; I saw the deceased and the prisoner there—I heard a cry of "Murder," got some information, and went to the spot where the man was felled—I got a light to see if he was really dead, and then went in search of the prisoner—I was at the Wheat Sheaf at 9.15, andlleftat a few minutesbefore 10 o'clock—I found the prisoner on the borders of Surrey, just over the stream, lying down by the side of the path; I was attracted by a sound—he appeared to be asleep—I called to him but got no answer and called again, and he said "What are you up to"—I went to him and took hold of him and told him he had caused the death of another man—he said "I know nothing about it—I told him I was sorry for him, one of the men with us asked him for his hook; he said "Hook, I have no hook "—Eddings was round on the other side of him and picked up the hook—I saw him pick it up—I told the prisoner he must go along with me, he said "All right, I will go "the hay band was not on the hook then—I took him to the Wheat Sheaf; he went very quietly while I had got hold of him—I was there when a man named Russell was there.</p>

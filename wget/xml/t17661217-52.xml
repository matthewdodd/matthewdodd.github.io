            . My husband keeps a cook's shop in the Fleet-market; the prisoner came to our shop to buy a piece of cold meat, I think it was the 6th of last month, about two in the afternoon; the meat came to 3 d. she gave me a shilling to change; I gave her a good six-pence and three-pence in halfpence; she had not had it long before she asked me if it was a good six-pence; I having been served ill before by her or somebody else, I gave her in change a particular six-pence; the six-pence she shewed me was not the same she had of me; I said, this is not the six-pence you had of me; she said it was; the six-pence I gave her had a dent in the head, and a crack in the side; she stood to it that was the same she shewed me; I said, I'll send for a constable, or I'll see the sixpence that you had of me before you go out of my shop; my son sent the boy for a constable; then I said, if you'll shew me the six-pence you had of me, you shall go about your business; then she said, call the boy back; I did; then she was more impudent than before; the boy was sent a second time; then she produced the six-pence she had of me, this is it; (produced in court.)</p>

            ; I came in at my father's house when this woman was detained for passing a bad six-pence; she was searched, and no other found upon her, after she had delivered that which my mother said she had received of her in change: then we went to her lodgings in George-alley, that comes down into the Fleet-market; as soon as we came into her room, she produced to us three farthings made smooth, ready to be made white, in an old rag, and three tea-cups with stuff to make them white; (produced in court) I said, do you know the maker, or do you make them; she said she took to making them some time ago; that an Irishman taught her, who she said was gone to Ireland; she fell on her knees and begged of me to forgive her, and said, she would never do so no more. <rs id="t17661217-52-verdict268" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>James Ponsford, an architect—he is employed in building Oxford-square, Paddington. The prisoner was in his employ as a plumber's labourer—on the 29th of September I went to the buildings in Oxford-square—the prisoner was at work there that day—I waited till all the work-people left—I then hastened to Marylebone-lane, and spoke to a policeman, and when I had been there five or ten minutes, I saw the prisoner come in a direction from Oxford-square—when he saw me he appeared quite aston<lb></lb>ished, and stood still—I went and asked what he did there—he made no answer, but seemed to be much agitated—I felt his jacket, and found there was something hard—I took him into a shop, pulled open his jacket, and took from his waistcoat pocket this piece of lead—the rest of this lead was then found on him, and this hammer, which was on the works, and which he had access to—I examined the premises next morning, and found two pieces of lead, which exactly correspond with some of those found on him—they are of a very peculiar shape—these are them—I have not the least doubt that the lead found on him is my uncle's property—the pri<lb></lb>soner had not the least right to it.</p>

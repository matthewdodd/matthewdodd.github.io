                  </hi>. I reside at 98, St. James's-street, Clerkenwell, and am an attorney's clerk—on the evening of Wednesday, 23d November, about half-past 10, I was undressing to go to bed—I heard a noise, and lifted my window open—the noise was a cry of distress, a groaning, gradually in<lb></lb>creasing to a greater loudness from the first time I heard the cry; the cry was, "Murder! oh, oh!" increasing as though a person was in great distress</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186412120037"></xptr>
               <p>—when I opened my window I heard a second cry of "Murder!" proceeding from Messrs. French's workshop—my house is parallel with the workshop (<hi rend="italic">A plan was produced</hi>)—this is my room-window, and this is an alley called Newcastle-alley—any person being there could get into the public way—this is the door of the workshop—I could not see the door of the workshop from my window, but I could see any person coming out at it—I could see the wall; I could even see any person coming to shut the door—the wall is in a straight line with my window, so that anything, even an inch beyond that straight line I could see—when I looked out of my window I saw a man running out of Mr. French's workshop, out at the door which I have described on the plan—he had something in his hand; I could not swear what it was, but it was something like a thick, long stick; it was something bug—he came towards me in the yard, running from the window towards my house—he then got on the wall—I could not see exactly what he put his foot on, but he was not out of my sight—I only saw about half of his body at the time be sprang to get on the wall—I then saw him turn the angle and on to the wall, and go down from the wall—there is an iron rod on the wall—the wall is in Messrs. French's yard, and divides their place from mine, and from the public lane—that lane terminates at the yard—when this man I saw was on the wall, there was nothing between him and me but the lane, and a foot or two of the wall of the house—when he was on the wall I called out to him to stop—I think he was about twelve feet from me at that time—I have not measured it—there was a light in Messrs. French's workshop—the light appeared to me to be almost the whole length of the shop—the front of it is all glass; the light shone on the man's face as soon as he came out of the workshop-door—I recognised him when he was on the wall—I had known him by sight before; the prisoner is the man—he jumped, and dropped down from the wall, and ran away—the wall is about ten feet high—as he was getting on to the wall I heard something resembling the sound of a stick falling—I called out—I saw some one come from Mr. French's house—I dressed as quickly as I could, calling out to the parties in the yard that I should be there—as soon as I went out of my front-door I went round to see whether the prisoner had fallen or jumped from the wall—I examined the back-door of the yard which leads from Mr. French's workshop to Newcastle-alley—it was closed and fastened with the usual thumb-latch, which a person could push from the outside—it was fastened so that I could not get in—I then went round to the front entry in Clerken<lb></lb>well-close, and went into the workshop—Mr. French was there when I got, in—after speaking to the deceased I found this broom (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the yard—it very much resembles what the prisoner had in his hand, only the head part being down I could not see what was at the end of the stick, be<lb></lb>cause the gas-lamp would not enable me to see that—I found it on the yard side of the wall; it Was stained with blood—it was raining very heavily at the time—I took the broom up and carried it in my finger and thumb, so as not to take any of the blood off—I carried it into the workshop, and laid it there to dry—the blood was at this end (<hi rend="italic">The broom part</hi>), and also on the handle—when I first went into the workshop they were washing his wounds—I had seen the deceased before; I did not know him by name—I found him sitting on the stairs—Mr. Joseph Smith, a workman, and Mr. French were standing by his side—while I was there he was removed to the hospi<lb></lb>tal—next morning I was called to the Clerkenwell Police-court—I was asked to pick out the man I saw get over the wall—there were three persons</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186412120038"></xptr>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in Mr. French's employ—the deceased, Francis Ploughman Roberts, was in his employment, and also the prisoner—on Wednesday evening, 23d November, about half-past 10, my attention was called to a noise—I was sitting in the back parlour, which adjoins the yard, with Mr. and Miss French—the window of the back parlour looks out into the yard, but the shutters were closed at that time—the noise I heard sounded like a very loud groan, a cry of distress; it proceeded from the workshop—I went into the passage, opened the back door, and went into the yard—to the best of my belief the back door was fastened—Mr. and Miss French followed me—I found the deceased standing up, lean<lb></lb>ing against the workshop-door; he was inside the workshop—I saw the last witness at his window—Mr. French and I led the deceased on to the stairs—I saw blood flowing from the top of his head; his face was covered with it—after seeing him put there I tried the back door of the yard leading into Newcastle-alley; it was locked—that door is always kept locked after dusk—the men come through that door to their work in the morning, and those who leave before dusk go out that way—those who stay late, working over<lb></lb>hours, have to come through the house—those who stay late cannot go in and out of the house as they please, not after a certain time—the chain is usually put up about 8—after 8 they leave by the front door—they come in at the back door of the house; it opens with a pull from the outside; if it is locked, of course they cannot open it—it may happen that it is locked or not—if it is not locked they can let themselves through, if it is locked they have to knock—I was sitting in the back parlour that evening—if any one had passed along the passage and out at the front door I should have heard them—I do not know who stayed late that evening—I did not see Smith leave—I went for a doctor—I did not go with the deceased to the hospital—I went with a constable to the residence of the prisoner—I did not go any<lb></lb>where else first—I found him at No. 2, Arundel-cottages, Kingsland—we got there about 3 o'clock in the morning—when he came down to us he had on his shirt, trousers, and stockings—he said, "What is it, Mr. Brinton?"—I said, "You will hear presently"—the policeman then in my presence charged him with violently assaulting the deceased—he was not then dead—the prisoner said he had not done it; he said he had left that night with Gouget—we then returned with the prisoner to the station—there is no other way of getting</p>

               <p>from Mr. French's workshop except through the house, through the back yard gate, or over the wall—it is the practice in Mr. French's establishment to have a tin can for the men to put the gold in that they are working upon—one of those cans is kept for those men who work late—it is called "the overtime can"—immediately after the deceased was taken to the hospital, I saw the workshop locked up—only two persons went into the upper shop, Smith and the constable—that was while the deceased was there, before it was locked up—I did not see any one else go into the shop—it was possible for a person to go up into the shop without any one seeing them—after the workshop was unlocked, I went into the upper shop and looked into the tin can—this is the overtime can (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was kept in the upper shop—when I looked at it it did not contain five unfinished gold rings—I looked at it on going into the shop about five minutes after the deceased went to the hospital—it did not contain any gold wire—it contained two gold rings, but not five unfinished ones—there are two workshops, one above the other—one is on the ground-floor, and the other over it—there is no communication from the upper to the lower, but by the stairs which are in the lower workshop where the furnace is—the men do not work there—all the work is done in the upper shop—when I went in and found the deceased, there was one gas alight at the further end from the house—the end nearest Thomason's house—there was one gas burning in the lower workshop—I saw traces of blood in the lower workshop—they were scattered along the floor, and on the bench, and a considerable quantity in the corner—the further corner from the door—the mortar was also knocked off the wall at the further end in several places—it seemed as though something hard had been against it, and knocked the mortar off—I saw marks of blood on the furnace—the furnace is on the opposite side to the bench I have spoken of, so that there were marks of blood on each side of the workshop, particularly at one end—the marks were like drops of blood as if they had spurted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you know that young men in working establishments are in the habit of <hi rend="italic">larking</hi>, and giving one another a slap in the face occasionally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The deceased was not—he was very quiet—the further end of the workshop, where I saw traces of blood, is not near the washstand, but at this end where "coke" is marked on the plan—the wash<lb></lb>hand room is in the lower floor at the further end, to the right of the door as you enter, near the coke bin, where the blood was in the corner—the first thing that attracted my attention was not as of some persons disputing—I did not hear Miss French make use of that terra—I heard a loud groan—I got up immediately on hearing the noise, perhaps in a few seconds, not more—there were no traces of blood in the upper floor—it appeared to be traced from the corner where the coke bin is, to the door near which the deceased was standing—there appeared to be several pieces of mortar knocked off, perhaps seven or eight—there is one step into the coke bin—the gas-light was about in the centre between the coke bin and the door—it would afford light to the place where I saw the most remote appearance of blood—there is a kind of bench by the window—it is used for laying tools and things on, and working on—there was a pair of iron tongs on it, I think, nothing else—the melting is done in the basement—there would be several instruments there.</p>

I work for Mr. French—on Wednesday evening, 23d November, I worked overtime—I left about twenty minutes to 9—I was working on some gold wire—I put my work in this tin case—when I put it in, I saw the work of a man named Grinham there—it was a large coil of gold wire, black—the value of the gold I put in, I should say, was about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Grinham's, perhaps, between 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was in Clerken well-close at the time—the crowd commenced near the premises—I came there, and saw the blood which was described by Mr. Brinton—the deceased had a pocket-book in which he kept notes and bills—I know that he kept it in his coat-pocket—I took him to the hospital—he gave me some things—he gave me from his breast coat-pocket a railway guide—a pocket-book was not among the things he gave me—before the deceased was taken to the hospital, I saw no one go into the upper workshop, except the policeman—he went with me—I went by myself two or three times—the policeman only went with me once out of the two or three times—I did not examine thus box—I did not see it after half-past 8 for some time.</p>

I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—on Wednesday evening, 23d November, at a quarter-past 11, Roberts was brought there—his face was besmeared with blood; his lips were very pale, as if from loss of blood—I examined his head; I found seven wounds on his head, and a bruise at the back of his head—there was also a bruise <hi rend="italic">on</hi> his left shoulder—the wounds were on various ¡arts of the head; one over the right eyebrow; two just above the forehead, on the right side; one on the forehead on the left side; one on the top of the head, and two on the left temple—he was sensible when he was brought in—he became insensible about three hours after his admission, and died about a quarter-past three—I don't know that he had any fear of death—I did not anticipate that he was so near death—he was very seriously injured, but I did not anticipate such a speedy termination—I was quite uncertain whether he would get well not; it was difficult to form an opinion at that early period—I did not form an opinion—I have seen the broom produced—the blows were such as might have been caused by that—I made a post mortem examination—I found the scalp extensively bruised, a large fracture of the skull on the left side, which implicated a blood vessel of some size, and from that was effused a large clot of blood—the blood vessel was broken, and the blood flowed on the brain—it must have required great violence to inflict these blows—that would depend on the nature of the instrument used—greater violence would be required with a light instrument—I should not suppose they were such as he could have inflicted on himself—if he had thrown himself from a height, that would have produced those injuries—the death was caused by those injuries.</p>

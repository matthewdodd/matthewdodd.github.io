                  </hi>. I am a General in the army. On Saturday I came from London-bridge, and was in Cheapside—I could not move; I was blocked up by the mob, and felt as if something had been taken out of my pocket—I felt a pull and looked below, and saw my watch chain hanging-close by me was a young man of that size, and I held on to him thinking he must have been the thief—he said, "Search me," and I thought from his saying so he had not got the watch, and I saw another, who began to cry out, "Search me, search me, I have nothing"—I took him too, and immediately a gentleman behind me said, "Oh, here's your watch, he has let it drop"—I did not see him drop it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Albert-place, City-road—I was directly behind the last witness on this Saturday afternoon—I saw him lay hold of a boy, and afterwards lay hold of the prisoner—the moment I heard the click of a watch go, I felt for my own, but I had left it at home, and I saw a watch dropped right between my legs; it came from the prisoner—I am positive it was he who threw it down—there were three of them, but the crowd was so great I could not get at them—I am sure it was the prisoner—I could not get at him for the moment.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Star Street, Commercial Road—on the night in question, I was in Ratcliffe Highway about 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner stab Brennan—I could not swear whether it was with a knife or dagger—I was on the opposite side of the way—I ran across, and as he was making a second attempt, I held his right arm—I tried to take the dagger out of his hand—the policeman came up then—I went with Brennan to the hospital.</p>

I live at Bell Alley, Limehouse, and was at the Prince Regent, on the night of the 20th February, with the prosecutor—there was a disturbance there—I left the house before Brennan, about five minutes—Brennan was walking away—the prisoner I saw walk behind him, and stab him in the shoulder—I saw the blade of a dagger, but not the handle—I saw O'Brien stop the prisoner's hand as he tried to stab again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London hospital—on the 21st February, Brennan was brought to the hospital—he was intoxicated—he had a wound on the left shoulder, extending through the muscle of the shoulder four inches, and about three-quarters of an inch in length—he had lost a great deal of blood—such a wound would be caused by an instrument like that produced—he seemed very feeble—The "burn<lb></lb>ing sensation" is a very correct term—he would feel that immediately after he was stabbed.</p>

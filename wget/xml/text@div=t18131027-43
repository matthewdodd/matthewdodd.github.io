The prisoner came to me on the 20th or 21st of March, in the evening; he said he was late of his Majesty's ship the Raisonable, now of the Namure. He said that he wanted an agent; he was recommended to my office. He shewed me a ticket of leave, purporting to be signed by the Captain. I then asked for his certificate, signed by the Captain of the Namure, laying at the Nore, He shewed me a certificate, signed Captain Rowley of the Raisonable, where he had served six years as Midshipman. That is the very paper. He said he was on leave only for a few days to see his mother and aunt that lived near West Barnet. He said further that he was quite out of money, and begged that I would let him have some in advance. He said that he had served six years in the Raisonable, that he was entitled to Buenos Ayres prize money, for service on board the Raisonable, for which he had only received a tenth; that he had received a payment for each prize. He stated further that his Captain advised him to get a respectable agent to look after his prize money; that he said he would have upwards of an hundred pound to take. He stated that he was at the taking of a number of ships on the service. He said if I would give him a list he would tell me which he had received and which he had not. I shewed him the list. He pointed out the prizes of the Raisonable; some he had been paid, and some not; he drew a line of distinction between. When I saw the number of ships I saw it would be as much as his Captain said he was entitled to. I gave him a pound. He returned the next day according to promise. I sent to Wetherby, the law-stationer, and got a stamp for the power of attorney. I got one, and filled it up for him; he told me the captain of the Namure was in town, that he left him at the west end of the town. This is the one that I filled up.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had filled it up what did you do with it - A. I told him I wished him to get it signed by the Captain of the ship, and another officer to make me certain that he was the man. I gave it into his hand. He put it into his pocket, and said he would immediately wait upon the Captain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any advance - A. No further than the stamp, and the pound the night before. He came upon the 23d, after dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was the blank filled up - A. On the 22d, the day after I first saw him. He came on the 23d, at my own office, No. 4, Copthall-buildings, in the City. I believe it is in Coleman-street ward. He gave me the power which I now hold in my hand; he said, the captain had signed it; he had put his initials in the margin, and that of Keene, the other officer, his initials was there. He said, Keene (the other witness) acted as lieutenant. He wanted a further loan. I stated that I must have his last will and testament, as a guarrantee. He waited, and signed that: he left both these with me. I gave him a check for ten pound; that was paid to him in the morning. He said he wanted some clothes and some necessaries.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you advance to him upon the whole - A. About twenty-seven pounds odd, I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his stating who the agent was for that service - A. He stated that Mr. Davison was the agent for Buenos Ayres. I knew the fact before. After he went away that evening I did not see him until the month of June following; I met him in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him from March until the month of June following - A. No. I met him then accidentally in Holborn. I never saw him again until then. I applied on the 25th or 26th of March, at Mr. Davison's office. I did not obtain a shilling of the prize money. When he came to me he told me his name was

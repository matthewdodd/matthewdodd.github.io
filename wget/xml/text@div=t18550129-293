                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Martin, who keeps a marine store shop, in South-street, Greenwich. On Saturday, 23rd Dec, I was ironing some linen in the back parlour, about 10 o'clock in the evening—I saw my husband's silver watch on the mantelpiece at that time—the prisoner came through the shop into the parlour, and asked me where my husband was—I said that he was at the greengrocer's round the corner, and if he wanted to see him I would send for him—I sent for him, and the prisoner waited at the shop door, and asked for something to drink—he was in the parlour about five minutes—he placed himself before the fire, and was within reach of the watch—nobody else was in the room—I had sent the child for my husband—I missed the watch about ten minutes after<lb></lb>wards—I had not left the room since seeing it safe, and nobody but the prisoner had been in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness. On Saturday, 23rd Dec., a little child was sent for me—I went to my shop, and met the prisoner by the counter—I had frequently seen him go backwards and forwards past my door—he asked me if I would come and have a drop of something to drink with him—I said, "No"—he said, "Do not go in doors; come and have a drop of something to drink"—I said, "No, thank you; on account of Christmas being so near, I will not have any now"—I went in doors, and in a minute or two missed my watch off the mantelpiece—I went in search of the prisoner, and found him between 11 and 12 o'clock on Sunday morning, and gave him into custody.</p>

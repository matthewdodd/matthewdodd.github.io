               <p>I was robbed last January. I live at No. 5, Little George-street, Westminster. I came from Wales. I was at last coming from Salt Hill. it was about half after nine in the evening, it was nine o'clock when I was at Salt Hill. I had another gentleman with me, he is not here, I believe he is abroad; we were in a post chaise I was coming between <placeName id="t17940430-8-crimeloc32">Brentford Bridge</placeName>

The chaise was stopped by five footpads together, two of them opened the doors, one of each side, and thrust their pistols in; they struck the other gentleman and they struck me against my side, and they afterwards searched my pockets and took five guineas out of my right hand breeches pocket. I lost a pair of saddle bags, it was underneath the seat of the chaise; they came in strait up and pulled them out, there was a grey frock coat in them, a kerseymere waistcoat, a pair of jean breeches, three pair of stockings, and two and three shirts,</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they stay with you? - I suppose on the whole about three minutes, or not quite so long.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they disguised? was any thing over their faces? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it? - It was a moon light night, with a light haze.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you distinguish any of their countenances? - No, I could not, not to be able to swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover any part of your property? - I was sent for to Bow-street about three weeks afterwards, and saw several things, part of my property.</p>

We took and put them in New Prison, and the prisoner he would not tell where he lodged, and so I watched to see who came after him, and there was an old man who came to him who was his father, and I took him into custody, and he told me his son lived in New Court, Fetter-lane; I went there and searched the place and found a pair of stockings, which I now produce to your lordship, and a vast quantity of other linen, I searched the room, could find no pistols, but on the mantle piece I found a pistol key.</p>

               <p>Q. It is possible that these stockings might have been mislaid? - It is not a very possible case when I had them in my journey.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth to Jealous. You went to Stannell's house, where did you find the saddle bags? - I found no saddle bags at all, there were none found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought them stockings last May in Birmingham, and nobody mended them but my mother, for when I brought them out of the country there was no mending on them at all.</p>

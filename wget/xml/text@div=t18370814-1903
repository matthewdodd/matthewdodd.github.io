                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live at Nos. 18, 19, and 20, Shaftesbury-terrace, Pimlico. The prisoner was in my employ for one year and a half, as porter—on the 27th of July I came home—I thought it right to go to the prisoner's bed-room, and there found six handkerchiefs—the bed was then pulled down, and we found half a dozen stockings, some socks, and other things—they had no business whatever there—I had not authorised him to take any thing in any way—this gold seal, and book, and other things were in his box—he said nothing at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The room these were found in was the dining-room for the family in the house. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is a room adjoining the kitchen, and other persons have access to it—he had a box in another room behind that room—I found there this seal, this book, this ink-stand, this lace, this silver thimble, besides a vast variety of other things which I have not here—the box was locked, and he had the key in his pocket—I received some duplicates, and went to the pawnbroker and got some silk handkerchiefs—I believe they were mine—they were given up to me.</p>

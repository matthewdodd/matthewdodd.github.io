                  </hi>. I am single—I was at Dr. Connolly's, at Ealing, on 15th June—I went into Mr. Fountain's liden drapery shop, at Ealing, that day—I had a small note-case in my hand, which contained a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and a memorandum—I placed it on the counter, and my parasol in front of it—on passing to the window I threw down a piece of muslin, and the prisoner, I think, picked it up—I did not speak to her—on my looking to the counter I immediately missed my note-case—I am positive the note was in it—I had taken it out in the shop intending to endorse it, and put it back again—the prisoner left immediately—search was then made for the note<lb></lb>case—it was not found—there were several other female customers in the shop, but none so near me as the prisoner—I immediately gave information to the police—I had received the note, with two others, from Messrs. Twining's, on the 10th—I have seen it since.</p>

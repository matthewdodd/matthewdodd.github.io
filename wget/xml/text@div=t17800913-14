             was following me with a cart; he told me he saw them take the parcel out of the waggon. He described the men to me; I went back again to see if I could find<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130013"></xptr> them. I went down a lane just on this side the sign of the Cock, at Houndsfield. I could not find the men. I came back again and found Mr. White's parcel upon the hedge by the side of the road, with the goods in it. I took it and carried it to the waggon; there was another parcel, a small paper parcel containing tea, sugar, and coffee, likewise taken out of the waggon. I came back to look for that small paper parcel; then I found the two prisoners standing under the hedge, about twenty roods from where I had found Mr. White's parcel. Some people came up to my assistance and we took them to Ponder's end; I took two paper parcels out of Mouit's pocket; one contained half a pound of green tea, the other a quarter of a pound of coffee. They had taken these two little parcels out and thrown the rest away. I charged a constable with them. The other two little parcels were found by some children in the hedge afterwards. Upon the the outside paper was marked Oliver. I found that paper in the hedge. I was carrying that for one Oliver.</p>

               <p>I saw Jackson at the beginning of Edmonton, driving the Cambridge waggon; it was about five in the evening; I was driving a cart about thirty yards behind the waggon. I saw Bryant get up at the hind part of the waggon and take out a brown paper parcel, and give it to the other prisoner, then I saw them throw the parcel into the hedge; and then they both ran down the lane which was about five roods off. I went forward and told the waggoner what I had seen. They chucked it over the hedge directly as they got it out of the waggon. The waggon was partly close to the hedge. When I told Jackson of it, he went in pursuit of them and I took care of his horses. Jackson came back in about half an hour, and brought back the parcel I had seen them throw over the hedge; he went back to look for some more things, and I drove the waggon to an house we stop at, and left it there, the Two Brewers in Ponder's End. I live at Theobald's Park. I went home and then came again in the evening to the Two Brewers, there I saw Jackson and the two prisoners.</p>
               <p>Where was the place you first saw them? - Before my cart, following the waggon. I did not see them above a minute or two before they got up behind the waggon.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these are the two men? - I am.</p>

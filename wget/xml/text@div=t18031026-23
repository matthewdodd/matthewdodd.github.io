               <p>EDWARD GREEN sworn. - I am a headborough of St. Luke's: I searched the prisoner's lodgings on Monday the 28th of September, the prisoner was not there; I found on the table some hats and caps, and in a hat-box I found a vast number of duplicates, and among them this duplicate of a sheet, for five shillings; I went with Mrs. Harnett to the pawnbroker's and saw the sheet; she looked at the corner of it, the marks were taken out, but she swore to its being her sheet.</p>
               <p> - SHEPHERD sworn. - I am a pawnbroker: I took in this sheet of the prisoner on the 29th of August, in the name of Ann Betts; she had been a customer at the shop a long while. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harnett. The mark has been taken out, it was marked E M H, the remains of the mark is very plain, it is exactly the same as my other sheet in every respect, I made them myself, and have no doubt it is the same sheet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent to the Solicitor for the Mint—on the evening of 7th March last, about 6.30, I went with several other officers to the Fox beer-house, Southampton Street, Camberwell—we entered by the back door, and went up stairs—Sergeant Kenwood pushed open the door, and we found twelve or thirteen men in the room—a scuffle immediately ensued—I saw the prisoner throw something from his right hand out of the window, which was open about 8 inches—at that time he was seized by Kenwood, and I saw him take from his left hand three counterfeit half<lb></lb>crowns and two florins, which he handed to me—the prisoner resisted very violently—several pieces of counterfeit coin dropped under the window, which were picked up by Inspector Bryant, and handed to me—after the prisoner was secured I looked round, and saw a man named Harris (<hi rend="italic">see next case</hi>) stoop behind the door, and place behind his heels some counterfeit coin, which I called Bryant's attention to; he picked them up, and gave them to me—Kenwood afterwards went out on the lead flats, where the coin was thrown out of the window, and produced to me six counterfeit If<lb></lb>crowns—I then went out on the landing, and placed myself in an unoccupied room—the prisoner Johnson, who has pleaded guilty, came up the stairs, looked into the room, and no doubt saw the officers, and was turning back—I said "Walk in, Joe"—he said he did not want to go in—I said "I want that you shall," and I pushed him into Bryant's arms, and I saw him take from his side coat pocket a paper packet, which he handed to me—I opened it, and it contained thirty counterfeit half-crowns, wrapped in ten<lb></lb>piece packets, with paper lapped between them in the usual way, and 120 counterfeit florins, wrapped up in a similar way—I produce the whole of the coin.</p>

I went with Brannan and the other officers to the Fox beer-house—we went up to the first floor front room—I pushed the door open—there were thirteen people in the room—the prisoner was sitting at a table near the window, which was partly open—as I entered he rose up and threw something from his right hand out of the window on to the leads—at the same time a paper packet dropped under the window, close to his feet—Bryant picked it up and handed it to Mr. Brannan—I seized hold of the prisoner—we had a desperate struggle—I succeeded in taking three half-crowns and two florins from his left hand—the two florins were wrapped in paper, and the half-crowns not; I handed them to Mr. Brannan—I afterwards got out on the leads and picked up six counterfeit half-crowns, which I also gave to Mr. Brannan.</p>

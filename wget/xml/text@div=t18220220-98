On the 30th of January, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in George-street, St. Giles's. I was inquiring for a lodging, as I was too late to sleep at my friend's in Seven Dials, where I intended. She took me to a house in <placeName id="t18220220-98-crimeloc530">George-street</placeName>

She sat by the fire smoking, and was going to get something to drink, but the woman would not let her go out. She came back, and blew the candle out. I called for a light - the woman brought one - I put on my clothes - my breeches felt light. I had three sovereigns, and 16 s. 6 d. in my pocket. We left the house together. I then felt and missed my money - she ran away immediately. I am sure she is the woman - I was afraid to make a noise in the house. I have frequently seen her before, and drank with her at public-houses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not go into several cook-shops with her - A. Yes; I paid for her supper - we had two pots of porter and a quartern of gin.</p>

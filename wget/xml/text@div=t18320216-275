               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. Where had you dined? A. With a friend, near Clerkenwell - I recollect seeing a band of musicians in Red Lion-passage; I stood listening to them - I am fond of music, and very likely asked them to play particular tunes; I did not ask them to follow me into Holborn - I did not dance to the tunes; I will not swear I did not beat time with my foot - I am generally merry; I did not caper nor dance - I saw the prisoner there, and she remained in our company all the way to Drury-lane; there were two other women with the music, who, I believe, were in our company before I saw the prisoner - we met them in Red Lion-passage; we all five went into a public-house in Drury-lane - I do not know what I drank there; I do not think the prisoner was affected with liquor - certainly not so as not to know what she said or did - I told the officer there were six or seven sovereigns in my purse; I made a mistake, there were but four - I recollected having paid away two and changed one.</p>

            . I live in Long-acre, with my mother - I am out of business. Mr. Arundel and I dined together, between two and three o'clock, and left the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160097"></xptr>house about six or seven; we went to Clerkenwell after dinner - we had dined at the York Arms, Shirelane, which I kept two years ago; it is not frequented by bad women, particularly - Mr. Arundel then went to call on a friend of his in Clerkenwell; I waited while he went in - we returned through Red Lion-square, met two or three women there round the music, and took two or three of them into Holborn, to a house kept by Mr. Thomas, stopped there about a quarter of an hour and drank- it is a wine-vaults; we then went to a wine-vaults in Drury-lane with the three women; the prisoner was one of them - they had followed us; Mr. Arundel missed his purse - I held the prisoner's hands, and he went for an officer; the prisoner then told me if I would let her go she would give me the purse, and gave it me from her bosom- it contained four sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You dined at the York Arms? A. Yes - we had wine for dinner; we got to Red Lion-square between eight and nine o'clock - we had stopped at a public-house on the way; I recollect the music in Red Lion-passage - I did not dance, nor did he; Mr. Arundel might move round with a lady - there were several women about, and two ladies were talking to us; the prisoner was there - we all five went into Holborn; I had some sherry and bitters - we treated the girls with what they chose; the prisoner was not intoxicated - I do not think I drank there; I swear the prisoner was not intoxicated; I was perfectly sober - how the purse got into her bosom - I cannot tell.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I received the prisoner in charge; Pinnel handed me the purse with four sovereigns in it - the prisoner said she was drunk, and was not aware of having put it into her bosom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you notice whether she was tipsy? A. She appeared rather so; she fainted away two or three times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Red Lion-square - the gentleman came to me; the music was playing - he asked me to go and have a glass with him; we went to Holborn- he asked the music to follow; I went into a gin-shop with him, and got very much intoxicated.</p>

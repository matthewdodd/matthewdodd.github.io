On 7th April I was employed by Mr. Dolamore to watch the prisoners—I marked about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., consisting of shillings and sixpences—I went into the public-house about 10.45; the male prisoner had just gone in—the female prisoner was there—John Spry remained half an hour—the two prisoners had a conversation together, which I did not hear—the male prisoner ordered a glass of ale—no change was given—he left, and I remained until a little before 12 o'clock, when he came back—the female prisoner had been away, but came in again—John Spry called for a glass of ale, and paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it to the female prisoner—I saw her put the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the side of the till, and she gave him in change two or three pieces of silver and some coppers—he put them in his trousers' pocket—some time previously I had given Roper this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)which is marked, to pass over the bar to the female prisoner—when the male pri<lb></lb>soner left I followed him, and told him I was a detective officer, and said "Roper told me you gave the barmaid a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and in change you received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said "That cannot be, because I have got no money on me"—I took him to the Bishopsgate police-station, searched him, and found 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers and is. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, amongst which was this marked shilling and these sixpences—I then went back to the female prisoner, and told her I should take her in custody and charge her with stealing 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the monies of her master, Mr. Dolamore, she made no reply—I then took her to the station, and the male prisoner, directly we got inside, said "You don't know me, do you?"—she said "No, I never saw you before, only coming to Mr. Dolamore's as a customer"—the male prisoner refused his name and address, and the female prisoner gave her address as 43, St. Peter Street, Cambridge Road, Mile End—in bringing him in the morning to the police-court he told me they were man and wife, both living at the same address.</p>

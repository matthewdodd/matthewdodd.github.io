                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Creer—the prisoner was our servant—shortly after she came I missed a pair of clogs—she was set to find them—she said she could not—she was to leave on Saturday, and I insisted on her box being searched—I found in it a pair of clogs, a pocket, two books, a picture, an apron, and a curtain, my husbands property—at first she said she bought the clogs, but afterwards acknowledged they were mine, and she did not know how they had got into her box, unless it was with the clean clothes.</p>

I was present at the search—Mrs. Creer took the clogs out of the prisoner's box, and charged her with taking them—she said, "No, they are mine; I bought them"—Mrs. Creer said, "You know perfectly well they are mine"—she said, "Yes, I do not know how they got in, without they got in with the clean linen"—Mrs. Creer took a pocket out—she said she did not know how that came there—she opened the box herself, in my presence—it was locked—I searched two boxes, some things were found in each.</p>

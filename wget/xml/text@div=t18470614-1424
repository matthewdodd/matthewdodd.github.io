                  </hi>. I am a cowkeeper, and live at No. 61, York-street, West<lb></lb>minster. On the 13th May I laid 12 Sovereigns in a bag under my pillow—when I rose in the morning I left them in the bed—the prisoner was my servant for nine or ten months, but had nothing to do with making my bed—I always make my own bed—I did not find the money the next night, and I searched from time to time under the bed and under the counter, but I could not find it—it was in a small canvas bag—the prisoner was asked whether she knew anything about it—she said she did not—I am able to speak to one of the sovereigns, from its dull appearance—I took it of a stranger, and was doubtful whether it was good—I bit it on the edge, and can identify it.</p>

On the 17th of May, between seven and eight o'clock, I was called in by Mr. Soane—he told me what he had lost, and gave the prisoner into custody—I told her she must go with me—she had an apron-full of wood—she wanted to go in the yard—I searched, and found on her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took a key out of her pocket, which unlocked a box at her lodging, in which I found ten new sovereigns—she had denied having any money in her box, only a bank book—she said she had found a bag in the yard, it was wet and dirty, and she threw it away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Fossey, an artist, and reside at 26, Hackney-road—about a quarter-past 5 on 4th October, I was passing along Crabtree-row, which leads into the Hackney-road—I had a leather bag, twisted round my arm, tight; it contained' a 51. Bank of England note, two sovereigns, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, a pair of spectacles, a thimble, a piece of em<lb></lb>broidery, and two linen handkerchiefs—a lad came up—I do not know which way he came—he ran at me, put his hand under my mantle, and got the bog, after a severe struggle—he pulled me down, and I was severely bruised—I have no doubt that Evans is the young man; he answers in size and otherwise; he looked like him—I called out "Stop thief!" and ran down the court—I turned back again—I was afraid of going after him far—I did not see the other prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, a costermonger, at 16, Crab<lb></lb>tree-row—on Friday afternoon, 4th October, about 5 o'clock, I was outside my father's door—I saw a lady coming along, and the two prisoners standing together—Evans took a bog she had, and ran down the court with it—the lady struggled very much, and he pulled her on the ground—she went a little way down the court and then turned back; the other prisoner stopped behind and then went down the next court—he was not above half a yard from Evans when Evans took the bag; he then stopped behind a little while and then went down the next court, which lead to Pickard—I had seen them together before this at the corner of the turning—I know them quite well.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she buy them - A. No. When she came in I was up stairs at dinner, and hearing some customer in the shop, I went down and pushed the door open; I saw the prisoner in the shop; she was putting something under her left arm. The prisoner, when I came into the shop, wished the boy to try a pair of shoes on, as she could not try them on herself. The boy tried them on. She then wished the boy to get a pair of bows tacked on, and she would call in a few minutes for them. She got up, and went towards the door; the boy said, stop, mistress, you have got a pair of shoes that does not belong to you, and took them from her. She then accused the boy of robbing her. The boy pushed the shoes over to me. The prisoner said, they are not your shoes; a man at Islington made them for me. I said, how can you say so; they are my shoes; go and fetch the man that made them, and you shall have them. With that, she took up the shoes, and went off with them. I said I would not be robbed with my eyes open. I ordered my man to fetch her back; he did. I then sent the boy for an officer; the officer came, and took her in custody. These are the shoes; they are two odd shoes; I had them in my hand that day, before the prisoner came into the shop. I know they are my property. When I said, fetch the man at Islington that she said made them, I did not expect she would take them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and resided at 7, Emily Place, in the same house as the prisoners and their deceased child—I occupied the front parlour—the prisoners had the room over it—I was not in the habit of visiting the child—I only saw it twice—I saw he family on the night of the child's death, but I knew nothing of them—I saw the prisoners in pass<lb></lb>ing through—the last week in December, I think it was, the deceased child came into my room about half-past six in the morning—I heard a peculiar rustling noise and lighted a candle, and underneath the bed in the centre of the room the child was crouching—it looked very thin and emaciated—it was in its night-gown—he spoke to me.

                  </hi>. I live at 72, Villiers Street, Bromley—I did live at No. 10 while the prisoners lived at No. 11 opposite—what first drew my attention to the house was one of the windows either having boards or shutters up—those boards were removed when Mrs. Conde was out, and I saw a child, looking more like a ghost than a child, with his head bound up with a piece of white rag—he looked very frightened and seemed quite wild—I saw him standing day after day, with no food what<lb></lb>ever given to him—I have seen Mrs. Conde fetch a pint of beer daily, and bread and cheese, and give it to her own two children, and she would keep them at the window; they were never allowed to move and play with the other child—they were kept separate—I used frequently to call over to her and tell her to give the child food, but she would never see me or take any notice—I am very deaf—if she had made me any answer I could not have heard her, but my daughter could; she was always at the window with me—the child was standing with his hands behind him and his back against the wall from morning till it was dark at night; I could see him from my window—he stood right facing the window, not in the corner, but behind where the door opened—I saw him once go round to where his mother was standing, and she struck him a heavy blow in the face, which nearly knocked him down—his father was at home, but did not interfere or take the least notice, and he had to go back to his standing-place—this was in the evening in the summer, when the father had come back to his tea; it was upwards of five years ago—I have not seen the child since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered licentiate of the Apo<lb></lb>thecaries' Company—I was called to the deceased child on Saturday, 16th February, about half-past eleven in the morning—I found him almost wasted to a skeleton; he was alive, but rigid and cold, his mouth and eyes wide open, tongue and throat parched and dry, and pulse weak; he was in bed—I ordered stimulants occasionally and other restoratives, but the child was past recovery and died in a few hours—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination by order of the Coroner—the body was dreadfully emaciated; it weighed 201b. 12oz., and measured seventeen inches round the chest, fourteen inches round the abdomen, six inches round the thigh, and was forty-one inches long—he was about twelve years of age—there were no external marks of violence, except bruises on the arms and hands, as if it had been beaten—they were superficial—there were not more than three or four, and very trifling—I should say they were about a week old—a fall might have caused them, they were on the left hand and arm; there were none on the right—there was no fat between the skin and muscles, and no fat in the body—the cause of death was starvation—there was a total disappearance of the <hi rend="italic">omentum;</hi> the stomach was empty, con<lb></lb>taining only about half an ounce of dirty creamy fluid—there was no food in the stomach, the intestines were healthy—I know the disease called atrophy—I do not think the appearances might be attributable to that; all the internal organs were perfectly healthy, the intestines were healthy—the lower intestines contained hardened foeces—the liver was healthy and the heart, but pale; there was no fat—the brain and its membranes were healthy—there was no mesenteric disease—if the child was being starved and had not sufficient nourishment, frequent beating would tend to accele<lb></lb>rate its death, the body being weakened by insufficient food.</p>

               <p>a person who has, died of atrophy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't recollect it—the lungs of the child were slightly diseased, but not sufficient to cause death; it was congestion, the first stage of pneumonia, that is the commencement of pulmonary affection—I have treated persons suffering from pulmonary disease, and have noticed that most persons suffering from it are eager for food; they have also a difficulty of digesting food: although there is a craving for food, there is frequently undigested food in the intestines—persons so affected on craving for food sometimes vomit it up again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it usual to find in the intestines hardened faces? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were hardened foeces; they had probably been there some time—the person would crave for food, but it would probably remain undigested in the intestines—it is a common symptom that the foeces do not pass freely.</p>

BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you point out anything you found on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> inconsistent with death from pulmonary disease? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The lungs were of a dark red colour—the absence of fat between the skin and muscle is not consistent with pulmonary disease, that is the first stage of pneumonia; but if the person had been suffering some time it would be consistent—absence of fat is consistent with pulmonary disease of long duration—persons sometimes waste to a state of tenuity—the <hi rend="italic">omentum</hi> dis<lb></lb>appears; that covers the intestines—I do not think the absence of it is incon<lb></lb>sistent with death from pulmonary disease—the child died from starvation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell the Jury your reasons, as plainly as you can, for saying it died of starvation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The total absence of fat, the stomach empty, all the internal organs healthy, and there was nothing to account for death—the difference between pneumonia and consumption or <hi rend="italic">phthisis</hi> is in the suppuration of the tissues of the lungs—I should not expect to find emaciation in the first stage of pneumonia—consumptive patients die in a year or two years—they do not fall away in six months after they get the attack—I have never been examined by Counsel before.</p>

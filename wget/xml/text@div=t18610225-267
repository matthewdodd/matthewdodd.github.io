                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the detective police—I have been engaged in inquiring into the robbery at the London Docks—on 12th January, I went to the Eastern Shades beer-shop, No. 1, Upper North-street, Bethnal-green—I there saw a person named Solomons, and had some conversation with him—he gave me this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took Solomons to the police-station, where he gave me a key—in consequence of what he said to me, 1 took that key to No. 6, Devonshire-street, Mile-end—I was accompanied by Sergeant Robinson—I went upstairs, and saw a Mrs. Hardiman, who is here—in consequence of what Solomons had told me, I went to a cupboard in the first-floor frout room of that house; at least, there is only one room up stairs, and one down stairs—the cupboard door was open—the key that he gave me was the key of the door of the house—I had not occasion to use it—the door was opened by Mrs. Hardiman—Sergeant Robinson went to the cupboard in my presence, and I saw him take out of it this opium (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it weighs 261bs.—Robinson took possession of it—after that, we returned 10 the Leman-street police-station, Whitechapel, where we had left Solomons—I then went with Sergeant Robinson to 63, J idling-street, Dockhead—the address on the card, is "Christopher Summers, 63, J idling-street, Dockhead"—I think it was about 9 o'clock in the evening when I went there—I did not find Summers—I waited till 1 o'clock, but he did not come home—I then returned to the station—not being able to find the prisoner, I charged Solomons on</p>

               <p>suspicion of having stolen the opium; of having it in his possession, and he was detained there in custody—I went to 63, Jidling-street again, about 11 o'clock the following morning, Sunday, and saw the prisoner there—I said, "l am a police-officer; do you know a person of the name of Solomons, residing at 6, Devonshire-street, Mile-end?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I have him in custody charged with having stolen property in his possession, and he has made a statement, implicating you in the matter"—Summers said, "What does he say then?"—I said, "I will not repeat what he says, you had better hear what he says in your presence at the station-house"—we then walked on to the station, and going along, the prisoner said, "I can't think what he wants to see me for, I never sold him anything except a sewing machine"—on arriving at the station, Solomons was brought into the prisoners presence—I said, "Is this the man that you state that you had the opium from?"—Solomons said, "Yes, that is the man"—Summers immediately said, "I never sold you any opium"—Solomons said, "Why, yes, you did"—the prisoner said, "When?"—Solomons said, "Why, many times"—Summers said, "I never sold you any opium"—Solomons said, "Why, yes you did, you know I paid you a sovereign last Friday night at the beer-shop"—Summers said, "Yes, but that was for the sewing-machine"—Solomons said, "No, it was not; you know the sewing machine was paid for long ago"—Solomons repeatedly asserted that he did any it, and the prisoner repeatedly assertedthat he did not sell it to him—he was then charged with Solomons—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a piece of opium that I got from Mr. Phillips', a chemist's shop in Tottenham-court-road.</p>

               <p>I think, "About 20 lbs."—I then got the key from him—that is not all the conversation I had about Summers—I think it is nearly all affecting Solo<lb></lb>mons—I have heard that Summers is still in the service of Mr. Kearas since be has been on bail—Mr. Kearns was examined before the Magistrate, and bound over to be here, and he was here on Monday—he was not taken before the Grand Jury—his name is not on the back of the bill—Solomons gave me the list of several places where he had sold the opium—none of those people are here—Mr. Phillips is not here—the assistant from Mr. Phillips has been here each day—I do not know whether he is here now.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Devonshire-street, Mile End, and have from time to time dealt in sponges—I have known the prisoner four or five months, I do not know exactly—I first bought opium from him somewhere about four or five months back—he came to me at the Britannia beer-shop, where I was—the landlord called me out and said I was wanted—I went out and saw a man standing at the bar, I passed him and went into the street, thinking it was my wife who had called for me, which she had occasionally done—when I found she was not there, I went in again and saw the prisoner standing at the bar—he said, "Is your name Solomons?"—I said, "Yes; what do you want?"—he said, "Do you deal in Turkey sponges?"—I said, "Yes, I do"—he said, "Would you buy some Turkey opium?"—I asked him what Turkey opium was, for I did not know—he said, "Well, I dare say you know—I said, "Indeed I do not, for I never saw any in my life; but what might be the value of it, what do you want for it?"—he asked me a price, and I told him that if he would bring me a sample I would inquire the value of it and let him know—he asked me 12<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound for it—on the next night, or a night or two after, he brought me some, a piece or two, and I took it to a druggist and inquired the value and the quality—the druggist told me it was very good quality indeed, very superior, and the market price of it was somewhere about 20<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound—I then agreed to purchase of the prisoner at half-a-guinea per pound—I asked him how he came by it, and he said that one, two, or three ships came into the docks every week, and he could smuggle such a thing as ten, twelve or fourteen pounds per week from those ships, or if he could not smuggle it that it could be smuggled from those ships, and from that time he continually brought me some, two or three times per week—sometimes it was two pounds, sometimes three pounds, and sometimes four pounds—it was never one particular quantity, but varying from a pound and a half—not having kept an account of it, 1 judged when I was first asked that I had had about 140 pounds of it, but on reference to my recollection, having a little more time since, I do not think there was so much as that—I cannot say how much short of that it was—I do not think the time would have allowed for so much as 140 pounds, in the quantities he brought at a time—I dealt with him generally at a public-house called the Duke of Gloucester, in Seabright-street, Bethnal-green, and sometimes he brought it to my house—no person ever saw me deal with him, because it was done secretly—Mrs. Hardiman, the woman who lives with me as my wife, was at home several times when he came—I</p>

               <p>remember weighing some opium at a chandler's shop, in Three Colt-lane—the name was Stichbury—the reason of my weighing it there was that he charged me for half an ounce weighed in the paper, and when I weighed it out of the paper I found I had not the weight—he was in the shop with me when I weighed it—I remember buying a sewing machine from him—that would have been a month or a little longer, before Christmas—I never kept any dates—it was paid within one week of the purchase—there were two separate payments—it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the first payment,' and 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the second, according to whether the first was 30<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was paid within ten days—I do not recollect the date, but the last payment I made him was a sovereign—that was likewise about a short time before Christmas—I do not know whether it was more than a night before I was taken in custody; I think it was one night only—I think it was on the Friday—I was taken into custody on the Saturday—I had borrowed a sovereign of the landlord of the house, to pay my fare to go into the country with, and I came home—I was not fortunate in selling my goods, and I only brought home 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me—I paid the landlord a sovereign, the prisoner came in just at the moment, and I said, "Here is a sovereign for you, and I have one sovereign left, which I want for my household expenses"—when we went outside the door he said if I could only pay him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would be a sufficiency for the present, for that there were other persons connected with him in it to whom he had got to give the money—I remember giving a card to Which her the ins<lb></lb>pector, who took me in custody—Summers gave that card to me—he wrote it.</p>

I keep a chandler's-shop at the corner of Three Colt-lane, Bethnal-green—that may be about 150 yards from the Eastern Shades—I know Solomons very well—I remember his coming in there with another person—Solomons said, "May I weigh this on your machine?"—I said, "You are at liberty to do so"—he put it on the machine and turned round to the man with him and said, "That is the weight, you see"—I said, "What curious looking stuff it is, what are you going to do with it?"—he made no reply but took it out of the scoop—I cannot say whether it was like this; it is so long ago—I cannot say whether the prisoner is the man.</p>

I have just come from Holloway prison—I was employed for eleven months at the Red Lion Wharf, Upper Thames-street—I was last there on 24th December—the prisoner was employed there at the same time that I was—I sometimes saw some opium on the drug-floor there when I passed it; some short time before Christmas the prisoner came to me when I was on the butt-floor—we worked together on the butt-floor the last two months—about a fortnight before that he said to me, "You can go to any place in the house and you can take some opium; never mind what quantity, I can get 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a pound; I know a market for it; you can take a whole case; the gate-keeper is all right; I will bring it out, and you shall have the money for it."</p>

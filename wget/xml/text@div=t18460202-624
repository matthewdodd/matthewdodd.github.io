                  </hi>. I live at Woodford-bridge, in Essex. The prisoner was in the employ of me and my father, William Henry Watkins—on the 17th of Jan. he was to drive a horse and cart to London with a load of hay—I noticed on the cart which the prisoner was going to drive, more hay than ought to have been taken—I spoke to the constable, and wished him to search the cart—the policeman told me there was rather more than a truss besides the 30lbs. he was allowed for his horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hay-binder to Mr. Watkins. I put a load of hay into each of the two carts belonging to my master—there were thirty-six trusses on each cart, to be driven to London—I bound 30lbs. of hay to put on each cart, beside the load—there was afterwards a truss found on the prisoner's cart—I believe the hay was of the same description as my master's—it was not bound by me.</p>

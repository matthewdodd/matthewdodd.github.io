                  </hi>. I have been for fourteen years and about a month an inspector in the service of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. It was my duty to be at the Barking-road station—on 19th Oct., the prisoner was acting station master there—it was his duty to issue tickets to persons going to Woolwich—it was not the duty of any one else to issue tickets, if he left—after the tickets have been issued to the passengers, they are col<lb></lb>lected, before the train leaves Barking, by myself and the prisoner—if I collected them, it was any duty to notch them—if any one else collected them, it was their duty to hand them to me to be cancelled—on 19th Oct., there was no one at the station but myself, two porters, and the prisoner—I was watching the prisoner at the 2.7 train—I was at the entrance to the platform—the prisoner was giving out the tickets, and taking the money—I took the tickets from the passengers' hands, noticed them, and handed them to the porters—two porters stood, one on each side of me—T have lost the original memorandum that I made; here is a copy (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>), and I can speak by memory as to the number of the tickets and what train they went by—I saw a ticket in the hands of a second class pas<lb></lb>senger—the number of it was 3175—I made a memorandum of it at the time—after handing it to the porter, it was given back to the passenger—I did not notch it at the time—I saw the prisoner collect that ticket from the passenger—I did not see what he did with it at the time—I saw it again in the hands of another passenger, coming from the ticket office, at the 3.7 train—the prisoner was then giving out tickets—I afterwards saw him collect that ticket again, but did not see what he did with it—there was another train at 47, but we had no passengers by</p>

               <p>that—I saw the same ticket again at the 87 train—I then collected it, and cancelled it—I took a note of another ticket at the 37 train, No. 3177—the prisoner collected it; and I saw it again at the 57 train, in the hands of a passenger going from the office to Woolwich—the prisoner served it out—I collected it, and cancelled it—I have kept both those tickets till this time—they are here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you at all a party to putting them into the tube in any way whatever? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not issue any tickets or receive any money on that day—I did not meddle with the tubes or with the boxes that they are contained in; nor did anybody but the prisoner, that I will swear—I am the general inspector—I am not responsible for the money.</p>

               <p>again at seven minutes past 3 o'clock, and again at seven minutes past 5 o'clock—the prisoner was serving in the booking office at the time—I saw him collect the ticket all three times—I did not see it notched—I do not know who notched it—this other ticket, No. 3177, was issued at the 3.7 train, and again by the 5.7 train—the prisoner collected it the second time—I can make no mistake about it—I was told to watch, and to be sure to be careful—I used to deliver tickets sometimes when the station master was absent—I did not serve at all that day—I have delivered tickets also when the station master was on the platform—I have never seen the other porter do it—I have seen the inspector, Mr. Squires, deliver tickets—I have not delivered tickets when the prisoner has been on the platform—I swear that positively—I know he has been there once a week for the last three months—I have not delivered tickets during any of those occasions, nor has Mr. Squires, nor the other porter, that I know of—I made the memorandum by taking the ticket in my hand and writing it down at the time, and the passenger was by at the time—that was the case each time—we each have clippers but we do not carry them about with us, we keep them in the office—I did not see the tickets notched—I was then in the office—I went in when I had taken the memorandum, and saw Kearsey collect the tickets—when he collected the tickets of the 5.7 train I was standing at the carriages—Mr. Squires was on the platform, near the carriages, and the prisoner was in a carriage—it was his duty to give the tickets up to the inspector—I did not see whether he gave them or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I took a memorandum of some tickets that were issued—I lost the original, but I gave a copy to Mr. Church—I saw ticket 3175 by the 2.7 train, again by the 3.7, and again by the 5.7 train—it was issued by the prisoner—I do not know who collected it at seven minutes past 5 o'clock, but I saw the inspector clip it in his office, and put it in the drawer—I did not serve out any tickets that day, but I may have taken some excess from passengers coming down from other stations without tickets—I do not remember that I took any fares from Barking to Woolwich that day—I saw ticket 3177 at the 3.7 and 5.7 trains, and then it was clipped by the inspector, but how he got it I do not know.</p>

I produce a leaf out of the train book—the commencing number on the 19th is ticket No. 3175—this professes to account for it—there is nothing here to show that it was issued again—he had no right to issue a ticket more than once—if the prisoner has received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for one of these tickets and 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the other he has not accounted to me for it.</p>

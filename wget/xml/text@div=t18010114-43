               <p>Q. Had he an opportunity of getting at the place where the corn was kept for the horses? - A. He had, he came back the next evening as usual.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am owner of Red-cross wharf; the prisoner had been a watchman in my service, about eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. You appointed him to watch over the other servants? - A. Most certainly I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He came to you at night to watch the premises? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. He was no domestic servant? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no command over your servants? - A. Only to see that I was not robbed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You were not present at the time of this discovery? - A. No, I was at home; the next evening, Tuesday, when he returned to his duty, I charged him with having robbed me of corn and coals, and produced the coat and the bag which contained the corn; he told me he had swept the corn out of the corn-barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise, or use any threat to induce him to say how he came by it? - A. I advised him to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him if he told the truth? - A. No, I did not; I advised him to tell the truth, without any condition; he said he had swept it out of a corn barge, but being closely pressed, he acknowledged he had received it from Nery, the horse-keeper; they are mixed oats, and the same that I feed my horses with; the prisoner had access to the keys in the accompting-house, that he might have helped himself if she had pleased.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140047"></xptr>(

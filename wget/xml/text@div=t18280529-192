            . On Saturday night, the 26th of April. I was in <placeName id="t18280529-192-crimeloc1069">Coventry-street</placeName>

Barrett struck him on the shoulder and ran away; the watchman came up - I gave charge of Rose: we ran after Barrett - we got the handkerchief from the area afterwards; the gentleman came back, but there were twenty or thirty thieves about - he went away, and did not tell us his name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons were there altogether? A. Perhaps one hundred; they tried to trip Whittingham up - the watchman is not here; I had a staff in my hand that night - I do not often have it; the gentleman said, his handkerchief was partly red and partly a flesh colour.</p>

            . Here is the handkerchief which Barrett threw down into the area; I did not see him take it - I had hold of him when he threw it down; I saw Rose's hand in the gentleman's pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where is the gentleman? A. There was a number of thieves surrounded him, and fairly frightened him away; I did not hear all that the gentleman said - I did not hear him say what colour the handkerchief was; I sometimes carry two staffs - I believe I have given Phillips a staff to hold while I have been tying the thieves; he has had it in his hand before - I cannot say whether it was often.</p>
               <p>ROSE's Defence. I was returning home; they came and took us.</p>
               <p>BARRETT's Defence. One of them collared me and struck me - I tried to get away.</p>

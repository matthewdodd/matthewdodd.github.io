                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of Cross-street, Old Kent-road. The prisoner called on me on 3th Nov., and said he was an officer of the Court of Chancery, and wanted tofind a family of Jackson's concerning some property now lying in the Court; 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left by a John Jackson, formerly of Springfield, near New York, and he would put me in the way of recovering it—I had told him my wife was a Jackson—he said he would draw up a petition, and he should require 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for fees to present it to the Court of Chancery—I asked him for his address, and he gave me 169, High-street, Shoreditch—he came again on 2nd Dec., and brought a paper which he said was a petition to the High Court of Chancery, on behalf of the property—I paid him two half-crowns and a sixpence—he represented that there was nothing for himself, but 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the stamp, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a nominal fee to present it to the Court—he told me then it would be not less than four days, and not over eight, before I heard from him—he called again on the 6th, and brought the answer, as he represented it to be, to the petition that he had received from the Court of Chancery—this is a copy of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he sent it me by post—I made an appointment to see him again on the 10th, and after I got the copy, and before the 10th, I spoke to the police—he came to his appointment, and the policeman was there—he then said there were to be seven pleas, and it would be 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I paid him four half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence, which were marked, and he gave me a receipt—I did not then believe what he said—after I had paid it him, I</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the Old Kent-road, and am a gas-lighter. About 5th Sept. I wrote to the prisoner, and he came the following day, and said he was an officer belonging to the High Court of Chancery—I had heard be was an officer, and asked him so when he came, and he said, "Yes"—I told him I had some property in the Court, and he said he would draw me up a petition, which would be 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I should hear from him in a few days—he afterwards came, and brought me an answer to the petition—I have not got it, he took" it away with him—I signed my name to each of them, but did not keep a copy—I signed my name to the petition and the <hi rend="italic">administration,</hi> I think he called it—he said the expense of the last was 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was for the petition—he said I could not have had a better answer if I had paid 100 guiueas for it—he called several times; but when he brought the <hi rend="italic">administration,</hi> he did not call for three or four weeks; and I wrote to him, and he did not come; I wrote again, and he came, and said the property would be settled by 22nd Dec.—I paid him the 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. (I do not know the coin) for the <hi rend="italic">administration,</hi> believing he was doing me justice, and that what he told me was true—he showed me a seal, which he said he got from the Chan<lb></lb>cellor's Court, and for which he paid three guineas; it was on a red piece of wax, with his coat of arms—the next I heard of him was, that he was in custody—the last time he came he said he thought mine would be put off till May.</p>

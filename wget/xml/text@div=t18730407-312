Staples, Depôt Brigade, Woolwich"—I put the two letters into the letter-bag, locked it, and the postman called for it.</p>

On 15th February I was the colonel's clerk at Woolwich—it was my duty to sort the letters, take the officers' letters, and leave the prisoner in charge of the office where the letters directed to the privates were left—the prisoner was employed there on the 15th, and on the 18th he asked me the name of the paymaster, saying he wanted to see him, as he felt anxious about his discharge, having lodged the money—I told him the paymaster's name, and he asked me to write it on paper—next day he asked me again the name of the paymaster, and produced this piece of paper, folded in four parts, and asked me to write the paymaster's name on it—the perforated edges and the colour of the paper induced me to think it was a cheque—I opened it, and found this cheque for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I explained to him that the cheque being made payable to order, it would be forgery to put the paymaster's name on it, and asked him where he got it from—he said that his brother had sent it to him, not knowing that he had already lodged the money—I gave him the cheque back.</p>

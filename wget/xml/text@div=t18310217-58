            . I am a Policeman. The prisoner King passed me on Sunday night, the 6th of February, near half-past six o'clock - I was standing at the corner of Earl-street and Salisbury-street, Lissongrove, about half a mile from Edgcomb's - he passed me two or three yards; I called him back knowing him, and asked what he had got about him (his appearance did not indicate that he had any thing) - he said it was all right; I put my hand into his trousers pocket, and felt a small crow-bar, called a jemmy, which I have here - I took him to the station; he unbuttoned his clothes as he went along- I suspected it was to slip out of his coat, and told him to button them up; he said, "I am not going to run away;" at the station-house I searched him further, and in the same pocket as the crow-bar I found six tea-spoons, two table-spoons, a silver watch, two salt-spoons, a pencilcase, two rows of beads, a sovereign-balance, two seals, and a watch-key: these were all in that pocket, and on his back I found this black coat, a black waistcoat, and the front of an under waistcoat - he had them on over his own clothes; he had two coats and two waistcoats, besides his own - I found a black and a yellow silk handkerchief in his hat; the black one had a pad in it - I also found a toothpick, and a shirt pin; I asked how he came in possession of the property; he said he had picked it up - I took a hat from him, which belonged to Edgcomb - on the following morning I took him some tea down to his cell; he asked if I had found an owner - I told him I had, and I was sorry to find it was so bad against him; when he got to Marylebone-office, a constable was there with two hats, which had been left behind in Edgcomb's house - he is not here; I received a hat from that constable, and knowing King wore such a hat I presented it to him, and said,"King, take your hat, and give me that you have on," which he did - he gave me Edgcomb's hat, and took the one I presented to him; I do not know whether he heard the conversation between me and the constable about the hat - after I took King I went to different stations to find out where the robbery had been committed; I was directed to the prosecutor's, and in consequence of information I went to the Sun, in Lisson-street, about half-past ten o'clock on the night of the robbery, and saw Frayne with two others sitting in one of the boxes; I did not then suspect him, and did not take him - he was afterwards taken by Webster.</p>
               <p>King. The hat he gave me did not belong to me - he took the other off my head, and said it belonged to another man. Witness. I gave him his hat, and he gave me the other in return.</p>

             re-examined. When I came to examine the house I found they had entered it at the front, for I locked the front door myself when I went away, but did not bolt it, the bolts being inside; I went out at the back door - I am positive I did not bolt the front door, but when I came into the house I found it was bolted; I saw King make towards the door, but whether he unbolted it I cannot say; I had gone to it, and found it bolted - then they seized me, and I saw them remove the bolts top and bottom; I heard the bolts drawn back - all these things are mine, and what I lost that night; the scuffle continued about ten minutes - I am positive the prisoners are two of the men; my mother did not bring a light when she came- it was on Sunday.</p>

Soon after we put our horses up at the Horse and Groom, in the Borough, a man came by me, who appeared like a farmer; said he, It is very fine harvest weather. He kept directing his discourse, and said, We are just come out of the country, from a place called Tworton, between Bath and Bristol. He had dirty-coloured boots on. He walked with me a considerable way, till we came near the Boar's-head tavern, just by London-bridge. He said a friend of his keeps that house; and coming from Bristol, he would be glad, as I was a countryman, if I would go in and drink with him. I said I never drank before dinner, because it made me sick. He over and above persuaded me. He said, I am not used to drink myself before dinner, but a little wine or some liquor, with a bit of sugar and lemon, will not hurt any body. He went in, and called for six-pennyworth. Then I said after that, You are a stranger to me, I do not desire a stranger should treat, so I called for another. Then in came the prisoner with another young fellow. He appeared like a rakish young gentleman. He had on a green waistcoat, a brown coat, and a large ring on his finger. He strutted about. The other six-pennyworth was not brought in. The prisoner and the young gentleman came up to the bar, and called for a glass of brandy. I said to the farmer, It is very odd to drink brandy such a day as this. So it is, said he, but the custom is to drink brandy when you are hot. The young gentleman being out, the prisoner said, I have just picked this gentleman up, he was with some butchers here. I thought he would have been murdered. They were at so silly a thing as hiding under a hat, and that he persuaded him to go home. He said he was a Captain's clerk just come from sea, and had received three hundred pounds. That he had put two whores into a coach, and was going to a bawdy-house, and that he would play with any body. Then he left the farmer and me, and goes up to the young gentleman. (I can describe them no other way than by the prisoner, the farmer, and the young gentleman.) The young gentleman then pulled out a bag from his pocket, and shook it, and said he did not care for any body; for he should receive three hundred pounds more the week following, and that he had then three hundred in the bag. The farmer said, As you would not let me treat you, here is a house at the corner of Cannon-street, the George, I'll treat you there. The young gentleman and farmer went in first, and the prisoner and I followed them. Going in, the prisoner said to me, I would not have you pay any thing, for this young gentleman, as he is just come from sea, do you save your money, let him treat. We went into a little room on the right hand, as the house was newly painted. They got half a pint or a pint of brandy, and would insist upon my drinking. I begged to be excused, and would not drink. With a great deal of persuasion, they made me drink a very large glass full, which made me stupified. Upon that the young gentleman said he would bet any money that us three could not produce twenty pounds, and threw out upon the table a thirty-six-shilling piece, a moidore, and a nine-shilling piece. Then he quitted the room, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060073"></xptr> left the prisoner and the farmer with me (I found afterwards) to back me on. Then he came in again, and said we were a parcel of land-lubbers. I am sure you can't produce twenty pounds among you all. Then he said he would bet two guineas out of that quantity of money to one guinea, that we did not. Upon that the prisoner said he had just been paying away a great deal of money, and he had not hardly any about him. The farmer said to me, How much have you? Then the young gentleman went out of the room again, and left them to talk to me. After they had talked to me a great deal, the farmer asked me how much money I could make, if I went home. I said, I must dress my master, and could not come out again soon. He asked me if I could not get into the house, without my master seeing of me. I said, No. (As he said if I could raise fourteen or fifteen guineas, he would make up the rest, and it would be a great service to me if we won to keep me in the country, as this gentleman has so much money. The young gentleman went in and out seven or eight times.) They made me drink another glass of brandy, and with a great deal of persuasion I went home, and brought fifteen guineas and a great deal of silver, five crown pieces among it. When I came in, the young gentleman goes out of the room again. Then they would go to the King's Arms tavern, in Cornhill. When I came out, they were at the corner of Change-Alley. I followed them in. There was a bottle of port, and four or five glasses on the table. They asked for a pen and ink to be brought into the room. They took a glass of wine each, and made me drink one. Said the farmer, I'll convince you that you are wrong (to the young gentleman) to guess three times out of four what a halfpenny shall be, heads or tails, to hide it myself under my own hat. Upon that the young gentleman and the farmer played for a shilling. The farmer put the halfpenny under himself. The young gentleman went to the farther end of the room and guessed. The farmer won seven or eight times. Upon that they played for half a guinea a time; he won again. Then the young gentleman quitted the room. The prisoner and farmer fell to persuading me to play. I told them I never gamed so high as a six-pence in my life, at cards or any thing else. They kept trying to persuade me. The prisoner said, If you don't get his money, somebody else will. The whores will, for he will spend it. Perhaps all this money will not last him above a month. Then he will go to sea again; and you may as well have it as the whores. I still stood in it I would not play. The farmer and the young gentleman played again. The farmer won again. Then they made me drink again. The young gentleman went out of the room again. Then with over and above persuasion, the farmer saying he had won so often, I might be convinced I should win, and the farmer would go partners with me. Then I consented to play, but would go no more than half a guinea. They wanted me to go ten or twelve guineas at once, the farmer was to go half; he stood at my right hand; we won the first half guinea, but the farmer would not let me have mine that I won. We went half a guinea each against the young gentleman's guinea. He said he would pay me before I went. Said the prisoner, You have no room to doubt the gentleman. You may as well go farther. Said the prisoner, How much can you go farther? Sir, You may as well go as much more. You see this man has won so much. You may as well go for ten or twenty guineas at once, as well as such a trifle. Then the young gentleman was out of the room. Upon that I shewed what I had got. With a great deal of persuasion I went for ten guineas at once. I took out ten guineas, and counted them in my hand, and the farmer took them out of my hand. I made a resistance. Said the prisoner, You can't suppose you will be cheated of your money; you are safe enough; you are in the room. As he was my partner, I could not suspect but he was an honest man. He threw my ten guineas into a hat upon the table, and the farmer threw ten guineas into the hat out of his pocket, but he would not let me look at them, and the young gentleman threw his great green purse into the hat, saying, If you win, you will be sure of your money; for there is five hundred guineas. Said the prisoner to me, You may be sure, for there is plenty to pay you. I took a halfpenny, and put it under my hat. When I put the hat down, the farmer always made that a rule to lift the hat up and see what the halfpenny was, and call to the young gentleman. He would not let me call once. His method was, What will you have?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060074"></xptr> or, What will you have now? * I made resistance, and said I think I have a right to call myself. Said the prisoner, You can't suppose your partner will do wrong, that loses his money as well as you. The young gentleman won the ten guineas; he called right all the three times. Upon that the prisoner said, Gentlemen, you seem to have very bad luck, be in spirits, you will win all his money before he has done. With a great deal of persuasion, I went two guineas more; and the farmer he put in two guineas. We lost that time. Then I went a moidore. The prisoner said, So you seem to be rather out of spirits; why don't you go all at once? You will either get a great deal, or lose. You are sure of winning. He wanted me to put in all my crown pieces, and all my silver I had. After I lost my moidore, I seemed to be rather vexed, and out of spirits. I thought these must be a set of false fellows, that knew one another. The prisoner said, I have a friend, a woollen-draper, that lives in the Poultry; I can have seven or eight guineas there, and I will try my luck with him, and you shall see what we can do with him. Then the prisoner, as well as me, gave the farmer a strict charge to keep the young gentleman in the room till we came back, as he had won so much money. Then we went to go to the Poultry, but the prisoner said, We will go in here; at the King's Head tavern, by the Mansion-house. We will have half a pint of wine, and I will pay for the wine: it is but half a dozen doors higher. You need not go there, I will go myself. There he left me. I did not stay to drink the wine. I went back to the King's Arms in Cornhill again, but the young gentleman and the farmer were gone, and had taken my cane; there came the waiter, who said, I hope them gamblers have not taken you in? I thought they had been breaking you in as one of their gang. When I told him the circumstances, said he, I knew them to be a set of rogues in many places where I have lived. I applied to my Lord Mayor, and got a warrant, made special for Whitechapel way and for the Borough, and employed Justice Fielding's men. It has cost me above fourteen guineas to take these people. Also I walked up and down myself to see for them. I took the prisoner myself half a year after in the Strand. I was with the chariot coming to town with my master. I knew him as soon as I saw him. I carried him to my master's house in Lombard-street. When he came there, he desired to go to the necessary: he looked round him when there, and said, There is no place to get out; you need not stand by me. I said, I will not leave you. He took this purse out of his pocket, and dropped it down the water closet. I thought I heard some noise, so as soon as he got off the necessary, I took it out. (Produced a net-work purse with a large quantity of yellow counters in it, fastened in with net-work above, so that if a good guinea was above, those would not come out with it.) Then master desired I would take care of him. Master went with me to the Mansion-House. There were six or seven such gilt pieces taken out of each of the prisoner's shoes: there was also a powder-horn found upon him. He made interest to get bail, and neither he nor his bail appeared to have his trial, so they have forfeited their recognizance. I took him since at the end of Tooley-street, with two other people with him. He made the greatest resistance, and said I might take the bail, he would not go with me. I insisted on his coming with me, and brought him the second time to my master's house, where Sir

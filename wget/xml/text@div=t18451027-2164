I am the wife of John Tapson, a sur<lb></lb>geon, living at Clapham<lb></lb>rise—on the 10th of June, about half-past one o'clock, I saw the prisoner at my house—Mr. Tapson was from home—she said, "I am unknown to you, but well known to Mr. Tapson, who is well known to myself and my family; he has attended me and my family"—she said she was unfortunately situated with a street <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and she had left home without her purse—I asked her what she required—she said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would be sufficient—I then save her two half-crowns, believing her to be a patient of my husband's, who, she said, had attended herself and family—she said she had been attended by my husband—I asked her to leave her name—she said she had no card, but would write her name—she wrote it, but I have destroyed it—she wrote, "Miss Evans, Grove House, Leyton, Essex"—I immediately replied, "I thought your name was Edwards"—she said, "No,</p>

               <p>Evans is my name—Miss Evans"—she said she would return and leave it in two days—I begged she would call before eleven or after two o'clock, that she might see Mr. Tapson—she said she knew those were his hours, she knew him very well—she then left, and I did not see her again till she was in custody.</p>

               <p>service about eighteen months—I had reason to suspect my store-cupboard was robbed from time to time, and suspected the servants—I purchased half a pound of tea and four pounds of sugar, marked them, and put them into the cupboard, taking care that the articles for use were taken from another part of the house—I adopted that means of ascertaining that the cupboard was opened every night from Monday until Sunday morning—I subsequently found part of the articles marked in the possession of the pri<lb></lb>soner—I marked the black tea by putting with it a small portion of a particular green tea, which could not be taken for mixed tea; and also got some small bits of lead, which were cut into chips and put into the canister—we had lost the key of the closet about six months before—on calling in a policeman, on Sunday morning, the 2nd of February, and charging the prisoner with the theft, she denied it with great firmness, and never de<lb></lb>parted from the denial—the policeman went into the kitchen, and found a tea-caddy with about two ounces of tea in it—he asked the prisoner if it was her tea—she claimed it—it was compared with the tea taken from the cupboard by myself, and agreed with it, having the peculiar sort of green tea and some pieces of lead mixed with it—out of twelve ounces, five and a half ounces were taken—it was stated to me, in the presence of the pri<lb></lb>soner, that she had retired for a particular purpose—my wife apprehended that occasion had been used to get rid of the key, and the policeman found the key that had been missing for six months on the top of the soil.</p>

On Sunday, the 2nd of Feb<lb></lb>bruary, I was called into the prosecutor's house—he gave the prisoner into my custody—she went with her mistress to be searched, and shortly after I went to the privy, and found a key, which I produce, on the top of the soil—I asked the prisoner if she knew that key—she said, "Yes," and she was very sorry for it, she was very sorry she had not told the truth, for she thought then her master would forgive her—I took her to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house—I saw the prosecutor take some tea from a caddy, which the prisoner claimed, and some from a canister in the store-room—they both appeared the same mixture—I found particles of lead and green tea among both.</p>

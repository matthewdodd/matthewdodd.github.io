On the 5th of March, the prisoner came to my shop, stating himself to be a publican, and that he wanted a firkin of butter; he said he would call again, and that he always paid ready money for every thing. He called again the next day, but we could not agree about the price; the next evening he called again, and ordered 56lbs of butter, two large cheeses, and one small one, and desired me to send them to the Barn public-house, in St. Martin's-lane, immediately, with a bill and receipt, which, he said, he had kept for two years. It being Saturday, I did not send it immediately. In about twenty minutes a man came, and desired me to send them directly, without the Gloucester cheese, as a customer was waiting for the cheese; he said he was to see them weighed and sent off with him, with a bill and receipt. I gave them to Ash, and told him not to part with them without the money.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Chapman. I took the firkin of butter and cheeses, with a bill and receipt; when I got to the Barn public-house, the man who went went with me from my master's, told me I was not to go in, but to put them down at the door, and said that the butter was to go into the house, and the two cheeses were to go over the way to his brother's. I untied them, and took the two cheeses off the butter and took them into the public-house, the landlord said he had ordered none. On turning round I saw a man stooping to the butter which I had left at the door, I run out and found it was gone. I saw the prisoner, with the butter, running towards the church steps, and I pursued him - He found the yard gates shut and turned back again; I called out stop thief! he threw the butter down and ran away, but was secured immediately. I am sure he is the man. I took the butter up.</p>

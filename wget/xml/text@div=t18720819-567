                  </hi>. I am the wife of Patrick William Hogan, and live on the second floor, in George Court—on 6th August I went to bed, with my children, a little before 12 o'clock—my husband came in at a little after 12 o'clock, and locked the door—between 1 and 2 o'clock I heard a jug break in the room, which woke me up—I sat up in bed, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner standing on a chair with the clock in his hand—I went over to him and said "Good God! who are you?"—he said "Hush," and held the clock with his right hand and tried to drop the blind with his left, but the tassel came off—he went into a water-closet on the landing, and I went after him in my chemise—he left the clock hanging—he ran down stairs and I after him—he was about to leave the door, and was caught by the constable—I examined my room door; the lock was burst in—I had given half-a-guinea for the clock—the street door folds in two; one half is fastened every night—there is a barber's shop at the bottom; he bolts half, and it is very rare that the other half is fastened—the staircase is used by all the lodgers—there was a gentleman in the house whose wife was out, and we heard her go up stairs ten minutes before he heard me scream—the door was half open when I followed the prisoner down stairs.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman D</hi> 122). About 2.30 on this morning I was on duty in George Court, and saw the prisoner rush out of Mrs. Hogan's house—I chased him, and caught him after 200 yards—I told him he was charged with stealing a clock—he made no answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was introduced to the house by a female, who evidently knew the house; she walked in and I walked in after her; there was no front door to open. I stood in the passage some time with her. I was a little the worse for drink, or I should never have been there. She went up stairs, and I after her, and seeing the second landing bedroom door open, I imagined she was there. I saw no one. I heard a clock ticking. I had no bed to go to, and thought I would stay till morning. I got on the chair to see what the time was, and the clock weight came down, because it caught my hair. I never thought of committing a burglary. The girl</p>

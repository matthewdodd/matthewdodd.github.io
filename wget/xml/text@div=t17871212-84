             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 6th of November I was going home to my lodging; I crossed through Farthing Fields, and I met, in a kind of a gateway, three men, two in soldiers clothing, with bayonets in their hands; The prisoner at the bar came and took me by the collar, and demanded my money; I am confident to the man; it was dark, but there was a lamp in the street, just by the very place; the prisoner took me by the collar, and demanded my money, upon which I told him I had none; he told me he knew better; upon which I gave him a guinea and seven shillings, and my watch.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner? - My Lord, I picked him out of the three battalions upon the parade; I never saw him, to the best of my knowledge, before that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120105"></xptr>How long was it that this robbery was in transaction? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>In the course of that time did you make so accurate an observation of his person, as to be able to swear he is the man? - I took particular notice of some kind of a cut on his left eye; he had me so close, that it was impossible to be deceived in the man.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man? - My Lord he is the man.</p>
               <p>You say he robbed you of a guinea, seven shillings, and your watch? - Yes, my Lord, one of the other two, who was on the other side of me, says, you have got a good hat, and he took that off; one of the others gave me a stroke with a bayonet on the head; then they quitted me, and I followed them; then as I was going about fifteen yards on, the prisoner came up back to me, with the bayonet drawn in his hand, and swore, by the Holy Ghost, if I came one step farther, he would plunge the bayonet in my guts.</p>
               <p>Have you ever recovered your property? - No, I am a seafearing man, I was going to Jamaica again, and I thought no more about it as I had my life safe; and a soldier told me that the outliers were to be on the Bird-cage-walk on Sunday, and for me to come there, as he thought he knew the man; upon which I got up pretty early on Sunday morning, and went there, and walked up and down the banks, and in the second company, next the grenadiers, I saw this man, the twelfth man on the right.</p>
               <p>At this time, when you made this observation, had that person pointed out this man? - No; I fixed on the prisoner at the bar, before I ever met him.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before he robbed you? - Never.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner at the bar very well; I keep the Bald-faced Stag in Holywell-row near Moorfields; he was quartered on me in August last; he belonged to the first regiment of guards; he is discharged now; he continued in my quarters till about the 12th or 13th of November; when he was taken up; there were other soldiers quartered on me, but I had no others besides him, at that time; he came the 21st of August.</p>
               <p>Now can you give an account how this man passed his time, from the 21st of August till the 13th of November, when he was taken up? - Sometimes he went out to work.</p>
               <p>Then during that time you could give no account of him? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you say what became of him on the 1st of November? - No.</p>
               <p>On the 2d, 3d, and 4th? - No.</p>
               <p>On the 6th? - On the 6th there was a woman lived with us to help the maid; on that day, her daughter was said to be married to a man with a wooden leg, which makes me take notice of that day in particular; I went out in the afternoon, about four, and returned about five; and when I came home, the prisoner at the bar was in company with these very people, making merry.</p>
               <p>How far is your house from Queen-street, Wapping? - I look upon it to be better than a mile and a half; they continued there all the evening, till between eight and nine; I cannot say particular to a few minutes, but I am certain it was after eight, and it might be near nine before they went home to bed, then the prisoner went to bed.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this was on the 6th of November? - I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. What day of the week was it? - It was on a Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>Now from the hour of five, when you first observed the prisoner at the bar to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120106"></xptr>in this company, till the hour of eight or nine, when he went to bed, might he not have been absent so as to go two miles and a half, without your observing him? - No.</p>
               <p>Had he never been out of your sight during the whole of the time? - Never more than five or ten minutes; he was in company with these people all the evening; Gilmore the soldier brought some mutton stakes, and the wooden legged man brought liquor.</p>
               <p>Was he any relation to the wooden legged man? - No.</p>
               <p>How came there such an intimacy? - Gilmore and the old woman had known one another, by being in the house together.</p>

               <p>Jury. Perhaps this witness can give us some information about his black eye.</p>
               <p>Has he had any mark on his eye? - Not the night that they said he committed the robbery; on Tuesday the 6th of last month, he had no black eye at that time, no other than what I always see on his face; he had no mark at all.</p>
               <p>Was you of the wedding party? - No, my Lord, I only came to the house for my beer, I saw him at five, six, and seven that night.</p>
               <p>Then you had three pints of beer instead of one? - No, my Lord, I staid till six, and went out, and came in again at seven.</p>

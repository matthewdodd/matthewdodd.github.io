On Tuesday evening, the 2nd of February, having lost several articles while my carts have been at the door, I was on the look out - I opened my door very carefully, and saw the prisoner by my horse's head; I immediately ran up the court, and said, "Halloo, my lad, what now?" he dropped this howsing, and ran off; I immediately followed him - he was stopped at the corner of Fish-street-hill; I never lost sight of him - on the spot where he was stopped I picked up a common knife; the howsing was cut off the horse's back; I suppose I was five minutes in pursuit of him - there are two brass plates in the howsing; it is worth 4s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you had lost a pair of reins? A. I said I thought it was a pair of reins, but attached to the howsing was a long thong.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KIRWAN. I am a patrol of Bread-street. I was on duty, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner run against a post, and stop - I ran up, and took him- Simmons came up directly, and charged him with stealing some harness from his horse; he said nothing to it.</p>
               <p>JAMES HAMOND. I am a beadle of the ward. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and found the prisoner in custody.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman did not know what he had lost; being cold I was running - he called Stop thief! and I was stopped; he charged me with stealing a pair of reins off his horse; I was taken to the watch-house, and kept there a quarter of an hour - I said I had stolen nothing. The constable of the night told the prosecutor to go and see what he had lost; when he came back he brought this with him to the watch-house.</p>

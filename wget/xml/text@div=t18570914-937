On 22nd Aug, about) half past? 12 o'clock, I saw the prisoner Mullins carrying this rope in Barbican—I told him I was an officer, and asked him what he was going to do with it—he said to take it to a job in Bishopsgate Street, and he had brought it from Cursitor Street—I asked him if he was in Messrs, Brown's employ, he said "No"—it is all in one piece—I asked him if he bad ever been, in Mr. Brown's employ; he said, "No."</p>

I was foreman of the works at Bread Street Hill—I saw some rope there—it was broken and laid aside, and another taken—I did not order the prisoners to get rid of it, nor to take it off the premises—I have an opinion that this rope here produced is a part of the rope that was broken, but I will not swear to it—this job was on Bread Street Hill—Messrs. Browns' office is on College Hill, and the yard on Fish Street Hill—the prisoners were in our employ, and Murray also—I think I dis<lb></lb>charged Murray the same day that I discharged Mullins, I am not positive—Murray was discharged in consequence of some disagreement between him and Finn—Finn has been out on bail; I think he was in our employ for eight or nine days—he way a ganger of one gang of labourers—I had no charge against him, but I fancied be belonged to the same close, and I dis<lb></lb>charged him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a labourer, in the employ of the prosecutors, on Bread Street Hill—the two prisoners were there, Finn was under foreman—I remember this rope, it was used on the Friday before it was taken away—I remember its being broken—we laid it aside till the Monday following and I saw the prisoners take it from where it lay, and coil it up—I heard Finn say to Mullins, "Take it, and make what you can of it"—they laid it on one side for a few minutes till the foreman, Rabjohn, was out of the way—Mullins came back in about an hour and a half, and worked till 7 o'clock, and he and Finn west off together—I saw Mullins on the Satur<lb></lb>day, on the Monday, and on the Tuesday; I asked him what he had done with the rope, he said it was gone, and he said afterwards it watt to a marine store, in Brook Street, Holborn, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said that it was a shame to sell such a rope as that for that price, and that I could tell him where he could make a. 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it—he said the rope could he got back by paying the money down again—I likewise asked Finn what had become of the rope, and he said that it bad gone to another job—I said, "What is the good of your telling me such a thing?" and said that it was a foolish job—he paid it was not, it was all gone for drink—I said, "What is the good of your tell<lb></lb>ing such a story to me?"—I did not communicate it to Mr. Brown till the Friday after that—I afterwards went with Mullins to a man named Aaron, to get the rope back—I paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Mulling showed me where the rope was—Mullins took the rope, and the constable took him with it—I was in the street, not far off.</p>

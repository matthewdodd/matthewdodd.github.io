            . Q. You are an officer belonging to Worship street. - A. I am. I was sent for by the gentleman that has been just examined; I saw the shirts that was produced by the pawnbroker. In consequence of what the woman told me, I went home to the woman's apartments in White Hart court, Hoxton; there I found these six shirts and two silk handkerchiefs; from the information that she gave me, I went to Mr. Finch's house in Cornhill in company with Armstrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take these shirts with you. - A. I did; I shewed them to Mr. Finch and Mr. Arrowsmith, they claimed them; one I think has been washed and wore, the others are new. I went with Mr. Arrowsmith to Hackney; we saw the prisoner, he was told by Mr. Arrowsmith that he must go before the magistrate on suspicion of stealing six shirts. I took him to the office in Worship street. I took him into a room where Ann Hall was sitting, that had been to pledge some shirts with Mr. Hall; I asked Ann Hall if that was the man that brought the shirts to her, she cried and said he was; he made no reply. I took him into the front parlour of the public office; the shirts were shewed him; they were taken out one by one. Armstrong asked him who these shirts belonged to, he said to his master, Mr. Finch.</p>
               <p>Q. These are the shirts in the paper. - A. Yes; he said he got them from his master Mr. Finch; he was asked whether he got them with Mr. Finch's knowledge. No, he said Mr. Finch knew nothing about it; he seemed to be very sorry for it; and made apology.</p>

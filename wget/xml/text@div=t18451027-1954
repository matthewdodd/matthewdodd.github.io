                  </hi>. On Monday morning, the 22nd of Sept., between twelve and one o'clock, I was walking in Holborn—Thomas came up and ac<lb></lb>costed me, and I agreed to accompany her to a house in Lawrence-lane, St. Giles's—when we got into the room I saw Brennan—she demanded something for drink—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that purpose—she went out, and Tho<lb></lb>mas remained with me—Brennan returned in a moment, and fastened the door—Thomas and I were arguing—the was demanding money—I had had no intercourse with her—I put my hand into my pocket and gave her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Brennan said she would have some money too—I said I had no more money about me—Brennan made use of very blackguard language, and said the would have some money at the room belonged to her—I made my way towards the door—Brennan said, "You are not going yet, till I am paid for the room"—I still refused to give her any money—I said I had not got any, and was making my way out—Brennan said, "I will feel to see whether you have"—she felt, and discovered I had got something in my pocket—she said, "What is that you have got in your pocket?"—I laid, "What is that to you, it is nothing that concerns you"—I afterwards laid it was a watch—I said, "Don't rob me of it, but behave yourselves honestly, and let me go"—Brennan then said, "Just tell me the time, as I have got somebody to meet"—I hesitated for some time, and at last I partly lifted the watch out of my pocket so as just to see the time, and told her it was half-past twelve—I then asked her to unfasten the door and let me go—they both rushed on me—Brennan thrust her hand into my pocket, and got the watch, and the chain attached to it—Thomas was on my other side at that time, with her hand in my other trowser's pocket—she took out 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and some halfpence—she pulled out her hand, knocked my hat off my head, and took my handkerchief, and while I was picking that up, they opened the door and rushed out—one called out <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, and the other, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>—I went out, met a policeman, and told him what had happened—I saw Brennan again on the Monday night, opposite St. Giles's church—I had a policeman with me—I pointed her out, and 'aid, "That is the girl that stole my watch, take charge of her"—she said she had never seen me—I saw Thomas on the following morning, in cus<lb></lb>tody</p>

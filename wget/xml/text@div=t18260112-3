               <p>GEORGE JAMES LEWIS. I live in Stanhope-street, Clare-market. On Sunday morning, the 25th of December, about one o'clock, I was returning from a party, walking arm-in-arm with a friend - I was quite sober, and in <placeName id="t18260112-3-crimeloc17">Drury-lane</placeName>

I was not knocked down. I placed my back up against a wall to defend myself; the prisoner struck me in the face with his fist, and instantly seized my hat; I saw him deliver it to some of his companions; he immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120005"></xptr>made his way towards Russell-court; I followed as well as I could, and collared him at the top of Russell-court; he was never out of my sight. I called the watchman, who came up instantly, and took him; the rest ran off in different directions. I did not think of looking for my hat. I am quite positive he is the boy who struck me and took my hat - there was a gas-light exactly opposite to where I stood. I am sure he struck me before he pulled my hat off. The boys all appeared to be of one party.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Clement Danes. On Christmas morning I heard a call of Watch! ran into Drury-lane, nearly opposite Russell-court, and saw the prosecutor running after the prisoner; there were twenty or thirty boys and young men in Drury-lane. I and the prosecutor both seized the prisoner about the same time - Lewis said he had stolen his hat; I believe the prisoner said nothing; I took him to the watch-house. I am certain he is the boy whom Lewis seized; the others dispersed in different directions.</p>

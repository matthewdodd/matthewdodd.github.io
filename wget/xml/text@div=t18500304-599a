                  </hi>. I am a cigar-case maker, at 29, Little Alie-street. The prisoner was in my service, not as a traveller, but to take the cases about to be sold—I went about also—we were not partners—on 29th Jan., I had three dozen cigar-cases to sell—the prisoner said as he was able to speak a few words of English, he would go with me and assist me to sell them—we went together to Bishopsgate-street, where we sold one down—I we afterwards went to shops in different places, and at last came to Oxford-street, where we had dinner—we then went to several shops, till we came near to Newgate—I then had occasion to step aside; the prisoner had the cases, and when I returned he had disappeared—I went home and made inquiries, but I could not find him out till the Saturday following, in Goulston-street, and I gave him in charge—it was two dozen cases that I lost—I had made them—the prisoner has assisted me a little; he was my apprentice—the agreement was, that he was to learn for four weeks; during that time I was to give him breakfast and supper, and he was to sleep in my house—I gave him dinner,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185003040071"></xptr>
               <p>but the amount of the dinners he was to work for, after the four weeks had expired—I procured the materials—he was not to have any share of the profits—a few days ago I saw some cigar-cases in a pawnbroker's shop, in White<lb></lb>chapel, which were my work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I worked at Witz's, at weekly wages; the prosecutor was work<lb></lb>ing there; I often had conversation with him, and I treated him with beer and gin, and liquor; he said I was spending my time useless to learn so long, I could learn it in a week, and afterwards I could earn six, eight, or ten shillings a week; if I had a couple of pounds, I could work with him as partner; I advanced him ten shillings, and afterwards, on the Sunday, I gave him nine shillings, and afterwards more money; and we both went to Bishops-gate-street and bought leather; all the money that I gave him was thirty-five shillings, which he is well aware of. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He did not give me that—he has contended throughout that he was a partner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. We worked together, and made three dozen cases; he told me to procure more money, and I went to some acquaintances of mine on the Wednesday evening, and borrowed more money, with which I bought paper, and bread, and other things that were wanted at home; I had been out alone on Monday and Tuesday, to sell them in New-street, Gravel-lane, and Hounds-ditch. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I lent the prisoner two shillings, and that he paid me again—that was all the money that passed between us—it is not true that I persuaded him to leave his former employ, to go about with me selling these things—I was working at Witz's, and he sold his business to me, and the prisoner came to me as an apprentice—he had not possession of the cases on two former days—I never intrusted my property to him alone—the cases which were done up and finished, I did not keep in the house, for fear they might be taken—I took them to my former employer, Mr. Witz; and there I always went with the prisoner when we went out to sell them; there we got them, and when we came back I left them there again—they did not belong to him, they were my sole property—when I established my own business, a relation of mine, and other acquaintances, lent me some money—I was not a servant to my former master, I had begun business on my own account—I paid my former master for the part he did to these three dozen cases, by making some other cases for him, and the difference he paid me in money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. We had still to finish three dozen for our former master. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, they were left unfinished—I left my master on Saturday, when he had one dozen money-purses to finish—he was in want of silk—I offered to finish that one dozen for him, which I did not mind doing—my master it not here; he was at Worship-street, where he witnessed to my statement—he was sworn there—his name is Isaac Witz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. When we were in Oxford-street he told me that times were very bad, and we would separate, and he intended to go abroad; I said, "How about my 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?" and he said, "There are the two dozen cases. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not tell him that—he did not say to me, "How about the 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"—I did not authorize him to dispose of these to make good any sum of money that he claimed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He gave me the cigar-cases, and said, "That makes 24<hi rend="italic">s.;"</hi> I said, "How about the other 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?" he stated at Worship-street that I had demanded the other 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from him. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Nine shillings was mentioned—at the moment I gave him in charge he said, "I have nothing to do with him, he shall give me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—when he was given into custody he maintained that there was still 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due to him—he has maintained from first to last that he took this property on a claim of right—he stated that he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185003040072"></xptr>
               <p>a right to do what he has done, and there was still something due to him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 68). I took the prisoner, but I could not make out what he and the prosecutor said—there was a great deal said, there was no quieting them at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Before the Magistrate I was told to come again on Thursday, and I did; if I had been a thief I would not have come. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He did come again—he was let out on his own recognizance—there was a witness, but he knew nothing but about money, and the Magistrate declined his evidence—I have always understood from the very first that the prosecutor owed the prisoner money.</p>

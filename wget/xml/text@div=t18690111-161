                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and have an office in Great James' Street, Bedford Row—I live at 55, Oakley Square—on the night of 18th November, about 9.45, I was walking towards my office, intending to call for some papers—I had left Brett's hotel at 9.30, where I had been dining with a friend—I turned into a urinal in Jockey's Field's—there was a gas lamp over the urinal, and a boy was there with lighted candles in each compartment—there are, I think, three compartments—there was another man in the urinal—I was just on the point of turning out of the urinal when the prisoner came up, turned into the urinal, seized hold of my guard chain, which I had attached to my watch and the button hole of my waist<lb></lb>coat, and attempted to take it from me—I resisted, and took hold of him by his coat and waistcoat with my right hand—I had an umbrella in his left hand—this happened just within the urinal—the lamp was quite near—I could see most distinctly, everything, almost as the light of day—the prisoner immediately up with his left fist and struck me a violent blow across my lip—which cut my lip very much—I still retained my hold of him, and called out for help, and then he still retaining his hand on my chain, up with his fist and gave me a violent blow on my left eye—it cut my eye a good deal, and gave me very great pain—the effect of it was to knock me down in the urinal—I had been suffering from severe illness and was rather weak—I was perfectly sober—while I was down he made another violent try at my chain—he got it away from my waistcoat but left my watch in my pocket—the chain he took away—as soon as I got up I went</p>

               <p>to my office first, and immediately made a complaint to a policeman whom I met in Lamb's Conduit Street—he accompanied me to the police station, and I there gave a description of the person—at the time I was in the urinal I saw that he was a dark man with peculiar features, rather a prominent roundish nose, rather a short man and stoutly built—on Sunday, 29th November, ten or eleven days afterwards, I was called by the police to look at some men—four men were shown to me, among them was the prisoner—I recognized him as the man who had assailed me—but I could not swear very positively to him at the moment—it appeared to me that his features had a little changed, that he had extended his nostrils by breathing through them—but on seeing him the next morning in the waiting room I had no difficulty whatever in recognizing him—I am positive now that he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When you saw me at the police station were there not two other men with me, and two policemen, about six feet high? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I don't know who they were, I should think they were about five feet high—I think I first said "I think he is the man, but he has not the same suit of clothes on"—I don't remember that I had any conversation with the constables after that—I went and looked at you again, and was even more confirmed in my impression than I was at first.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 163). I was at the station on 29th November, when the prisoner was there—I called in two young men who were passing by, and placed them and a policeman with the prisoner, and two others who were charged with him, named Edwards and Hopkins—the policeman was in plain clothes, and was about five feet seven or eight in height—the persons from the street were dressed in the same class of life as the prisoner, apparently—the prosecutor went to the prisoner and pointed to him—he was told to touch the one he knew, and he touched the prisoner—he did not point to anyone else—at the Bow Street Police Court the prisoner asked to see me, I refused last Session—he asked the Judge to let him see me—I went to him—I did not hold out any inducement or threat to him—he said "I did not steal the chain, I know who did, I saw the chain just after it was stolen"—he said it was done by three men living on the Dials—he told me their names, and mentioned a house in Charles Street, but said he could not say they were living there—he told me to apprehend them—he said they had not been to see him or sent him anything—he said it was an old fashioned round chain, he saw it in the beer shop on the Dials—I asked him the beer shop, he said he did not know—he said he believed the chain was sold in Barbican—I asked him where, and he then said, "Well, I don't think it was sold there."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SMITH</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). It was a very old-fashioned chain, I should think sixty or seventy years old, with large gold links; what would be called a cable chain—I had had it ten or twelve years—there was another man in the urinal, but this was the only one that attacked me, the other seemed to go away at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am innocent of the charge. I saw the man that had the chain in a public-house, shortly after it was stolen, and I gave a description of him. Mrs. Perry, the landlady of the public-house, could prove that I was in her place at 9 o'clock, and never moved out. I had a very bad cold, and had a mustard plaster on.</p>

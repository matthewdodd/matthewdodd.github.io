I am the wife of Samuel Charles Waller, who keeps the Dover Castle—I saw the prisoner there on the evening in question—I cleared the till the first time that evening between eight and nine—that was after the prisoner left—my daughter had been assisting in serving some time before that—on clearing it I found only one florin, which I put in my pocket—the prisoner had gone out, but she came back afterwards with another woman, and I served her with a quartern of gin, which came to fivepence—she gave me a florin, which I put in the till—there was no other florin there—I gave her the change, and she left—I served in the bar with my husband till eleven o'clock, when we closed—I took no other florin</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186611190121"></xptr>
               <p>that evening—my husband was serving a lad with some porter, he tendered the florin in change for a half-crown, and it was found to be bad—I then looked at the one in my pocket, and found that also bad—I gave it to my husband.</p>

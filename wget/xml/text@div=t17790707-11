Not being able to do my business, I told him he should stay only till he got another place. He got a place, which he was to go to on Monday. He went away from me. On the Saturday night after he was gone, counting up the plate, I missed the spoons mentioned in the indictment. In consequence of an advirtisement I found them at a pawnbroker's near St. Giles's.</p>

I asked him if they were both marked alike; he said they were; I looked and found they were not. I stopped him, and advertised the spoons on the next Tuesday.</p>
               <p>(The spoons were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

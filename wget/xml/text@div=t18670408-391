I am a watchman at 113, London Wall, and am an old soldier—I received my pension at Tower Hill on 4th March—I was with Summers at the Czar's Head—we were both sober and went there together—the prisoner came in while we were there, and had a pot or two given him by Summers and me—when we went out he and his companion followed us, and I saw the prisoner knock Summers down on the pavement—I went to pick him up, and saw the prisoner put his hand in Summers's pocket and bring it out clenched—after that the prisoner told me that I had robbed Summers—that was when Summers was on the ground—I, told him I had not, but that I thought he had—he then put his hand into my pocket and got hold of my purse, but I wrenched it from him, and he forced me against some iron railings—I assisted Summers up; he was not sensible—I saw the prisoner brought back ten minutes afterwards in custody—I saw no fighting before Summers was knocked down.</p>

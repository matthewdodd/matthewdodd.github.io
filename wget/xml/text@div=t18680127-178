                  </hi>. I am master of the schooner <hi rend="italic">Wave</hi>, of Guernsey, now lying at Gravesend—on 3rd November last I was with my schooner at Fayal, one of the Azores, belonging to the kingdom of Portugal—Mr. Dart is the British Vice-Consul there—I received the prisoner from him to bring to this country, and give him in charge to a police officer here—I brought him here, and handed him over to a police officer—we arrived here on 28th November—the ship <hi rend="italic">Fredonia</hi> was not at Fayal when I left; she had sailed before I arrived there—on the voyage home I had some conversation with the prisoner about what had taken place on board the <hi rend="italic">Fredonia</hi>—he told me that the deceased had been on shore that day, and came on board in the evening the worse for liquor, and said a few words</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186801270031"></xptr>
               <p>to him; that he (prisoner) told him he thought he was very drunk; that they had a quarrel, and the deceased drew a knife at him; that he told him he wished he would leave him alone; after that they went to bed, that about ten o'clock they had another quarrel; that the deceased got him in the corner of the forecastle, and made two or three attempts to stab him; that he <hi rend="italic">fended</hi> the knife off two or three times with his hand, and he drew his own knife and stabbed the deceased, who fell on the side of his berth, went on deck, fell down, and died—he told me this, not all at once, a little at one time and a little at another—he said the <hi rend="italic">Fredonia</hi> was bound from Fayal to Boston—he mentioned this to me two or three times; it was always the same account—he said that he had no intention to do him any harm whatever, but he found he was obliged to in order to save his own life—I have been back to Fayal again since this—I was there at Christmas, and left; on 6th January—the <hi rend="italic">Fredonia</hi> was not there then, and they had not heard of her arrival at Boston—I brought over some papers, which I transmitted to the Board of Trade; they were given to me by Mr. Dart, the Vice-Consul, at the same time that I received the prisoner.</p>

In substance they were to the same effect as the statement made by the prisoner to Mr. Leprelli, with the addition of threats made use of by the deceased, and the statement of the mate and seamen that the prisoner always appeared to be of a good and quiet disposition, and was liked by all the ship's company</hi>.</p>

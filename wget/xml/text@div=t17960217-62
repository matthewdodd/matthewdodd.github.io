The two small keys belong to two boxes of mine; and the other two are old keys belonging to a house that I have lett, lately, in Marybone parish: as to stealing the apron, I never was in that person's room in my life; I went to enquire for a person of the name of Bowland.</p>
               <p>Singleton. He told me he had taken nothing but this apron; that he lived in the Borough, and I found afterwards, that he lodged in Mary-le-bonne.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did at that time; for I had lett my house at Mary-le-bonne, before I went into business; I was a gentleman's coachman, and was endeavouring to get into the same situation again; and I had the promise of one from a gentleman that I did live with; I have lived with Mr. Cade, in Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury; I lived with Sir Henry Cheare, seven years; and with a gentleman at Kentish Town five years; my witnesses have been attending here three days, but are not here now.</p>

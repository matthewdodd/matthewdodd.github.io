There were deducted back about 40 shillings for paying the whole; they had not money to pay Mr. Crepany's Clerk, so he sent it to me to take the money of me; I believe they gave me about a guinea for my trouble and expences in writing of letters, and paying postage. Murphy at that time desired Daunt would give him something for his trouble in shewing him the way to Doctors Commons, so Daunt gave him half a guinea, Murphy grumbled and said it was too little ; then they went away. I seen Wilkinson since, he is living. After I found it was a forgery, I made enquiry after was person called Daunt, and Murphy, and at last got of Murphy, so I got a warrant and constable, and took him at Newington in Surrey After which he made his escape from the constable but we soon retook him When I told him what he was for he said he threw himself as any feer and hop'd I would not take away his line; he had but little to say for himself. He was committed upon this, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175301110034"></xptr> last sessions he preferred a bill of indictment against me for this very crime he now stands charg'd with, and got it found by the grand-jury.</p>

I was informed the man who went by the name of Daunt was in goal in Ireland, so I went there to him, his right name is Williams.

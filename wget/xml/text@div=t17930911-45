I had sent the prisoner up to bed before I went with my maid and myself; the prisoner was a boy for fetching in pots, and drawing beer; I sent him to bed about a quarter after ten; I went afterwards down in my cellar to look at my cellar, and I heard somebody walk over the tap room, the maid was with me in the cellar, and she said she believed it was the boy come down, and gone into the bar; I came up immediately into the tap room, I was in the dark, I had no candle; I met the boy coming out of the bar, he had no light, and I had not the candle with me, my maid had the candle, we had no light till I called her up with the candle, my maid came up immediately. I asked him then what he came doing in my bar? he said he had not been in. I asked him what was his business down stairs? he said somebody had knocked at the door; I told him that was no reason that he should come down, because he knew both the maid and I were up; I had not the courage to search him; my husband<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110064"></xptr>turned him out of doors when I told him, and he searched his clothes after he was gone; he turned him out the next morning about six o'clock, before I was up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were his clothes? - In the room where he slept; I brought the coat down, and I found it very heavy, and I opened it before my maid servant, and my husband; I found in it about four shillings and three halfpence, in halfpence and farthings, and one shilling and sixpence in silver, I think it was eighty four halfpence and twenty-five farthings, as near as I can guess, they were all together in his coat pocket; for about two days we could not tell where to find him; I cannot swear to the money, but there is one piece my maid can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that you lost any money? - My drawer was shut when I went down into the cellar, and when I came back the drawer was half open.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear there was any money missing? - I cannot swear that, because I don't know what was in it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the boy below stairs after he was sent up to bed? - Yes, I went down stairs along with my mistress to see that every thing was fast, and while I was down stairs along with my mistress, I heard somebody go across the tap room into the bar, my mistress says, what are you listening at? I said I hear somebody up stairs, and we both went up directly and catched him coming out of the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the drawer open? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was shut before he went to bed? - That I cannot tell; my mistress says to him, what is the reason you came down stairs after I sent you up to bed, and to come into my bar? he said he had not been in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been in the bar? - He was coming out of the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his clothes examined the next day? - I did, and there were eighty-five halfpence, and twenty-five farthings, and one shilling and six-pence in silver found in his clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the coat to be his? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him wear it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of that money to belong to your master and mistress? - Yes, one piece, a copper piece; the constable has the money; he is here.</p>

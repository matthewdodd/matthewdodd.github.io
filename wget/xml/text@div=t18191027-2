She had given me no notice - and at five we missed the articles stated in the indictment. We had a very good character with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house were the things in - A. The plate and table-cloth were in the kitchen; the scarf, shawl, and watches were in the bed-room. I saw all the plate safe at one o'clock, at dinner. I saw the watches safe within a day or two, and the shawl on Saturday, the 25th. On the Friday following I saw the prisoner at the Rainbow, public-house, at the top of our street. She surrendered herself to a constable there.</p>

            . I live in Feathers-court, Gray's Inn-lane. My husband is a brass-founder. I have known the prisoner about four years - she lived three months at the corner of our court, and used to see men. On the 28th of September, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, she came to my house, and asked me if I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270004"></xptr>pawn a table-cloth for her? She produced it to me, and I pledged it at Beauchamp's, at Holborn Bars, for 2 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she produce any thing else - A. Yes, a shawl and scarf, which I pledged for her. She said she had some plate which she wished to sell out and out.</p>
               <p>Q. As you knew her before, did you ask her how she got them - A. I asked her if they were own? she said they were her husband's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pawn the things all at one place - A No, my Lord; I pawned the shawl for 5 s., and scarf for 8 s., the next day at Lee and Morritt's. I gave her the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she show you the plate - A. No, my Lord; I saw a pepper-box in her hand on the 28th - she slept at my house that night. She was out all the next day. I went out with her to buy a box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to a public-house with her - A. Yes, on the Tuesday evening, about seven o'clock, we went to a young man there, she asked him if he would buy a watch? he said he had no money to buy it. Another man, who sat there, got up, touched her on the shoulder, and she went out with him - she returned in about a minute, and called me out. I and the young man who I was talking to, went with her and the other man to Walton's-court, she then gave a small bundle of things to the other man, he went away with it, returned in about a quarter of an hour, and called her aside - she told him to go back, and take it. What he said to her I do not know. He went, and returned in about five minutes, and gave her some silver - I heard it rattle. We went and had something to drink at another public-house, she paid for it, and we all parted. She went back to my house, and slept there.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the man here - A. No, nor the man whom I knew. I do not know where he lives, his name is

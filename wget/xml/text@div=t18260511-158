I was employed by the Mint to detect utterers of counterfeit coin. I procured an introduction to the prisoner in April last, at Three Tuns-court, Wapping - I mentioned it to my brother James,

            , and some others; I met the prisoner, by appointment, on the 11th of April - I had received from Mitchell, some money, in the presence of my brother James - some of it was shillings, and one of them in particular was marked; I had no other money. The prisoner was to bring some counterfeit money - he brought a sovereign, and said the person had no other coin ready - he asked 7s. for it, which I paid him. Mitchell was waiting with my brother at a distance; I told them what I had done, and they took the prisoner, and found the marked shilling on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you give me a shilling going along, after you paid for the sovereign? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER MITCHELL. I am a surveyor of the Thames Police. On the 8th of April I saw Thomas Fogg at the Black Boy public-house, Wapping - Green was then present. I searched Fogg, and took his money from him; I gave him 7s. 6d., which was not marked. I saw him again on the 11th of April, in company with Green - I then searched Fogg, and gave him 6s. 6d., and one of the shillings I marked with my pen-knife - I followed them to the court, and saw them go into the house - they came out in company with the prisoner, and went to <placeName id="t18260511-158-crimeloc907">Whiterow, Spitalfields</placeName>

I searched Fogg, and found on him a counterfeit sovereign, which he said he had from the prisoner; James Fogg then searched the prisoner, and found on him the shilling which I had marked and given to Fogg.</p>

            . I went with Thomas Fogg, and asked the prisoner if he could let him have any counterfeit coin- I did not hear what he said, as he spoke low; we then went to White-row, and the prisoner asked for the money to get some counterfeit half-crowns - he came back, and said he could not get any, but could get a sovereign; Fogg then gave him 7s. for a sovereign - he went away, and returned in about half an hour, with the sovereign, which he gave to Fogg; I went up, and said,"Have you got it?" he said Yes.</p>

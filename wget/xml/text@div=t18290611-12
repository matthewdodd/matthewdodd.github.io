On the 27th of May the prisoner came to my house, and lodged there two nights; he left on the Thursday morning, and then owed me 5s. 10 1/2d. for what he had to eat and drink, besides the two night's lodging; I went after him, and found him in Windmill-street: I told him I came for the small bill he owed me - I asked him to go into a public-house; he at first objected, but did go in - I had missed a silk handkerchief from my bar the night before, and when I got him into the public-house he took it out of his pocket, and offered it to the landlady in pawn for a debt he had contracted there; I said it was mine- he denied it, and said he had bought a piece of them in Guernsey; there is no mark on it, but I have more of the same pattern - I do not think it is a very common pattern.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) Having arrived at Southend from a voyage, on my way to town, I accidentally met with a young person, who stated himself to be a baker, and perceiving from his dialect that he was a countryman of my own, I was glad to embrace his services; he then introduced me to the prosecutor, Drysdale, who keeps the Caledonian Inn, Beer-yard, Drury-lane: I agreed to take my refreshment at a certain sum, and to take the same in the bar, with himself and family, during my stay; in the course of the day, Drysdale induced me to play with him at bagatelle; I was surprised at his having a board, and made some remark upon the subject, to which he replied he did not care for any person, as his spirit merchant was a Magistrate, and knew that the board was in his house, but that he had raised fifty pounds and purchased spirits of him, since which time he never took any notice of any thing that was done in his house, whether card playing, of which a great deal took place during the time I was there, and that since he had him on his side, being his licensing Magistrate, he did not care for all the others. In the evening he asked me for 6s. 9d., which he stated I owed him - being rather fresh, I said I would call by and by and settle with him, as I had not so much about me, but was going to see a friend, and I should call and pay him; on the next morning imagining he had not acted altogether fairly towards me, I was determined I would not pay him, as I did not consider I owned him any thing, and two days after I left his house, and where I had removed to he knew from the young man who had taken me to his house, having myself told him; he, finding all claims fruitless, and considering I might mention his allowing gambling in his house, took the advantage of seeing my handkerchief in my hand - he said it was his, and immediately looked at the corners to see if there was any mark, and which handkerchief I assure you, I purchased in Guernsey, together with six others which all being separate patterns, made the piece of seven - if the prosecutor knew the handkerchief to be his, what necessity was there for him to examine the corners for a mark? upon his first examination he said he could not swear to it, but upon the second examination, he then found as by a miracle, he could swear to it. Had I stolen his handkerchief I should not have taken it out openly to his face before him, but have disposed of it.</p>

The information was here read—it stated, that John Gosden, of Wilstead-street, Somer's-town, on the 29th of December, being then and there a seller of beer, ale, and porter, by retail, and having a license under the provisions of an Act passed in the first year of William IV did knowingly permit and suffer gaming with cards in his house, contrary to the provisions of the said license.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you from the parlour see into all parts of the tap-room, so as to see if people are at cards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I know very well a party at cards could not be made up without being seen—I should think so—it is impos<lb></lb>sible to see through a brick wall—there is not room for three or four per<lb></lb>sons to play and not be seen, for the door is so wide, and it was open all the time—it is impossible that four persons could be playing at cards without my seeing them—one person might hide himself if he chose, but I do not think he could come in without my seeing him—they go through the tap-room into the parlour, and through the passage into the tap-room—the de<lb></lb>fendant could not come in without my seeing him—if that model was cor<lb></lb>rect, I could convince you, but it is not at all like it—I should not like to swear that in the parlour I was sure to see every body who comes into the tap-room, but I believe it to be impossible—it is quite impossible for four persons to play without being seen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a turncock to the New-River Company, and live at No, 3, Brill-place, Somer's-town. I was at Gosden's beer-shop on Monday, the 29th of December—I went there at six o'clock in the evening, and staid until eight o'clock—I sat close against the bar in the tap-room—I could see into the parlour from where I sat—I could see if any body came into the house—I never saw the defendant come there between six and eight o'clock—there was no card-playing at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 43, Johnson-street, Somer's-town; I am one of the Criers of this Court, and have been so nearly twelve years. I have known Gosden for years—I was at his beer-shop, in Wilstead-street, on the 29th of December, on private business of my own—I went there at one o'clock, and staid until nine at night—I sat in the parlour—I was there from one o'clock till nine without leaving the house—I occasionally went to speak to him at the bar—he was sitting with me the principal part of the time, there being nobody else in the room for at least four or five hours, I can be certain—I never saw the defendant till he was brought up here to traverse—I was at Hatton-garden, but my attention was not called to him—I could overlook the tap-room from where I was sitting in the parlour—I am confident that four persons could not be playing cards with<lb></lb>out my seeing them—there was no card-playing there at all, either in the parlour or tap-room—the bar is not large enough for it—I should think business was very slack that night—there were not above six or seven per<lb></lb>sons there—I cannot say how soon after this I was called on to recollect what passed, but I remember it perfectly well, by Gosden having to attend a summons at Hatton-garden next day—he asked me, as an old friend, to go with him—I said I could not be of any service, and did not go—I am quite confident there was no card-playing that evening—I would not have stop<lb></lb>ped there a moment if there had been.</p>

                  </hi> I am a linen-draper, at North-place, Kingsland-road. Lacock came into my service on 15th or 16th Sept., and left on the 7th Nov.—on that day, Sunday, a little after eleven o'clock in the morning, she went out to Church and took my son, who is nine years old, with her—while she was gone I went into the kitchen where she slept, and found a bandbox which was hers, partly open—I saw several lengths of ribbon and two pairs of stockings in it, which I believe to be mine, and in another bandbox two pairs of stockings, a flannel petticoat, and a skirt, my property—they were new and had been in the shop—I found in a drawer in the kitchen, which was not locked, a black corded skirt which had my private mark on it, and two pairs of stockings—there was no one in the house but my wife and children—I had no apprentice, and no other servant or shopman—I went to the station</p>

               <p>and got a policeman—after dinner I called Lacock, and charged her with robbing me—she denied it—I gave her in charge—she said she was innocent, or something to that effect—I took her to the kitchen, where the bandboxes were, and found three boxes locked—I asked if they were hers, she said, "Yes"—she gave the key to the policeman, he opened them, and found all this property—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here are twenty-five pairs of stocking, two parasols, two dozen gloves, eight or nine black lace falls, sixty or seventy yards of lace, and other articles—they are my property—she said the lace was hers, but she knew nothing of the other things—they are worth 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she was taken to the station—next day I went to Walsby's house in Seaton-street Commercial-road—I knew her by her coming to see her daughter-in-law—I saw her—the officer told her in my presence that her daughter was taken up for robbing her employers—she said, "I know the gentleman very well"—the officer asked her if she had got anything belonging to Marianne Lacock—she said she had not—he said, "Is this your apartment?"—she said, "Yes," and she had no objection for him to search—he commenced searching—she took the things out of her boxes herself—nothing was found—the policeman then turned over her boxes, and found a parasol, two pairs of socks, a pair of stockings, a Victorine, and some Coburg cloth—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are mine—she said they were given her by Lacock, except the cloth, and that she bought the socks in the Commercial-road—she was taken to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On Sunday afternoon, 7th Nov., I went to Mr. Slater's—Lacock was called up, Mr. Slater told her he suspected she was robbing him—she said, "No, sir, I am not doing that"—he said, "This is an officer," and asked her for her keys—they were given me—I searched her boxes, and found the property—I afterwards went with Mr. Slater to Walsby's house, and told her what I took her for, she positively denied it—I said, "Have you any little present which has been brought here, or anything you have fetched away; recollect yourself, you are in custody, to save your-self all trouble you had better give up any little things you have?"—=she distinctly said, "I have nothing"—I said, "If you are an honest woman you will have no objection to my searching"—she turned over three boxes—that did not satisfy me—I turned them over and found some cloth, which Mr. Slater said was part of his property—she said, "I believe I did have that of Marianne"—I asked her for her duplicates—she produced some—I selected some which I thought connected with the case, went to the pawn-broker's, and found property with the private mark on it—she afterwards said, "Well, I did fetch several parcels for Marianne, but I am sure I do not know what they contained."</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mr. Thomas, Red Lion, Commerce<lb></lb>cial Hotel.

I meet them. Call on you to<lb></lb>morrow on my way to Man<lb></lb>chester, with cash. Reply paid. Say what train they leave." In con<lb></lb>sequence of that I sent two sealskin jackets to Euston station by train—I paid the cheque into my bank, but it was returned, marked "No account"—I have never been paid for any of the jackets—I saw them at Hammer<lb></lb>smith—the marks are taken off, but I believe them to be mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier at the London and Westminster Bank, Lothbury—Shuttleworth became a customer in October, 1876—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the pass-book we gave him—there was a balance in his favour on 13th February of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 18th March he had over<lb></lb>drawn to the amount of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—between these dates he had not paid in anything, but about 25 cheques had been presented and returned dis<lb></lb>honoured—when we had dishonoured about a dozen this letter was written</p>

               <p>under my direction: "10th March, 1877. Sir,—I beg to inform you that your account is overdrawn to the amount of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Please to give it your early attention." I afterwards called on him at, I think, 51, Bishopsgate Street—there was an elderly man in an office upstairs on the first floor—there were some engineer's tools and books there—I did not see Horn there—I went there, I should think, about a dozen times—I wanted to see Shuttle worth respecting the overdraft—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a debit note for 100 cheques supplied to Shuttleworth on 18th September, 1876—the numbers are from 985601 to 985700—this cheque marked A is signed in Shuttleworth's writing—I should say the body is his—I have no doubt whatever of the signature—here are three in the same name—we have never had a customer named Louis Miller—I have no opinion about the writing of the cheques in that name, but they came from the same cheque<lb></lb>book—after the entries by our clerk in the pass-book here are some entries by another person whose writing I do not know, three debits and one credit—it has never been balanced since 13th February—the account was then closed and the amount written off as a bad debt.</p>

On 15th December I received the prisoners from the Nottingham police, they had been detained on a telegram—I told Horn that he had passed a cheque to Mr. Athawes, and mentioned the account—he said "That is correct"—I mentioned another on Mr. Gray—he said "That is correct"—I made this note at the time—I told him of the case of Mr. Moss—he said "That is correct, I shall make a clean breast of it, I have been led into this; I received two cheques from Leo, and one from Shuttleworth, they led me into it; I did not know they had no effects at the bank"—I mentioned the cheques received in the Bank of Birmingham, and the Bank of Nottingham, on the London and North-Western—I told him he had been seen in Shuttleworth's company on the morning after he had been at Mr. Moss's, he said "Shuttleworth had the money, he put me into that; the goods I received at Birmingham I sent up to Leo, and he received them at Euston station; I should like to make a written statement"—he wrote this statement at Hammersmith: "I hereby swear that I have only known Herman Martin Leo ten weeks, and that I have at no time written a cheque; but he has done all, purchasing them from a person known as Shuttleworth, and that a police summons has been heard to<lb></lb>day, Saturday, at" Worship Street police-court, for one on his own bank for which he received the cash. I can also swear he gave Shuttleworth several sums of money which he received, that he has sworn to me more than once, and in one instance I saw money passed for this purpose, and that he used fictitious names to induce me to cash them, saying they was all right, and in these instances implicated me when I had no guilty knowledge for the time being, but since come to my knowledge.

I should like to see him"—he took me round to several public-houses, and afterwards to Hackney, on the pretence of finding Horn, but never found him—Shuttleworth walked away from Gudgeon, but he joined us afterwards—he left us when we went to Hackney—I watched the offices at Ludgate Hill from 23rd November to llth December—Shuttleworth's name was on the door and downstairs, and "Gudgeon, Private" on the opposite door—I could not get in—there was a card on the door marked "Return in half an hour"—I marked it and it was not moved—the old man fetched the letters every morning—I followed him on several occasions, and found that he did not go always to the same place—it was apparently arranged the previous night where they should meet—once while I was watching, some washing machines came there—there was nobody in the office, and they were taken away—I did not follow them—I saw it was a Great Western van—on December let I followed Gudgeon and Shuttleworth from Finsbury Street to the Smithfield goods station—I saw Field come out of the goods station, and they went with Field and the old man, who fetched the letters into a public house—I afterwards saw the van come up the incline with the machines on it, and followed it to Mr. Comfort's—Gudgeon and the old man also followed it, and afterwards I went to Mr. Comfort's and found them there—I found Shuttleworth in custody on 18th December in a beershop in Little Moorfields—I asked him if he would take a walk with me to see a friend, and I took him towards Falcon Square, where I met my inspector, who read the warrant to him—he said that he knew nothing about it—I mentioned a cheque uttered by Horn and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness for Horn</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">CORNELIUS HORN</hi>. I am a straw plait dealer at Dunstable, and am the father of the prisoner Horn—he had had two or three different commer<lb></lb>cial situations in London and went into business for himself once and failed—I became acquainted with Leo as near as I remember last October in London, in my son's company—Leo afterwards came down to me at Hemel Hempstead to buy plaits—he left me an order to send him some—in consequence of what I heard I did not execute the order—I have never heard anything against my son up to this time.</p>

               <p>it—I never heard that he obtained 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of cigars by false pretences—I do not know Baxter, a companion of his—my son lives in London and I at Dunstable—he is under my observation a great deal.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. He left me seven or eight years ago to go into a situa<lb></lb>tion in London; it was not 17 or 18 years ago.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Horn received a good character, Shuttleworth also received a good character, and his witnesses said that he had been engaged in bond fide business</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gudgeon in his defence stated that he had acted throughout as Shuttleworth's clerk, and two of the witnesses had stated that he informed them that that was his position; that he left Shuttleworth's employ on December</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st, a week after the washing machines were sent up on 30 days* credit; that he then entered the employment of Gordon, Neville, and Co. as manager and foreign corre<lb></lb>spondent at</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a year, and was arrested at their office; that the firm of Gudgeon Brothers had never failed, only Oswald Gudgeon; that the purses were ordered not by him, but by Shuttleworth and Co., and were sent to their office; that the goods being pledged in his name was no proof that he pledged them, as any name could be used; that he was first introduced to Leo in</hi> 1872 <hi rend="italic">by his partner Born, and that Leo wished to be employed as his</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Gudgeon's</hi>) <hi rend="italic">traveller to get orders for wine, and that he had lent his cheque-book to Leo; that he had never had any transactions with Horn, and had only spoken to him two or three times in his life; that although he had been bankrupt his creditors accepted</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in the pound and gave him three years to pay it in, and signed a deed to that effect; and that he had always traded in his own name, and had done a very large business with merchants, shipowners, and colliery owners all over Europe and in many other parts, and had bought his own ships and purchased a colliery for</hi> 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">that one of his agents was a nephew of Messrs.

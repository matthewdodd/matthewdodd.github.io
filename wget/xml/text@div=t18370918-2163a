On the 22nd of August I lived with Mrs. Glenister, at Lambeth—Mrs. Collins fetched me out of Mrs. Glenister's room into hers, which was the next door—I took out my money to send for something to drink, and gave Kirtland half-a-crown to get some gin and beer—I had one sovereign and six half-crowns in my purse then Mrs. Collins once or twice felt my pocket, but she did not take the money out herself I heard Eliza Glenister say she would not have it, but I heard no further—James Collins and Kirtland took me into the adjoining room, where Kirtland's wife laid asleep; and Kirtland held me by the arm, while Mr. Collins put his hand into my pocket, and took out 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15s—Mrs. Collins was not in the room at the time, she was in the other room, holding Mrs. Glenister down there to prevent her coming to help me.</p>

On the 14th of May, between twelve and one o'clock at night, Caldwell called me up. I went into his room, and found Limerick Leonard's chest broken open. He lodged in another room, and was ill a-bed at the time. I had seen the chest locked three hours before; the staple was drawn; the articles stated in the indictment were taken out of the box, and laid under the bed. Leonard died about five or six days after. I know the property was his. I found the prisoner under the sofa; when he saw us, he ran down into the yard. I followed; he said he would be my butcher, if I touched him. I secured him, and charged him with the robbery. He said nothing. He had no business in that room. He was rather drunk.</p>

            . I lodge in the same house; I was awoke, between twelve and one o'clock, by hearing the prisoner in my room, who was then feeling about my bed. I asked who was there? He said it was Jack, and that he was going to bed. He slept up stairs. He went out; I told him to shut the door, which he did. In about a quarter of an hour, I heard my door open again, and somebody bustling about the floor at the foot of my bed. I got up, and called for a light; the prisoner jumped up, and told me to say nothing. He got under the sofa; but afterwards ran down stairs. Cox followed him. Leonard's trunk was in my room; I saw it safe six hours before. When the prisoner was taken, I found the staple drawn, and the things taken out, and put under my bed. The prisoner was drunk.</p>

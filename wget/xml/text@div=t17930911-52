               <p>Q.

I told him that I certainly would, if it was accepted by a reputable man, give him the exchange, deducting my account.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come to you afterwards with the bill? - The next evening, after the candles were light, the 29th of February; I then looked at the bill, and asked him respecting

               <p>Q. Did he represent him as living in a large house of his own? - I don't remember he gave any other description.

I asked him why it was on the back? because I never saw an acceptance in a place where I thought an indorsement ought to be; he then said he made the same objection to Mr. King when he received it of him; he represented that Mr. King damned him, and asked him what the devil of an acceptance he wished to have?</p>
               <p>Q. On that did you advance him any money? - Yes, I did, ten pounds, he represented that he had been distressed; I did not advance more, because I had made no enquiry after Mr. King; I took a receipt for the ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that receipt. - This is the receipt written by myself, and signed by Reading.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know where he lodged? - He lodged at one place in Duke-street, Manchester-square, he told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the lodging? - Never, he told me so when he gave me the bill.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. How long was it after this happened? - On Friday the 2d of March.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the bill after you received it? - As soon as I received it I went to my friend Mr. Brownlow, of Fleet-street, and told him that I had taken a bill on

               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of any information coming from any quarter make any enquiry after Reading? - I did, and found he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where? - At Duke-street, Manchester square, finding him and his wife had both absconded themselves, from thence, I conceived it to be a notorious transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cause any other enquiries to be made in the public papers, and advertisements? - Yes, I did, I went to the chamberlain of the City; I advertised his person, and description, and there is a copy of advertisement.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not he say he wanted some goods the day he came to you? - Not that I can recollect, he came only mentioning what he owed me before.</p>
               <p>Court. How much did he owe you before? - About nine pounds, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. When he came he told you where he lived himself, and where King lived? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. The receipt was read over to him when it was written? - It was.</p>

               <p>Q. He made no hesitation of signing the receipt? - No.</p>

               <p>In February, 1792, I was shopman to Dalby and Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when the prisoner at the bar came? - I cannot exactly say the day, it was the evening, the first time he came.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what application he made that evening to Mr. Dalby? - It was about a bill that he obtained of a person that owed him some money in Yorkshire; the prisoner said that he had just come out of the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce that bill? - He did not the first evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe it? - He said the amount of it was eighty pounds, he said it was drawn on King, I am sure he said King.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he represent to you who King was, or where he lived? - He said he lived in Berkeley-street, a man of opulence; he represented that the second evening, not the first.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect after his coming the first evening, what application he made, with respect to that bill? - He wished to have it discounted, Mr. Dalby said if he would bring the bill for him to examined, he would have no objection to discount it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Dalby to make any deduction out of it? - Yes, he was to pay Mr. Dalby what he owed him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come again? - He came the next night.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first day he came? - I think it was the 28th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it? - That I cannot say exactly, he came the next night and brought the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Dalby discount it? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason he did not? - He wished to make some enquiries, I heard him say so, he advanced the sum of ten pounds on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing the second night about the accepter? - Mr. Dalby objected to the mode of acceptance, because it was accepted on the back of the bill, Mr. Reading said that he made the same objections to this King, and he said that King swore at him and asked him what he would have?</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Dalby advanced him the ten pounds on the bill what became of the bill? - He took the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Reading give any acknowldgment for the ten pounds? - Yes, a receipt was given.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him describe who Mr. King was that night? - He represented him to be a man of opulence; I think he said, he was one that kept his carriage, and that a footman came to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe the house? - I think he said something about a large white house, I don't recollect he said any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110077"></xptr>thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether he stated him to be the only person that lived in the house? - I cannot speak to that, I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have lived in the service of Messrs. Dalby and Brown some time? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You of course know the firm of the house; do you recollect what the firm of the house was in February, 1792? -

               <p>Q. Had he been accustomed to deal with Messrs. Brown and Dalby? - I recollect him buying one parcel of goods, and they were not paid for.</p>
               <p>Q. From his having been there several times, and dealing there once, I presume there was a considerable confidence placed in the prisoner at the bar? - I don't know that there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Dunbar, the way in which the prisoner at the bar came was in your hearing the first night, I suppose there were several present in the shop at the time, who must have heard all the conversation that passed between the prisoner and Mr. Dalby? - I cannot speak to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the prisoner talked in such away as to prevent any one else from hearing what he said? - He was in the parlour with Mr. Dalby.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not whisper, or else you would not have heard him? he said he had got such a bill, and he wanted somebody to discount it? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And he said he would bring the bill the next night, provided Mr. Dalby would do so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he came the next night? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He always spoke of a Mr. King, living in Berkeley-street he spoke of that himself? - He did, of Squire King.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear say where the bill was drawn from? - I think it was from Bristol, and the drawer was named White.</p>
               <p>Q. And that appears on the face of the bill to be truth? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bill now, and see whether it appears so? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. It does appear to be a genuine true bill, both as to the bill being drawn itself, and as to the acceptance? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that during all the conversation you heard that he ever hesitated giving any account of this bill or of the acceptance? - I don't know that Mr. Dalby asked him any particular questions any further about this King.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether he did not give answers without hesitating in the least to the questions that were put to him? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. The second time he came he trusted the bill with Mr. Dalby? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He got a receipt for it? - He got a receipt for the ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not write the body of the receipt himself? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it read to him? - I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. So when the receipt was tendered to him having been made out by Mr. Dalby himself he made no scruple of putting his name to it, and left the bill with Mr. Dalby? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, how soon did you hear of the prisoner at the bar afterwards? - About a twelve month.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you heard that this unfortunate man has been in the King's Bench prison? - I have heard that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard that very soon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110078"></xptr>after this matter took place, he went down to Bristol? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard that he was arrested at Bristol? - I have.</p>

               <p>Q. This man had not quite lived with you three months; did you agree with him weekly or monthly? - He was to pay me weekly.</p>


               <p>Q. Had he paid you for the lodgings? - He had not.</p>
               <p>Q. So that induced you to make that enquiry; you have had lodgers before, you have known them go away and come back again? - Yes, but they always settled with me.</p>
               <p>Q. This man did not, and therefore you come and state what you have stated. With respect to Mr. King, did you try one side of the way? - Yes, of upper and lower Berkeley-street, both of the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not another Berkeley-street in Portman-square? - I enquired on one side of the way down both the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiry on the other side? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bailey. For what reasons did you make these enquiries after Mr. King? - Because the prisoner had told me that he had business to do with a gentleman in the city concerning a note, and if that note had been properly honoured, and he had got cash, I was to have been paid the demand I had got on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he represent to you what that note was? - No, but his wife did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to enquire in Berkeley-street? Was it from any thing that passed between you and the prisoner? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then the prisoner at the bar told you there was some money to be had of a gentleman in the city, and you was to be paid your demand when he got the cash?</p>

On the 23d or 24th of February, a bill came for acceptance to a Mr. King, in Upper Berkeley-street, I was dressing his hair; I knew a Mr. King, in Upper Berkeley-street, Portman-square, just by New Quebeck-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember while you was dressing him on the 23d or 24th of February, any thing particular that happened, that you took notice of that morning? - A person brought up a bill for acceptance, the word of the man servant was, that he brought up a note up stairs, which he said was for acceptance, and he said the person was waiting below; Mr. King asked his servant to hand him the pen and ink off the pembroke table that stood between the windows; this was as I was dressing him, he did hand him the pen and ink, he wrote, but I cannot say what, I did not see what he wrote.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had wrote this what became of the bill or note then? - He gave it to the servant again, I still continued dressing the gentleman's hair, in a minute or two afterwards the servant came up again with the bill, saying that the person was not satisfied perfectly with the acceptance, he ordered the gentleman up, the person that was shewn up was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110086"></xptr>the prisoner at the bar, when he came up Mr. King asked him what reason he had to object to that acceptance, he said he did not doubt either his honour or his principle, but it was a mode of acceptance he never saw, on that he said, that was the mode he always accepted his bills, and when they came to him, he duly honoured them when due. He said, A. stood for acceptance, and King was his name; he should do no other to it. In the course of a day or two he asked me to get a private lodging, on which I introduced myself, as letting out lodgings; I lived in Prince's-street, Soho.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he went to your house, after you told him you could accommodate him? - Two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you dressed him in Berkeley-street? - Six or seven days, but not more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bill or note? - I cannot pretend to say nothing at all about it for what sum it was drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Mr. King stop in your lodgings? - Eleven days.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left your lodgings do you know what became of him? - I cannot tell no more than what he said himself, he said that he was going abroad to the West Indies.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round again to the prisoner at the bar, and see if you are certain that he is the man that came to Mr. King's house? - I am sure that he is the man; I have been to Newgate on Saturday to satisfy myself about the identity of his person, I went for that purpose, and for that alone, the remark I made of him was, that he had a particular scar on his right eye, and that I thought he was an Irishman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bailey. How long have been in business? - Eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in business now? - I am.</p>

               <p>Q. Never took a thought how often you had been with bailiffs, but you have with the note? - The dispute that arose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110088"></xptr>between Mr. King and Mr. Reading made me remember that.</p>

He lodged at my mother's a few weeks; he wanted a situation, and I think he got one; that is four years ago. He has called since; the last time he called he said he was married, and had married a person of some property; I think it is two years next February the last time I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time in February? - I do not. I went to his house and dined with him, it was in Bolsover-street, Cavendish-square, he had a house in there, I was at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade did he carry on? - He told me that he was going to deal in hops and different things, that he had a great many friends that would assist him, and that he was going into business for himself.</p>


               <p>Q. Was it a pretty good house? - I believe it was a small house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his being acquainted with any body else in your street? - I never heard him speak of any, nor I don't know that he knew any except me and my mother, and my father when he was alive. A person came in the name of Nugent, much about this time two years, it was the latter part of the summer, an elderly gentleman came by the name of Nugent, he wanted lodgings; we let him the lodgings; he refused to give his character he said, when my mother asked him for his character, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110089"></xptr>said, why should we suspect him, he said, I don't like to be troublesome to my friends; I will pay you every week. He came in on that account, because he was to pay every week for his lodgings, we agreed; he said he should order every thing in; but when he had been there about a fortnight, and we had lost just before that a piece of cloth, I found a duplicate, a pawnbroker's ticket, in the house, in his apartment, and I was curious enough to go to the pawnbroker to know what it was about; the pawnbroker asked me if I had found it? I told him I had found it in my house; the pawnbroker said he had orders to stop it; I told him he might stop it if he pleased; I asked him what it was upon? he said it was a man's coat; I asked him the person; he described him exactly, and there was on the duplicate, 
               <persName id="t17930911-52-person648">
                  John

            , Mary-le-bone-street; he described the person, so I have every reason to believe it was the gentleman that had taken the apartment, and pawned the coat; and there were a great many people came after him, and enquired for bills and debts, and many things; so that we had every reason to believe that he was not as good as he should be. So I think this gentleman went by the name of Nugent and King.</p>

On the 19th of Sept., about nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners in the Hornsey-road, about 150 yards from the Forresters' beer-shop, coming from there towards London—I had received information, and stopped Lawford—I asked him what he had got in his pocket—he said, "Nothing"—I found a drinking-glass in his pocket—Copeland was in his company—he walked towards the wall, and we heard a glass fall over the wall—he dropped it over—(it was dark)—I then went to the wall and took Copeland—a young man with me got a light, and found the glass that Copeland had dropped—he came back over the wall—I handed Copeland to Beale, and I took Lawford again—I then saw Copeland hand something to Rolfe—I found it was a brush and another ale-glass—I found in his pockets two other brushes, and another ale-glass—in going along I found Copeland was very uneasy, and wanted to get rid of something—I put my hand into his pocket and found a spoon—when I first stopped them, Copeland had two flower pots in his hand, tied in a handkerchief, which he handed to some other person—(there were several persons about)—when we got to the station I found a saucer—Copeland said he did not know how the spoon came there, somebody else must have put it there—he said he lived at No. 15, Mary's-place, Mary-street, Hampstead-road—I went there on the 20th, and in searching I found two ale glasses and some other things.</p>

                  </hi>, Junior. My father keeps a public-house, in Idol-lane, Tower-street—on 16th June, the prisoners came there—one, I am not certain which, asked for a screw of tobacco, and put down a shilling—I put it in the detector, and it bent—Wilson, I think it was, then said, "Here," and he took it from my hand, and gave me a threepenny-piece, and I gave him change—I pointed the prisoners out to my father, and he looked at them—they left, taking the shilling with them—I am positive it was a bad one by its bending—on 23d June, I saw them again at my father's—I am quite sure they are the same men.</p>

I saw the two prisoners in my house on 16th June—they were pointed out to me by my son—I am quite sure they are the men—on 23d June, I saw them at my bar again—the assistant had just served them with a pint of beer—I took up a shilling which was by the side of the beer—I said, "Whose is this?"—I believe Hewitt said, "It is mine"—I bent it in the detector, found it was bad, leaped over the bar, and said to the prisoners, "I shall require you to stop here, as this is the second time you have endeavoured to pass money in my house"—they denied knowing each other—I sent for a policeman, and gave them into custody with the bad shilling.</p>

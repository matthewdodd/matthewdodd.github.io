            . On the 20th of October I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). I went out between five and six in the evening. I left no one but the prisoner in my apartment. I am certain the things were all there except the two handkerchiefs, when I went out, because I put my drawers to rights that day, she had taken them out of the drawer on the Monday.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay out? - About three quarters of an hour; when I returned she was gone; she had left the doors open. I lodge in the lower apartment; there is no one lodges in the house but me and an old gentleman, he was out; the prisoner had said she was ill; I thought she was gone to lie down; I went up stairs to look for her, and when I returned to my own room, I found one of my drawers open.</p>
               <p>Did you, before you went up stairs to look for her, shut the house-door when you came in? - No; I did not, I left it open.</p>
               <p>You did not see your drawers open when you first went in? - No; I did not observe that.</p>
               <p>How long was you out of the room before you returned and found the drawers open? - I suppose not more than half a minute.</p>
               <p>How many rooms in the house did you go into to look for her? - Only one, a one-pair-of-stairs room. We found her on Friday evening the 22d, in Dyot-street, in a bad house, and she had my clothes upon her; her father and mother came to my apartment, and fetched me to their house, where the prisoner was.

               <p>Was you present? - Yes; he asked her about my things, and she denied knowing any thing of those that were found upon her; her mother had brought the hat and cloak, and laid them on the table; she owned to them. I asked her how she could use me so; she said she did not know; she had sold my handkerchiefs and table-cloth to a Mr. Tipton in Field-lane.</p>

               <p>Who did you find there? - The prisoner, and her father and mother. I asked her how she could be so bad a girl to rob her mistress in that manner; she said she could not tell what was the reason of it.</p>
               <p>Were any of the things produced then? - Yes; a black hat and silk cloak; they were lying on the table; she said she had got into bad company.

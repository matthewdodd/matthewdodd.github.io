The prisoner was in my employ on the 18th of July - I had previously employed him, when in Whitecross-street - on his coming out of there he came to me, and asked for work, and said if I would allow him to take the wood to his lodgings he could do more work, as he could get up at four o'clock in the morning. I gave him eighty-three feet of Cuba and Honduras wood; of what we generally call a peacock mottle - it was a log which had been opened under peculiar circumstances; he was to make it into Trafalgar nail-over chairs. In consequence of some information I applied to

            , and there I found some children's chairs made of the wood I had given to him. I went to his lodgings, and found about nineteen feet of my wood deficient; he had not completed my order, and had no direction from me to sell the wood, but to make the chairs I had ordered.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were the chairs you found made of one sort of wood? A. No; a part of them are of another sort of wood.</p>

            . I live in President-street, York-street, City-road. I am a cabinet and chair-maker. I know the prisoner well: I have looked at these chairs particularly, and if I had known I should have been called on to-day, I believe I could have brought a piece of wood from which the top of this chair has been made. I was present at the prisoner's house, when these things<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150086"></xptr>were making, and he said to me "You see your stuff comes in useful now;" I said "What is this?" he said, "It is some wood of which I made some chairs for you some years ago. I made a couch," said he, "last week, and could not sell it, so I am making up these things, which are sure to sell, to get money." My wood was Cuba wood, and so is this; there is a resemblance between the chairs and this piece of wood produced, but I do not think it is the same: it would be a waste of Cuba wood to buy it to make these chairs of - but odd bits are used for them - workmen do sometimes keep small pieces which we call offal wood - we are not all so stingy as some people are.</p>

            . I live in Old-street. I am a cabinet and chair-maker. I have known the prisoner upwards of six years - he was in my employ while he was in Whitecross-street prison - he had, I have no doubt, a great many odd bits of stuff of mine; the whole of these chairs, except the tops, are made of odd bits, and the tops are pieces which are often given to the men. I have a log myself, which has nearly the same veins, and I have no doubt would correspond with those chairs quite as well as this. I do not believe these are parts of the same tree - they do not correspond at all.</p>

            . I live in the Curtain-road. I have employed the prisoner for six months. I sent him some wood to Whitecross-street - I do not think these chairs are made of this wood - they do not correspond at all - I would not swear about it.</p>
               <p>MR. LLOYD re-examined. Q. In what way do you think the chair was cut off this wood? A. From the side - not the end; it was twice the width when I gave it to him, but the same length - he had made a set of Trafalgar chairs, and some nail overs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had the wood to make the chairs, and in consequence of his not giving me money to go on with, I was forced to make those chairs, and get some person to buy them, to get money for my family. He found I had sold them and came and took away the chairs on which I was at work.</p>
               <p>MR. LLOYD. I had paid him more than he earned.</p>

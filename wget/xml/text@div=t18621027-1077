                  </hi>. I am registrar of the Westminster County Court—the Judge of that Court is Mr. Francis Bailey—it is in St. Martin's parish—I recollect a case of Harmer and Wint coming on to be tried on 13th October—this is the original summons—it is for 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for money lent.</p>

               <p>whether the signature was his—he said that it was not, and that he had never borrowed any money of the plaintiff—he was asked that more than once, and gave the same answer—he was cautioned about the signature by the Judge, who asked him to write his name, which he did—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, as iron<lb></lb>mongers, in the Horseferry-road, and was plaintiff, with him, in this cause in the County Court—we supplied the defendant with some goods in 1858—he owed us money at that time—we obtained a judgment against him in the County Court, Westminster, and execution issued—he came to me in March, 1858, when the Sheriff was in, and said that he was able to make up the amount within 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and, if I would lend him that sum, he could pay the men out; if not, he must let his furniture go, and he should be ruined—I objected at first, but, on his pressing it, I lent it him, and drew up this I O U (<hi rend="italic">Dated March 23d</hi>, 1858), which he signed—the body of it is my writing—I saw him write this "John Wint" on it, and gave him the money in my clerk's presence—I received a communication, and went to the Westminster County Court—I was examined as a witness, and stated that I had lent the defendant 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and saw him write the I O U—after I had given my evidence he was examined, and said, "I never had a shilling of Mr. Harmer in my life"—the Judge said, "You persist in denying that this is your signature to the I O U?"—he said, "I do"—the Judge asked him several times whether he persisted in his denial of the I O U, and then made an order for him to be prosecuted—I recollect very plainly lending him the money, and his signing the I O U.</p>

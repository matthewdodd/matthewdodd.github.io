About 12.30, on the morning of 2nd March, I saw the prisoners in the Balls Pond Road—I followed them—they stopped at a little jeweller's shop for sometime, and then went on into the Kingsland Road, where they stopped near a tailor's—I followed them into the Englefield Road, and they stopped opposite No. 14—I stopped and watched—I saw the reflection of a light, apparently from a match against the parlour window—they came out of the gate and moved into another gateway—they then walked up and down in front of the house and then went into the garden of No. 14 again—I waited a few minutes to get assistance from the constable on the beat—I saw him and spoke to him, and he stopped with me—at that time they came out of the front garden and crossed the road to where I was standing—I saw them come from the gate, but did not see them come out of the house—I took hold of them and asked what they had been doing in that house over the way—they said they had not been to any house, they were going home—I took them to the station, assisted by the other constable—they were searched, and on Thompson was found a jacket, a pannier, and a dress—on Russell we</p>

               <p>found the skirt of a dress, and he was carrying this umbrella in his hand—I went to Englefield Road with N 161, and rang the bell, and from what a gentleman lodger in the house told me, I went to 124, Church Road, Islington, and saw Miss Stockman and Miss Nash, and they went back with me to the house—I examined the parlour window, which was partly open, and found that the catch had been put back by some instrument—I found this knife on Thompson, and a quantity of matches loose in his pocket—he was wearing the ladies' jacket underneath his coat, and Russell had the skirt of the dress bound up in front of him—Miss Nash went with me to the station, and I showed her the property.</p>

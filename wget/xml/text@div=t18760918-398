                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I was engaged with Marony, another officer, to watch the premises of Mr. Bumpus, 13 and 14, Milk Street—on Friday, 18th August, about 1 o'clock, I was in Milk Street, opposite the warehouse—Dance was employed there—I saw Williams and Barker, and a man named Toby waiting at the end of Clements Court, opposite the ware-house—Dance came from No. 13 and 14, and the two prisoners and Toby crossed the road, and they had a conversation together for a minute or two—Dance then went back to the warehouse alone, followed shortly after<lb></lb>wards by Toby—Williams and Barker remained outside, in about five minutes Dance came out followed by Toby, who appeared to be very bulky in the chest—they went down Aldermanbury together, till they came to Fountain Court—they simply looked in the direction of Williams and Barker, and passed on—Toby left Dance and went through. Fountain Court along Basinghall Street, and they met again in Milton Street—about half<lb></lb>way down Milton Street, Toby turned round, looked in our direction and ran away through a court; I have never seen him since—I followed Dance to his lodging, 6, Lambs Passage, Chiswell Street—he went round White-cross Street, and met us—we went up and searched his room and found some pieces of linen, not any of these pieces of lawn—I took him back to the warehouse, about 2.30 I found Williams and Barker standing in the passage—Barker had got this piece of canvas over his arm—Dance said "Those are the two men I spoke to you about"—Williams said "We don't know you, we have just run in here out of the wet"—it was not raining and had not been for sometime—I took the three prisoners up into the warehouse and waited until Mr. Bumpus came, in half or three quarters of an hour, and Dance said in their presence "I will tell you all about it"—he stated it first in private to me and Mr. Bumpus; I said it reflected upon the other two, and they must come in and hear it, and they did come in and Dance in their presence made this statement to Mr. Bumpus, which I took down. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "About a week after coming to you I met these two men, and two men not in custody, in the City Road; they asked me where I was working, I told them that I was working in Milk Street, and that I sometimes had the keys of the place; they said 'You ought to let me have samples of those keys." I said 'Who is <hi rend="italic">they,"</hi> he pointed to the two prisoners and continued: "I said I don't know about that; they said well, can you get us any stuff; he said you can come up and see; the four of them came, and I gave them a quantity of stuff; they came the next day,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187609180015"></xptr>
               <p>and I gave them some more; they came another day and I gave them some more, and that was all the transactions that I had with Williams up to the present, but Barker and the other two men have been a number of times, and I have given them stuff on each occasion. Last Wednesday Barker came up and I gave him a quantity of muslins; I had nothing for the first transaction.") I forget the sums he mentioned as having received afterwards—he said "On Wednesday night I met Barker at Islington, and I waited out<lb></lb>side a street near Albert Terrace, and he brought me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—Mr. Bumpus said "How did they know I was not at home"—Dance said "I used to write on a piece of paper like this 'Come up and take,' and take it down to them, and that signified that Mr. Bumpus was out"—he said "I don't remember that I have got anything more to say now"—I then said to Barker "You have heard what he has said with regard to you"—Barker laughed and said it was all wrong—I then said to Williams "You have heard what he has said with regard to you"—Williams said "Yes, let me ask him a question. Did I ever take any stuff?"—Dance said "No, but you used to come up with Barker, and he used to take it and you bad a share of the money"—he said "Coming up and having share of the money is nothing; did I ever-take any stuff?"—Dance said "No"—we then took them to the station; nothing was found on them; they gave addresses, but I could learn nothing of them there.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was the same in substance as stated by the last witness.</hi>) I have gone through my stock and have missed roll linings, muslins, and other goods.</p>

               <p>no, he did not know him; he went to some other parties and came back and said the person I was looking for was not there; I believe Toby was there at the time, but I am not certain, nothing else took place with Barker then—I think I saw him next morning in Wood Street, alone; I think I spoke to him first, I asked how he was getting on and he asked me where I was working, I told him at Mr. Bumpus'in Milk Street—he asked if there was any chance of doing anything there; I said I did not know but I would see, when the governor was out of the way, I had the keys of the place sometimes—he asked whether I could not let him have the keys; I said I did not know—he said again "Is there any chance of doing anything there?"—I said "Come and see"—he went with me to Sterne and Evans' where I took a parcel—he said "If you ever see anything lying about in the warehouses where you are going, you ought to put it under your coat"—I told him he had better go there himself and take the goods, he said no, he did not think that—he then came along with me to our warehouse, there were two bales from Manchester in the passage, Mr. Bumpus told me to open them, I did so, and Barker said "If you leave one bale there for an hour I can get a truck and take it away—I said "No, I shan't stand to that;" I went up into the warehouse with two parcels, and when I came back I found two parcels gone, containing ten pieces of Victoria lawn, and Barker was also gone—I saw him again about 3 o'clock the same afternoon, he was with a party of his <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> where I had found him the night before, at the Britannia, in the City Road—Toby was not with him, nor Williams—Barker came to me and said "They are no good, if I come down can you give me anything better?"—I said "You must come and see"—he went away and came back with Williams and Toby and another <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> they call <hi rend="italic">Sweet Stuff—</hi>—we went and had a pot of <hi rend="italic">four-half;</hi> we remained talking at the bar for about ten minutes, Williams was talking about something one of his <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> had taken that morning; it had nothing to do with the Victoria lawn—we then all came down to the warehouse together—I went up to my work, Mr. Ellis was there, I asked him to go away for half an hour—the other four were outside waiting; they separated, one was opposite the Swan with Two Necks, one in Clement's Street, and the other two were just at the bottom of the warehouse—I had told them to wait there because they had asked me if there was any more stuff, and I said I would see—I remained in the warehouse till Mr. Ellis went out; I found some cambrics and put them against the door, I looked out of the window, Williams and Toby were there—I called them, Toby came up first and Williams followed, I told him to go down, which he did, and the stuff was taken—I saw Barker the same night, he had told me to meet him by the Britannia Music Hall—he said he had not sold them yet—I think he came the same day—I told him he should not have any more till he gave me some money, and he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 18th August I saw him in St. Paul's Churchyard, he had told me the day before that he would come—he was in company with Toby every time I saw him—when I came out of the warehouse Williams and Toby were opposite—Williams had not been with Barker for a week before that.</p>

            . I was the post-boy who went out went out with the Chester mail on the 11th of March. I received the bags from Mr. Arnold, and put them into the mail, that is, the portmanteau.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you receive the bags?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. Between two and three o'clock; I carried the mail in acart. When I came to <placeName id="t17700711-26-crimeloc144">the Shepherd and Shepherdess, in the New Road</placeName>

He took hold of the bags, and said he would blow my brains out if I did not let him have them. In getting down, he hit his pistol against the side of the cart, and it snapped, but missed fire; there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110031"></xptr> no powder flashed. He told me, he only wanted a letter that was going to a young woman, and they would not let him have it; that he would take it out, and then, he said, he would send the bag to my master in a backney-coach. He said, my master lived in St. John's street; I said, he lived in Bartholomew-close. He asked me whether he had not a mole upon his chin; to which I made no answer: I began to pull my horses round, to come back again; he said he would blow my brains out if I did not go on, and appeared to me to pull out another pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the person dressed?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. In a dark brown great coat, and he appeared to me to have a black under coat and waistcoat; his great coat had what they call a Newmarket cape, a large round cape.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a pistol was it?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. A little pistol, and looked very bright (A short pocket pistol shown him.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that like the pistol the man robbed you with?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. Yes, it is like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any guard to that trigger?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark when you was robbed</p>
               <p>Wheeler. It was about three o'clock; it had been star light, but it rained very hard then, and was very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any moon at that time?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. There was a moon that night, but it was down at that time (A great coat shewn him.) This appears very much like the coat the man had on; some people call them Fryars, some Newmarket capes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so light that you can take upon you to say that the man that robbed you had such a coat as that, with such a cape?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. It was light enough to distinguish that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at first describing the man that robbed you, give an account that he had such a great coat?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular in his person?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I think he had rather a full look with his eye.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner first after this?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. When he was before Sir

               <p>Q. Did you hear him speak?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. Yes; and I judged by his voice and the full look of his eye, that he was the man that robbed me. (Note, the prisoner had a remarkable full eye.)</p>

            . On Saturday the 10th of March last, I inclosed a bill in a letter, which I sealed and directed to Mr. Fuller of Daintry; about ten or eleven o'clock I delivered it myself to the bell-man in Hatton-Garden, who takes in letters to forward to the post-office. (A draft shewn him) This is the draft; it is drawn by Mess. Shaw and Riley, payable to the order of Mr. Fuller; Mr. Fuller having omitted to endorse it, was the reason of my sending it back to be endorsed. After I heard the mail had been robbed, I applied to the house upon which the bill was drawn, that in case the bill was presented, they might take proper notice of the party: the bill being soon after presented for acceptance, the prisoner was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the bill?</p>
               <p>Watson. It appears so upon the face of it; I am sure that is my letter in which it was enclosed. (The letter read, in which he advises Mr. Fuller, that he returned inclosed, the draft, as he had omitted to endorse it.)</p>

            . On the 20th of March a young man presented that bill at our house for acceptance; upon observing that it was the bill Mr. Watson had given us information to stop, Mr. Sneath, my brother, one of the partners, went over with him to the post-office, and upon informing the secretary of the circumstances, he sent two gentlemen to Mr. Suetton's house; I went with them; their names were Cummings and Braithwaite. We stopt the coach twenty or thirty yards before we came to the prisoner's house, and the two gentlemen went to the house, the boy and I staid in the coach. The door was locked; they enquired at the next house, but could not hear of him. We went to a public house; the boy pointed out his master. I told him I should be glad to speak with him; he desired me to walk to his house; when we came there I produced the bill, and asked him how he came by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the bill?</p>
               <p>Sneath. Yes; I marked it with the initial letters of my name. He told me he had received it the day before, of a man who came to buy some tea of him, whom he looked upon to be a smuggler; that he bought four or five pounds worth of tea; that he had bought six pounds worth of him once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you his name?</p>
               <p>Sneath. He said it was Newman, or Newborn.</p>
               <p>Q. There is such a name wrote upon the bill?</p>
               <p>Sneath. I wrote that as a memorandum. He said, he did not know whether he was a housekeeper or a lodger. He looked very much confused at the time, and wanted to know my reasons why I came, and what was the matter with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110033"></xptr> the bill. I did not immediately resolve him; but told him, if he would go with me to the post-office, somebody should go with him in pursuit of this man. He said, he would go with me. On coming down stairs, there was a man with a cart at the door with some starch; a carpenter came to fix up some shelves for him; he said, he must stay to have that job finished; and that if I would go on, he would follow me. I told him I would wait till he was at leisure. I beckoned to Mr. Cummings, and he came over to me. The prisoner went up stairs for five minutes, I believe, with a young woman that lived at the next door; when he came down, he said he would go along with us. We went to the post-office; Mr. Todd desired us to take him to Sir

            's in search of this Newman, or Newborn; he said he lived in Bond-street. I went there with him; I got out of the coach at the end next Piccadilly, and left him with another man in the coach; I enquired almost at every house, at least at every open door, and could hear nothing of him at all. When we came up to the Castle Tavern, he said, I am very well known at this house; let us have a gill of wine together. We searched all the street, and could not find any such person. He said, Newman was very well known at the Blue Lion in Red Lion Square: I went with him there; he was very intimate with the people in the house; we enquired of them, but they knew no such person. Then we described him to the people of the house, as the prisoner had described him to us, which was almost like himself, of the dress and manner; they said, if it was any body, it must be one Johnson; but they said he was rather taller.</p>

            . I lived with the prisoner in March last; I received this bill from my master, and took it to Mess. Baldero's and company for acceptance.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your direction?</p>
               <p>Canfield. He said I must give it to a man behind the counter, and if he could not do it, then I must tell him I would bring it again in the afternoon; I carried it for acceptance.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lay near enough to hear him if he got out?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you fasten the door when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Canfield. It was upon a spring-lock when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the key?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I left it in his room; the young woman was there when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose she went away; did she not?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she went out of her own accord, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Canfield. Yes, I believe so.</p>

               <p>Q. What occasion had you to examine the lock?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear the young woman go away?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I did not hear her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not lock the door yourself?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I could not double lock it; the woman was to go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any maid-servant in the house?</p>
               <p>Canfield. No; there was only my master and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your master the appearance of being so ill, as not to be able to get up the whole day on Friday?</p>
               <p>Canfield. Not to my knowledge; he was not up the whole day either on Friday or Saturday.</p>

               <p>Canfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember the morning that the bill was stopt, and your master went to the post-office?</p>
               <p>Canfield. Yes.</p>

               <p>Canfield. Only me and the young woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man that was at work in the house?</p>
               <p>Canfield. He went away as soon as he had done his job.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that great coat and that suit of black your master's cloaths?</p>

               <p>Canfield. Yes; and I saw him find the pistols, they were in green bags.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been out of the house from the time your master was taken to the post-office, to the time these things were found?</p>

            . No. There was one circumstance I did not mention; the next day after I had sent this letter, I went accidentally to the post-office; I saw a paper stuck up there, purporting that the mail had been robbed, and the bag for Luton stole. I went home and asked my lad if he put the letter into the post-office, he said he did: I referred to my bill-book, and found a draft was drawn upon me by my brother for twenty-four pounds twelve shillings. I then thought the draft must be in the letter. I wrote to Mr. Williamson; he sent me for answer that he had never received it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110036"></xptr>Laurence. I had before advised my I had drawn such a draft.</p>
               <p>Canfield. Did you ever receive that or master (Shewing him the draft.)</p>
               <p>Canfield. Yes He ordered me to carry it for to Mr. Laurence, the same time I the other draft to Messrs. Baldero's and Co. I was stopped at Messrs. Baldero's, so I delivered the bill back again to my master; my master called me up, when I got home, and asked me what an came for that was in the shop; I told I was stopped at Baldero's with the note he gave me; he asked me for the other and I gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner Council. Is there no possibility of putting a key underneath the door on the outside.</p>
               <p>Canfield. I don't know, it might be so, I never tried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you might put it over the door?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I don't believe they can.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not this girl go out and double lock the shop door, and put the key underneath?</p>
               <p>Canfield. The key was upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cummings. Please to produce all the notes you found at the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Cummings. The bills were found in the drawers, the letters underneath the bed upon the bedstead. A draft for 6 l. 10 s. (read) sent from Nantwich to London, to be forwarded to Bishop Stortford. The letter read in which it was enclosed, dated Nantwich, 7th of March. A note of hand for 6 l. 5 s. from Bishop Stortford (read.) Another from Colchester, dated March 9th, for 158 l. 10 s. and the letter accompanying it. A note for 70 l. with the letter accompanying it; another 19 l. 7 s. another 100 l. accompanied with a letter giving advice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner's Council to Canfield. You say the door was double locked in the morning.</p>
               <p>Canfield. It was to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no doubt about it?</p>
               <p>Canfield. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you always well satisfied it was so?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I always thought it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have told somebody you have doubted it, will you say you never did?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I can't say positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Rutson of Bishop's-gate-street?</p>
               <p>Canfield. Yes.</p>

            . I am a publican. I have known the prisoner some time. I went to see him; March last; on the 9th of March in the evening, I was with him; he was very ill to all appearance. One of Mrs. Serjant's daughters shewed me up stairs to him, and then left me. He told me he had had a fit in the morning, that he fell down, and was some time before he recovered himself.</p>
               <p>Q. to Canfield. Do you remember any fit your master had on Friday morning?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I never saw him in a fit, I know he complained of one; I have known him intimately for four years past; I knew all his family; his general character has been very good. I told him if he wanted any thing I could assist him in, or if he was troubled or enthralled he should be welcome to my assistance: I mentioned no sum, but if he had wanted 100 l. he should have had it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you apprehend that he was enthralled?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I did not; but I could not tell his circumstances; he was to have opened his shop some little time before. I asked him the reason why he did not open his shop so soon as I expected; he said he was willing to get all his things into his shop before he opened, and his business consisted of a great many articles.</p>

            . I am an apothecary, I live in Nortonfalgate. I was called to attend upon the prisoner the 12th of March last; I went to him at eleven in the forenoon; he was in bed, and appeared to me to be very ill; he had a burning heat in his skin, he had the symptoms of a fever upon him; one person in the room, Mrs. Sarjent, I believe, said he had not been out of his bed from the Thursday before.</p>

We had an account that he was taken up; I went to him, and he gave me an order to have my goods back again.</p>

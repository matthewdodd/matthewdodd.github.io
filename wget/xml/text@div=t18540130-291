                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 244). On Saturday evening, 7th Jan., at 20 minutes to 7 o'clock, I saw the prisoners standing by the pitching block, at the corner of the Old Bailey—I saw them come from Newgate-street, and followed them into Skinner-street—Moss had something done up in this wrapper (99<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on his back, and his left hand was on Burn's right shoulder—I asked them what they had there; Burn said it was meat—I asked him where he was going to take it; they both replied, "We are going to take it to the bottom of Holborn-hill," and that a man had engaged them to carry it close by the pitching block, and was going to give them 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told them they had better stop and let me see who the man was who had engaged them—Moss said "Take it off my shoulder; I cannot keep it on my shoulder if I am to wait"—I took it off his shoulder, and placed it under the wall—he said, "I will go and get the man, and bring him for you;" he went away, and I kept Burn and the beef—I waited twenty minutes; and finding he did not return, I took Burn and the beef to the station house—this ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was skewered to the meat, which led to its being identified—Moss was apprehended by my description of him, and was brought to the station on the following Wednesday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Saul, a meat salesman, of Newgate-market—this ticket is my writing—I left it skewered to some meat in a cloth in the middle of the shop, when I left on Saturday, about half past 4 or 5 o'clock—I missed it when I came on Monday morning—I know the wrapper produced; it belongs to the party in the country, who sent it up with the meat, but it was in Mr. Saud's care.</p>

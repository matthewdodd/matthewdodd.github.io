I met the prisoner on the 25th of May, as I was going home, and went to a room with her—I put my watch and my hat on the table—we then had some dispute, as she said I had promised her more money than I gave her—I told her to give me back what I had given her—I had given her a shilling, and paid sixpence for the room—I had not promised her any more—she would not give it me back, and she turned into bed—she then turned out again, and stooped down as if to tie her garter—I then missed my watch, and accused her of having it—she denied it—she made an alarm—the landlord came up, and sent for an officer—she was taken to the station-house, and my watch was found in her stays—this is it.</p>

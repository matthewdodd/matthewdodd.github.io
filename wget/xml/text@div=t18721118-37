                  </hi>. I am a bombardier in the G Battery, B Brigade of Artillery—John York is in the F Battery—on the morning of 5th September the F Battery went to Aldershot, and York with it—the prisoner was also a bombardier in my battery—there is a post-office in the barracks—I receive the letters bodily from the post-office and take them to the barracks and distribute them—on the morning of 5th September I received a quantity of letters for the G Battery and the F Battery—I took them to the B Brigade office—the prisoner was there, and we both sorted the letters for the G and F Batteries—I took possession of the G letters, and afterwards distributed them—the prisoner took possession of the letters for the F Battery—he was to post them after redirecting them to Aldershot—he said he would do it himself—I noticed a letter for Corporal York amongst the letters for the F Battery—I remarked to the prisoner "Here is a letter for Collar-maker York, it is a bulky one"—it was different from an ordinary letter, it was bulky—the prisoner did not say anything—he took possession of the letter—that was about 9.15—I did not see any more of the letters—to the best of my belief the words "Ten shillings" and the name of "Collar-maker</p>

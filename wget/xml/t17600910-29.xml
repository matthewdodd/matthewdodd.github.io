               <p>Q. How do you know it was broke at that time?</p>
               <p>Hanson. I hearing a noise, got up to see, and there was a sow out of the sty; I heard a very great noise, and upon looking about, I saw a man lying by some casks; after that he was removed to another place; I call'd up my servant, we took him, and found it to be the prisoner at the bar, he had been my servant; I took him before an alderman; he own'd he was the person that was found there; he was ask'd how he came there; he said he had been employ'd there, and he went in to ask for his money; we found one of the pigs dead in the sty.</p>

               <p>Q. Which way did he come in?</p>
               <p>Souden. He must come in at a wicket I imagine, there was a broomstick lay in the hog-sty.</p>

            . Master call'd me up as the clock struck four; I came into the yard; he said to me I have got a man in the yard, he lies upon a cask; I went in and saw a hand; then I said hollow two or three times; then he said hollow; I said who is there? he said it is me; I said who is that? he said it is me again; then I said, it is Old Harry, we call'd him so, he had liv'd fellow servant with us; master said is it Green; yes, he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the alderman?</p>
               <p>Hayes. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own any thing?</p>
               <p>Hayes. He own'd nothing there, but that he came for some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Who fastened the yard gate?</p>
               <p>Hayes. I did; it was a door, it was lock'd and bolted every night at 11 o'clock when I went to bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the lock broke?</p>
               <p>Hayes. It was not, but he had keys that could open any lock about our house.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Hayes. He has been detected in opening them; I have a key here that was found in a cupboard that he had the use of some time before.</p>

               <p>One of the men own'd me some money; I went to the door, the little gate was open, where the officer goes in to take his survey; I went in there, and being in liquor, sat down where the cooper does his business; I began to be sleepy; I went into the hog-sty, and fell asleep; it is a very likely thing indeed, that I should go there to kill a pig, and not take it away when I had done. I will not say but that I did abuse them. in calling them a name or two; I might say something to them more than was handsome, that was all.

               <p>Q. Did your Ladyship remove it into the country subsequent to that time, or where was it when you last saw it? - A. I think it was in that cabinet; I have not looked at it a good while; it was in the cabinet when last I saw it.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he leave your service? - A. I cannot positively say the day he was discharged; he was discharged between the 26th and the 31st of July; I discharged him by Lord Mansfield's direction's who was then at Ramsgate.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was in your service, was he entrusted in your apartment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he then an opportunity of knowing where the snuff-box was deposited? - A. Of course his employment let him know where this box was kept; I believe he knew it as well as I did; he was often with me in that room, and any thing that I wanted I got him to hand it me.</p>
               <p>Q. When had your Ladyship first occasion to know that that box was missing? - A. Not till I received the Magistrate's letter.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where do you live? - A. I live in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar and tell me whether, at any time, you saw him at your shop? - A. Yes, on the 15th of August last the prisoner came to my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose? - A. To purchase a gold chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce him any chain? - A. Yes, the man in the shop shewed him a chain; I was not there when he first shewed him the chain.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came in had the prisoner at the bar come into your shop about any thing? - A. Yes, he was in my shop looking at a chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree with him about the price of the chain? - A. Yes, when we agreed for the price, he asked me if it was customary to take old gold in exchange for new articles; I told him it was; upon which he pulled out some bits of gold, which I have now in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When he gave it to you did you make any observation about it? - A. I immediately suspected him; the pieces of gold were apparently fragments of a snuff-box of curious workmanship; I sent for our journeyman to come out, and I conversed with him aside.</p>
               <p>Q. When the journeyman came out did you speak to the prisoner? - A. I asked the prisoner, how he came by the gold; he told me he had it from a servant; I told him that it was no servant's property; he said it was, upon which I told him I thought he had stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the gold lying at the time of this conversation? - A. On the counter; I told him he should not go away until he had given me an account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you had told him the whole of the story he seemed to try to collect it in his hands? - A. I went to fetch my hat to go with him to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that you were going to take him to Marlborough-street? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went for your hat, what became of him? - A. I observed him make a snatch at the gold on my returning with my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he succeed in getting any? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any remain behind? - A. Yes, he took a part, and left the remaining part behind.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the chain? - A. We lost that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180038"></xptr>Q. You never saw the chain any more? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner stay or go away? - A. He made a snatch at the box, and immediately ran out at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stated the box you meant the pieces of gold that are there? - A. Yes; I pursued him; he had gone about fifty or sixty yards before I overtook him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him at all? - A. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the least doubt that the prisoner is the man? - A. None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was afterwards taken to Marlborough-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he was searched? - A. No; when I overtook him, I immediately collared him, he said, do not collar me, for I am no thief; I told him he had given me every reason to suppose to the contrary, and he must go with me to Marlborough-street, and I took him; I attended the search-warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at Marlborough-street did you learn from the prisoner where his lodgings were? - A. Yes, I think it was No. 21, Bolsover-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What apartment in that house did you search? - A. The garret.</p>
               <p>Q. And underneath the grate in his apartment? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Will your Lordship have the goodness to look at all these things now produced - are you certain that they belonged to and that they were part of a box that was in your possession when your Lordship went into the country? - A. Yes, it is part of a gold box I then had.</p>
               <p>Q. There are some brilliants, will your Lordship look at them? - A. I had some of a similar sort that encircled the box I lost, and it had such a case as that which is found, and I know the miniature.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose immediate custody was this, in Lady Mansfield's or your's? - A. In Lady Mansfield's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the box been in your family any length of time? - A. The box came from the Emperor of Austria, 
               <persName id="t18050918-42-person436">Joseph</persName>
             the Second, to my father, on his leaving Vienna.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the value you set upon that box? - A. I should imagine, I cannot speak with accuracy, two hundred guineas, the value of the box and the brilliants.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt of its being worth ten pounds? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Just shew me one or two pieces of the box that you speak to? - A. I speak to the chasing; the form of the box and the rim of this box are different from any other box I ever saw; on the miniature there is the lower part of the face to be seen, and the breast, with the Austrian orders.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Lady Mansfield.) Q. Has your Ladyship seen part of the box since you have come to town? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the result of that observation? - A. That they are part of the box.</p>

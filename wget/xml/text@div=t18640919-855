                  </hi>. I am a schoolmaster, and live at 27, Herries-street, Her<lb></lb>cules<lb></lb>buildings, Lambeth—on 26th August, about ten minutes past 6, as I was going over London-bridge, three fellows surrounded me and hustled me</p>

               <p>and pushed me towards the parapet of the bridge—from their appearance I judged something was wrong—I felt a tug at my watch; I looked down and saw one of the prisoner's hands leave my pocket; I could not swear I which—as soon as that happened they left me—my watchguard was hanging I down, and my watch was gone—I turned round and seized Williams, and said, "I want you; you have taken my watch"—he said, "It was not me, sir"—I held him tight, and gave him into custody; he was one of the three I that surrounded me—I can swear to him by his hare-lip, and also to the I other two.</p>

I am a clerk, and live at 7, Alfred-place, Brunswick-street, Dover-road—on 26th August, shortly after 6, I was passing over London-bridge—I saw the prisoners—there was a steamer coming in, and a great number of persons were looking over the parapet to see it—I saw the prosecutor trying to move along, and the three prisoners around I him, pushing him about—I then saw a hand drawn from his pocket; I be<lb></lb>lieve it was Homes's—I saw one of them pass the watch on to Donovan—I Homes tried to get away—I laid hold of him by the shoulder—he said, I "What do you want with me"—I said, "Come with me and I will tell you"—he tried to struggle, but there were two ladies and gentlemen behind him, and I kept him.</p>

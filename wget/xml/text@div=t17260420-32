The Prisoner came up to me, and I asked him what he wanted. He answer'd, D - ye I'll tell ye when I come in He pull'd open the Door, clap'd a Pistol to my Breast and took my Money, and demanded my Watch. I told him I had none, upon which he undid my Breeches. - Now are not you a lying Son of Bitch, says he, to say that you have ne'er a Watch, when I have got hold of the String? The other took a Thimble, and some odd Things from the young Woman, and carry'd off my Hinges. Their Pistols had Brass Stocks and bright Barrels.

             thus depos'd. The Prisoner and one Carpenter asked me to go with them on the Highway, the Night after this Robbery was Committed. You need not be afraid of me, says the Prisoner, for I can do you no hurt: I cannot be an Evidence against you. You know that I have been Transported, and Cast for my Life, and I have broke cut of Newgate. We robb'd the Hamstead Stage Coach last Night, and there I got these Hinges, and this Money . - I told him I'd consider of it, and so I did; for I went before Justice Blackerby, got a Warrant, and so he was Apprehended. Quilt Arnold thus depos'd. I took the Prisoner at Westminster, and took these 2 Pistols upon him You see the Stocks are Brass, and the Barrels bright. <rs id="t17260420-32-verdict167" type="verdictDescription">

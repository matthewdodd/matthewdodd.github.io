                  </hi>. I keep the Old Red Lion, in Bridgt-stwet, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth—on the rooming of the 4th of Aug., I went to bed about two o'clock—I examined the house previous to going to bed—there is a door leading to the stable—I fastened that myself by two bolts, and shut down all the first floor windows—after retiring to bed, I was alarmed by hearing a policeman call me by name, and ringing the bell—I opened the window, and after hearing what he said, I went up stairs, called my waiter, and immediately came down stairs—I beard somebody, as I thought, trying to open the front door which faces the water—there are two fronts to my house, the back-door leads to the stable—the stable yard is generally open all night—when I got down stairs it was quite dark, in consequence of the house being cloied—I went towards where I heard the noise, and seized hold of somebody by the collar—I could not recognise him at that time—the man I seized, said, "You have been robbed, Sir, I am looking for the thief"—I said, "If that is the case, no harm can come to you;" at the same moment, I re<lb></lb>ceived a violent blow at the back of the shoulder—I could not tell what it was with—I then seized the man tight by the throat—I could not tell who he was at that moment—I then received another blow, on the temple, at the side of my eye—it did not quite stun me, but made me feel rather stupid—I</p>

               <p>then caught him tighter, and put my legs round him, and flung him on the top of the kitchen stairs, on the landing, level with the ground floor—I threw myself on him, and held him till assistance came—the policeman B 53 came from the stable yard with others—somebody brought a light which enabled me to see the man—it was the prisoner, Huggett—I was upon him—I did not loose my hold of him at all—I am quite positive he is the person I first seized, and am sure he is the man who struck the second blow; because, while I held him, I felt his arm come against me—I saw nobody else when the light came—I then went into the bar, and found it strewed with various things—some silver spoons and forks were bent, and thrown about the bar—I found the bar door had been opened which I had locked at night, and taken the key to bed with me—I found the bar window had been forced by a crow-bar—I found one of the first floor windows open, which I am positive was shut when I went to bed—it was merely kept down by its own weight—I found the dust on the stone of the balcony scraped away by finger<lb></lb>marks, and the marks of a shoe with a nail—the balcony is about nine feet from the ground—a person could easily get up there, and from there get to the window—from a small cupboard in the bar, I missed three silver spoons, and a five shilling paper of copper—my bar-maid's work-box was forced open—the tills were emptied of four sixpences, and about four shillings of copper money—nearly five pounds weight of cigars were taken from inside the bar—I found many of them strewed about the passage leading to the stable yard, and one bundle, unbroken, in the stable yard—two stairs below where I struggled with Huggett, I picked up a life-preserver; and the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packet of halfpence I picked up where I threw Huggett—the life-preserver was close to the spot—about ten minutes after I went down stairs into the cellar, with the policemen, and heard a policeman say, "Here is another man"—he was in the cellar—we found the prisoner Jones in the coal cellar—after he was taken, we were searching among the coals, and on turning them over, found a crow-bar, which I afterwards fitted to the bar window, and it answered the marks exactly—I do not think any of the prisoners were in the house the previous night—the back-door was fastened before I went to bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Beard, and live in Red Lion-yard, at the foot of Westminster-bridge—it is the yard behind the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's premises—the back gates were open on the night in question, as my master was out—my attention was attracted by the policeman running about—he told me to stand back, which I did, till he had taken two of the pri<lb></lb>soners—he called for a light, and I brought one—I picked up in the yard three spoons, a constable's staff, and some cigars—I gave them to the ser<lb></lb>geant No. 3.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant L</hi> 3.) I received some articles from Sand<lb></lb>ford, which I produce—I found some cigars, and 1 found a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> in the coal-cellar—I dug it out of the coals—I found two german silver forks and a spoon in the bar-parlour, and a pair of plated sugar-tongs—the life-preserver was found on the cellar steps—I tried the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> to the bar window, and it fitted it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the police-force—I saw Mr. Mackintosh at the station on the morning, I was sent for—he appeared to have a contused wound on the temple—it was done by some heavy instru<lb></lb>ment—this life-preserver would have done it—there is danger attending a blow on that part—the eye has been discoloured and swollen—it is very slightly so now.</p>

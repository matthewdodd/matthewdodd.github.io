I am single, and live at 76, Aubyn Street, Waterloo Road—I have lived with the prisoner six years up to the time this occurred—on 13th November I was with him in the Strand—I had been with him since 9 o'clock—we had had a glass of drink, and he was not sober—we had words about money affairs, and I said that I would not go home with him any more—Miss Olliver, a friend of mine, came up, and we all three went to the corner of Buckingham Street—the prisoner asked me to go home—I said I would not, and he stabbed me in my chest, back, and side—I was taken to the hospital, and am still there, though the wounds are healed.</p>

I am single, and live at 112, Wardour Street, Soho—I know the prisoner—I saw them quarrelling in the Strand, and advised them to go away—we all three went together—they still kept having words us we walked along—I think they had each had a few glasses of drink—they could walk steadily—we all three stood at the corner of Duke Street—I advised them to go home—the prosecutrix said that she would not go home any more, and he struck her several times, but I did not see that he had a knife in his hand.</p>

I am house-surgeon at Charing Cross Hos<lb></lb>pital—the prosecutrix was brought there on 13th November, with three wounds, one on her breast bone, one against her spine, and one in her right loin—the first two were superficial—the knife must have been directed straight—the third passed downwards, and slightly forward through the muscles of the loin—it was upwards of two inches deep, and was bleeding slightly—the wounds have healed, but she has not recovered her strength.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he had not the slightest recollection of committing the act, that since having the small pox he had never been able to take spirituous liquors without losing his senses, and that when they quarrelled he no doubt stabbed her with his penknife, for which he was now deeply grieved.</hi>

               <p>On Thursday the 15th of December, about twelve at night, I was going to my lodgings at <placeName id="t17860111-9-crimeloc44">Saltpetre-bank</placeName>

               <p>We heard of this robbery, I had taken up a man and a woman, I had a disorderly woman, and another man was brought in, and in less than half an hour after the prisoner came in to ask for this woman, he had something stuck out, he said it was tobacco, and the beadle searched him in my presence, and took out this hat and handkerchief, that was the night this robbery was committed, within an hour after, he said he picked up the hat in a mob, on Friday, and the handkerchief he said he changed with a woman two or three days before; the prosecutor described the marks of the handkerchief before he saw it, before Justice Staples, I think he called it a sort of a cross like the mark of a ten, and he described the hat to have a red strap.</p>

               <p>Did he tell the colour of the lining? - I do not remember whether that was asked or not, I did not see the prosecutor that night, I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>I took the things out of the prisoner's pockets in the watch-house, when he came into the watch-house, I asked what he had in his pocket, by the bulk, he said it was some hands of tobacco, I asked him to shew it me, he would not, I put my hand in and took it out, I asked him where he had it, he said he got it at Billinsgate in a fight.</p>

               <p>I did not think it any harm to buy the hat and handkerchief, I gave half a gallon of purl for the hat on Saltpetre Bank, there was a man and a boy in the house at the same time, and I sent for them, and they did not come, I expect them soon, there is nobody here now.</p>

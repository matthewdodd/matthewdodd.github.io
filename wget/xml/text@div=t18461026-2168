                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper, and live in Lovegrove-stree Kent<lb></lb>toad. On the evening of the last night of Peckham fair, the 23rd of Sept, about nine o'clock, I was at the Eel-pie-house—I went in the dancing-room and came out a little after ten o'clock—I then went before the bar, and had something to drink—I recollect having my watch then, because I had looked to see the time a minute before I went to the bar—I had known the prisoner perfectly well for four years—he was standing before the bar with some others—I do not know what he was about—I knew bkn and his family—"he lives in the neighbourhood—he wat there at the time 1 came up to the bar, and looked at my watcb—he spoke to me—I do not know whether he saw me pull it out—he was standing behind me—I remained at the bar till he and another person, not in custody, took hold of my arms—three or four others came behind me and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me against the tap-room door, and carried me off my legs—I fell dowu, they all fell on me—I should say there were five of them altogether—they were all on top of me—the prisoner was one who <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me into the tap-room—I cannot tell whether he was on me—I felt a tug at my pocket while I was on ihe ground—somebody pulled the men off me—I got up, went to the front <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the door, and missed my watch from my waistcoat pocket—I had a gold guard round my neck-
I found the gold chain hanging down, and the ring of it gone except a small part of it which was broken—I told the landlord the watcb was gone—he said be knew nothing of it—I saw no more <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the prisoner till he was in custody—I did net see him when I got off the floor—I do not know whether he was in the room then or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Morgan's servant. I live in Lovegrove-street—was at the Eel-pie-house on the 23rd of Sept., when my master was there—was in the gardeus with him about ten o'clock—I stopped in the dancing<lb></lb>booth some time, and then came away with my master—we were coming out,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184610260133"></xptr>
               <p>I went in front of the bar to have something to drink—master gave me a ticket to go into the gardens, and I left him in front of the bar—I returned to the bar in about an hour and a half, and saw him there again—the prisoner and several others stood at the bar—three or four of them took hold of master's arm, and said, "Well, Morgan, how are you?"—they all said so—they asked him whether he was going to stand something to drink—he said, "No, go along with you," and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> them on one side—the prisoner and another one gave him a <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> against the tap-room door—the door went open, and he went into the tap-room—the prisoner pushed him and took hold of him—I do not know that the prisoner laid his hands on him when they asked him how he was—my master was down in the tap-room—there were three of them kneeling on him, the prisoner was upon him—I should know the others if I were to see them—they were strangers to me—there were four on him with the pri<lb></lb>soner—I have no doubt that he was kneeling on him, but do not know how he came to kneel on him—they were hardly on him two minutes—I pulled three of them off, the prisoner and two others, as they were kneeling on him—the prisoner went away, I took my master up, and a few minutes after<lb></lb>wards, coming outside the door, he said he had lost his watch, and came back to the door—just before twelve 'clock the same night the prisoner was taken at the Lord Nelson, at the end of Peckham foot-path, not a quarter of a mile from the Eel-pie-house—I had not known him before—I thought I had seen him before—I did not recognise him that night as having seen him before—I went to the Lord Nelson three times to look after him, and the fourth time I saw him, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. No, I was not sober, I had been drinking at the Bell public-house, I was coming through <placeName id="t18010114-50-crimeloc287">Aldgate High-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was there any lamp near you? - A. It was very near under a lamp.</p>
               <p>- ADAMS sworn. - I am a watchman; when I was in my watch-box, I heard a cry of stop thief; I directly started from my box, and saw the prisoner running very fast, and the prosecutor in pursuit of him, and before I could get sufficiently far enough across the road, the prisoner passed me; I pursued him very closely, and called to my partner to stop him; as soon as I could stop him, the prisoner turned to the right into Church-row; I followed him through Church-row; I then called out, stop him; the prisoner then made away for Leadenhall-street or the Minories, he saw several people in front of us, and immediately started back again, he crossed backwards and forwards in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140057"></xptr>road till he passed me again; I came up to him, and laid hold of him; he asked what he had done; I said I did not know what he had done, but should insist upon his going with me; I then took him to the watch-house, and as soon as I had got him to the watch-house, the prosecutor came in, and said, that was the man that had robbed him of his watch; the prisoner said he had no watch about him; he was searched, but we found none; I took my lanthorn, and went to search, and between where I took him and the watch-house, I found the watch about ten yards from the watch-house door, it appeared to have been run over by a carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was exactly in a line in which the prisoner had passed? - A. It was exactly in the line; I then took the prisoner to the watch-house, and the prosecutor claimed the watch.</p>

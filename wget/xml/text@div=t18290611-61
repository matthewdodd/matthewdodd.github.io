            . I am a Thames Police constable. On the 4th of May, about four o'clock in the morning, I was coming out of the West India Export Dock, and saw the prisoner in the Maria lug-boat; I saw him lift up a tarpauling, which covered some bags of sugar; he remained for some minutes in a stooping position - I went and asked him if he had the charge of that; he said he had, that he was the watchman - I then went into the boat, and found that one of the bags had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110031"></xptr>opened, plundered, and sewed up again; I asked if he had any sugar in his hat - he said No; I took off his hat and found this bag, which had had some sugar in it - I then searched his pockets, and I saw him take from his left hand pocket, this small hair case, which he threw into the water - I got it out; it contains a needle, and some twine, which corresponds with the twine, with which this bag has been sewn up; he then acknowledged that the bag had been plundered, but he did not do it - about eight o'clock, Gates came and asked what I did there; I told him one bag had been plundered- I took the bag, and weighed it - it weighed 1 cwt. 2qrs. 5lbs., which was 15lbs. less than it should be; I then took the prisoner to the office, and the Magistrate ordered the sugar to be taken out of this bag, that it might be shipped on board the Emmery - I have kept the bag ever since, which the sugar had been in; the sugar in the little bag appeared the same as was in the other - the prisoner said that when he saw me looking at him, he started the sugar overboard, from this bag.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOY. The prisoner was brought to my office by Bishop - I desired him to take the bag out of the craft; it had been recently plundered, and mended with tar twine; I asked what he had done with the sugar from this little bag - he said, seeing the officer observe him, he had thrown it overboard; I then asked why he threw his needle-case overboard - he gave no answer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did I not tell you I found this bag cut open, and I picked up the sugar? A. I asked where he got the sugar he threw overboard - he said he picked it up near the bag, in the craft.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Sunday evening I went and took a sculler to the West India Docks - I saw this craft made fast to a barge, loaded with bricks; I went on board and staid till one o'clock in the morning - I went and sat down in the brick barge cabin, and staid there till a little after four; I then went on board this craft again- I lifted up the tarpauling, and found the bag had been cut and some sugar scattered about; I did sew up the bag again with a needle and tar twine, which I always keep in my pocket to stop holes - I did take up about a - lb., and shake it over the boat's side; that is what I told the officer.</p>

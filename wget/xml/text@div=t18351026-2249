                  </hi>. I am a wholesale druggist, and live in Thames-street. John Foster was my porter for about twelve months—about eight months in my individual service, and four months previously, in the service of myself and another—I came to town to the warehouse, on Monday morning, the 19th of October, and Foster made a communication to me—I found there was an appearance of violence to the window, and some parts of my warehouse—a chest of manna had been broken in one room, and a chest of saffron was broken, and I missed a parcel of isinglass—from sixty to seventy pounds of manna had been taken; the chest was quite empty—it was worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound—I got the assistance of Josiah Evans, the officer, and I pointed out to him the marks of violence which my premises presented—in a subsequent part of the day I gave Foster to Maclean—l had him taken, from something said by the officer—Foster then made a statement voluntarily, without any promise on my part; and in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he said, I went to the prisoner's house, in Hackney-road, with Roe and Maclean—he carries on the business of a confectioner—Roe went in first, I followed him momentarily—Maclean entered at the same time with Foster—Cohen was at home, in the front shop—Roe called him backwards into his house, there being persons in the shop—they went into his back parlour, and we followed immediately—nothing was asked in the front shop—when we got into the back parlour, Roe had put questions to which he was apparently giving an answer—I did not hear what he said distinctly—the first question I heard Roe put, was, "Where are the goods you received this morning?"—he replied, "I will show you, "and attempted to go out of the back door, near which he was then standing—Roe refused to allow him to leave the room, and insisted upon his stating where they were—he made several attempts to induce Roe to allow him to show where they were; and finding he would not, he said, "My wife shall show you"—his wife came in almost immediately, I suppose two minutes after we entered the house; and when she came in, she said, "What are these gentlemen wanting?"—the prisoner said, "They are come about the bag that came this morning; show them where it is"—she look Roe into the yard, and he brought from a building in the yard, a bag containing manna, and a paper bag containing isinglass—I examined the bag containing manna, and have since seen it weighed—it is rather more than sixty pounds—I have no doubt but that it is of the same kind and quality as that lost from my warehouse—I had seen the same bag in my warehouse the Fri<lb></lb>day previous—whilst there, there was a man who appeared to be an ac<lb></lb>quaintance of Cohen—he asked him, "From whom did you receive those goods?" pointing to the two bags—Cohen's reply was, "That is the man"—pointing to Foster, who was in a corner of the room—it is utterly impossible to recognise the isinglass, but the bag I had seen on the Tues<lb></lb>day preceding.</p>

Buchanan and Meg<lb></lb>geson—he said he knew some of their men very well, and asked whether I could get any things so that my master should not know—if I could get it to his house, he could get it away directly; so that no one should know about it—after this I had dealings with him often, and I received money from him a great many times—he walked with me several mornings, and asked if my master did not deal in saffron and different things—he saw me often enough to know me—on the Saturday in question some saffron, gam<lb></lb>booge, tamarinds, and isinglass was taken from my master's warehouse, and on the Monday morning some manna was taken from the middle floor there—it was in a box—I stole it—I took, I suppose, about 50lbs.—I put it into a cloth bag, and took it to the public-house at the corner of Fish-street-hill, and asked if I could leave it there—I did not know Thomas King at that time—I saw him standing outside the public-house—I asked him if he knew Hackney-road—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he knew Mr. Cohen—he said, "No"—I gave King the bag to take to Mr. Cohen—when I asked him if he knew him, he said he did not know him, but he dare say he should find it—I told him to take it to Mr. Cohen, a little beyond the church, on the left-hand side—he then took the bag—it was about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning—that was about two hours and a quarter after I had brought it from the warehouse—I brought it out at about five minutes to nine—I had had some conversation with Cohen that morning about the manna—I saw him at his house at about eight o'clock—I asked him whether he could come and take the manna—he said, no; he could not carry so much for twenty guineas—I told him there was about a cwt.—that was what I guessed it at—I had not taken it out of the chest—one shilling a pound was to be given for it—Cohen stated that—I remember Mr. Bu<lb></lb>chanan coming to the warehouse that day—I told him of a robbery at the place—I had caused the window and rails to present that appearance, which I pointed out to Mr. Buchanan—what I told him about it was false—the officer was sent for—I was afterwards taken into custody.</p>

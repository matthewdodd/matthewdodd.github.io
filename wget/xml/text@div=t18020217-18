               <p>Q. Had you seen the shoes that day? - A. I hung them on the window myself; they were men's shoes; I hung them there about nine o'clock in the morning, and missed them at one o'clock the same day; I was informed by a person that I had been robbed; these are the shoes, (produces them;) I am quite confident they are my shoes; I bought them among a lot; I had not such another pair of shoes in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination. - Q. What is there remarkable in the shoes? - A. They are very badly made and closed; they are bad altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not swear there are not many others made like them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- MOREY sworn. - About one o'clock, while I was standing at my own shop, nearly opposite to the prosecutor's, I saw the prisoner at the bar standing at the corner of his window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Yes; he stood there under the appearance of making water; he had his head fixed in Mr. Smith's window; I saw him snatch, or cut the shoes from the window, put them under his coat and run away; he was perceived by me and another man, the other man followed him closer than I did; he threw the shoes away, the other man picked them up; I pursued him, but I did not take him till two nights following, Friday the 15th.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the shoes picked up when he threw them away? - A. Yes, immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether these are the shoes? - A. Yes, I marked them myself; I am sure these are the shoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination. - Q. You say, he was not taken till Friday the 15th? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him between Wednesday and Friday the 15th? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he taken? - A. The corner of Whitecross-street; Smith and I took him ourselves at the King's-arms public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the neighbourhood? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known him before - what is he? - A. I understand he is a carpenter, he said he lived somewhere about Old-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have no doubt about the person of the man? - A. None at all.</p>

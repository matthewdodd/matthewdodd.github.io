               <p>Q. Whose business was it that night to take care to secure the house? - It is my business, and I always make it my business to fasten my own windows up; I fastened them up the 5th of April, at eleven o'clock; we shut them up every night at eleven, except Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make your door fast then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon did you discover the robbery? - We did not discover at all till we were going to bed, a little after eleven, we discovered it unlocking the door, and going into the bed room and finding my drawers open and the window open.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is it from the ground? - I really cannot tell you. I fastened it down my own self, at five o'clock the 5th of April, and I found it up when I went to bed, my drawers were open, and my clothes were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your window fastened? - It was fastened by a little iron that hooked into an iron nut; there were no shutters at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was fast? - I am quite sure of it. I fastened it myself and afterwards went back to try if it was fast myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How late had you seen it safe? - I see it safe at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You say all your drawers were open? - No. Some of them. I missed my gowns, a black silk gown and coat, a brown silk gown, &amp;c. and several other things, part of my bed furniture.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any bank notes? - No, my husband had the bank notes unbeknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they undo this sash fastening? - I really cannot tell but I think they must force it open some how or other on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is your window from the ground? - It is a one pair of stairs window. I have no idea of the height.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the thirty pounds bank note again? - Yes, I have seen it since, but I have not seen the number, but only the value of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever seen the three hundred pounds one? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How lately had you seen these bank notes? - At four o'clock that afternoon, when I went up to shave myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the manner in which these persons had got in? - They got in at the window; the sash was up as high as it could be lifted.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is that window from the ground? - About ten feet.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the furniture of the room? - The drawers were all about the room, some of them on the bed, some on the toilet, some on the floor, some in one place, and some in another.</p>
               <p>Court. You say the window was about ten feet from the ground? - More than that, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Is the window facing the street? - It comes into Bethlem-court.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was this? - The 5th of April, Easter Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no alarm of this till your wife went up? - No, no alarm at all.</p>
               <p>Court. How did they get in? - I cannot tell. There is a little bow window, they trod on that, and there is irons to the lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they seen about there at all in the neighbourhood? - No, I cannot say that; I had seen them that evening.</p>
               <p>ARMSTRONG sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You belong to Worship street? - Yes. On Monday the 6th of April, at night, I went, in company with Ray,&amp;c, to a house in a place called Queen's square, or King's-square, in the neighbourhood of Brick-lane; there I found the four prisoners, in the lower apartment. I searched Wybrow, I found four guineas, which I returned him, I searched Skiving on, and found some money on him, which I returned him. On searching Mrs. Wybrow, or Phillips, I found a new five pounds bank note, and a guinea and a half. There was no money taken that night. I then went up stairs with Wybrow and the woman, and he put his hand in a basket, and took out this little box; there was nine guineas in it. I took that and kept it. One woman was taken into custody that night, two of the men, and Mrs. Wybrow. In the morning they were taken to the magistrate's, and I had orders to search him afterwards, which I did at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200147"></xptr>the office. In the morning of Easter Tuesday I went to the Bank, and, being a holiday, it was not open. I went to a number of linen drapers; at last I came to a Mr. James's, in Bishopsgate-street, and I asked them if they had changed a thirty pounds bank note? they said, they had. He went with me to Mr. Freeman, that lives in that neighbourhood, a hatter or an haberdasher, in Bishopsgate-street; and Mr. Freeman produced it. I then went and apprehended the other woman, and brought her to the office. I then had orders to research them. I searched Skivington, and he had only two guineas; and on Mrs. Skivington I found half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was it in King-square, Brick-lane? - Wybrow desired the place to be locked up, and the goods to be taken care of.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the other prisoner live? - I don't know; I never see him till that night, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. This thirty pounds note you have had in your custody ever since? - Yes, ever since the day it was delivered; it is marked on the back.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search him? - I did not. After a little information that Mr. Arm strong and I received, we went to the Bank, and being holiday time, we heard nothing about the notes there. We, according to a little information, went from the Bank to the different haberdasners and linen drapers in Bishopsgate-street, and that way, and we went to that linen draper where it was changed, and we went and apprehended Wybrow's sister afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q.What note was it? - A thirty pounds note. I have these things that I found at Wybrow's lodgings. This here property is the property of Wybrow's sister, that she bought at the time that she changed the thirty pounds note, and here is the other property I found in Wybrow's lodging, all new property, the property of the two young women at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Wybrow's sister? - Her name is Lee.</p>
               <p>Q. Who does the other belong to? - All the whole belongs to the two young women.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say it was her's? - Yes, I believe she did. Here is a counterpane taken from the lodgings: that never was owned by any body, but I was told to keep it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. These people were not all committed for a burglary, two for a burglary, and two for another offence? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a reward of forty pounds a piece for a burglary? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was Ray with you? - Yes, he was at finding these things at the lodging.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with the last witness at the lodgings of Wybrow? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see these things found? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us what you know of this matter? - I was in company with Armstrong, and two or three others of the public officers, on Monday the 6th of April. I went to the house of Wybrow, and searched the house, and in a closet, among some rubbish, I found two guineas wrapped up in a bit of paper. We secured the prisoners, and they were taken before the magistrate, on the Tuesday following. I was in the yard where they were locked up, in different lock-up-houses; I heard some conversation pass between the two prisoners in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200148"></xptr>public office in Worship-street. There are some lock-up-houses for prisoners be hind the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the conversation between? - Skivington and Wybrow.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know these men before? - I knew Wybrow perfectly well; I knew his voice perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons in these lock-up-houses but these two - There were not; they were in separate lock-up-houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they see each other? - No, they are situated one joined to the other. I heard Skivington say to Wybrow, provided it was not found out where the thirty pounds note was changed, all the rest of the property was quite safe. Skivington then said, they were gone to bone Joel. Wybrow made answer, and said, I am sure they don't know where he lives.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by boning of him? - Take him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood it so? - Yes, it is a word that is made use of very frequently. Skivington says, they will find him, and if they do, he will split; I imagine that is telling the truth, impeach.</p>
               <p>Q. After they said Joel would split, was there any other conversation? - Skivington said, that Harper and Armstrong were gone round to all the linen drapers, to see if they could find out where the small note was changed. Wybrow said, I hope they will not hit on the right; and there was some conversation about a cloak that were taken out of Wybrow's house. Wybrow said, that the landlord, White, seemed to own the cloak last night. Skivington said, no, Bill, you are wrong there; he did not, on account of his wife's not being there. Wybrow said, if he was examined before the magistrate, he could point out a thing in the cloak that they knew nothing at all about. Skivington said, my mother came to me in the watch-house; I gave her all the money that I had, except one half guinea. Skivington said, I told her that there were nine guineas, which his mother had agreed to come and swear it was her property before the magistrate the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any more conversation? - No, I believe that is all the conversation that I heard pass between them. I communicated it to the magistrate immediately I heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce any thing yourself? - Only the money that I found among the rubbish.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long have you been an officer at this Public office? - Nigh three years.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not recollect your ever coming here before to recollect conversation? - Yes, I did once.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the day did this pass? - It was in the forenoon; it might be between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. How are these lock-up-houses situated with regard to each other? - They join to each other.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any window that commu nicates to the wall of the two? - There is a window to each that looks into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q.There is no window between the partition of each? - No, there is a very thick partition that parts the lock-up-houses, and they are obliged to speak very loud, or else they cannot make one another understand.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards is this from the office itself? - It joins the office; there is a door that goes into the office only, it is a few steps, or else it is in a line.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any one of the justices sitting at this time? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. And I suppose as it almost always happens when the justice is sitting, a great number of people are in the justice room - In general there is a great number of people.</p>

            Is there any body else come to prove this conversation besides yourself? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. It did not disturb the justice as he was going on with the examination? - There were two doors that were shut.</p>
               <p>Q. But what I want to know is, whether the justice sent out to quiet these two noisy fellows, because you know they talked very loud, as you and I do now? - They did talk very loud.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what I want to know is this, whether the justice did not send out to quiet these two noisy fellows that disturb ed him while he was doing his business? - The justice if he had been on the bench, could not have heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you say that the door of this lock-up-place goes into the office itself? - No, I do not; there is a door opens, then there is another door, and then another door after that, before you go into the office.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a public house near this lock-up-house, a little nearer than the office? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. They could hear them in the public house plain enough? - No, there is a very high wall that is built.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you happen to be when this conversation took place. I was standing on the step of the passage door that comes out of the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was one of these doors removed? - But there were two after that.</p>
               <p>Q. But you describe three doors, you had opened one of the doors; they did not perceive you of course? - They did not.</p>
               <p>Q. As you found him going on, did you make any sign to any of your brother officers to come and hear this pretty story? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. That would have been unlucky, if any body else could have proved it as well as yourself, because you are a man of that character, that you don't want con firmation? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it depends on your single testimony? - What I have said is nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no reward in case if either these people are convicted - Yes, there is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reward in case Wybrow is convicted? - There is forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reward in case the other is convicted? - Just the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Just the same. Stroking the chin is a very easy thing. So this lucky conversation, you believe, will entitle you to eighty pounds reward? - Very likely part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. On the serious and solemn oath you have taken, do not you expect to receive a part of eighty pounds reward, if they are convicted; don't you expect to have a considerable part? - I might, it is left to the discretion of the Court, it lays entirely with the Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you expect that the evidence you have given will entitle you to part of that reward? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no manner of doubt about it? - As being a public officer, I cannot be unacquainted with it.</p>
               <p>Q.On your oath, had you any doubt about it at all when you told me very likely? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, good Mr. Ray, it was no secret that the officers were gone round to search the linen drapers? - No, I did not know they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. But they informed you when they came home what they had been out upon? - I communicated it to the magistrate, and before the face of Wybrow and Skivington.</p>
               <p>Q. You were with Harper and Armstrong before you gave this evidence against these people? - Undoubtedly I was. I was there the next morning after they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200150"></xptr>Q. You knew they were gone to the Bank to make inquiries? - They were not gone to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.You had been with these people before they had been at the Bank? - In the morning we met at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not you know they were gone about the thirty pounds bank note? - I did not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you consult together what you were to do about this? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.If the two other women who are indicted with them are convicted, there is eighty pounds more to be divided among you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, does not that yard which you go through to put their people into the lock-up-houses, belong to the public house just by? - There are three ways to the yard. It belongs to the office; there is a yard belongs to the public house; but this yard belongs to the office, no one can go in it but the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Any persons who were in the public house yard had just the same opportunity of hearing as you had? - I cannot say that. I stood nearer than the people of the public house could stand any way.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body may come out as far as that door from the public house? - They might.</p>
               <p>Q. And they were speaking so loud, that you heard them through the door? - No, I don't say so, I said there was a window to each lock-up-house, and I heard them from the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you wonder that these men who were giving such material evidence spoke so loud on the occasion? - It is not to be wondered at at all when there is nobody else in the lock-up-houses.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were the two windows from each other? - I suppose about five or six yards from window to window.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there being only an occasion to convey the voice five or six yards off from the lock-up-house in which Wybrow was. Yet they were speaking as loud as people could speak? - Yes, or else they could not understand one another.</p>
               <p>Q. So then these people were hallooing from the bottom of the den. They did not take the precaution to get up to the window? - I did not say they were hallooing they were talking very loud, and the instant I did hear what they said, I communicated it to Mr. Colquohon, one of our magistrates. They talked much louder than the ordinary way, and then they stopped three or four minutes before they went on again, and they now and then called out, Bill, which they spoke very loud.</p>
               <p>Q.What persons did you see come out of the public house? - I could not see any person coming out of the public house, it is impossible for me to tell, for there is a high brick wall that parts this yard from the public house yard. In some places nine or ten feet, in other places it is seven feet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was there any in this yard besides yourself? - No, nor no other persons in the lock-up-houses but themselves.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they know you were there? - No they did not.</p>

             came up to our house, I cannot recollect the hour when he came up; he walked to and fro, and said that he heard that these people that stand at the bar now were in custody, and asked us if we would go down to the office to see them; Joel said, if it was so he was very sorry for it, and he would give them a shilling or two if it lay in his power. Accordingly we went and did not see them that day. Three of the officers of Worship-street after that came, Mr. Harper, Mr. Armstrong, and another gentleman, I don't know his name. On Saturday we went up to see them; we were detained and sent to gaol, I and Cox, on suspicion that we knew something about this affair; but I was discharged when I came up for reexamination. When I came up on Wednesday I was discharged, and she said she would go and speak to the magistrate, and see if she could not get discharged; she went in and staid for about two hours and half; she was not discharged. I went the next day to her; she did not tell me any thing of the affair. I think she came up again on Wednesday following; I was there, and I stopped for about two hours, and I asked her what she had been about? and she said she would hang jack Skivington by fair means or by soul, because he would not cohabit with her.</p>

               <p>Court. Take care what you are about. Who was present? - Nobody. She called me into a little room, and asked me to give her something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with her? - Four years, off and on. I am an engine winder by trade.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you know in point of fact, whether she ever has been a witness in this court before? - No, not to my knowledge. (A ribbon shewn her) About a fortnight before this affair, Cox took this ribbon and put it about her head for a fillet.</p>
               <p>Court. You know this woman for four years intimately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Knew her affairs and secrets? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How does she get her bread? - By prostitution.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get your bread? - In the same way; but since I have been in trouble I have thought better of my way of life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Who did you live with at the time that Tomlinson was tried? - One Stacey.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he a witness against Tomlinson? - I don't know. I was taken with the man; and when I found what he was, I mended my way of life. I think it is about six or seven months ago, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have lived particularly with nobody since? - No, nobody at all; I have now mended my way of life. I come up here now from Gravesend.</p>

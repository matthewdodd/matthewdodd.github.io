I saw the prisoner, on the 14th of July, carrying a sack of malt; I met him in what we call the side warehouse, at the top of the stairs - he was about fifty yards from Mr. Tomkins' warehouse; the prisoner had been employed by me and the foreman of the lower granary, but he was not on that day - I asked him where he was going with it; he said he did not know, but Tom gave it him, meaning a man in Mr. Parker's employ; Tom was by his side at the time, and I heard him say to the prisoner, "Cut down with it;" meaning for him to make haste - I put my hand on the sack, and the prisoner pitched it down - I was going to untie it, and Tom Collins said,"It is only a bit of sweepings," by which I understood what is generally swept up for fowls - Tom Collins then went down stairs, and I have never seen him since; the prisoner staid there - I found the sack contained four bushels of clean malt; I showed the same to Mr. Tomkins about a fortnight afterwards; it is in the warehouse now- the prisoner had worked there two or three months, when we wanted hands.</p>

            . I was on the wharf as foreman. I met the prisoner, and asked what was in the sack - he was speechless, and turned as white as ashes; it was Mr. Parker's sack - Collins said it was sweepings; I said I would see what it was - they had no business there either of them; I went to the office, and while I was gone they both started.</p>

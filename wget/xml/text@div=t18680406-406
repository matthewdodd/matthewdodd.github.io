                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, of 50, Sidney Street, Stepney—on the morning of 2nd April, at 12.45, I was in Wellington Street, London Bridge, returning from my daughter's—I was quite sober—when I had passed the steps leading to the church in Wellington Street, I was suddenly seized from behind by the neck, not with violence, but I was thrown down with much violence—I did not see who seized me—I struggled to get up, and in the struggle I saw Cockrane holding my throat, and Smith in front of me, pulling my coat open and rifling my pockets—I had in my left breast pocket some extraordinarily particular documents connected with the House of Commons, which I grieve most particularly about—I also lost a pocket-book and a watch—Smith took the things, Cockrane simply got hold of me—no further violence was used to me—Smith said something, and they immediately got up and left me, and when I heard his voice again I recognized it—Elizabeth Powell and a young man then approached me from the other side, and the prisoners quickly got up and ran away—I saw that it was futile to run after them, and Eliza Powell and a young man assisted us over London Bridge—a cabman drove up and said something—I got into his cab, and he drove me to where I found the prisoners in custody—they were as near as possible at the corner of St. Thomas' Street, Borough—I had seen their faces by the gas lamp—Cockrane had a plaid scarf round his neck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cockrane</hi>. You could not recognise me when you drove up; you said, "I think it is he, because he has got a plaid scarf on." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 1, Ford's Place, Battersea—on 2nd April, about 12.45 in the morning, I was in Wellington Street, and saw Cockrane take hold of Mr. Ulrick and pull him backwards on the stones;—while he was holding him Smith pulled his coat open and rifled his pockets—when they saw me running across the road they both ran, and Cockrane had a black and white scarf on—it lasted a very few seconds—a man that was standing in the middle of the road gave a signal, I think, and one ran under the railway arch, and the other two in the other direction—that is near the Borough Market—I am sure of Cockrane more than I am of Smith, as the light shone so bright in his face; and I firmly believe Smith to be the other—I went up to Mr. Ulrick, who was lying on his back on the pavement and seemed exhausted—he could not speak for a minute—he afterwards walked with me a little way—a cab drove up—I got into it, and drove to the station, where I saw the prisoners; but I had seen them in custody, in Thames Street, outside a public-house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cockrane</hi>. When I came up to the cab your friend was in the cab; the policeman said, "Are these the two?" you said to your friend, "I think that is one, by his scarf;" and you said, "I can't recognize him." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. That is false.</p>

I am a cab driver, of 1, Saunders Street, Lambeth Walk—on 2nd April, about 12.45, I was standing near St. Saviour's Church, and heard a man's voice in distress—I turned and saw Ulrick on the ground, and the prisoner and another one roughly handling him—Cockrane had hold of him behind, and Smith in front—after they had got what they wanted, they tripped him up, and ran away—they threw him on the ground after they had got what they wanted—one of them took the South-Eastern Line, and the other went in the direction of St. George's Church—Cockrane went into a public-house, at the corner of York Street, Borough Market—Smith was on the other side, St. Thomas' Street side—I followed with my cab—I lost sight of Smith for a minute or two; but never lost sight of Cockrane—I drove up to the door of the public-house, but did not like to leave my horse to go in—I saw Cockrane come out—Smith was then standing on the other side of the road; and he whistled to Cockrane, who crossed the road and joined him directly—Burcher, the constable, was a few yards off—I made a communication to him, and with assistance he took the prisoners—I went back to fetch the old man and the girl—it was the man who is not here who took the South-Eastern Line—the public-house Cockrane went into is about 100 yards from where Ulrick was assaulted.</p>

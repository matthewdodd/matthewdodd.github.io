                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife; he is a milliner; we lived together at No. 2, Tabernacle-row, St. Luke's. On Saturday evening, 3rd Nov., about 6 o'clock, I went to the house of Mrs. Quarrel, in Baldwin-street, accompanied by Mrs. Elsworth, a friend of mine—directly we went in, Mrs. Quarrel laid the cloth for us, to have some refreshment—she placed some knives on the table—we were about to sit down to take some refresh ment, when my husband came up stairs very quickly, and came into the room—I do not think he spoke—I said, "Oh, here is M'Intosh!"—he ran across the room to me, as I was sitting on the sofa, and struck me on the head, and stunned me—he only struck me with his hand—he had nothing in his hand—when I recovered my senses, I was lying on the floor, bleeding from my head—a medical man was sent for—I had two of my fingers cut rather badly—they are quite well now—I have no recollection how they became cut—my husband was very much intoxicated—the wounds are quite well now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Elsworth, a boot binder, in Britannia-street, City-road. I accompanied Mrs. M'Intosh to Mrs. Quarrel's, about half past 6 o'clock, on 3rd Nov.—we went up to her room, on the first floor—after we had been there some time, the cloth was laid,</p>

               <p>some knives were put on the table, and we were about to take some refresh<lb></lb>ment, when the prisoner came up the stairs, gave the door a push, and nearly stumbled into the room—he came very quickly—he rushed towards the couch where Mrs. M'lntosh was sitting, and gave her a violent blow on the head—he then took up a knife and struck me across the nose, and said, "You b—b—s, I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for the pair of you"—I got to the door as fast as I could, and when I was coming out of the room I saw him in the act of going with a knife to his wife—he was very close to her—the blow he gave me with the knife cut my nose slightly, and gave me a black eye—I ran down stairs, very much frightened, and called for the police—I came back in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and found Mrs. M'Intosh bleeding from the forehead, and the doctor was there dressing her wounds—I distinctly saw a knife in the prisoner's hand—I saw him take it from the table.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined Q.</hi> Was he drunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he was—he had no knife when he struck his wife the first blow—I did not see him strike her with a knife at all—I only saw him going to her with the knife—I saw him take up the knife after striking her the first blow.</p>

Mrs. M'Intosh and Mrs. Elsworth came to my house on this evening—I had just put the table ready to give them some refresh<lb></lb>ment, and was leaving the room again, and met the prisoner coming up the stairs—he was not coming very quickly, I believe—when I returned to the room I found Mrs. M'Intosh lying on the floor, apparently insensible, and bleeding from the back of her head—I picked up a knife—there was one little spot of blood upon it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of No. 3, Brunswick-place, City-road. I was called to Mrs. Quarrel's house, and found the prosecutrix sitting on the floor—she was wounded in the forehead and fingers, and also on the back of her head—the wound on the forehead was a stab wound—it went to the bone—it corresponded in size to the shape of this knife—(<hi rend="italic">two knives were produced, both broken</hi>)—it was just the breadth of the blade—it was bleeding—it was not a dangerous wound—there were wounds on three of the fingers—they were incised wounds—they were severe, but not very severe—they were on the back of the fingers—these knives would produce such wounds—the wound at the back of the head was a swelling, nearly the size of an egg, and on the centre of that was a small wound—it might have been done by the fist, or contact with any hard substance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined Q.</hi> The wound on the forehead you say was to the bone; that would be about one-eighth of an inch, would it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A quarter of an inch—there was no contusion round it—it was a clean wound—I do not think, if the blow had been violent, it would have produced a greater effect, considering the hard structure of the frontal bone—it was not fractured—a blow inflicted with all the force a man could use might fracture the skull—the wound was unquestionably inflicted with the knife in this state, not pointed—the knife is square and blunt, and it exactly corresponded with the size of the wound—I do not think the wound on the back of the head could have been inflicted with the knife fully pointed—the wound on the fingers could not have broken the knife—I think that wound must have been inflicted at the same time as the other—probably the hand was raised to protect the face, and it fell on the forehead—I think the point must have been broken first.</p>

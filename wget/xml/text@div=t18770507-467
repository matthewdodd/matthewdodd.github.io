I live at Hawley Terrace, New Cross—on Easter Monday and Tuesday I was assistant barman to Mr. Burgess, at the Prince Arthur public—house, Greenwich Road—the male prisoner also acted as assistant barman—it is a large bar, there are four or five tills in it—when change is required it is taken from the tills, the gold is taken from behind—during the Monday I observed the female prisoner come in and out several times—on the Tuesday I made a communication to my master and watched—that was from what I had observed on the Monday—I had told the pri<lb></lb>soner on the Monday that he was doing something wrong, and he made a laugh of it, and walked away—on the Tuesday I kept observation on the prisoner—between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening I saw the female pri<lb></lb>soner at the bar with a small stone bottle, she called for half a quartern of gin—I directed my attention to her carefully—while George Woods was getting the gin to serve her she put a sixpence on the counter, the male prisoner picked it up, put it in the till, and gave her two shillings and some bronze—she took up the money and went away with the gin.</p>

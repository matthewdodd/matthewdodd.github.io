                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 653). On 20th February, from informa<lb></lb>tion I received, I went to Tyler's Market, at three o'clock in the afternoon, and into Mr. Andred's counting-house, which joins Messrs. Venables'—they are divided by a wooden partition—I made a hole in the partition, and waited there till ten o'clock at night—I then heard the gate at the entrance to the market unlocked, also the door of the counting-house—I saw, through the hole in the partition, the prisoner with a lighted match—I saw him light several other matches—I saw him open a drawer in the counting-house with a key, and take out some money—I then heard him lock the drawer and the counting-house door—I then passed out of the counting-house into the shop, and I heard the prisoner talking to someone,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186802240039"></xptr>
               <p>but I did not know who—I had seen two men at the Warwick Lane en<lb></lb>trance to the market—I allowed him to walk a short distance from the shop, and then I jumped over the gates—they were not firm, and shook about a good deal, and. the prisoner ran out of the market into Warwick Lane—I stopped him just outside the market—I told him I should take him into custody for entering and stealing money from Messrs. Venables' counting-house—he said, "Emery, you have made a mistake, I was in Sketchley's Place"—I took him to the station, and searched him, and found a pound of sausages, threepence in coppers, and three marked sixpences—I had known him as assistant watchman in the market for some time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there a gaslight burning opposite Venables' counting-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not notice any—there are a great many gas-lights in the market—I did not see him take any key from the ledge in the counting-house—the place was dark till he lighted the match—I saw him open the till and take money out—he had his hand closed over the money—he only had a light occasionally—he had a light when he opened the drawer—I had been in the place all the afternoon, and had not moved—I did not go round to him when he unlocked the drawer because I should have made a noise, and he would have made some excuse—I should have had to go about fifteen yards—I did not move till I heard the gate locked—I had to jump over a gate—I saw two men outside, and I asked the prisoner to assist me to stop one of them, as they seemed in a great hurry to get away—I did not see anybody but the prisoner in the counting-house—I kept hold of him and we ran a few yards—I believe one of the men was the prisoner's brother, and the other a man named Groves—I took no steps to take the other men—I did not search the place, it wan locked, and I could not get in—I did not go in the morning—I had never been on duty there before—I did not know that it was the watchmen's duty to watch the counting-house, and see if there was anybody about—I was in<lb></lb>structed that he had no right in the counting-house—I did not cough when I was watching, I am sure of that; I was as quiet as I possibly could be—I did not hear them come up the market; there was sawdust on the floor, and you could not hear anybody walking.</p>

                  </hi>.

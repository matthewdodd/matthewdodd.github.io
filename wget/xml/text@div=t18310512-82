On Saturday, I think the 16th of April, in consequence of information, I left my shop, and went after the prisoner; I came up with her twelve or thirteen doors from my house - I said,"What have you got?" she said, Nothing - I said, "Yes you have, for the good lady saw you take something from my door;" while I was talking I saw her throw down two pairs of sleeves which are my property - I took them up, and had her taken into custody; we sell them in the trade at 8d. a pair - I had seen them safe on the door-post three or four minutes before.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL PRICE. These are mine - they could not have fallen unless they had been unhooked off the nail; when I took the prisoner she said she had neither father not mother, and had not broken her fast all day - I have made inquiry; she bears an excellent character, and is in great want.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character, and two persons offered to take care of her.</p>

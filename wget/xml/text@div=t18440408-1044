The prisoner was in my service two years and a half, as under-housemaid—on the 5th of April I missed three half-sovereigns from my dressing-table—I called my sister who fetched the prisoner form the room above—I sent for a policeman, and said I would have her searched—she said, she hoped the policeman would not search her, she had no objection to my two sisters searching her—after they had retired, my sister called out, that she had found one half-sovereign.</p>

               <p>went with her into the next room—in taking off her dress, she was a long while in taking one hand out of the sleeve, and she kept her hand closed—I said, "Ann, you have something in your hand"—she changed it into the other hand, and brought that hand forward—I said, "Put both hands forward"—something fell from her—I said, "That is the half-sovereign"—she said, "No, it is the sixpence which I told you I had"—she had pre<lb></lb>viously said, she only had sixpence—I picked it up, and it was a half-sovereign—I went with her into the drawing-room, and saw the policeman take two more half-sovereigns from her hair at the back of her head.</p>

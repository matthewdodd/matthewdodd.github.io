                  </hi>. My father's name is Emanuel Benjamin; he is a clothier in Whitecross-street. About half-past two o'clock, on the afternoon of the 19th of April, I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner pass, with the cap now produced on his head—I went to the cap stand, and missed a cap from the side of the door, not outside exactly, nor inside—I had seen it safe half an hour before—I am sure this is my father's cap.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you not tell the inspector you did not wish to. press the charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not recollect his telling you to go away—you refused to go, because you did not have the cap—I brought three caps before the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate, of the same make and pattern—the Magistrate said they were dif<lb></lb>ferent—the lining was second-hand—I have no private mark on this cap—there are plenty like it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) The prisoner said it was his own cap; he had bought it of a Jew in the street some time ago; he had bad it a fortnight, and could produce witnesses that saw him wear it—I was directed by the Magistrate to go with him, to Flower and Dean-street, where he said he lived—When we got outside the court, he said he would not go, it was no use, he did not wish to go.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

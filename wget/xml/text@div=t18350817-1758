                  </hi>. I am a grazier, and live at March, in Cambridge<lb></lb>shire. The prisoner was a drover, in my employ for many years—he took beasts to London, and sometimes received the money, which he brought to me, or paid to the agents of the Wisbeach Bank—on the 13th of April, I sent him to London with some beasts—he returned on the Tuesday or Wednes<lb></lb>day following, and left this market-bill at my house—here is written upon it "99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," stated to he the balance; and against that is written "Wis<lb></lb>beach Bank"—I believe it is the prisoner's writing—it is written over the word "Ditto," which had been written there before—from the words "Wis<lb></lb>beach Bank," I expected it had been paid to the agents of the Wisbeach Bank, in London.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not direct him to demand the money from Hill as Green's bankers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never did—I did not tell him to write to say that Corthorn had no authority to receive money—I told him to write, to make some inquiry about the money—I did not know that I mentioned Hill—I desired him to write somebody—I expect he did write to Hill—I believe I desired him to write.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not for the purpose of getting your money from Hill or Green that you desired your attorney to write to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I expected the money was somewhere—I had nothing to do with Hill or Green—as soon as I found I was <hi rend="italic">minus</hi>, I gave my attorney instructions to write to London, to endeavour to find where the money; was and what had become of it—it was not to make a claim of the money; it was to know what had become of it—I did not know who had it—I judged the pirsoner had had it, from "Wisbeach Bank" being written over the word "Ditto."</p>

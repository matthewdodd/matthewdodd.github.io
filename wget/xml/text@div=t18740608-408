                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 281). On 30th April I saw Romer, the prosecutor, come out of the Bremen Flag in St. George's Street—the prisoner followed him out, and made a stroke at his right side—I had not seen Romer do anything to him—he went down on his hands and knees,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187406080020"></xptr>
               <p>and as he was getting up the prisoner struck him again, and he called out "I am stabbed"—I saw him bleeding from his left side—I laid hold of the prisoner, who said "I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, and I will do it again; here is the knife I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it with," handing me this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his pocket—I took him to the station, he had been drinking, but was not drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—Romer was brought in on 30th April, and I found an incised wound on the left side of his abdomen three-quarters of an inch long, but not very deep, and a slight scratch on his left shoulder—I did not probe the wound, but I think it penetrated the abdominal cavity—it might have been very dangerous, and he will have to wear a belt for some time—this knife would inflict it—he was twenty days in the hospital.</p>

One word brought on another, and he wanted me to fight and pulled his jacket off. I tried to go out the back way, but could not; and when I came back he was standing at the door with the knife in his hand. As I was taking it away from him we both fell, and that is how he got cut. When I struck him on the arm there was no knife in my hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Charlton-street on the night of Christ<lb></lb>mas-day between eleven and twelve o'clock, and saw the police taking a Spaniard into custody in that street—the two prisoners, and a great many more, were ill-treating the police—they were hitting them with sticks and bludgeons, and attempting to get the other away that the police had got in custody—I went to the assistance of the police, and took hold of a stick that one of them had got to hit the police with—I wrestled with that person, and prevented him from hitting the police—we struggled together, and went down—he said something in Spanish, which I did not understand, and three more came to his assistance—I was fighting with them I dare say for pretty nearly twenty yards, fighting among the four of them,</p>

               <p>trying to sure them—they came to drag me off him, and I got up again—we were fighting together for nearly twenty yards up Charlton-street—I hold of the two prisoners—we struggled and went down together—the other two went away—while I was on the ground with these two I received different cuts, one on the right side of the head, and another on the left, which divided the ear—my coat collar was cut through, and part of the breast—this is the coat—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—they were deep cuts—finding I was cut, and the blood beginning to run down my face, I said, "Good God! is there never an Englishman among you; to see me used in this way, and render me no assistance?"—a voice replied, "Yes, here is one"—it was the policeman Madden, who had got another of the Spaniards in custody—Garcia struggled and got away from me, and Madden came and pulled Assension away, and I assited in taking him to the station—I am sure that I received the cuts from one Or other of the prisoners while I was on the ground—they both struck me while we were struggling together, and I received the cut from one or other in the course of the struggle—I showed the cuts to Mr. Parker, a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 186.) I was Charlton-street on Christmas night, and Was called to the Victoria public-house by Mr. Viles, the landlord—I found there from twelve to fourteen Spaniards—they were drinik—they called for liquor, he refused to serve them, and he called on me to take one of them into custody for' assaulting him with this stick winch I produce, and creating a disturbance in the house—I took him into custody—if was neither of the prisoners—the other Spaniards struggled very much to get him away—When I got him into the street one of them spoke to the others for their language, which I did not understand, and they all surronded me to rescue tne prisoner—police-constables Manser and Relly came up—five of the Spaniards struck Kelly, and pushed him into a doorway—I struggled with my prisoner 100 yards down the street, and when I had got that distance, or it might be more, heard Thurman cry out "Murder!' and say, "Is there never an Englishman that will come to my assistance?"—I said, "Yes, here is one"—I struggled with the I prisoner I hadf in custody, and got him across the road—I found the prosecutor on his back, and Assension on him—I laid hold of Assension's collor with my left hand and rose him up—Thurman's face was all over blood—Assension's shirt was torn, and tere was blood on it and on the cuffs of his coat—I could not see where</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184501060040"></xptr>
               <p>Garcia was at that time—he was taken afterwards—with Thurman's assist<lb></lb>ance I took Assension and the prisoner I had in custody to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Assension.</hi> They must be mistaken, or they have sworn falsely about I my being over him; it is true that his face was over blood, but that was I from a blow I had received in the struggle; it was my own blood from my I nose, and the blood on my cuffs was from wiping my nose; I was first I taken prisoner by Madden, who held me by one arm, and another police-man came and took charge of me; I never thought of saving myself, but I went straight to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not let him go after taking him off Thurman—I kept him all the way to the station, except about a minute, when the reserve policeman came up, and held him while I got my breath, and then I took him again—I was out of breath—that was in Phoenix-street, only a few yards from the station-house door—Thurman had hold of him at the same time, and never let loose of him.</p>
               <p>

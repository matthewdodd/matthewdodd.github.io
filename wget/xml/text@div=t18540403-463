                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 325). On Sunday morning, 19th March, about half past 5 o'clock, I found the prisoner inside a counting house at No. 9, Love-lane, Eastcheap—what first attracted my attention was, I found the door open; I went in, and found the prisoner lying down inside the door, in the counting house—I could not see him before I went in—he was lying down behind the door, so that I could not go in without moving him; I took him into custody—when I moved him he pretended to be asleep—he said he was not going to strike me—I took him to the station—I knew him by his being in Billingsgate market—he was lying down, and had this coat thrown over his shoulders—I had tried the outer door of the house about 3 o'clock, or half past 3, and it was then safe—I have since examined that door, and found marks on it, as if it had been forced by some sort of an instrument—I should say the marks were made by this instrument (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I found nothing on the prisoner.</p>

I went to No. 9, Love-lane on the morning in question, about 6 o'clock, I found the outer door open; I went in, and saw the inner door bearing marks of having been violently forced open—I found this piece of iron on the premises—I believe it is used for some purpose by fishmongers—I found it on the mantel piece, which is across the room, about seven or eight feet from the door—I tried it to the marks, and it fitted exactly—I found papers strewed about in great con<lb></lb>fusion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. William Sproston; his counting house is at No. 9, Love-lane, Eastcheap. The outer door of that house is used by other persons besides my master and his servants—his counting house is on the ground floor—I was the last person at the counting house on the night of Saturday, 18th March—I shut it up, and left it secure about 8 o'clock—I locked the counting house door with a key; I pulled the outer door to after me; it shut itself with a spring lock—other persons who have access to the place have a key of it—when I looked the counting house the desks were quite safe; they were locked too—the papers were in the desks; there were no papers left about—this piece of iron was not in the counting house on the Saturday night—I know the prisoner by sight, by working in Billingsgate-market; he jobs at one place and another, as a sort of porter——I know this coat; it is the property of William Sproston, Jun.—it was on a chair in the counting house when I shut the counting house up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How do you know the coat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a pilot coat, and lined with plaid—young Mr. Sproston is quite well; he is not here—I know the coat; I paid for it—I bought it at the corner of Philpot-lane—I cannot say exactly how long ago—there is no mark on it—it is like the one I bought for young Mr. Sproston.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this piece of iron used in your trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is used for opening barrels of salt fish and herrings—our warehouse is a few yards from the counting house—I have never seen the prisoner use such an iron as this—this is not ours—it is common in Billingsgate-market.</p>

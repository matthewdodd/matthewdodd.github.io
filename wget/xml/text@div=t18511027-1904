                  </hi>. I am a carpenter and builder, of 3, Eastling-plaee, Harrow-road. On Saturday evening, 13th Sept., I was at the <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Jonson, and saw the prisoner there in the parlour—I went there shortly after 9 o'clock, and found him there—he was endeavouring to <hi rend="italic">kick</hi> up a disturbance with two or three people—two of them were brothers, named Robinson—he appeared very quarrelsome, and challenged one of them to fight—in about three-quarters of an hour the landlord came in; and by dint of perseverance of the company to make the prisoner quiet, he was quiet—the persons removed to the other side of the room out of his way, the two Robinsons, and two gentlemen named Holmes and Rogers—after a short time the prisoner followed them—they would not make room on the seat, and he stood in front of the seat, and threatened and challenged them to fight—the landlord requested the prisoner to go out, took his glass from his hand, and took it to the bar expecting him to follow it, but he did not; and the landlord came in again, put his band gently on his shoulder, and put him out of the room—the landlord was absent about a minute—on his return he was moving the table to get past a gentle<lb></lb>man, when the prisoner rushed in with the glass in his hand, and struck the landlord with it on the forehead with all his might, and cut his forehead very much, and his own hand in three or four places—the glass was smashed all to pieces, except the bottom part—it was a large grog-glass—the landlord fell on the table, and was assisted by the company—I secured the prisoner till a policeman came—he said he did not intend to do it, and wished me to let him go—the blow appeared to me to be done on purpose, decidedly—he said he did not intend to do anything, and if he had done anything he was sorry.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor and army clothier, carrying on business, in partnership with my son, at 35, Savile Row—I know the prisoner Austin Bidwell by the name of Warren, and Macdonnell by the name of Swift—I recollect their calling upon me in April, I believe about the 18th, with another person, to order some clothes—it is my practice, when persons call to order clothes, to ask them to sign a book, which I produce—the two prisoners signed theirs, Austin Bidwell as F. A. Warren, and Macdonnell as Edward R. Swift, both of 21, Enfield Road, Haggerstone; the third person, I believe, did not sign, I don't recollect him; he was introduced by the name of Siebert—I made them a considerable quautity of clothes—on the 4th of May the same two prisoners called again in a cab,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180006"></xptr>
               <p>and I think with a third party, but that I won't swear—they tried on the clothes I had made for them—we entered into conversation, and I under<lb></lb>stood them to say they were going to visit Ireland; they did not say when; they had a eab at the door, with luggage on it, and they said they were in a hurry to catch the train; I understood that they were going to Birming<lb></lb>ham first, then to Liverpool, and from Liverpool to Ireland—in the course of conversation Austin Bidwell said he had more money than he thought it prudent to leave at his lodging or hotel—I said "Is it of any amount?"—he said "Yes, it is some amount"—I think he said about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that being the case, I declined to take charge of it, and said "I should recommend you to deposit it with some bank; my banker's is close at hand"—he said "We have very little time to spare, we are in a hurry to get a train"—I said "It will not take you long; I can take you down there"—I then accompanied him to the Western Branch of the Bank of England, where I kept an account—I saw Mr. Fenwick, the sub-manager—Mr. Pimm was the manager at that time, he was then absent—I introduced Austin Bidwell to Mr. Fenwick, describing him as an American gentleman and a customer of mine, and that he had a certain sum of money that he wished to deposit—I think I mentioned his name as Warren—he was alone with me—the signature-book was then brought for him to write his name and address—I think Mr. Fenwick asked how he was to be described, and he said as an agent, I think—he handed the money to Mr. Fenwick—I think I was present when he signed the book—Mr. Fenwick gave him a cheque<lb></lb>book—he said that more money would be remitted to him in the course of a week, I think 1,000<hi rend="italic">I.</hi>, and how should he manage, should it come through me—Mr. Fenwick replied that there was no occasion for that now, as he had opened the account there was no occasion to trouble me—we then returned to Savile Row, and the three parties left in the cab; at all events, Austin Bidwell and Macdonnell did—I fancy I saw them afterwards two or three times at our place of business—I sent the clothes to the address they gave—the first order went to Enfield Road, Haggerstone.</p>

I cannot, without referring, tell when it was that I first saw Austin Bidwell, it was in April, at all events, when he gave the order for the clothes; he was measured at that time—on 4th May he came to try them on—his name was put in my book before the 4th May; we made the entry from his dictation; here is his signature, which he wrote himself, "F. A. Warren, 21, Enfield Road, Haggerstone"—there is no date put—I cannot tell you when that signature was written—the first time he came he was in company with Macdonnell; I won't swear that there was anyone else at that time, or on 4th May, but I fancy there was; yes, I think there was—there was more than one person with him when he came on 4th May, and when we came back from the bank there was more than one person waiting for him—when I was examined before I don't think I mentioned any other person but Swift as waiting for him—I don't think I suggested to him to put the money in my bank—he wanted to leave it with me, and I suggested that I should not like to have so much money left with me, and he had better put it into the bank—I introduced the name of the banker to him—I told him that the bank was in Burlington Gardens, close by, and then he said he would go with me to the bank—the principal part of the money he handed over was bank notes—he gave the same name at the bank that he had given to me—I had seen him more than once before the 4th May.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now, and was in May last year, the sub agent of the Bank of England at the Western Branch in Burlington Gardens—Mr. Green was a customer of oars at that time—I recollect his coming to the Bank on 4th May with a strange person; it was the prisoner Austin Bidwell—he was introduced by Mr. Green as Mr. Warren, an American gentleman, who had a considerable amount of money which he wanted taken care of—I inquired of Austin Bidwell his name, and he said "Warren"—the signature-book was produced, this is it, and he wrote this "F. A. Warren"—I asked him to write his name in full, and he then wrote "Frederick Albert Warren"—they are both here—he gave his address "Golden Cross Hotel"—he wrote that himself—I asked him how I should describe him; he did not give me an answer exactly at once; he then gave me to under<lb></lb>stand that he was over here on business—I can't remember his exact words—he said he had acted more as an agent for others than for himself—I said "Then shall I describe you as a commission agent?" and he said "Yes"—I entered his description in our ledger—he opened the account with a sum of 1, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him a cheque-book—the numbers in it were Q R 16, 501 to 16, 550, to bearer—this credit-slip was made out at the time; I wrote it in his presence—I said a pass-book should be prepared for him, and be ready when he called—I believe he afterwards called for it—he said he should have more money to pay in, and he asked me if it must come through Mr. Green—I told him that was not necessary—after that I did not transact much business with him myself—I remember seeing him on 17th January this year, at the Bank, in the agent's room—Colonel Francis, the agent and manager, was there at the time—after a little conversation about various incidental matters, he threw down this bill of Rothschild's for 4, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the agent's table, and said "There, I suppose that is good enough paper for you"—he spoke on that occasion about his business, about sleeping cars; he said that he hoped to see the sleeping-cars introduced shortly abroad, so that our English tourists might use them in going to the Exhibition at Vienna—he also stated that he had the choice of three different factories at Birmingham, and that he was going there at once, and he hoped to commence business by the 1st February—he mentioned also a patent break, and also a signal light for placing in front of the engines—when he put down the bill, he asked to have it discounted—Colonel Fraser acceded to his request—that was a genuine bill, and was subsequently paid—his account continued at the Bank until 1st March—I think his pass<lb></lb>book was sent to him once before that; we never received it back—when it was sent to him it contained all the paid cheques up to the date of making up the pass-book, as is our custom—we have some credit-slips here made</p>

               <p>out in his handwriting, between May and August, 1872—it is the practice for a customer to sign when he receives a cheque-book—Warren received two cheque-books; he received the second on 3rd January—that was one hundred cheques, payable to order, Nos. Q Q 82, 801 to 82, 900—I have the cheque signature-book here, with his signature, "F. A. Warren" on both occasions, 4th May, 1872, and 3rd January, 1873—we put down the letters and numbers of the cheque in the book.</p>

               <p>down in my room—in the course of conversation he told me generally what he had come over to England for; he said that he had come over to introduce sundry American inventions, first and foremost among which was the sleeping oars, and some other inventions, but that was the principal one—he also spoke about a steam break, and I asked him some particulars about it which he declined to tell me, as it was a secret—he said he hoped to have the cars running on the line between Paris and Vienna, so that all the visitors at the forthcoming Exhibition might make use of them, and that no country in future would be able to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> without them; that he hoped afterwards to introduce a Company for the same purpose into England, and that then he hoped to have a good account at the Branch—but I understood him to say that at that time he was simply wishing to introduce them on this foreign line, from Paris to Vienna—he said he was going to work at Birmingham—I don't think anything more was said about Birmingham at that time; that was the substance of the conversation—he told me that he came from America, and there was no doubt of it—the sleeping ears are American cars—I undertook to take charge of the 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Portuguese bonds for him, and filled up one of our forms and he signed it in my presence—this is it—it is simply a request to hold, it is an office voucher for us, he signed it in my presence: "London, 3rd September, 1872. The cashiers of the Bank receive and hold the undermentioned securities amounting to 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of F. A. Warren. Securities, 43 Portuguese 3 per cent, amount 8,000."—on 4th of September I saw him again, he brought some more 3 per cent Portuguese bonds, 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nominal value—he said that he wished to have the whole sold, and he fixed a limit upon them, 41 3/4 I think it was.—I undertook to sell them for him—I wrote out one of our usual requests and he signed it in my presence; "4th September, 1872. To the agent of the Bank of England, Western Branch. Sir, please sell 12,000 Portuguese 3 per cent., at a limit of 41 3/4 per cent. 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. F. A. Warren. "Those were ordered to be sold for the account—that was near the market-price at that time, it was a very close calculation—on the 9th of September I saw him again—the account days are in the middle and end of the month—he called on me on the 9th, before the account day—he asked me to give him an advance of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on those bonds—I do not remember that he mentioned why he wanted it—I made him the advance from that date up to the account day, up to the time of the sale—he signed this paper in my presence: "London, 9th, September, 1872. To the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. I request that you will advance to me at the rate of 4 1/2 per cent, per annum, the sum of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., upon the undermentioned securities, which advance I engage to repay on the 13th instant.

"This is filled up in my own handwiting, it is quite in the ordinary form—it was signed by him in my presence and he was credited with the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bonds were sold and realised 5,025<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that went to his account on 14th September—I did not see him at all times that he came into the bank, it was not necessary, but I certainly saw him on the 29th of November, and I may have seen him on the 26th—he then brought me two bills on Suse and Sibeth, for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and asked me if I would discount them for him—these are the two bills, they are drawn by Isidore Hess and accepted Suse and Sibeth, dated the 31st</p>

               <p>of October, 1872, at three months, drawn at Ferrara, payable in London—they were due on the 3rd February and were paid—he asked me whether I would discount these bills for him—I said I must inquire about them first and see—I took them down to the City and got permission to discount them for him—they were discounted on the 29th of November—I saw Austin Bidwell on that day—I am not sure whether he brought those bills in on the 26th or 29th—they might have been discounted after he left—I did not see him after I had been to the City about them—he said he might ask us to dis<lb></lb>count a few more bills of the same character—these bills for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each were discounted, and the amount, less discount, was placed to his credit—they were due on the 3rd of February and were paid in due course—I saw him again on the 23rd of December—he then told me he was going to Birmingham about his workshops, and so on, and would send us a few bills of the same stamp as those we had had from Birmingham—I think I gave him to understand that I would wait till I saw the bills—he then left, and on the 30th, which was Monday, I think I received this letter from him, dated the 28th of December, which contained a memorandum of these ten bills (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which agreed with the memorandum sent with the letter—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "28th December, 1872.

               <p>his address—he gave me no address at Birmingham, except "Post Office, Birmingham"—the Portuguese Bonds were sold, and we placed the amount to his credit on 14th September—he drew out upon that account by a cheque to Jay Cook of 3,030<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which you will see in the account on the 14th—it must hare been the old cheque-book—I discounted these bills on 29th November—they were dated 31st October, and were Suse and Sibbeth's; two bills of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell whether it was the 26th or 29th when he asked me to discount them; I am doubtful whether it was on the 26th or 29th I saw him—I cannot recollect if I discounted the bills the same day I saw him—I did tell him I would make inquiries about them—I did so, at my head office only—the balance in his favour then was 1, 658<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the two bills I discounted are here—they were payable in London—I did not make inquiries at the place in the City where they were payable; that would not be usual—I cannot say what I led him to believe—from what they said at my head office in answer to my inquiries I discounted the bills—I am not aware if I saw him between the 29th November and the 23rd December—I received on 30th December a letter of the 28th, containing some bills—all his bills received before 21st January were genuine, and paid at maturity—I wrote to him at the Post Office, Birming<lb></lb>ham at his request, and only there—the bills were acknowledged—the Bank of England has a branch at Birmingham—the first letter I received from Warren was the one containing the batch of bills which were discounted on 30th December—I had no letter from him between 28th December and 21st January, 1873, nor before 28th December—the letter of 21st January did not strike me as being different from that of 28th December—it is somewhat different—there, is a general similarity between all the letters after the 21st January, which, without suspicion being excited, would not attract attention—I believed all the' letters to be in the handwriting of Warren—I cannot say when I changed my opinion, but it was after a process of study—I do not know anything about Mr. Chabot; I have only seen him to speak to him quite lately—I do not know that the documents were submitted to him—I see that the letter of 21st January is much more cramped—the signature is larger than the body of the letter—it appears to be written with the same ink—with my present knowledge I would not say that the letter is in the handwriting of Warren—I do not say that the signature was written at the same time—I think the signature is Warren's—the colour of the ink is very much like the colour of the ink in the writing; it looks pretty much the same colour—the signature is not a stiff writing; I think it is quite as free a signature as those in the other letters; look at the two "r's"—I don't know that it was after the last examination that I changed my opinion as to these other letters being in Warren's hand<lb></lb>writing; I don't know when the last examination was about handwriting—I don't know that it was when I found he was not in this country at the time these letters were written from Birmingham that I changed my opinion—I did not learn that for a considerable time—it may have been so; first of all I thought they were his writing, and afterwards I thought not—I did afterwards find from inquiry that he was out of the country at the time those letters bear date—I also compared the writing—it may possibly have been one thing that made me change my opinion; I don't think that was altogether the reason that made me change my opinion in the first instance; very likely that induced me to make further comparison of the letters—the indorsements on the bills after 21st January are much more like his</p>

               <p>anything of the sort, as that sort of bill was very dear in Amsterdam—I told him that there were some bills on Hamburg in the market the day before, and possibly he might obtain them—he gave me an order to buy bills to the amount of about 20,000 guilders, and I was to only buy them from good houses—I asked him subsequently what he was, and he said he had some business connected with the railway works—I bought some bills for him, and the following day he called and paid me in Dutch bank notes—the day on which he paid for the first bills he gave another order to buy further bills to the same amount or rather more—those were bought and paid for in the same way—a day or two after he bought the bills there was a change in the currency, and a day or two later he came to me to sell those bills for him again—he said he had made a mistake and wished to get rid of them again—I said he would have to put up with a loss—when I went on Change I learnt the alteration in the currency and found there would be such a great loss in selling the bills that I would not do it without further orders—I explained that to him and he told me to sell the bills, that it did not matter to him, he had made such large profits on bill trans<lb></lb>actions in Frankfort that he could well afford to stand the loss, and he in<lb></lb>tended to buy something else by which he could recoup himself—the loss was from 500 to 600 guilders, about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling—with the proceeds of those resold Hamburg bills, he instructed me to buy some fresh bills on London—he wrote the particulars on paper for me—I wrote the "F.

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Continental Bank, 79, Lombard Street, City; it is also known as Messrs. Hartland's &amp; Co.—I know Austin Bidwell as Charles Johnson Horton, and Hills as Noyes—I first knew Austin Bidwell on 2nd December, last year; he called at our bank and opened an account; he merely asked if he could open an account with us—he said that he had had an account with Messrs. Bowles Brothers; that he had been fortunate enough to have withdrawn from them a sum of 7, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. just previous to their suspension—he asked what interest we should allow; as he received a cheque-book we saw that it was going to be a current account, and the question of interest was dropped altogether—I told him that the question of interest on a current account would have to be settled by Mr. Hartland himself, who did not happen to be there then—he opened a drawing account in the name of Charles Johnson Horton, he gave that as his name, and signed this signature book "C. J. Horton," and then "Charles Johnson Horton, Charing Cross Hotel;" he wrote that—we assumed that he was an American—we understood from him merely that he was an American gentleman—the account was opened by his paying in 1, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Bank of England notes—he filled up this credit slip, it is one of our forms, "Hartland &amp; Co., 79, Lombard Street, December 2nd, 1872. Credit, C. J. Horton, 1, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—this note, No. 22, 659, was one of the notes; and these are the other twelve—at the same time I believe. I gave him change for one, a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank note—that was the first time I had seen him—he called again the following day, the 3rd, and wrote on this credit slip "C. J. Horton," he put against the word "Cheque," "245<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," it con<lb></lb>siated</p>

               <p>of two amounts, the particulars of which I put in, one was a cheque on Baring's for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other, for 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was a cheque of F. A. Warren's on the Bank of England—that amount was credited to his account—on 5th December I believe I saw him again; I have a credit slip of that date, the name "C. J. Horton" and the date is written by him, it was a cheque for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., less stamp 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it purported to be a cheque of J. H. Schroeder &amp; Co., but I cannot speak personally to these matters—his account was credited with that amount; on the same day 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn out by a cheque of C. J. Horton, it was paid in bank notes—on 27th December I cashed a cheque of Horton's for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I paid 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it in bank notes, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—these are the notes, two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can't say whether I saw him on 30th December; this credit slip of that date bears his writing "C. J. Horton," it is for 1, 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it is a cheque on the Bank of England, drawn by F. A. Warren—that does not appear on the credit slip; it is an entry in the cash-book by Mr. Hartland; he is not here; it is inconvenient for both of us to be away at the same time—that 1, 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was credited to Horton's account—on 31st December there was standing to the credit of Horton's account 1, 645<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on that day I paid to Horton these bank notes, four of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all, in payment of a cheque of his; the balance was struck after that—on 9th January, 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in to—the account in Bank of England notes—this is the credit slip, the body of it is in Mr. Hartland's writing—I received the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. myself, the initials "C. J. H.," are the prisoner's, Austin Bidwell's—I have here the credit slip of 11th January; the whole of that is in Horton's writing, it is a credit slip of bank notes, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not take the numbers—I have nothing to do with the numbers—that sum was credited to Horton's account—on the same day there is another credit slip for 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in banknotes, and "Credit, C. J. Horton, notes, 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by C. J. H."—that is also Horton's writing; those notes were credited to his account—on 11th January a sum of 3, 933<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was drawn out, I presume by a cheque of Horton's, it is debited to C. J. Horton—I have no personal knowledge of that; no one else drew on that account—the entry is in Mr. Hartland's writing—we gave him in payment two drafts on Paris to his order, one for 50,000 francs, another for 22,000 francs, both drawn on Messrs. Meyer and Piesse, of Paris, and French bank notes for 28,000 francs—on 6th January a cheque of Horton's for 1, 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid over the counter in these twelve 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the account was first opened I gave a cheque-book to Horton containing twenty-four cheques; and on 11th January a fresh cheque-book was delivered to him containing forty-eight cheques; I don't think he signed for them—on 16th January 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn out by a cheque of Horton's in one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and the rest in money—these are the Nos. that appear in the books—I have only the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note here, there are two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. missing; these are a portion of the notes given in payment of that cheque—I produce a credit slip of 18th January for 3, 304<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the greater part of it is in Horton's writing; it con<lb></lb>sisted of two cheques on the Western Branch of the Bank of England, one for 1, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 1, 704<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it does not state by whom they were drawn—on 21st January 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in bank notes on a cheque of Horton's, that cheque has been put into the pass-book and returned in the ordinary manner—I cannot state the exact date when the pass-book was last given up—we have not got the pass-book, we have some of the later cheques in our possession, but not this cheque, the papers and vouchers</p>

               <p>are all in the hands of the prosecution—the earliest cheque I have here is January 2nd, 1872, it was paid on that date—the next is February 20th, 1873—I have none between, those must have been omitted to be returned—the cheque of the 21st of January for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in ten notes of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and two of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these are the notes; that was an open cheque—I paid it myself over the counter—on that same day a cheque of Horton's was paid for 807<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in favour of Jay Cooke, McCulloch &amp; Co., through Williams, Deacon &amp; Co.—this is the credit slip of 22nd January—the date and initials appear to be in the writing of Horton; as far as I am a judge of handwriting, I should say distinctly that it was his; the name "C. J. Horton," and the initials especially—it is "January 22nd, 1872, C. J. Horton, cheques 3,716<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., C. J.

A. Warren's—on that same day a cheque of Horton's for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was cashed over the counter with two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes; these are the notes—on 24th January, a cheque of Horton's for 2, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid, and also one for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid the larger cheque by a cheque on the Union Bank of London, and the 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque in three bank notes of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., these are the notes—on 25th January, 3, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in, this is the credit slip; the words "C. J. Horton," are in my writing, the date, amount, and initials "C. J. H," are in the handwriting of Horton, that consisted of one cheque on the Western Branch of the Bank of England, signed "F. A. Warren"—I knew the prisoner Hills by the name of Edwin Noyes—I first saw him at the bank, he was introduced to me there by Horton, I should say about 18th January—he introduced him as his clerk—he said he was to be treated as his confidential clerk; that is to say, we were to treat him exactly as we should himself, in his absence—I asked if Noyes was to be allowed to sign cheques—he gave a direct negative to that, "by no means," or words to that effect—I understood him to say that he was going down into the country, I think to Birmingham—he did not say what for—I do not remember his saying at any time what his business was—I don't think I saw him after he introduced Noyes—I would not like to say that I did not see him the next day or very soon after, but I don't think I did; I may have done so, but I don't think I did—after<lb></lb>wards we did business with Noyes, only in the way of cashing cheques and paying in money as a clerk—I received this letter, signed E. Noyes, dated 25th January, I can't say that I received it on that date—I believe it to be written and signed by Noyes—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "January 25th, 1873, Messrs. Hartland &amp; Co., Continental Bank. Gentlemen—Please hand to bearer the German money bought by me for Mr. C. J. Horton, this day.") I believe Noyes did on that day buy some German money, it had to be obtained—this is the receipt for it, it was 2,000 thalers: "25th January, 1873. Received, 2,000 thalers and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. cash. E. Noyes. "It was brought by a messenger—my impression is that we sent the money by a clerk with the messenger—I think it was to the Terminus Hotel, London Bridge; the number o£ the room was 6—I cannot say how the thalers were paid for—this order was written by Noyes: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "25th January, 1873.

On 25th January, a cheque of Horton's for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in bank notes; there were five 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have also a memorandum made from our books,</p>

               <p>of the foreign money paid for the balance; I cannot say who made it—the foreign money was 395 German florins, which are worth 1, 150 thalers; and 2,000 thalers—that amounts to 502<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 2,000 thalers were sent afterwards—on 27th January, a cheque of Horton's was paid for 351<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in favour of Jay Cooke &amp; Co.; it came in through their bankers', Williams, Deacon &amp; Co.—on 28th January, a cheque of Horton's was presented and paid over the counter with seventeen 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, five 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and 1,049<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in Dutch florins—these are the other notes, the rest would probably be given in cash—on 3rd February, 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in to Horton's account—I produce the credit slip for that: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "3rd February, 1873.

That is in Hill's writing—the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a cheque on the Bank of England, Western Branch—there is nothing to show whose cheque it was—on the 4th February, 3, 891<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid in to Horton's account by this credit slip (<hi rend="italic">Signed "E.

Gentlemen,—Please enclose amount in an envelope. E. Noyes for C. J. H."—I think a cheque for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was enclosed, and I believe I declined to send the money—I afterwards saw Noyes at the bank, and said that in sending money by a strange messenger it would be necessary in future to give fuller directions, and that his letter was rather vague; he said that he should desire me to obey the instructions in his letters, and trust the persons he sent, that the person he sent could be trusted, and it would be all right—my opinion is that another letter was sent, upon which we acted, and sent the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this letter is also in Noyes's writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "February 14th. Gentlemen,—Please place the amount of enclosed cheque in an envelope, and direct it to 'C. J. Horton, Room 6, Terminus Hotel, London Bridge, 'and deliver it to bearer. Yours truly, E.

Noyes"—I have no doubt that it was a cheque of Jay Cooke &amp; Co. on their bankers, Williams, Deacon &amp; Co., because it passed through our bankers', the Union Bank, but there is no mark on it—it agrees in amount and date—on the same day I paid a cheque of Horton's for 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in these fourteen notes; there are two of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, two of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and ten of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

On February 20th I paid a cheque of Horton's for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with one note—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Horton's cheque, enclosed in the letter; it is dated the 19th, and is to "self or order"—the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was paid for that cheque—I do not know whether I sent it by the messenger or not; it was probably sent as desired—that cheque is drawn on one of the cheques out of the book issued to Horton—on 21st February 4, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in to Horton's credit by this credit-slip: "21st February; Credit, C. J. Horton. Cheque 4, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. E. Noyes."—That is in Noyes's writing, in my opinion, but I did not see it written—when Horton went away all the transactions were with Noyes as his clerk—this is the cheque for 4, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it appears to be made payable to "C.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MCINTYRE</hi>. I am the person who handed the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 25, 702, and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 29, 480, across the counter—Mr. Horton came with no introduction to us, but he mentioned Bowles Brothers, and their failure—I do not know that it was so much of a failure as being in a dislocated condition—we made inquiries, but I did not do so personally—the address given to us was Charing Cross Hotel, he wrote it down, and I have got it here—this is the book I made Horton sign, to get a specimen of his signature—I did not make inquiries at the Charing Cross Hotel—at the time he signed this book he paid in some money, and signed a credit-slip, that was on December 2nd—I believe this credit-slip of 30th December to be his writing—I don't think I saw him write it—I saw Noyes first about 18th January, but I cannot fix the date—I do not think I saw the credit-slip of 18th January written—I know nothing about these cheques for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the entries are by Mr. Hartland—there is also one on 18th January for 3, 304<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that was, I believe, the last time I saw Horton—he did not hand me the credit-slip, that was on the day he introduced Noyes, but it was not received by me—the next credit-slip I received after the 18th was on the 21st or 22nd—I believe I received the credit-slip of the 22nd; I cannot say from whom, but I presume it was from Horton, though I cannot say that I saw him after the 18th—I did not, I believe, see any part of it written—the "Credit C. J. Horton" is written, and it is signed "C. J. H."—there is certainly a slight difference in the name between that and the signature-book—I do not think I should refuse it as a signa-ture—we always find some slight difference in signatures, but it appears to me practically to be the same—I should say that these initials correspond exactly—they correspond with the capital letters—the amount is 335<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is, I think, much more like the signature in the book than</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180039"></xptr>
               <p>the slip is, but yet it in dissimilar in some respects—I cannot tell you in whose writing the figures or date are in this credit-slip of 22nd January—the word "Jan. "is sufficiently like to be the same, but the figures do not appear to be so cramped—the figures and the date, I think, appear to be written with the same ink—from that time all the credit-slips were drawn up by Noyes, but I am not sure that there are not some signed by Horton—the letter of 13th February is signed "E. Noyes for C. J. H."—I think the body of this slip of 30th January is Horton's, but the total is Mr. Hartland's—it is not at all like the signature-book, but still it may be Horton's, it is written so carelessly—I saw Horton write in the signature-book, and I think I saw him write some credit-slips, but I cannot tell you in all how many times I saw him write—the credit-slip of 11th January was filled up in the office, and it is probable I saw it done, it is like the signa-ture-book—the entries in our books where I find Warren's name are chiefly, and I believe all, by myself—I do not think the cheque of 20th February for 4, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with the mistake in the endorsement, went through the clearing-house, I think it was presented by ourselves—it is credited and debited on the same day, and we got it back from the bank at once.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. Horton opened the account with us on 2nd December—I am not quite sure on what day he introduced Noyes to me; it was somewhere about the 17th or 18th—between 2nd December and 17th or 18th January all the money that was paid in to the credit of Horton was paid in by himself—I principally received it; on seven-eighths of the occasions, on nearly all the occasions—I don't think there was anyone with him—I am not sure that he never sent a messenger; I should not like to say that; he may have done so; but on the major portion of the occasions he came himself—I have an idea that there was a credit-slip of Noyes on 20th January, but I am not sure—the first signature of Noyes here is that of 25th January, about the German money—on that same day here is a credit-slip signed with Horton's initials—it may be that the first documeut I received bearing Noyes's signature was on 25th January—it appears that he made payments in with the initials "C. J. H."—I treated him on every occasion as Horton's clerk—I had no particular reason for asking Horton whether Noyes was to sign cheques—I have known cases where confidential clerks have to sign cheques; it is not at all out of the ordinary course of business; but when I asked him he said "By no means," or words to that effect—between 25th January and 1st March Noyes was there nearly every day, either to pay in money on Horton's account or to draw it out—I am not sure that on one occasion he did not bring a porter with him; on one or two occasions he might have been there with a porter from the hotel where he was staying—he has sent individuals to the bank with communi-cations from himself—I received a letter from him by a messenger on three or four occasions—they appeared to me to be very ordinary persons, and persons that ought not to have such communications entrusted to them—they appeared to be messengers from the hotel—I never asked Horton what his business was; he appeared to us to be an American gentleman—I don't know that he represented himself as being anything, but that he had simply closed his account with one bank and desired to open it with another—nothing whatever was said about agency business—we did not open the account with him contemplating such a large amount of business; it was on the understanding that it was to be a deposit account, and then, observing his intimate connection with the Bank of England, we asked no</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180040"></xptr>
               <p>further questions—we did not make any inquiry, because the evident con-nection of the account with respectable persons put it on one side—we were under the impression that he was carrying on business on a large and extensive scale; we had no idea what sort of business; we did not know, we could only surmise—I had no idea about agency business, or any other kind of business whatever; I only saw that transactions were being conducted on a large scale through the medium of respectable persons—until Mr. May made his appearance we never suspected anything wrong; we reconciled all with the idea that very large money transactions were being conducted with a large customer of the Bank of England, and we did not concern ourselves with what it might or might not be—I can't say that such an address as the Terminus Hotel is usual, but it did not impress us—I did not look upon it as eccentric—we had no suspicion whatever—when Noyes sent the letters by a messenger, we had some opinion as to the irregularity with which business was being conducted; at the same time, we had nothing to do with that—we had no notion, either from the large sums or the address given, that there was anything wrong about the transaction—I think I never saw Horton after Noyes was introduced until he was in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not know that he was a customer of the Bank of England; I merely observed a connection with a large customer of the Bank; I refer to the cheques of Warren that were constantly paid in to his account—we did not ascertain by inquiry that Warren's cheques were good, but by the fact that large cheques were being continually paid; we only took care of ourselves—the cheques were always honoured, and that satisfied us—in the majority of instances the cheques paid over the counter were paid to Noyes.</p>

                  </hi>. In the course of last year I lived at 11, Duke's Road, Euston Square—about the commencement of August in that year I became acquainted with George Bidwell—I knew him by that name—I travelled with him in France in September; we went to Trouville—I became unwell and returned to London, leaving him abroad—I afterwards by arrangement met him in Holland—during our first acquaintance, and while I was absent from him in England, I received these letters from him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—during my acquaintance with him, and up to the time when I met him in Holland, I had seen Austin Bidwell and Macdonnell—I had known them by those names—George told me that Austin was his brother—Macdonnell seemed to be on intimate terms with them both; they addressed each other by their Christian names, Austin, and George, and <hi rend="italic">Mac.</hi>—I stayed with George Bidwell one day at the Victoria Hotel, Rotter<lb></lb>dam; we went from there to Haarlem; that would be a half or three<lb></lb>quarters of an hour from Rotterdam—while at Haarlem I saw Mr. Austin once, and Macdonnell twice, I believe; on one occasion while I was there I went to meet George Bidwell at the station, he had been to Amsterdam all day, and I met him on his return—the next day after that, the 14th, we all breakfasted together at Rotterdam, Austin Bidwell, George Bidwell, Macdonnell, and me—it was said that Macdonnell and Austin Bidwell were going to England, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Calais, and George Bidwell and I were going by way of Harwich—we did not go that day, we waited till the next, the 15th, and then crossed—we got to London I think on the 16th, and went to the Alexandra Hotel, where we found Macdonnell—I don't think I saw Austin Bidwell there—after staying a day or two at the Alexandra Hotel I went to Ford's Hotel, Manchester Square, and remained there with George Bidwell till the beginning of January—I first saw Hills on Christmas Day, at Ford's Hotel—George Bidwell had said that Mr. Macdonnell, Austin, and a friend of theirs was coming to dine with us on Christmas Day—they did come—Hills was introduced to me as Mr. Howe, from Liverpool—George Bidwell told me that we were to give them each a present, and I got four silk neck wrappers, and had their monograms put on them, "G. M." for George Macdonnell, "G. B." for George Bidwell, "A. B." for Austin Bidwell, and "E. N." for Hills—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the one I got for Hills—George Bidwell told me what initials to put—George Bidwell's was a white scarf—we had the dinner-party and spent the evening together—the others treated Howe friendly enough, they addressed him as <hi rend="italic">Ed.</hi>, and he addressed them by their Christian names; he addressed Macdonnell as <hi rend="italic">Mac.</hi>—I believe Howe dined with us once again that week; he went down to the Crystal Palace with George Bidwell and me on the following Saturday—after 1st January we removed to 87, Upper Gloucester Place, and remained there till about the end of February—while there I saw Hills once or twice, Macdonnell, and Austin Bidwell—after living there for some time, we went to the Albemarle Hotel—while at Upper Gloucester Place I remember seeing a black leather bag, I kicked it accidentally, that caused me to open it, and it was full of money—about the end of January I bought a travelling bag at Parkius &amp; Gotto's, as a present for George Bidwell—he took it away</p>

Meunier's—I received</p>

I am a single woman and live at Pimlico—in December last I was employed at the Turkish Divan in the Haymarket—I used to be there of an evening—whilst I was there in December I made the acquaintance of the prisoners Maodonnell and Austin Bidwell, and I recognise Noyes—I knew Austin Bidwell as Theodore Bingham, and Macdonnell as George Macdonnell—I never knew Hills'name—the three used to come to the Turkish Divan in the evening—I supposed they were friends, they came together—Bingham said that Macdonnell was his doctor—I knew that Bingham was an American—Macdonnell said that Hills was a genius, that he had come over here to invent something—they used to come to the Divan sometimes two or three times a week, and sometimes not for a week—sometimes they stayed away a little while—I became on friendly terms with Austin Bidwell—I remember his going to Paris—I saw him off by the train at the Charing Cross Railway Station—that was in January I think, I don't remember the date—I saw him take his ticket; he told me that he was going to Paris on business, not what particular business—he was away two or three days—I saw him on his return, at the Turkish Divan, his face was strapped up, he had met with an accident; he had a small piece of plaster on his forehead—he said there had been an accident on the line by the mail train, that two persons were killed and he only got injured—I think he was alone when he told me this, but I don't remember; it was at the end of January as near as I can remember; that was the last time I saw him—he did not say anything about going away—after that I saw Macdonnell and Hills, they used to come to the Divan sometimes—I asked them about Austin Bidwell—I generally spoke to Macdonnell—he said that he was very ill, suffering from the accident—he also said he was suffering from a shot wound, and he would have to have the ball extracted from his side—he said that he was going to extract it—I always called Austin Bidwell by the name of <hi rend="italic">Dorey</hi>—I afterwards received two or three letters from <hi rend="italic">Dorey</hi>—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I think Noyes brought it me, I am not sure, I am almost certain it was Noyes—I never saw Austia Bidwell write, and never saw him after receiving that letter—after he left I never received any letter signed Dorey from anyone except Hills or Macdonnell—one of them brought me that letter (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "My dear Daisey, I will be unable to see you, I am sorry to say, until I change my quarters, which I hope will be on Monday, and I shall do so almost only because I can see you.

               <p>the City with Macdonnell in a brougham, he went into some house, and when he came out he had an envelope with coloured papers, American bonds I think they were—I had never seen any before—I did not see what he did with them—some time in February I had arranged to go to New York with Macdonnell—we were to start at first on 1st March, I think, on a Friday, but it was put off to another week as Macdonnell said he had to go to Paris, and he went away on the Saturday morning—he said he should be back on Thursday, but he came back on Tuesday—I saw him at his lodging, and he arranged for us to start for Liverpool next day—he said there was an unpleasant remark passed at the table where he was dining, something about the forgery, and he said they would be down upon all Americans now—he did not say what forgery—he said he understood the language they were speaking by asking them to pass something at the table, I think he said it was German—on the Tuesday night, the 4th, Macdonnell remained at my lodging—he went out between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning, he returned about 12 o'clock in the day—when he was out some person called, I heard afterwards that it was Sergeant Bull, of the Detective force—a gentleman called before that, I think it was George Bid<lb></lb>well, it was very much like him—he asked me if Mr. Macdonnell was in, that he had not kept an appointment with him at the Grosvenor—I told him I expected him again, but he had gone out; the gentleman then left—I had got my things all ready to start, and during the day some man brought me my passage ticket for the <hi rend="italic">Peruvian</hi> for America; two passage tickets were brought, a young woman was going with me—I received no message with the tickets—in the afternoon I had a telegram from Macdonnell, saying that it was impossible to go till the 9 o'clock train—I and the young woman left the lodging that day with the luggage, for the purpose of going to Liverpool—I saw Macdonnell in the evening, outside Gatti's Restaurant, near the Lowther Arcade—I went there to have some tea—that was before I had started from my lodging with my luggage—Macdonnell told me to go to Liverpool, and he would meet me there—I asked him why he had not taken a ticket for himself—he said he had taken it at another office—he said I was to go by the 9 o'clock train from Euston—he left me outside Gatti's—I then went to my lodging, got the luggage, went with my friend in a cab to Euston Square station, and went to Liverpool by the 9 o'clock train—I did not see Macdonnell again before I started—I went to the North Western Station Hotel at Liverpool, Macdonnell had told me to go there—I remained there till the following Friday, Macdonnell did not come, and I returned to London on Saturday—I had only my own luggage with me, not Macdonnell's; I don't know where his luggage was—the police took charge of my luggage at Euston Square on my return, and examined it—the next time I saw Macdonnell was in New York, in custody—I went out with one of the City police constables.</p>

I saw Bingham off to Paris the last time he went before the accident; I saw him again three days after—he had then met with the accident; that was the last time I saw him until I saw him at the Mansion House—a good many Americans come to the Turkish Divan, it remains open until 1 o'clock; it is open all day, I believe—I was not living there, I was only an attendant there in the evening; I was evening barmaid; it is a smoking place.</p>

I am the manager of Nelson's Portland Hotel, and have been so since August last—I know all the prisoners, I have seen them at Nelson's Hotel—on 22nd August last George Bid well came there and took a room—he stayed one week—during that week I saw Austin Bid well and Macdonnell there; I knew them by those names and addressed them by those names—George Bidwell told me that his brother Austin Bid well was staying at some other hotel, a larger one than ours—he said that on a previous occasion he had stayed at the Langham—on this occasion he said he had come direct from a journey to our house—at the end of the week he asked me to tell him of some quiet watering place that he might go to for a day or two, and I told him Eastbourne—he left on the Friday morning, the 29th, and came back late on the Sunday night, the 1st September—he remained a few days, he then told me that he was going abroad, he wished me to receive his letters and keep them till he wrote, and then forward them to the address that he would give; he also wished me to receive and forward any letters for his brother or Macdonnell—he left with me a letter for Mr. Hills, I was to give it to Mr. Hills—he did not say when Hills would be likely to arrive—letters did arrive while he was away, and after that I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is George Bidwell's writing, I don't think I have seen him write, I know his writing by receiving the letter from him; he afterwards referred to having written to me and to receiving my replies (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Grande Hotel, St. James, 211, Rue St. Honoré, Paris. Send my letters to this hotel until further notice as soon as they arrive, and oblige yours, George Bidwell, or for J. C.

Dear Sir,—Please deliver to the bearer my coat, bundle, and anything you have for me; I will settle when I come in again. George Bidwell"—I gave the things to the cabman, taking his name and number—the bill is still owing.</p>

               <p>George Bidwell came after my apartments in April, 1872—he took lodgings at my house—South Kingsland is Haggerstone—I asked him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, on the terms that he was to leave at any time—he gave the name of Mr. Anthony—there was another person with him, but I never ascertained his name—Austin Bidwell and Macdonnell came there while George Bidwell was staying with me—they breakfasted every morning after they first came—a parcel came for Mr. Warren—I sent my daughter up with it; it was kept—George Bidwell remained a little more than a week—when he left he took the latch-key with him—I asked the fair gentleman, whose name I did not know, to ask Mr. Anthony to please to send it back, and I received this letter enclosing the key: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: 29th April, 72.

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer in Edinburgh—I knew the late James McKelvie, who was a private detective—he is dead—that is his signature. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition was read as follows: "I</hi> am a private detective officer, residing at 120, Nicholson Street, in the City of Edinburgh. I have within half an hour arrived here from Scotland. I received certain informa<lb></lb>tion from Gibson, Craig &amp; Co., of Edinburgh, writers to the signet, and in consequence of that I watched the house No. 22, Cumberland Street, Edin<lb></lb>burgh, on Wednesday last, the 2nd April instant, from about twenty-five minutes past 10 o'clock in the morning. It is a private house. The prisoner came out of the house to the door, looked round and went back again, and remained in about twenty minutes, and then he came out, and from his appearance I suspected he was George Bidwell. I watched him and saw where he went. He posted a letter in a pillar-box, and then he went to a stationer's shop, and then to a baker's shop. When standing at the door he looked around and came out and went around the corner, and in about twenty yards he set off to run as hard as he could run. I ran after him, he ran into a blacksmith's shop, from which he turned back and passed me. I</p>

               <p>took no notice of him as he did so; he walked on a little and then started to run again. He then ran down Drummond Place and Scotland Street; he went through Scotland Street lane, and over the Church railings, jumped over several stone walls, one after the other. I followed him, and went through a private house into Scotland Street again. I got round to the street by another way, and was in the street as soon as he. I ran him to Duncan Street, Stockbridge, in which he came to a standstill, and could not run any further. He made several thrusts at me with a stick which he had in his hand. I took out of my pocket a small baton and held it out as if it were a pistol, and told him ‘to stand and be a gentleman, and give me his hand; to be a brother and not a coward. 'I got hold of his hand and held him. (I called him a 'brother' because I fancied he gave me a Masonic sign.) I got assistance and drove him in a cab to Messrs. Gibson, Craig &amp; Co.'s office. I said 'You are George Bidwell; you are wanted for the forgery on the Bank of England. 'He spoke some foreign language, and I don't know what he said. I understood him to say that he was not a Fenian. I said 'I know that; I was not looking for any Fenians. 'When I got him to the office I asked him if he could give any account of him<lb></lb>self, and why he ran over those private grounds and stone walls? and he would not give me any answer. A few minutes afterwards he said he was subject to giddiness in the head, and took to those fits of running off. I asked him what I might call him, and he said 'You may call me James, if you like. 'He would give no answers to any questions after that He spoken very broken English, like a Frenchman. I gave him a book to read. He said either his father or mother belonged to France, and the other to Germany. He said he had been in Paris. I told him there was an old friend of his doing five years there just now. I bound up his leg, which was cut and bleeding. He was then handed over to the police of Edinburgh, and I had nothing more to do with him. The stationer's shop was kept by Mr. Anderson, into which I saw him go. I did not search him or the lodgings. I only watched the lodgings.—<hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

I am an engraver and printer, at 16, Ivy Lane, Paternoster Row—I know the firm of Nelson &amp; Co., printers, by name—I did not know them till I was at the Mansion House—I know now that Mr. Chaloner is a partner in that firm—I knew the prisoner George Bid well by the name of Brooks—about 18th December he called and said he was recommended by Nelson's—he brought two copper plates with blank bill forms upon them and asked me if I worked from copper plate—I told him yes, and he told me that he was recommended from Nelson's, and he asked me what I would do him 500 for—one of the plates had the figure "1," and the other had the word "First"—he wanted the figure "1" transferred to the plate that had the word "First," and the other he wanted transferred to the other plate—I told him I could do it, and he asked me what I would do 500 copies for, and I told him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I said I could not get them done before Christmas—he said if I could get them done he would give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. extra, and I said I would try—after he gave me instructions, he asked me to explain, that he might know that I understood his instructions—I did so, and he said "Very well, that will do"—the plates were left with me—on that occasion I had merely to transfer the different figures—I made up the stone from the plates and printed from the stone—some of those forms were ready the day before Christmas Day—I went out of town the morning before, and on my return I found that some of the forms had been delivered—I afterwards saw him and printed some forms with the word "Second," and some with the figure "2"—the forms had scrolls on them—he did not bring any scrolls at that time—the scrolls were engraved upon the plates—he came again at the end of December or the beginning of January—the order he gave then was merely to add some<lb></lb>thing to the plate and print a few more—on one occasion I engraved for him on slips of copper some names of places—some of the names were engraved on the bill plates themselves, names of several countries, Hong<lb></lb>kong, Cairo, Bombay, Valparaiso, Yokohama, and Alexandria—they were ordered at different times—some plates we made use of for several bills—I put some of those names into some of the bill forms—I also engraved on slips of copper the names of the Union Bank of London and the London</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180071"></xptr>
               <p>and Westminster Bank, and I also printed the names of the banks on the body of some of the bills—I remember on one occasion his bringing two plates with scrolls on them—these are the scrolls (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), they are for making the ornamental part across the bill—I can't say what date he brought those—he brought four, but I tried to make use of two—I told him I would try what I could do with them—I transferred them to wood and found they were too black, and afterwards, instead of using those scrolls, he selected two patterns out of my pattern-book—I engraved the scrolls he selected on a separate piece of copper and transferred them to the bills—I engraved two bill plates for bill forms for him also, and printed bills from those plates, and inthe centre of the scroll on the bill forms I printed certain names—H. C. Streeter and T. Perkins were printed on the bills printed from the plates that he brought me—and the names, D. R. Howell and Juan Perez were printed in the scroll of the bills which I printed from the plates that I had made—in printing Juan Perez at first, I spelt the name wrong, "Jaun" instead of "Juan"—the prisoner was very cross about it, and I of course said I would alter the name and print them over again—I altered it and printed forms with the name properly spelt—the last time I saw him was about the 22nd or 23rd of February—I should say I saw him on an average about twice a week from the 18th December to that date—he said he was getting up samples for bills of exchange—he came on 22nd or 23rd February, and took all the forms away except these four blocks of the scrolls which I had not used—he took away everything else—he asked to look at some of the forms I had printed on the stone, and he wished me to show him the way to take them off the stone, and I got one of my apprentices to show him—the bill form on the stone was entirely effaced—that is done with snake stone—I told him afterwards that if he offered me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I could not produce him another bill from that stone without retrans<lb></lb>ferring it—he said that would do—he did not say why he wished the stone erased—these bills are all on forms printed by me—I can't say positively that this one of "Oppenheim &amp; Co. "is mine, but I am pretty well sure because of the name; all the others I am certain of.</p>

From the copper plates I had a perfect form on the stone, and then the printing could be done in a day or two—I had not to wet the paper for the purpose—the bills with the name of "Streeter" on were all done at one time—I can't give you the date when they were done—Juan Perez was the last I did, because I made a mistake in the name—"Howell" was the one I did just before that; the order for those two was given at the same time—when I finished printing "Streeter's" bills, I obliterated that form, transferred another from the copper-plate, and went on printing another form and so on, till I got through the whole—I think it was about the 20th February that I ordered my apprentice to efface "Howell's" form from the stone; it may have been as late as the 23rd—"Juan Perez" was done after that alteration—no suspicion was excited in my mind at any time—these were mere blank bill forms when they left my hands, just as specimens shown by Messrs. Waterlow's to their customers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a die sinker and stamp cutter, of 29, Bell Alley, Moorgate Street; in November last my place of business was 91, Queen Street, Cheapside—on 20th November George Bidwell came and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180072"></xptr>
               <p>ordered an endorsing stamp to stamp the names on bills of exchange and things of that sort; it was to have a handle to it, and I was to put on it "Sub-country man. "and "Secret" underneath the impression—the stamp on this bill (<hi rend="italic">the subject of the indictment</hi>) is from the die I cut—the impression on this paper (<hi rend="italic">found at Macdonnell's</hi>) is rather heavier than the one on the bill, and I do not recognise it as the same stamp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by George Bidwell.</hi> I know that the impression on the bill is from the stamp I made, because I kept an impression of it, and forwarded it to Messrs. Freshfield, and they compared the impression with the one on the bill and found it to be the same—I recognise you by the usual means; I should be stupid if I did not recognise a man afterwards, especially if I looked at him two or three times as I did you—he had no the same appearance you have now, he had no whiskers and he had a moustache, curled at each end, in the French style—the words on the stamp are cut in very ordinary block letters—I have little doubt that some letters could be printed like this, with type of the same size, which could be procured at any printing office or type founder's—we can do anything in type—I should say it is impossible that you could fit up words with exactly the same dimensions, without having my stamp to go by; I mean as to the relative distance of the words—if the person to whom I gave the stamp had lost it, or given it to another person, he could have another made exactly like it, but he would have to have something to guide him as to the relative size and distance, or else the two impressions would not be the same—any other engraver could engrave or set up a stamp exactly like the one I cut, if he had this bill, or one of the thousands of other bills the Bank issues.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a member of the late firm of Nelson &amp; Co., of 66 and 57, Oxford Arms Passage, Warwick Lane, Paternoster Row—I know George Bidwell, the second prisoner from the Jury—I first saw him on 9th December last—he gave no name or address—he wanted an electro plate to be set up in type—I was to put German words in it—I do not recollect them now—he gave me this written paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the writing is in pencil—I afterwards fastened it on this larger sheet—there were no particular instructions about mounting it, or for a handle, but I gave instructions for it to be mounted—he paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account—I did as he directed, and mounted the plate on a piece of wood, and then took this impression (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from it, with the words "electro mounted" on it—I wrote those words at the time I sent the proof to the foundry—that is the order for casting—it was set up "tur," and altered to "tun," the "t" should have been an "f," and the copy was closely followed—"r" was set up first, and altered to "n"—after I heard of this case I got back the proof from the foundry—I also found the original paper that George Bidwell pro<lb></lb>duced, and have it here—he called in a few days, and I delivered the stamp to him—he asked me for a small portion of printing ink, and I supplied it, also a brass rule with which lines are printed—I charged 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the stamp and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the ink and rule, and he took them away—I did not know his name and address then—on 18th January he came again, and brought me four forms of bills of exchange—he wished me to imitate them as well as I could with type—he selected the type—one form was executed, he corrected the proof and fifty copies of it were printed—the bill forms he brought were left with me—this one is headed "Callao," this other is the one that was executed, and a proof of it is underneath it—I set up another of the bill forms, the one</p>

               <p>with "Callao" on it, but I only delivered a few proofs to him—he selected six scrolls from my specimen-book, they were procured from the founder's, and he took four of the six away with him—those are the four that were shown to Mr. Straker—he called at various times until nearly the end of February—he showed me some forms of bills in December—I said that they were lithographed—he then asked me if I knew a lithographer in the neighbourhood, and having seen Mr. Thomas Straker's name, of Ivy Lane, I mentioned it—he did not tell me afterwards whether he had been to him—on 28th January, the day he brought the forms of bills, he paid a sove<lb></lb>reign on account—I inquired what name I should enter in my book, and he took this small slip of paper, which was lying on my desk, and wrote on it "J. R. Nelson"—I afterwards found it and gave it up—I asked his address, he said he was staying at Brighton—I find endorsed on all these bills (<hi rend="italic">Including the one charged in the indictment</hi>) an impression of the German stamp which I cut for George Bidwell—I do not understand German—the stamp on this bill (<hi rend="italic">For</hi> 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on Blydenstein, dated</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th January</hi>) appears to bear exactly the same device in the corner as the one I printed for George Bidwell, with a little difference in the colour, but it is not filled up on one of my forms—the device is identical with that on the bill brought to us to copy the print from.</p>

Smith, Payne &amp; Smith"—there was another on the 16th—this is the impression—this is a proof taken from the block before I gave it up to George Bidwell—from time to time he gave me pieces of paper to copy from—the prisoner com<lb></lb>municated with me on slips of paper when he came, sometimes with a pencil and sometimes with a pen—these are the original copies given by the prisoner for me to engrave from—they were torn up by the prisoner and thrown on the floor and afterwards found—after this case began, we looked and found those pieces—there is one written in German, <hi rend="italic">"Ich will bald mehr haben</hi>"—that is a copy for some of the work done—he told me to read the German letters one by one to prevent a mistake—he wrote in</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MCINTYRE</hi>. I have not had the assistance of any other expert in handwriting in examining these documents—I never had the assistance of another expert in my life—Mr. Netherclift never assisted me in his life—when I have been called to prove the handwriting of a person he has not, as a rule, been called on the other side to prove it is not—that is very seldom indeed the case, and only in difficult cases, I mean in the matter of a mere signature, when perhaps it will be a mere matter of opinion—I can't say that I have ever seen these persons write, I base my judgment upon having examined certain documents which have been proved by the witnesses to be in the handwriting of Austin Bid well—I have examined the admitted handwriting till I have become fully acquainted with it, and then I compare that with the handwriting in dispute—I saw the signature in the signature book and a number of other signatures—the whole of this letter of 28th December is undoubtedly in Austin Bidwell's handwriting—the body of the letter of 21st January, addressed to Colonel Francis, is in George Bidwell's writing, without doubt—the signature is Austin's—it is very possible that it was written with the same ink—I can't say that it was not—I should say it had been written afterwards, and blotted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180081"></xptr>
               <p>some little time after—it is my opinion it was nearly dry when it was blotted, it may have been written tea minutes after or immediately after<lb></lb>wards—it might be written by a fresh dip of ink, and fifty other things might be—the signature is quite in the right place, where you would expect it to be if the man had written the whole of the letter, the words "Yours very truly" rise one beyond the other, but the signature, "F. A. Warren," is quite straight, so it does not look like the same hand—I should Bay the signature was written with rather a free hand—I say that the bodies of these cheques are in the handwriting of George Bidwell, and the signature is Austin's—they are very excellent signatures, written in a manner so as to be sure not to be returned, and all written at one sitting, in my opinion—they would infallibly be received at the Bank, I should say—signatures might be traced so that the forms of the letters would be the same, but the tracing would have the appearance of the tracing at the back of some of the forged bills—a lame, crawling line—I don't know in whose writing the initials F. A. W. is, to the cheques altered from order to bearer—in my opinion they are not Austin Bidwell's—there is only the word "Bear" on the cheque of 27th February—I don't know whose writing that is, nor the initials, but I don't think they are Austin's—there is another cheque on the 27th, with the letter "B" and part of the letter "E," and the final "er"—I believe those letters are in George Bidwell's writing; it seems to me they are written by the same person who wrote the body of the cheque, but trifles like these I have put on one side—I don't know in whose writing the two names "C. J. Horton" and "C. J. Heorton" are—I don't recognise Austin Bidwell's hand in them; who wrote them I can't tell—the endorsements "F. A. Warren" on some of the bills are written by Austin, and some are not—I have seen 140 bills; most of them, if not all, have the signa<lb></lb>tures of Warren on the back—some of them I believe to be in Austin's writing, and in a large majority I can't recognise the signatures—I can't tell you how many of the signatures are his in my opinion—I say that Streeter's bill, the subject of this indictment, is certainly not a tracing—it is a very fair signature, a signature that would be sure to be honoured—the signatures "Horton" to the cheques on the Continental Bank have been all written at one time, and are the careful signatures of Austin—comparing them with the signatures on the credit-notes and other signatures, I say they are written by the same person—in this respect they are not like them; one is a very careful signature and the other is a careless signature—I have com<lb></lb>pared them with the more careful signatures—I am prepared to say that in my opinion the signatures to the cheques are in the writing of Austin; to the best of my belief they are—I can't distinguish them from his genuine signatures; there is only this difference, they seem to be written with particular care—they are particularly good signatures, so far that they have given me a great deal of trouble—if you select these two, there is the very worst signature of "Horton" and one of the very best—if they had been put before me to compare, I should hesitate to give an opinion, and say they were not written by one person—here are two signatures that are written by one person; that is credit-slip "Austin Bidwell," 24, and credit "Austin Bidwell," 30—if those signatures had been put before me, and I were asked whether they were written by one and the same person (mind, I know that they are), I should say I would give no opinion—if I were pressed, I should say I have come to no opinion—I can't give an opinion unless I form one—I only give opinions when I feel convinced, and that would be a case in</p>

In a case in the Probate Court I once swore that the signature of a testatrix was a forgery, and the jury found afterwards that it was a genuine signature, but the Judge certified that there were grounds for a new trial, and it is not settled—I have never admitted that it was not a forgery—I don't remember such a thing in my life; you are asking me whether I have made a mistake, and I ask you by what I am to judge; you tell me a jury found a verdict against me; I am telling you that the case has to be tried again, and further when juries have found verdicts against me and the case has been tried again, their verdict has always been reversed—there have not been many cases—I do not know where Mr. Netherclift is; he has differed from me in opinion, perhaps, in one case in sixty or seventy in which we have been employed—I say that this document is in Noyes' writing, from the peculiar termination of the letter "a," and from the Greek form of the letter "C" in "Charles" and in "Massachusetts"—I was a long time coming to that conclusion, because I am cautious, and had not seen it for some time—I could find letters there to correspond with Macdonnell's writing, but not in a satisfactory manner; not in a manner to induce me to form an opinion—I have not compared it with Macdonnell's writing.</p>

The letter was not placed in my hands one evening on the arrival of Mr. Peter Williams from New York, but I was examined at the Mansion House next day—I speak to George Bidwell's writing to all these letters positively—there are one or two specialities in it, such as the spelling of the word telegram with two "1's," which is the way George Bidwell spells it, but it was from the general character that I spoke to it; I had not sufficient time to look into it—I had had much longer than a quarter of an hour—I took them home with me—I was positive after I had seen the letters—I must have seen them more than half-an-hour at Mr. Freshfield's before I took them away—I think I was two or three hours in his office on this business and going to the Bank of England, and I think I am speaking within compass when I say I saw it for three-quarters of an hour—I am speaking of the letter from New York and one letter of Noyes Hills'—some of these letters are in George Bidwell's writing, and there are two from Edinburgh—I had seen the Birmingham letters as long ago as 21st March, and for three weeks at a time—no one would suppose that the signature and the bodies are in the same writing; one is signed by Austin Bidwell, and the other is not, if I mistake not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">declining to address the Jury on behalf of Macdonnell and George Bidwell, those prisoners themselves addressed the Jury as follows:—Macdonnell.</hi> The statement I have to make to you, Gentlemen of the Jury, was alluded to towards the end of Mr. Giffard's discourse and from what he said I presume he has been informed or conceived some idea himself as to what it was my intention to say. He tells you that any statement which I can make to you is not evidence, and can be received by you only with very great caution; I do not attempt to deny that; but, nevertheless, I think that my statement will be so supported by the testimony which the prosecution has elicited that it will merit at least a very careful consideration at your hands. I can easily conceive that in my case it will be very difficult indeed to make any defence whatever; but, as I believe that no person is in a position to give so accurate and so faithful an account of this whole</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180087"></xptr>
               <p>business as I am, I propose to show to you that in the case of one prisoner at least, if I cannot show it by direct evidence, it is certainly worthy of con<lb></lb>siderable attention—I mean my proposition which refers to the pro<lb></lb>bability of his entire innocence in the actual fraud. My only reason for making this statement is that the truth may be known in regard to him, for I am perfectly well aware that every word I am saying to you now cuts from under my feet any hope that I might have entertained for myself. The idea of the prosecution, which they have endeavoured to enforce on your convictions, is that the original intention with which Austin Bid well, George Bidwell, and myself came over to this country was to perpetrate this fraud on the Bank of England. I think if that idea could be entertained, it would argue for us a knowledge and a prescience something more than men of ordinary ability and attainments could pretend to. It would suppose that we were perfectly acquainted with the mode of doing business in England, that we knew some person or other who had an account with the Bank of England, that we could by some well-devised plan get sufficiently into the confidence of that person to obtain from him an introduction to the Bank of England, and that all the other minor details, which have been explained so fully in the course of this investigation, would all work together for our benefit, would all turn out precisely as we desired, and that, in fact, nothing at all would interfere to prevent the carrying out of the fraud. When we first came to England it was certainly with no such intention. Mr. Green, of Savile Row, has told you that the opening of the account with the Western Branch of the Bank of England was an entire accident, and so it was. That was done on the 4th of May, and on the 28th of May we three left England. We left England without the slightest intention of returning. We were to have gone to South America by Rio as far as San Francisco, and thence back to Rio. Circumstances occurred in Rio to induce us to change our minds, and we came back. There is no doubt at all the intention was to close the account with the Bank of England, because it was of no use. But when we came back to England it was of considerable use and advan<lb></lb>tage to us to cash any documents that might come in our possession. We went from England to the Continent, and our intention while on the Continent was to do certain business between Vienna and Frankfort-on-the-Main. Circumstances then arose while we were at Vienna to prevent that business. In the meantime I was taken very seriously ill, and returned to England for the benefit of medical advice. While on my way to England I arrived at Amsterdam, and there I purchased from a banker named Moses Ezekiel a bill upon London. The prosecution has found out, apparently, every cir<lb></lb>cumstance connected with this case, and have, no doubt, found out that. I also had another bill, drawn by Baron Schey of Vienna on London, and that bill I cashed myself. I went to Waring with it, and I saw the manner of doing business, which differed entirely from the manner in which it is transacted in America; the bill from Moses Ezekiel was drawn on the London and Westminster Bank, and was negotiated for me at the Alexandra Hotel. As soon as I saw how business was transacted, I sent a telegram from the station next adjoining the Alexandra Hotel to a person in Holland, and I stated in that telegram that I had made a great discovery. That telegram, I daresay, was also found, but, as it would tend to show that fraud possibly could not have been contemplated so early as the prose<lb></lb>cution claim, it has not been brought forward. That was the first moment at which anything of the kind entered my mind. In America,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180088"></xptr>
               <p>when bills are presented at a bank for discount, when acceptances are presented, it is the custom to send the acceptances round to the persons accepting to be what is technically called "initialed," in order that their validity and genuineness may be certified. I found that was not the case here, and the result of that discovery is that I am standing before you to-day. I went over to Amsterdam after that, and there telegraphed to another person to join me at once. He met me in Amsterdam, and we came to London, where we were afterwards joined by George Bidwell. Mr. Pinto, from Amsterdam, has told you that George Bidwell purchased bills drawn from Amsterdam upon Hamburg, which bills a day or two afterwards were sold back again, and others, drawn upon London, purchased with the proceeds. That was done in pursuance of my directions, and the bills so obtained were afterwards discounted by F. A. Warren. The matter went on in that way for some time until the 11th or 12th November. Austin Bidwell went over to Paris to buy the bill on Messrs. Rothschild which has been so much commented upon, that for 4, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. During his voyage or journey to Paris he met with a very severe railroad accident, in which one man certainly was killed outright, and I think two or three more, and Austin Bidwell had probably as narrow an escape from instant death and being smashed to pieces as any man ever had. On arriving in London he was in such a condition that it was almost impossible for him to move. He was helped from the station to the hotel where I was then stopping, and visited by a physician (Dr. Coulson), who told him he was in very great danger of being paralyzed for life, that his spine was affected. On the 17th of January, when Austin Bidwell took that bill to the Bank, I went with him as far as the door, and afterwards helped him back to my quarters. I think on the following day Dr. Coulson saw him, and Austin Bidwell then told him it was his intention to leave England immediately. The doctor replied that if he intended to travel he must do so at once, or he might not be able to do so at all. The evidence goes to show that up to this time every preparation had beea made for the contemplated fraud. The 18th of January was a Saturday, and after the doctor's interview with Austin Bid<lb></lb>well, who was then in my room, he told me that it was his intention to utterly withdraw from anything connected with this or any other similar matter. You can easily conceive that up to this time a great deal of money had been thrown away in continually transferring and re-transferring the papers. The idea of losing that money and having no return for it at all did not please me very much; but as Austin Bidwell said he would leave, was determined to leave, and did leave, I could only let him go, and he went But for all that, I thought that I would not make myself a victim; at all events I should carry it on, and in that determination I was joined by another person, who will tell you the same thing. On Dr. Coulson's advice Austin Bidwell decided to travel immediately, and he left with me two cheques—one drawn upon the Western Branch of the Bank of England and the other on Hartland and Co.—to obtain the balance of his account from both banks and invest the proceeds in United States bonds, which were to be forwarded to him in Paris. These cheques were in the first place drawn for the full amount. I thought it very likely that he might be induced to change his mind, and I had other cheques prepared, leaving a small balance on both accounts. These two cheques were cashed, and the proceeds left in my hands. The first forged bill as sent down to Birmingham on the 21st of January. Mr. Chabot has told you that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180089"></xptr>
               <p>it is his opinion that the endorsement "F. A. Warren" on the bills was in the handwriting of Warren. It was not. No one knows that better than I do, for I know all about it My hand was the one that put those endorsements on. Mr. Chabot also says the cheques by which the moneys were drawn from the two banks were in Austin Bid well's hand<lb></lb>writing, and were all signed at one sitting. Several of them were signed at one sitting, I quite agree with Mr. Chabot, but not by Austin Bid well. I can refer you in particular to the cheque which went to the Western Branch of the Bank of England, in which the name of Horton was mis<lb></lb>spelt. It is admitted that Austin Bid well was then on the way to Havaunah. Mr. Chabot does not state positively that these cheques were signed by Horton; the Continental Bank was perfectly well satisfied that they were sjgned by Horton, and I think the expert in that bank was quite as able to judge as Mr. Chabot whether the signatures were genuine. Now, then, I come to the accident on the Northern Railroad of France. When Austin Bidwell arrived at my quarters in England his first statement to me was this: "<hi rend="italic">Mac</hi>, I have had a most frightful escape from instant death, to be an escape, as perhaps any man has ever experienced. "He went on to elabo<lb></lb>rate his sentiments during the accident, and wound up by saying that such was the deep impression made on his mind iu those few moments of peril that he should certainly have nothing to do with anything not only affecting his personal convenience and his liberty and happiness, as far as that goes, but also place in jeopardy, according to the view from which he looked at it then, his eternal happiness. I think, Gentlemen of the Jury, that this is not at all a far-fetched statement, and is probably one that will commend itself to your attention as being worthy of a great deal of consideration—namely, that a man of his age could not have so absolutely and entirely for<lb></lb>gotten the sentiments implanted in him in youth as to be indifferent to such a warning. For myself, I am willing to confess that, probably from not having gone through that experience myself, I gave the matter but little attention, in fact, I laughed at it and laughed at him; but all I could say could not change his mind, and on the following Monday he left England. Now, as to the money which remained in his hands, he asked me to invest it for him in American bonds, about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In the meantime the first batch of forged bills had been presented, and part of the proceeds invested in United States bonds, through the medium of Messrs. Jay Cooke &amp; Co. When I went to Paris on the 28th I took those bonds with me. I met Austin there, to whom, by the way, a night or two before, I had sent 10,000 dollars, and when I went over I took the balance to him. Those 10,000 dollars he deposited for safe keeping with the American Agency. I went with him there to take them out, and while there I told him I had certain moneys that I was about to give him as soon as I could settle my affairs in London. It was useless to have money entirely idle, and I myself requested him to buy that very bill which has not been used but has been presented in evidence here. I wanted him to buy it on the ground of having already had some sort of acquaintance with these people, and he could do it better than I could. At that time I am bound to state that he had the most entire confidence that what I told him was true and exactly as I represented it to him, and, accordingly, he bought the bill In the course of our opera<lb></lb>tions on the Continent between Vienna and Frankfort last autumn, there was a good amount of money left uncollected, and Austin's visit to Frank<lb></lb>fort primarily was to collect that money. When he left Paris with the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180090"></xptr>
               <p>intention of going to Frankfort, I myself requested him to sell those bonds, without telling him that it was part of any fraud, for of a fraud at that time he had no conception whatever. I requested him to sell those bonds, and the balance that was due by him to me on a settle<lb></lb>ment I asked him to forward either by bill on London or New York. The balance was between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the manner in which he remitted that sum to me was in a bill from Baron Bethman for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn on the Russian Bank of Foreign Trade. When I returned to London I sent him a telegram, which has been produced here, asking him to buy certain small sighted bills; and I think, if all the papers in my trunk had been examined, one letter would have been found in which he stated he did not know to what I referred. When Austin Bidwell left England the evidence shows pretty clearly that he left everything in confusion as far as this business is concerned, and in a state of unreadiness. When the first bills were sent in to the bank the intention only was to recoup the loss on the money transactions and then clear out. But when the facility with which they were received and discounted was considered, it was determined to carry the thing further, and in order to do so it was necessary to get up bills, printing done, and stamps made, and there was very little time to do it in; it had to be in a hurry—at once. Mr. Giffard asked in his address to you what was the object of the account. The object was very plain. I do not propose to insult your understandings, gentlemen, by saying that a fraud was not contemplated at one time, but you may, perhaps, be inclined to believe that such a statement as I am now making is made only with one motive. Does it redound to my advantage, does it help to clear me at all, or do I state anything to you intrinsically improbable? I think not I have no doubt Mr. Giffard has had a great deal of experience in this sort of business, and I daresay he will believe me when I say that men engaged in illegitimate transactions do not place very much confidence in each other, or any more than they are absolutely bound to do; and if there was an intention, in spite of the withdrawal of one party, still to carry out the original scheme, it is not likely that party, after having entirely withdrawn, should be intrusted with any confidence concerning the scheme. He asks who were benefited by it; and if he sifts the matter to the bottom I think it could be very easily explained; but who was intended to be benefited by it, is another question. Mr. Giffard, in his opening address, said it was the belief of the prosecution that Austin Bidwell was on his way to Mexico. If that were their belief, I can only say it is well founded. He then referred to the package of bonds sent to New York addressed to Austin Biron Bidwell, care of the Safety Deposit Co. Of course it is very difficult to prove any such statement as this. Notwithstanding, it is the simple truth that that package never was intended for Austin Bidwell; and, if you think that is hardly the case, I might ask, if it was really intended for him why was it not sent to Vera Cruz, where he was going, instead of to New York, 1, 800 miles away from Vera Cruz. The printing and engraving of these bills were nearly all done after the 25th <hi rend="italic">of</hi> January. When Mr. Chabot was called at the Mansion House, he was very careful not to give any opinion as to the cheques and bills that were sent after he became aware that Austin Bidwell was not in England at the time, and it was only upon coming hero, after being in possession of all the circumstances, that he then gave it as his opinion that those bills were not signed by Austin Bidwell. Of course I do not presume to impugn Mr. Chabot. I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180091"></xptr>
               <p>no doubt whatever that his testimony is perfectly conscientious, but with such aids to help his decision, is it at all extraordinary that his testimony should have been precisely what it was yesterday. Since Mr. Chabot first took upon himself the profession of an expert, busi<lb></lb>ness of this kind, like that of every other, has made very great strides. It has become, as one of the newspapers said, an art I mean fraud of this description, and, although a very wretched, unhappy, miserable, and con<lb></lb>temptible art, it may be to a certain extent called an art nevertheless. Mr. Chabot would induce you to believe that these cheques were left signed by Austin Bidwell I am unwilling to allow that statement to be left as it was by Mr. Chabot on your minds when you come to meditate on your verdict. My only object is to make as much reparation as can be done to a person who, in spite of Mr. Giffard's statement as to its improbability, has been deceived and imposed upon, and has had his confidence violated. If I am successful in pressing that view of the case upon you, I shall have obtained all I can possibly ask for. If I am not successful, I gan only regret it; but I ask, when you go to consider your verdict, to bear in mind the statement I have made; to consider whether there is anything intrin<lb></lb>sically improbable in it, and to say whether it is at all likely that I would stand up here and, through any other motive than the one I have men<lb></lb>tioned, make observations which must necessarily be most prejudicial to myself. That is all, gentlemen, I have to say to you."

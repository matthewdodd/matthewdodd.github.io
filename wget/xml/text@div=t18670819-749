                  </hi> On 1st July, about twenty minutes to nine o'clock, I was in Endell Street, and had just passed Short's Gardens, when a man came in front of me, made a snatch at my watch chain, and broke it from the watch—I held my hand on my watch—I put up my stick, and was about striking him when the chain broke—the prisoner, I firmly believe, and another stood close at my elbow, and directly the chain dropped I was pushed backwards; I pitched on my shoulder and elbow, and my arm was broken—I saw three of them—I got up as quick as I could and went to Bow Street Station, and then to Charing Cross Hospital to have my arm set—I was sent for on Wednesday morning, went to Bow Street, and selected the prisoner out of fourteen or sixteen others—he sat in a corner—I told the policeman there was one man there who I did not like the looks of; he said, "Go in again, I will go with you," and the more I looked at him the more I felt convinced that he was the man—I should be very sorry to take a solemn oath, but it is the impression on my mind that he is the man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">F</hi>). On Wednesday morning, 3rd July, I took Elliott to see the prisoner in the jailor's room at Bow Street—he did not identify him, and left the Court—at that time the prisoner was sitting in the lobby with several other men—Elliott said something, but I do not think he could hear it—in consequence of what he said I took the prisoner in custody and told him it was for assaulting Elliott and attempting to rob him—he said, "I was not near the top part of Drury Lane on that night"—I had not mentioned the whereabouts, nor had Elliott—the top of Drury Lane is close to Short's Gardens.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he go there for the purpose of identifying the man who had robbed him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he came for the purpose of seeing another man who was in a room, and the prisoner was in the Court—we had to go through the lobby first—he did not go in first and come out again, nor did I then take him back again; if he says so it is not correct.</p>

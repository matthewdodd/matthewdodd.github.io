                  </hi>. I am a private, in the third batallion of Grenadier Guards. On Sunday morning, 22nd Feb., about 10 minutes past 12 o'clock, I was coming home through Broadway, to go home to barracks—the prisoner came up and caught hold of my medal—I sent his arm back, and walked on,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185704060111"></xptr>
               <p>when up came another, and hit me in the head, at the same time he caught hold of my medal—I collared hold of him, and pulled my belt off to the other man to keep him from assisting, and called for a policeman—the police-man came, and I saw the prisoner <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> my medal away; I still had hold of him—the policeman took hold of him, and I looked for my medal on the ground, but could not find it—it was fastened on my jacket, it was a Crimean medal, with four clasps—the value of it is about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, St. Almon's Hill, Westminster.

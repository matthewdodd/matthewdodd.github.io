                  </hi>. I am a dealer in marine stores—my house is in the parish of Whitechapel. On the night of the 7th of September I went out about eight or nine o'clock, and came home about twelve o'clock at night—when I opened the shop door we wanted a light, as my wife had fallen down the trap, which was open—it had been broken open—the trap door was forced up—that would let any body into the house—I called the police, and found the two prisoners underneath the dresser in the back promises—they had got there by entering the trap door—I know Longhurst—I believe he goes about the street picking up bones—he has dealt with me—I do not know Mahony—this copper, brass, and lead were found in a bag on the counter—the drawer was open which they had taken it out of—I had seen the bras and lead on my premises before—the bag belongs to them, and there was a little black silk handkerchief with 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in halfpence to them, on the counter, which I missed out of this box, where I kept my money—I had seen the money safe about eight or nine o'clock that night—I found the box moved from the mantel-piece on to the table in the parlour, and the halfpence gone out of it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the property</hi>)—I know I had this kind of lead in the drawer, and missed it, and one piece of the brass I can swear to—I know it by its being in my drawer and by the pattern—I had such a thing in my drawer—I gad seen it two or three times that day, and it was missing from the place after they were there—I had not fastened the flap of the cellar door, but it was shut down—it must be lifted up to be opened—a small flap lifts down to secure the big one—one must be lifted up to get the other up.</p>

            . I live in Little Earl-street, Seven-dials. On the 1st of July, about half past one o'clock in the morning, I was at the Fox and Goose public-house, King-street, Seven-dials. I had been locked out the night before, and met Smith, who said he was locked out, and that he was going to walk the streets; we walked about for two or three hours, till we saw the King's Head public-house open in James-street, Covent-garden. The prisoner was there, and asked us to drink with him, and we asked him to drink with us; there was a bustle in the house soon after; and I told Smith to take care of his watch, and as his fob was very large, I put it into my fob and bound it up in my apron; I left the King's Head about seven o'clock in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100052"></xptr>the morning, it was then safe, and I was quite sober; the prisoner came out with us and went into the Fox and Goose with us; we sat down in the tap-room - Smith and I rested our heads on the table, and went to sleep; the prisoner then set in the opposite box to us; I am sure the watch was safe in my fob, for I bound my apron tight round it. I had not laid on the table long before Smith awoke me, and asked for his watch; I found my apron untied and the watch gone, and the prisoner was also gone - he was taken next morning, and I saw it taken from his watch pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You had no watch of your own - A. No, we were in the streets from eleven till three o'clock; we had about two pots of beer between us, and were none the worse for liquor - my apron could not come undone of itself.</p>

            . I am a pearl worker. On the 1st of July, I was locked out, and met Pawley in the street about a quarter to twelve o'clock; we had been together that night, but separated to go home; I met him again, and we agreed to walk about as it was a fine night - we went into the King's Head; the prisoner was smoking his pipe there; he came up to me with a pot, and said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose you are locked out like myself, will you drink with me;" I did so, and passed the pot to Pawley; he afterwards drank with us - we were quite sober. We left the house about seven o'clock in the morning; I had given Pawley my watch to to take care of - he put it into his fob and bound his apron tight over it, it could not be seen. I said, I thought we could get in now - the prisoner asked which way we were going, and said he was going our way, and followed us without being invited - and at the end of King-street, he said if we would go into the Fox and Goose, he would treat us with whatever we liked - I sat down and went to sleep with my head on the table, being tired with walking about so long. I was awoke soon after by a young man - the prisoner was then gone - I awoke Pawley, and asked for my watch - his apron was loose about his heels, and the watch gone - I got an officer. I found the chain and one seal in pawn; a person afterwards brought me a seal which was attached to my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you fall asleep directly you went in - A. We might have talked a few minutes - we were quite sober.</p>

            . I am a journeyman baker, and live in Crawford-street, Mary-le-bone. I was lodging at the Fox and Goose, at this time. When I came down stairs the prisoner was in the tap-room, and the two witnesses asleep. The prisoner said they were his friends, and Pawley had property to the amount of twenty guineas - and I said, he should awake them - he said, he was afraid of Pawley's dog - after that, he went over the table on his hands and knees and struck Pawley, who was too sound to be awoke. I saw him put his hand under the apron which was rolled up, and put his hand into his pocket he then came over the table and went out. I awoke Smith immediately, and the watch was missed - nobody but the prisoner could have taken it; nobody else was in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He tried to awake Pawley - A. He shook him but could not.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the morning after the robbery, I found the prisoner in Leg-alley, Long-acre, and asked what he had done with the watch - he said,</p>
               <p>"I have got it in my pocket," and pulled it out with one seal I found the duplicate of another seal on him - he said, a young man, who was with him, had pawned the chain and kept the duplicate - that it was pawned somewhere about the Haymarket.</p>

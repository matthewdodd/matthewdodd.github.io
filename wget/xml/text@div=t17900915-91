               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. The mode of importing Chintz into this country is in a number of bales, carefully packed, or sewed up? - Yes.</p>

               <p>These goods are not imported into this country for importation here? - They are not permitted to be sold here; they are very frequently smuggled.</p>

               <p>There was no bale ticket in this bale? - I have not the invoice here; I have an extract from it; it contained damaged goods; it was an uncertain quantity, and a variety of goods.</p>
               <p>From the appearance of the bale, could you, who are used to these sort of packages, judge whether that bale had been opened or not? - I did not see the outside package, but from the whole of the inside package, it appeared to me to be, what we, in the usual warehouse phrase, call plundered; the inside package the wrapper had a hole cut through it.</p>

               <p>I am a company's officer; I take my orders from the warehouse-keeper; I perceived, by the appearance of these two bales, that they had been plundered, and the men opened them.</p>
               <p>Did you look at the other parcels that were left in the bales? - I did, at all of them.</p>
               <p>Dickinson. I compared the pieces that were found on the prisoner with the contents of these bales, and there was an exact similarity, the same sort of goods precisely, though I suspected that the piece of coloured goods was taken from a bale where a piece of the same sort was not left in the bale; but I compared it with the goods of the other plundered bale, and there was the exact pattern.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I understood you that they were both of them ullage goods? - The one that I saw open was, the other I rather think was a compleat bale.</p>
               <p>Court. Which of the bales was it that corresponded with these goods? - From the ullage bale; but there were goods like these, which are ullage goods, in that bale, excepting that bale was described as perfect goods, and there is an imperfect bale.</p>
               <p>This is an imperfect piece? - This is a piece that would not be sold at the Company's sale, as a piece of sound goods.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say then, that you suspect that they came out of the perfect or the imperfect bale? - I suspect that they all came out of the imperfect bale.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Rotherhithe-wall; I am a hairdresser; I have been acquainted with the prisoner seven or eight years.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing any thing of him in the month of July? - He came to me in the month of July, near the time.</p>
               <p>What time of day? - About eight in the morning; and he asked me the favour to lend him a couple of guineas: I knew him to be of a good principle, and I went up stairs to get it: he said he was going to buy something; I did not take notice: I am a journeyman; I was in my business, combing a gentleman's wig.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you understand he was in trouble? - Two days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you say you live? - Rotherhithe-wall.</p>
               <p>Is there such a house as the Cross-keys there? - Yes, I believe there is; I never was in the house in my life; it is some distance from our house, two or three minutes walk.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with him? - I have been acquainted with him seven or eight years; I have been out with him in company.</p>
               <p>Have you often lent him money? - I lent him once a trifle, and he paid me to my satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Had he generally such a sum of money as two guineas in his pocket? - Yes, he always paid very creditably; I never saw any thing dishonest of him in my life.</p>
               <p>CROFT JACKSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Walworth; a surveyor to the East-India company; I know the prisoner; I have seen him before; he has worked in the craft where I have been delivering the hoys on the quays; he always seemed to work very well, and was very honest and solid.</p>
               <p>I understand he wishes to examine you as to the mode in which the men do their work in the hoys? - There is myself in the hold of the hoy, and two belonging to the King, to take care nothing is pilfered out of the hoy: that day, the 21st of July, the stern of the vessel could only get in; we had no occasion to lay over the after-part of the hatches, because the crane would not reach beyond the beam; we had to roll the bales from forward all the way aft to the crane, before we came to the property; that was the way that the hoy was delivered: he was not there that day; there were three in the hoy delivering her.</p>
               <p>Court. In the bale hoy? - In the bale hoy that day.</p>
               <p>Could the prisoner then have opened a bale in the hoy, and have sewed it up again? - He was never in the inside of the hoy, if he was on the dock; I do not know; I was in the hold all the time: upon deck, he must have been in view of many people; it was impossible: there was one bale, I observed, was rather slack; it was tied up with foreign thread; where it was done, I cannot say; it was not done in the hoy; it was done before she was unloaded: but there was not a broken package that day; which is generally the case.</p>
               <p>How long had the ship delivered those bales into the hoy? - I believe, the day before; she was just arrived.</p>
               <p>Court. How do these hoys lay; what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150116"></xptr>quay was it? - I do not remember the name of the quay; it was a little above the Custom-house.</p>
               <p>What other hoy besides the bale hoy was there? - There was one that was close to the quay, which was a tea hoy; the bale hoy laid adjoining to the tea hoy.</p>
               <p>What vessel laid next to the bale hoy? - I think they were sugar-lighters, but I cannot be so positive to that.</p>
               <p>Were there a great number lay out for a good way? - A great many sugar-lighters about.</p>
               <p>Is that a place where small boats come in or ply? - There is the stairs just by.</p>
               <p>How near were the stairs? - About the length of a hoy.</p>
               <p>From it or to; which way, up or down? - There is one just above, and another just below, both ways.</p>
               <p>Are those stairs kept free for boats to go in and out? - They are blocked up frequently in the day.</p>
               <p>I suppose, when they are blocked up, the people come over the lighters or hoys, or whatever is near? - They get on shore in the best manner they can, and there are steps to get up on the quay.</p>
               <p>How high is a hoy out of the water? - Sometimes four foot, six foot, eight foot, out of the water; the sugar-lighters laying close to them, you may easily step out of one into the other.</p>

               <p>Could he on that day have opened a bale, and have plundered it, without your observing him? - Which way was it possible, when he was not there?</p>
               <p>Could he by any means have plundered a bale in that hoy? - It is not possible; because he was not there to do it, and when the bales go up; they go on the crane; but he never was below, nor no man else, ever to plunder; there are three of us there.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any alteration in one of the bales in any part of its sewing? - I cannot say; it is Mr. Jackson's business.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you there from the time that the hatches were unloaded? - The hoy came up between seven and eight; we boarded it; and in half an hour after she began to work.</p>
               <p>Was you there from the time that her hatches were unloaded? - The whole time; we never stir from the place as soon as we get entrance to go down.</p>
               <p>You was in the hoy then as soon as this man was stopped? - Yes. I heard there was a man stopped.</p>
               <p>Had you any curiosity to go and see who it was? - That was impossible; we are not allowed to go out of the hoy.</p>
               <p>How long do you remain in the hoy? - Till she is cleared; let her remain as long as she will, if it be a week: we are allowed three hours in the day to go on shore, when she is locked up; and then one remains there.</p>
               <p>But you do not lock down the hoy while you go to dinner? - There is no necessity, because the hoy was out; but we never move, nor go away, till the hoy is locked down; not one of us is allowed to go on shore; we are obligated both of us to be on board, only three hours out of the twenty-four; therefore it was impossible.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an extra porter. I have known him between four and five years, an extraordinary good character; I never heard any thing amiss: I understand that there is a person that has given evidence against him, that was in expectation of having a place from the East India Company; I mean one Jones.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Bristow. You, I think, was the witness that told me you was at the water side attending the landing? - The next hoy to that.</p>
               <p>Who was the officer that was attending the bale hoy? - His name is Heathfield: I knew nothing of the transaction till after the man was apprehended.</p>
               <p>It seems he came on shore from this hoy? - Yes: he must have passed from some other vessel; the situation of the two hoys was in that direction, that he must have come to the best of my knowledge immediately out of the bale hoy.</p>
               <p>What vessels lay beyond the bale hoy? - I really cannot say; there might be a number of sugar lighters.</p>

               <p>How are the stairs situated where the people land? - I cannot say whether the stairs were obstructed by boats or not; I had no suspicion of their coming from any place but the hoy; I first considered it a smuggling business, and gave directions to seize the hoy, till the bale appeared to be plundered.</p>
               <p>But that bale was sewed up again? - I only go so far as to say the possibility that a man might have concealed himself behind the bales, and opened it.</p>
               <p>Dickinson. I understood there was a man that was to prove that he was seen beckoned into the hoy? - There is a ticket porter of the name of Baldwin, that says he saw him beckoned into the bale hoy.</p>
               <p>TATTENHAM BALDWIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at work in the crane.</p>
               <p>How near is the crane to the bale hoy? - The chain runs into the bale hoy, to get the goods up: I cannot say how long the chain was.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of this prisoner that morning? - Yes, I did; there was a lighter of cotton that laid close to this bale hoy, and he laid on the lighter of cotton for some time; then I saw him jump off the deck into the hold of the hoy; he came off of the cotton into the bale hoy.</p>
               <p>Did you see him come off of the cotton into the bale hoy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did he remain in the hold? - A very little while, a few minutes: he went on shore over the tea hoy; but he was beckoned by some of them; when he jumped down he jumped down in a particular hurry: I saw the motion of the hand of some of them: there was Shorland was employed by Baker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What paper is that? - An account of the names of the people; I got a gentleman to write it down, because I would not be mistaken in what I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150118"></xptr>say; their names employed were Shorland and Milday: I saw a motion from somebody in the hold; and I saw him jump down, and come up again presently; and there was only Shorland employed by Baker and Willoughby; Hurd was not employed that day at all, nor was not paid when we went to be paid; he was in the hold, but he was not employed.</p>
               <p>How long did you see him on the cotton lighter? - A quarter of an hour as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Dickinson. There is an observation that occurred to me; the committee of directors, that gave me orders to prosecute this man, desired I would use any means adviseable by the Lord Mayor to endeavour to find out the gang, if I could, as the company had frequent losses; at the examination I asked the Lord Mayor what was proper; he recommended me to go to the prisoner; I went back to the warehouse, and when I arrived there one of the porters in the warehouse, who I had employed at the water side, said, he knew this man very well; I took him to the prison with me, and I there asked him who were concerned with him in the business; he was very averse to say any thing to me; I thought it was on account of the turnkey being present; then we went into another room; I said to him, pray what is become of the rest of those goods? he said, he knew nothing but of four pieces; I said, I suppose you know how the rest were taken? he said, he knew nothing but of four pieces, and they went down into the hoy again: the other person is present that was with me, and in court: I asked the prisoner how many pieces were taken; he said, he did not know but of four pieces more; I said, had you your share? there were twenty-six pieces taken; his answer was, he knew but of four pieces more, and they went down in the hoy, that is down the river, when the hoy went away from the quays.</p>
               <p>Court to Constable. Did I understand you right, that when you asked the prisoner how he came by these pieces that were found upon him, that he said, he had brought them out of the hoy? - He said so when he first came to the Poultry Compter; I am sure he said so at first.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure he said so? - I am quite sure, on my oath.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to ask the witness Baldwin, what time he saw the prisoner in the hoy? - I cannot tell the hour.</p>
               <p>How long before the alarm of his being taken up? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you ever in the employment of the excise? - I was.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - It is nine years ago.</p>
               <p>Did you turn yourself off, or was you discharged? - No; I was discharged.</p>
               <p>Is it a fair question to ask for what? - I can tell you what it was for.</p>
               <p>If you please? - My lord, it was a few gallons of liquor laid against us before our board of excise; but nothing was sworn against us.</p>
               <p>Did you say a few gallons or two? - I said a few gallons.</p>
               <p>So, though nothing was sworn, you was discharged? - Yes; we were discharged on circumstances; it was found in the next ship, and they thought it came out of ours.</p>
               <p>That is, in plain English, they were wicked enough to suspect you had stolen it? - No, not stolen it.</p>
               <p>I believe you have said, that you expect a place under the India Company in consideration of your evidence? - I never asked such a thing.</p>
               <p>Nor never mentioned it to any body? - I never in my life mentioned any such thing to nobody, upon my oath that I have sworn.</p>

               <p>Stanton.

               <p>Court. Is the constable a parish constable? - A constable of the ward of the tower.</p>

I understand this visit you paid to the man in goal was in consequence of the recommendation of the Lord Mayor; was the prisoner present when his lordship desired you not to say any more in publick? - I cannot be positive; I did stay after he was gone: the reason I took the person with me was, that he knew him.</p>
               <p>Be so good to tell us whether it was not conveyed to this man by some means or other, that it would be better for him to speak out, or speak explicitly? - I said, who are your accomplices? without any introduction: he said, what is to be the consequence if I inform you? I said, I have no terms to offer; if you chuse to suffer me to convey any information to the office, I shall be ready to convey it.</p>
               <p>Did not you feel, and do not you feel, that he did it in hopes of a benefit? - I thought he expected the benefit that he has had, that he was not indicted capitally.</p>
               <p>Did not he expect favor in the prosecution? - Not in the mode the prosecution is carried on; I do not think he had any reason to expect it; I told him, I can have no kind of animosity against you, you have not robbed me; I am merely an agent.</p>

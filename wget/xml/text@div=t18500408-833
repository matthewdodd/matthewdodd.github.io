                  </hi>. I keep the Crown public-house, in Great Ornond-yard. The prisoner was my potman—on 13th March, on my return home, I found he had been drinking—from some information, I went into the cellar and found the tap of the puncheon of rum was running about the cellar—the earth of the cellar was damp; it would take the impression of a shoe—I found the prints of the nails of a shoe there—I nave compared the prisoner's shoes with the marks—they appear to be made by them—I asked the prisoner for the key of his room, which is on the ground-floor—he was rather flurried, and said he could not find it, lie thought he had sent it in his jacket pocket to the washer-woman, but it was in the door—I found, in the cupboard in room, two gallons of gin in a stone bottle of mine, and a pewter-pot full of gin on the table—he followed me into the room, and I asked him if he was not ashamed of himself—I ordered him to take his things, and go off about his business—he returned, and I put him out; he returned again, and I gave him into custody—I found a bottle of rum, and another of gin, in the coal-cellar—I noticed the flavour and quality of the gin; that in the pint-pot on the table, was from the puncheon in the cellar—I generally keep the key of the cellar in the bar—the prisoner had access to it—he sleeps in that room, and keeps the key—he had left the key in the door—I do not allow him to take the key of the cellar, and go in.</p>

On the 20th of May, between nine and ten o'clock in the day, I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Lord Cook</hi> schooner, steering—I am the captain—the wind was south-east-east, a fresh breeze—I was making from the north shore to the south shore, to the upper part of Half-way reach, which is beyond Woolwich, going down the river—I saw a boy in a Peter-boat—I had towed him from Woolwich—he let go of his own accord, and appeared to be pulling down the river—I saw a ballast-lighter, belonging to the Trinity-house, coming down the river, astern of me—I did not notice how many men were on board—I saw a man at the helm—I did not notice whether there were more than one—she was going from the north shore to the south—there were</p>

               <p>several vessels tacking about, but none to interfere with its motion, until the accident occurred—I did not hear an alarm, but saw the ballast-lighter in contact with the Peter-boat—the boat went down, and the boy in it—I saw the wreck of the boat afterwards, but never saw the boy again—a smack sent off a boat towards the wreck—the lighter did not stop or put about, but proceeded on its course—I cannot say whether the people on board knew what had taken place, but some time after I saw a boat proceed from the ballast-lighter—the boy was rowing against a head-wind—it was a smart breeze—the vessel was under command—I saw some people on deck immediately after—I was not noticing it till the accident occurred—if there had been a look-out kept I should think they must have seen the boat—the boy was master of his boat—he was going down with the tide—I should sup<lb></lb>pose be could get out of the way of danger, if he had either stopped hit boat, or pulled along—the vessel was sailing across the river—I do not know who was navigating her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fisherman, and live at Greenwich. I belong to a fishing-smack, in which I was sailing down the river with eight others—I saw the boy in the boat rowing down the river—we stood to the south—we asked him how far he was going—he said, "To Rainham"—my brother, who is master of the smack, said he would give him a tow if he pulled along<lb></lb>side, but he could not catch us—we saw no more till a boy in our boat said, "Oh, master, he is run over"—I and another man hauled out our boat directly, and when I got within two strokes of him he went down—I put the oar down into the water, but could not feel him—at that time the lighter's boat came to the spot, within a minute or two—I think if they had heaved the vessel round directly, and jumped into the boat they might have saved the lad, but they kept right on till they got right over the river—they did not heave about directly—we saw hands on board—if there had been a look-out, I think it might have been prevented—I saw the wreck of the Peter-boat—I do not know who navigated the lighter.</p>

I am master of the smack, I saw the boy in the Peter-boat, and spoke to him a few minutes before the accident occurred—I was walking the deck, and the lad said, "The boy is run over"—I turned, and saw the boat—I consider, if the lighter had been looking out, it might have been prevented—I can venture to say, if I had been looking out in my boat, and they told me they saw a boat in time, I could have cleared her—it is the duty always to keep a look-out—they got out a boat afterwards.</p>

I was in the ballast-lighter on this day—the prisoner was steering her—I saw the Peter-boat when we were a yard or two from it, and called to the prisoner—he did not hear me—I called again, and told him to look out forward for the boat—he answered me, but I did not hear what he said, it blew so hard—I then saw the boat come in contact with the lighter—I directly ran after the boat-hook, and when I came forward the boat was gone—directly afterwards I and the prisoner got into the boat—the man who <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the chain dropped it overboard, and we could not haul it in—we lost time by that—I saw nothing to blame in the prisoner—we supposed the boy was going to take a tow, as he tried to take a tow of the lighter a-head of him, and the man would not allow him, because he was afraid he would be pulled out of the boat.</p>

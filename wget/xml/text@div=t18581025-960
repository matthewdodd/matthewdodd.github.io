                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Cullis, a tobacconist, of 105, High-street, Poplar. On 24th September, the prisoner came about half-past 7 o'clock in the evening and asked for half an ounce of tobacco; I served him—he gave me half-a-crown; I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and he left the shop—I put the half-crown in the corner of the till by itself, there was no other half-crown there—in a few minutes after the prisoner was gone, I sent the half crown out for change by Marshall and he brought it back bent—I then found it was bad—I put it in the bottom of the cash-box away from other money—I locked the box and put the key in my pocket—the next morning I straightened the half-crown for convenience, but it remained in the bottom of the box. On Tuesday, 5th October, the prisoner came again for an ounce of tobacco—he paid me with a crown—I told the girl to go out and get change, and whispered to her to bring in a policeman, which she did—I gave the crown and the half-crown to the policeman—and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

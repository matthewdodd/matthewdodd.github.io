                  </hi>. I live at the East Pavilion, Sloane Street, Chelsea—the prisoner has been my tenant about two years, of a baker's shop, at 35, New Road—he had been there two years without paying me—he was living on the rent he was receiving, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—he let out the greatest part of the house to lodgers—he had always about nine or ten people in the house—about two years ago he paid me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was to pay me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month—for two years I have got nothing from him—I made application for it, and he told me to do what I pleased, they were in force there, they were in possession—this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not in my hand-writing—I never in my life gave the prisoner any authority to sign my name to any receipt, certainly not—some time before he was taken into custody a man named Smith called on me—in consequence of what passed between us, he went first to the prisoner's house, and I afterwards went my-self, and met there Mr. Smith and Mr. Firman—they were looking at the receipts—as soon as I saw this receipt I said to the prisoner, "Well, you have forged my name; that is not mine"—he became quite pale, and said, "Well, I will tell you the truth: I was wanting to borrow some money from my society," showing me a loan society's card, " and I could not get the money without your receipt, and that is the reason why I forged your name, but I am very sorry for it"—I said to him, "But you attempted to defraud Mr. Smith, and to get his money for your business by saying no rent was due"—he made no reply to that—he could not make any—Mr. Smith gave the receipt to Mr. Firman, and when we left Mr. Firman said to me, "You had better take the receipt," and I said, "I will do so, but you must put your initial on it"—I afterwards put an execution in the house—this was on the Friday before the prisoner was taken—he was taken on the Monday, three days after.</p>

               <p>time, that he had written the receipt by your direction, in order that Smith might buy the business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I have never in my life given him authority to sign my name—not on any occasion whatever—I don't know that he has signed it, except on that receipt—I will explain to you why it was I allowed him to be two years without paying me any rent—the people were in force, the number makes the force—there were always a dozen, and when I asked for rent I was always threatened and told to do what I pleased, and I did not dare even to put an execution in, because they would have burnt down the house—about fifteen days before the tax gatherer put in an execution (I have the execution here) and they beat the two men, and took back the goods and broke the carts and the goods—a fortnight before a policeman took one of them in charge, who was fined by the Magistrate 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw all this myself—I spoke to the policeman, and I had to pay the taxes, without receiving a single farthing—the prisoner owes me about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods, because I was in the beginning trying to do what I could for him, thinking he would succeed—he bought flour from me, which he did not pay for—I said to him, "Well, you must try to sell the business; we can't go on in this way"—I was trying to get rid of him the best way I could—I told him to try and sell the business, but he did not take my advice—he would not go out—I told him perhaps a hundred times to go away—I told him to put an advertisement in the paper—I don't know that there was an advertisement put in—I never saw one—if I had seen the advertisement I should remember it, but I don't think I ever saw any advertisement—he paid me nothing at all when he went into the business—I did not let it to him myself—Mrs. Holmes, who had the business, had some arrange<lb></lb>ment with him—he gave me a reference—I have not seen 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he paid when he went in for the goodwill of the business—perhaps he has paid it—I heard he paid something, but I don't know the amount—I don't know that he expended a sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to convert the place into a baker's shop—it was a baker's shop before—I mean to swear that Mrs. Holmes let it to him—she came to me and said, "Well, I have lost my husband, and you will oblige me if you will allow me to substitute the business;" and I gave her permission to do so—she always paid me very well, and she was a woman of good conduct, and I put no obstruction in her way—it was not a baker's shop when she had it—she was selling bread and grocery—there was an oven there when she took it—the oven has been there since nine years—I swear that it has always been a baker's shop—I have never told the prisoner to write to millers for large quantities of flour, and to make use of and sign my name to the letters—never have I given him permission to sign my name—I don't know a Mr. Ram—(<hi rend="italic">Ram was called into court</hi>)—I know that man, he is one of the lodgers—I have seen him before in the street—I never knew his name until now—I never spoke to him—I did not in his presence tell the prisoner to write to millers for flour, and to sign my name to the letters, and I may add that Ram was one of the mob who took the goods and beat the brokers—I never told the prisoner in Ram's presence to get a customer for the business, and to tell the cus<lb></lb>tomer that he was doing a good trade—I never saw the advertisement—it is very likely I told him what he ought to say in the advertisement—I advised him to put in an advertisement—it may be I wrote it down for him myself—I never said, "We shall have forty applications; send them all to me," or anything to that effect—it may be I said, "A business is to be sold at 35, New Road; apply to such a place"—I left the place to him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170052"></xptr>
               <p>very likely—I did not describe it as a flourishing business, because it was not flourishing—the shop is in very good order, and if it had been conducted well it would have been a good business—I described it as a baker's business—of course I concealed the fact that it was a bad business—I wished to have another tenant—I did not say to the prisoner, "I have got a gentleman with 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to invest in the business, and we must not lose him; we must make things look as well as we can; you must tell him the rent and taxes are paid"—I knew Mrs. Loose, the prisoner's mother—she was living in the house—I did not in her pre<lb></lb>sence tell the prisoner that a gentleman was coming after the busi<lb></lb>ness, and that he was to be sure and say that the rent and taxes were all paid—I swear positively I never said so, or anything like it—I did not on any occasion in her presence tell the prisoner to order flour and sign my name to the letters—I have seen James Loose, the prisoner's brother—I don't know him—he lives in the house—I did not in his presence say to the prisoner, "Make use of my name in any way you like to get flour, and sign my name to the letters"—certainly not—I don't know a person of the name of Eliza Downing—(<hi rend="italic">called in</hi>)—she is the niece of the prisoner—there were half a dozen living on me—she is one of them—I did not say to the prisoner in her presence, "If you are going to write about coals or flour you can sign my name to the letters"—I don't know Alfred Downing—(<hi rend="italic">called in</hi>)—I don't recollect his face, and I don't think I ever saw him—I did not in his presence, about twelve months ago, give a paper to the prisoner, and tell him to make a fair copy of it, and sign my name at the bottom—these premises were about being pulled down—for three years they have been going to pull them down, and that was the reason why I did not put in an execution—I would not take the chance of being murdered, perhaps, by these people, when they would be sent out by the company—that was the reason the prisoner agreed to forego any claim that he might have for compensation for the pulling down of the premises; but what claim could he have?—he agreed to forego any claim of his—he had no business—I did not offer him anything—I was always asking for money—I had no understanding with him—I put in a distress for rent when I heard of the forgery—that was too strong—I may have said I would allow him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for bread and potatoes if he would give up pos<lb></lb>session to Mr. Smith—I was always trying to get him to give up possession—I did not offer it myself—I was telling him to get out of the place, and do the best he could, if Mr. Smith would take him; but Mr. Smith would have nothing to do with the shop since the forgery—the distress may have been put in before the forgery—I don't know that it was before the distress was put in that I told him if he gave up possession he would have some allowance made him—very likely I said that I would make an allowance to him of all that was due, if he would give up possession quietly—I promised him nothing myself, except to forgive him all that was owing to me—I always said that, before and after the distress, and begged him to leave the place quietly—he owed me 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had discovered the forgery before I put in the distress—I never promised to let him go for the forgery—I always said that if he would leave the house I would forgive him all he owed me—he always refused to give up—I never spoke to him after the forgery—I sent my coachmen to him, and said, "Tell that man to go quietly out of the house, and I will not ask him for a penny of what he owes me; he owes me 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I make him a present of it; but he must leave the place quietly"—my coachman brought me back word that he would go, but he never</p>

               <p>went—I sent him four times—he did not go, and then I gave him into custody—my coachman is not here—the prisoner always sent word that he would go—after he was locked up I went to the house—an execution had been put in, and those people in the house stole some of the goods—I said to the prisoner's mother, "Well, you must go; you have not only robbed me, but you have robbed the broker of the goods seized, and you had better go"—then Mr. Firman, who was with me, persuaded her to go quietly, and she went—it may be she said she had no home to go to, or something of that kind—I said, "You can go to your son's"—I did not say, "Go to the devil if you like"—I will swear that she was not turned out of the house; she went out—Mr. Firman pressed her to go, and she walked out—Mr. Smith has not got the house now—I am in bargain with him, but it is not settled—he is to pay the same rent—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been named for fixtures—the sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has never been named—Mr. Smith did not come to me in consequence of the advertisement.</p>

I wanted to get a loan; they would not grant it without a receipt for my rent, and that is why I did it"—we then went away, and Mr. Bissett took the receipt.</p>

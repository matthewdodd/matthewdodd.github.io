            . I keep a cab. On Saturday morning, about two o'clock, I was near the top of Holborn-hill -I was called out of the watering-house, and saw the prisoner standing by my cab - he asked if I was engaged; I said I was going home - he said he had been looking for a cab for half an hour; I asked where he wanted to go - he said he wanted to take a few things from his stable to his lodgings; he had got a dog and a whip with him - I went with him across Smithfield, down St. John-street, and Compton-street, and stopped by Parcival-street - he told me to wait there; he returned to me in about five minutes with the property - I saw the saddles but not the bridles; I drove him to White Hart-yard, Drury-lane - he got out, and knocked at, I think, No. 2; he told me it was his lodging - a Policeman came up, examined the property, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What became of you? A. I was taken to the watch-house, but not detained more than a quarter of an hour - the property was all tied up together, and I could not see the bridles.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in White Hart-yard, and saw Thorn with the cab - I saw the prisoner get out, with a dog; he threw the apron of the cab over; I said, "What have you here?" he said, "Harness;" I questioned him - he said it was his own, that he lived at No. 2, and his name was Green; I said, "Your name is not Green, I know who lives here;" he said he did live there - I took him to the watch-house; there were three bridles, three saddles, and a chaise whip.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not take the cab driver? A. Only to take the property - no charge was made against him; I asked where he first took the prisoner up - he said,"Over the water, on this side the Elephant and Castle;" I asked the prisoner where he brought the harness from, and he said, the Elephant and Castle.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL to THOMAS PENNINGTON. Q. Have you any other Christian name? A. My name is Thomas Charles.</p>

               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How long is it since you signed your name as Thomas Charles? A. I cannot say - I generally write my receipts Thomas only; I will not swear I have not written the name Thomas Charles within the last twelve months - I am not so well known by that name as Thomas only.</p>

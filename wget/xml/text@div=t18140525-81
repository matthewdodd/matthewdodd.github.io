When I awoke, I was told my pocket-book was gone; I felt in my pocket; my pocket-book was gone. I went into the street, and fetched the prisoner in again. My pocket-book was brought back to my house by a little boy, with thirteen pounds in it. There was sixteen pounds in it altogether when I went into the house; there was a two pound note and a one pound note missing. I have never seen them again. I know I had sixteen pounds in notes in my book.</p>

            . My son-in-law keeps the Town of Newcastle public-house, New Gravel-lane. The prosecutor and the prisoner came in with another woman and a man, who said he had come out of a French prison. They were altogether. After that, the prisoner walked out of the tap-room, and came to me in the house with a pocket-book; she said, here is a two-pound note and a one-pound note, which I perfectly saw in the middle sold of the pocket-book; she said, I shall be in in a few minutes. At the time, I thought the man had given her it to take care of. In about a quarter of an hour, I went into the tap-room; he said he had been robbed. I said, my friend, the girl that was with you has got it; she shewed me a pocket-book with a two pound and a one pound note in it. In a little time, a lad came in; he said, here is a pocket-book I have found. I delivered it to the prosecutor; I asked him if he knew what was in it; he said, yes. I told the prosecutor he was very lucky to have it. He afterwards charged her with taking the two pound note and the one pound note. When the pocket-book was brought back there was a ten pound note in it, and three one-pound notes. I believe the prisoner was so intoxicated she did not know what she did.</p>

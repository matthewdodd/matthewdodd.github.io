                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the Royal Horse Artillery, at Woolwich. On Monday afternoon, the 26th of April, I gave my wife a sovereign, which she put into a box in my room—we only occupy one room—it is a lodging-house—the landlord does not live in it—the pri<lb></lb>soner was present when my wife put the sovereign into the box—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what I afterwards heard from my wife, I sent for the prisoner, and asked her if she had taken the money out of the box—she denied it, but said rather than be charged, she would go and borrow one, and give it me in place of it.</p>

On the 26th of April, I placed a sovereign in a box in our room—the prisoner was present —she went away soon afterwards—I went out at a little after three o'clock, think, but I have no clock—I locked the room-door, and put the key on a nail, between two laths outside the door—the prisoner knew where I put it—she was brought up from a child with me—I was absent about half an</p>

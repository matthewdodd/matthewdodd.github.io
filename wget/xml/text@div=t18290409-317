On the 3d of April I was at home, and in consequence of information I saw Pettet about half-past one o'clock in the passage of My house; he demanded 120l. for six years' back rent - I told him I did not owe any such money; I asked him to walk up stairs - he followed me up, accompanied by two more men, who I cannot identify; Pettet pulled out a paper, and read it - I do not know what it was; he then demanded the rent in the name of

             - I should not know the paper again, for I did not have it; I never heard of William Chapman in my life - Pettet said his own name was John Smith; he asked me to open my lodger's door, whose name is Bennett - I told him I could not, for my lodger was out; his door was fastened with a padlock outside - I was very much alarmed; he told me not to flurry myself, for I should have five days to replevie if he was in the wrong - when I said I could not open Bennett's door, he said he could not wait a minute; I said, "I have another way backwards, if you will wait while I go round and see if that is open;" he said he should not wait a minute - he rushed by me, and wrenched the padlock off before my face; he went into the room, and the two men with him - I did not go into the room; I went down-stairs, and went out to look for my brother - I was absent nearly a quarter of an hour; when I came back there was a van at the door loaded with goods - I thought I saw a table on it which was mine; I did not notice any thing else - when I got into the house it was nearly empty, and the house was so full of people in the passage I could hardly get in; I found Mr. Butler there, who is the rent-gatherer for Mr. Ray - he has been so about ten or eleven years; I never knew any other rent - gather during that time - I had some conversation with Butler, and then fetched Hawthorne, the officer: he came back with me - Pettet was then standing at the post of the parloar-door, and I gave a charge of him - the constable asked him by what authority he took the goods; he refused to show his authority; he said he was not going; to have it turn up - two tables were taken out of the house, four chair, two brass candlesticks, one pair of cotton stockings, and some crockery; the house was nearly empty - I had never received any notice not to pay the rent to Butler.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Since you have been tenant of these premises has any person demanded rent from you, except Mr. Ray and Butler? A. Not since Mr. Ray has had the house; before that Mr. Barker did - I have not paid any rent for four years, because I have a little property which I cannot get at, and Mr. Ray is so kind as to wait for it; I am confident Pettet did not say he had come as an agent of Smith or by his authority - he said his own name was Smith; I was very much alarmed, but I am certain of that; he demanded the rent in the name of Chapman, and said his own name was Smith: he did not represent that he was acting for Smith; I first saw him in the passage; I think the door was shut when I saw him; the passage was full of people, when he refused to show his authority for fear it should be torn up - he did not say I should have a list of the articles taken away; he was asked for the inventory, and said he had got it, but would not show it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When it was discovered to be an improper seizure - a good many things were put back into the house? A. Yes; I was not present then - I did not know Martin before; he was not taken into custody - he went to Worship street of his own accord, and attended twice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do you know Petit? A. Yes; I had not seen him before; a little boy let him in at the street door - he told Butler he had shewn his authority to so many, he was afraid it would he torn up; I think the whole of the things were not put into the van at the time he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make the least resistance? A. Yes; he would not go to the office for some time; he did not say he had shown his authority to the proper person, and they had no right to take him.</p>

            ; Petter was desired to cease- he was stopped with a table, and he insisted on taking it out, saying he was acting under the authority of the King: Hawthorne was sent for - he came, and took Pettet into custody; I saw Pettet take some chairs and tables out of Miss Howorth's room - and he took some candlesticks out of my hand; the things in the room were her's, but I had the use of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who brought the things in? A. I brought some in - some persons at the door took them off the van - some were in the passage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did not Pettet shew an authority at the time this took place? A. I saw him show some sort of paper at one time to some of the persons, but what it was I do not know - he afterwards refused to shew it to Butler.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say you might take some things, if you could get them out before some persons came to the house? A. If I could do it before the van came: I never heard him say he was agent to Smith; the things were brought back after he was in custody; some of the other lodgers' things were also brought back - but not till after he was in custody.</p>

            . I am a fishing-tackle maker, and lodge at Miss Howorth's, on the ground-floor. About half-past one o'clock on this day I was in Miss Howorth's room, and heard somebody call out Miss Howorth - I opened her room door, and saw Pettet and White, and a man in top boots, standing in the passage; I said, "Miss Howorth, you are wanted," and she went out - in about five minutes I went into Gardner's room; I found nobody there but Gardner and his brother - Pettet came into the room; I asked him who authorised him to come and make a seizure in that room; he told me to mind my own business, or else he would charge a constable with me, and said he was acting under the King - he said he wanted 120l. for six years' back-rent; I said, "This young man don't owe any rent, he has got three or four weeks good yet" - he told me again to mind my own business, or else he would charge a constable with me; I said, "You won't be so hard - this poor young man has got but one hand, let him have a thing or two that he gets his living by." I asked him for his nets, his fishing canns, and gun; he said, be quick, for directly the van came he should clear the house immediately - I went up stairs into Miss Howorth's bed-room, and got two or three small things out, and when I came down the van was at the door, partly loaded - Martin was in the van; I saw Hillick bringing a trunk down stairs; he took it to the van - Pettet at that time was giving the men directions to be quick; and I saw Pettet with a table in the passage just before Butler came - it had been taken from Miss Howorth's room; after this Pettet was taken into custody - I afterwards assisted in unloading the van; Watts, the street-keeper, was there - I was in the van; Martin asked who authorised me to move the goods from the van - Watts showed his staff and said, "I authorised him." Martin said,"Where am I to get my money from?" I said, "You must look to those who employed you." Martin assisted me in moving the heaviest things directly Watts showed, his staff.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He was the owner of the van? A. I believe so; he gave assistance when he found things were not right, and so did all the prisoners except Petit, but he was not there - Hillick<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090145"></xptr>said he was glad it had turned out as it did, and that the things had not been taken away, when he found it was an illegal seizure, and so did White; they all appeared to be acting under Pettet's order.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Was Petit given into custody - before or after the seizure was completed? A. The van was very nearly loaded when he was taken; whether any thing was put into it after he was taken I cannot say - it was never wholly filled; Pettet said he had proper authority, and if I interrupted him, he should give me into custody - I saw nothing put into the van after he was taken.</p>

            . I live at No. 92, Mary-street, Hampstead-road; I am employed by Mr. Ray to collect his rents, and have been employed so about ten years - among others I collected from Miss Howorth; I abstained, by direction of Mr. Ray, from pressing her for rent - she owed between four and five years' rent; on Friday, the 3d of April, I went to her house, and saw a great number of persons at the door, and also a van partly laden with household furniture, as it appeared to me - I went into the house, and saw Pettet and Hillick nearly at the bottom of the stairs; Hillick was carrying a table, and Pettet behind him - I insisted on their not taking it out of the house -I stopped it, as the passage was narrow, and desired them not to remove any thing out of the house; Hillick stopped directly, and Pettet said, if any body interrupted him in what he was doing, he would send for a constable and give them in charge - I asked him to show me his authority for making the distress; he told me he should not show it me at all - I insisted on seeing it, and then we went into a back room; he produced a paper, which he held with both his hands, leaving only a part of it to be seen - I read part of it, and asked him who put in the distress, and he said William Chapman, whose name was on the paper; I asked him his name, and he said it was

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. He held the authority in both hands, did you get it into your hands? A. Never. I have collected the rent about ten years; I believe a claim has been set up to the premises by a person of the name of Young; nobody else that I know of- there is, I believe, an action in the Court of King's Bench which is not yet decided.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. The action is by Mr. Young? A. Yes. I never heard the name of Chapman or Pettet; I have received the rent for all these houses ever since I have collected for Mr. Ray.</p>

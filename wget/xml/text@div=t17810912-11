               <p>On the 22d of August, between nine and ten at night, I went into a public house in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120010"></xptr>

After we had drank three pots of beer, I rose up, and said, I will go away: the prisoner laid hold of me, and said I should not go; so did one Spriggs, who is gone for a soldier; and Spriggs was in company with the prisoner when I first saw him. While Thompson held me by the right arm, Spriggs pulled the watch out of my pocket: I laid hold of the watch, and got it back again. Thompson denied having any knowledge of Spriggs, or his intention of taking the watch. (The Constable produces the watch.)</p>
               <p>The Landlord deposes, That the prosecutor made an alarm that he had lost his watch; but that he did not know who had it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor asked me to go and drink part of a pint of porter. We went into a public house, and had three tankards of beer: when we were calling for the fourth, the prosecutor made an alarm, and said, the other young fellow wanted to take his watch out of his pocket; he went out, and gave charge of us: he wanted us to go for soldiers: the young fellow was willing to go, knowing himself guilty. I never saw him before: I know nothing of him.</p>

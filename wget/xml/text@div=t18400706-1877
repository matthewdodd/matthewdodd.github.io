                  </hi>. I am a builder, I reside in London at the present time, and had done so one week before the 10th of June last. About six o'clock n the evening of the 10th of June I was standing by the column under the portico of the north wing of Buckingham Palace—I had gone there about half an hour before—I was standing waiting for the approach of the Queen—I saw her Majesty come out of the wooden gate of the north wing, (I believe it is called the garden-gate,) in a low open carriage, accompanied by Prince Albert—the carriage turned to the left, up Constitution-hill—there was a postilion and four horses—the top of the carriage about leached even with my forehead—I am not acquainted with the name of it—it was a low open one with four wheels—I was on the left-hand side of the carriage—there were no military in attendance on the carriage—there were four out-riders, two a little in advance, and the others a distance be<lb></lb>hind—there were no other attendants on the carriage, that I am aware of.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, on that day, see the prisoner any where? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first I saw of him was after the carriage came out—I turned short across the corner, up Constitution-hill, to get a second view of her Majesty, and then I saw Oxford—he was on the right side of the carriage, on the footpath next the iron-railing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a spectacle-maker—my place of business is in Copthall-court—my residence is in London-wall. I was in the Park on the evening of the 10th of June—my attention was attracted by the cortege of the Queen and the carriage her Majesty was in—I saw her Majesty sitting in the carriage on the left-side—Prince Albert was on the right—I was running by the side of the carriage on the left side, the wall side, the side on which the Queen sat. and heard the report of fire-arms—I was then about three yards from the carriage I should think.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in advance of it, or behind, or what? <hi rend="italic">A,</hi> At the side, exactly at the side of the carriage—the noise attracted my attention in that direction, and I saw the smoke ascend—the carriage passed on a short</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184007060055"></xptr>
               <p>distance, and then I saw the prisoner with a pistol in his right hand—his right arm dropped—he turned round as if to see if any body was at his elbow, and to me it appeared that he pointed the second pistol across his right hand—he fired it towards the carriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had he the pistol in that direction before he fired it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not an instant—my nephew was with me—I immediately ran across and seized the prisoner—my nephew seized the pistols—some one came up I believe and took a pistol out of my nephew's hand at the time, and collared my nephew, upon which the prisoner said, "It was I, it was me that did it"—I had at the time he said that, got hold of him by the collar and his arm—we walked about twenty yards, and the policemen came up, and going along the road towards the station-house, after the policemen had come up, I said to my nephew, "Look out, Albert, I dare say he has some friends"—the prisoner turned round, and said, "You are right, I have "—I kept hold of him till we got down to Gardener's-lane station-house, and then he was taken into the station-house by the policemen—myself and two or three more had hold of him at the time—I never let' go.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About what distance do you judge the prisoner to have stood from the carriage at the time you saw the smoke? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three yards—the carriage was quite open, and was going at a slow pace—that three yards would be shortened I think about three quarters of a yard by stretching out his arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the muzzle of the pistol would be within little more than two yards of the carriage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say so—he appeared to take a deli<lb></lb>berate aim—when I saw him fire he was about a yard from the railing which encloses the Green Park—the nearest gate by which any one could enter the' Green Park was about one hundred and fifty yards from where this happened—the railing is quite open.</p>

               <p>the pathway up against the railing—I had hold of him before he said, "It is I"—he appeared desirous that it should be known he was the person who did it—we had got a short distance from where this occurred, when I told my nephew to be cautious, for probably he had friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Either when the prisoner said, "Yes, I have friends," or at any other time in the transaction, did you see any persons whatever in his com<lb></lb>pany? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in his company—there were plenty had got hold of him—I had an idea at the time that the witness Clayton was with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Princes-street, Leicester-square. I was on Constitution-hill on the evening of the 10th of June—when the Queen's carriage approached I was stand<lb></lb>ing about 200 yards from the marble arch of the palace, on the side where the wall is, the garden side—I heard ft pistol fired—the car<lb></lb>riage</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184007060058"></xptr>
               <p>was then about twenty-eight yards from me, or it might be thirty, nearer to the palace than I was—I was in company with my brother, and on hearing the report I said, "Good G—d, <hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi>" and instantly ran off towards the spot—I crossed the road, and ran down to where I heard the report—when I came abreast of the horses I heard a second report—I was in the act of crossing the road when I heard the second report—I ran on, I never ceased—the horses stopped, and her Majesty arose in the car<lb></lb>riage, and looked round, with no fear on her countenance neither—her Majesty's back was towards the palace—I was crying out, "Where are they who did it?"—I ran on and could not see how long her Majesty's carriage stopped—I did not see it go—I passed the carriage, and ran on to the spot where I saw the smoke—I saw two persons, one with his back to the railing, on the park side—I inquired, "Where are they who did it?"—a female said, "That is the man who did it"—she pointed to the two, but I judged it to be the man standing with his back to the railing, which was Albert Lowe—I said, "You confounded rascal, how dare you shoot at our Queen?"—the prisoner heard me say so—he was nearer to me than Albert Lowe was—I spoke in a loud voice—the prisoner said, "I did it; I give myself up; I will go quietly"—I took hold of his coat—the mob rushed in, and seized me, and knocked the pistol out of my hand on the ground—I stooped down to pick it up, expecting to resume my hold, when I was seized right and left, back and before, was kicked and torn, and my shirt-collar out, and was taken into custody—the police took me to the station-house, where I was locked up in a cell and searched—when I was brought from the cell I saw the prisoner in the inspector's office—I asked for a draught of cold water; what with the struggling and the dust that was created, I felt a great wish for a drop of cold water—the prisoner said, "And I should like a drop of cold water"—I was walking up and down, and in passing him, be turned round and said, "Is the Queen hurt?"—he turned his head towards me, and said so—I said to him, "What did you put in the barrels?"—he said, "I have answered a dozen questions; there have been a dozen persons asking me questions, and I shall answer no more."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know what became of the pistols that were taken from him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a pistol lying on the table, one was brought in by the po<lb></lb>liceman, that was locked up with me in the cell—I took hold of that pistol which was lying on the table, saying, "I have put my little finger into the muzzle of the barrel, and have wiped out the powder, and is there any here?"—I asked myself that question—I put my finger into both pistols, but the one I first put my finger into I marked—that pistol came from the hands of Albert Lowe—I took it from him—it was not taken from me when I was knocked down—it came on the ground, but I picked it up, and resumed my hold again—one part of the time the policeman had it, and at another time I had it, but it never went out of my sight till I had marked it—the police made their appearance, I should judge two minutes after the first shot—I had got the pistol before the police came—I can say that the pistol I marked was one of the pistols taken from the prisoner—it was in the hands of both the prisoner and Albert Lowe—this is the pistol—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—there is a mark on the barrel.</p>

               <p>horses—the carriage drew across the road immediately on the second pistol being fired—the pulling up of horses, going at the rate of six or eight miles an hour, would take six or seven yards—I should say the second pistol was fired the distance of full eight or ten yards from the carriage.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the afternoon of the 10th of June, I was on duty at Buckingham-palace. About six o'clock I was sent on an errand to the south wing—I saw the Queen's carriage going up Constituation-hill—I was in front of the steps at the south wing—shortly after I saw the Queen's carriage I heard a shot fired—I immediately ran towards where the sound proceeded from—it appeared to me to proceed from Constitution-hill—as I went towards the spot I met a gentleman on horseback, who spoke to me—my attention was attracted by a mob of peo<lb></lb>ple, who had hold of a person—before that a second shot had been fired—it was after I heard the second shot that the gentleman on horseback spoke to me—I was going towards the carriage when I heard the second shot—I ob of people having hold of the prisoner—the two Lowes had hold of him, and several others besides—on my coming up, several voices (I do not know whether it was the Lowes) said, "This is the man, and I laid hold of him—nothing more was said by the persons present—the prisoner said, "You have no occasion to use violence, I am the person, I will go quietly "—I had merely laid hold of his collar and his left arm when he said that—I proceeded with him to the station-house—shortly afterwards some person remarked, "Perhaps there might be more of them"—the prisoner replied, "I have friends "—Smith, a policeman, came up, we went in front of the Wellington-barracks, and as we got opposite the barracks some person said, "I wonder whether there was any balls in the pistols, or no"—the prisoner made answer, "If the ball had come in contact with your head, if it was between the carriage, you would have known it"—I took him to the station-house, and he was searched by me and another constable—the other constable took from him, in my presence, a key, a knife, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I have the key—I found a piece of wadding in his trowsers' pocket—I looked at it, and saw the mark of the hammer on one side and the cap on the other—I asked him what it was for—he said, "To prevent the pistol going off," as he did not wish to hurt him<lb></lb>self—it would prevent the pistol going off, by putting it between the hammer and the cap—it had been so used—he also said, if I was to go up to the Park, where it occurred, I should find the other piece of wadding—while I was in the inspector's room different gentlemen came into the room—a question was put, (I cannot say whether it was to the prisoner,) whether there were any balls in the pistols—the prisoner said there were balls in the pistols—next day I made search in the garden, on the other side of the wall, but was not able to find any thing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SIDNEY TAYLOR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now when the question was put, as to whether there was any ball in the pistols, how many po<lb></lb>licemen were in the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I do not think there was any body but the inspector and myself—there were a number of gentle<lb></lb>men there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had various persons been asking the prisoner questions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not asking the prisoner questions, but asking one another, as they came in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say, that questions were not put to the prisoner himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not by the parties while I was there—I did not hear any one put questions to him except the inspector—he asked him questions</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184007060060"></xptr>
               <p>—he asked his name and where he came from—I believe he asked him something about the pistols.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it the practice of the police, to whom you belong, to interrogate prisoners as to the fact of any crime with which they are charged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not—the inspector merely asked him where he came from—he was not interrogated by the inspector, in my presence, as to whether there were balls in the pistols—he asked where he got the pistols from—the question about the balls was not put to the prisoner, but the gentlemen asked whether the pistols were loaded with ball—the prisoner was not asked the question, he was in custody at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he stated there were balls in the pistols; what were his words? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As near as I can recollect, his words were, "The pistols were loaded."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He did not say there were balls in them, but the pistols were loaded <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "There were balls in the pistols."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The pistols were loaded,", were those his words? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not exactly—he distinctly said there were balls in the pistols.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He said they were loaded, were those his words? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "The pistols were loaded with balls," those were the words, as near as I can judge—I will not swear to the exact words—I cannot tell the exact height of the wall of the garden—I should say it was eighteen or twenty feet high—I searched in the garden—I made a very minute search—not all over it—within about 100 yards in length, and about twenty-five in breadth—what I should suppose to be the range of the pistol-ball—I did not find any—I searched on the other side of the wall for a short time—about two hours after the firing—the police-sergeant and three or four men were there when I searched—I assisted in the search for a short time—I stopped there for about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What mode of searching was used? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We kept moving over it with our hands, and then swept it with a broom—that search extended about twenty-five yards in length, and five or six yards in width—there was no ball found in the dust while I was there—I did not see all the dust sifted—it was taken down to the Palace, and sifted there—I saw it brought down to be sifted—I did not make any further search—there are several trees about there—I was not examined before the Privy Council, and have not stated any thing before the Privy Council as to balls in the pistols.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you told any body before the examination by the Privy Coun<lb></lb>cil, that you had heard the prisoner state the pistols were loaded with ball? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I told Mr. Maule, the solicitor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many people were there in the room at the time he said there were balls in the pistols? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From ten to twelve persons—he said it out loud—he was in my custody at the time, in one corner of the room—I should think he said it loud enough for other people to hear as well as me—the people were talking as to whether there were balls, one said, "I wonder whether there was one," and he said, "There was."</p>

I remember the prisoner calling at our shop, on either Tuesday or Wednesday, the 3rd of June last—he brought half a hundred caps of me—he asked if I kept bullets—I told him no, but recommended him to a gunsmith in the Borough—he wanted to know if I had any small canisters of gunpowder—I had, and I showed him our half-pound canisters—he said they were not small enough, he wanted a small canister, he should like a quarter of a pound, if he could—he tried four or five of the caps while he was with me—he only showed me one pistol, but I believe he had a pair with him—I found some caps that fitted it—I had known the prisoner some years back, in the same road where I am living now—I had been to school with him, but for bow long I cannot say—to the best of my recollection it was eight or nine years ago—when he came into the shop I feigned not to know him—he asked me if my name was not John Gray—I told him it was—" Well," he said, "don't you remember any one of the name of Oxford?"—I said, "Yes, I cer<lb></lb>tainly do, I went to school with a person of that name"—he said, "Well, I am the same"—I asked him what he had been doing with himself—he said he had then lately come from Birmingham, but he had been in the public line.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember at any time his making an attempt upon his own life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—frequently, before our marriage—one night he was picked up by the watchman outside the door, and there were a great number of people there—I, knowing what he had threatened, was very much alarmed—he was found by the watchman in the street with a razor in his hand—I was in my mother's house—he was brought in, and I saw him—the watchman had the razor, and gave it to my mother—he was crying at that time, and teemed very desponding—we had seven children—the prisoner was the third child—the first child is living—at the time I was pregnant of the second child, my husband's conduct was dreadful, brutal—he neglected me to that I fainted three or four times a day for want of food—he once broke a jug, and threw a piece at me—it would have cut my face, but I held up my arm and it cut my arm—I have the wound now—he annoyed me dreadfully by grimaces while I was pregnant of my second child, and by jumping about like a baboon, and imitating their grimaces—that continued during the whole period of my pregnancy of the second child—that child was barely born alive—it was a confirmed idiot, and its countenance was precisely as the father looked when he made those grimaces—it put its tongue out like he did—it lived about between two years and four months, not quite two years and a half—during all that time it had not the least appearance of reason—it never spoke or walked—it was very voracious—it showed no indication of sense or reason at all—I continued to suckle that child after the birth of the prisoner—it took to the breast two or three days after this boy was born—its cry was not human—it was a sort of moan—it was not like a child cries—I suckled that child and the prisoner together—my husband's conduct was much the same during my pregnancy of the prisoner, grimaces and so on—I was in tears one day when a lady called, she said, "What is the matter, Mrs. Oxford?"—I said, "He is commencing the same faces he always has done," and she told him it was very wrong of him—he once struck a file into my breast, and the milk flew out from the wound—there was a stream of milk on the floor—that was before the birth of the prisoner, it was whilst I was suckling my first child, and on observing the milk come from the wound, he showed the same indifference that he always did—I had not had any quarrel with him—he was always tormenting me—he delighted in annoying and teasing me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you do any thing to provoke him to these extraordinary acts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was considered too patient, and too attentive to him—I was blamed by my parents and many persons—he kept a horse at one time, and I have seen him bring the horse into the house, he led it in by the bridle, and he seemed, like a child with a toy, amused at his own folly—he brought it into the sitting-room, and led it about—I have frequently applied to him for money for the support of the family, which he has re<lb></lb>fused, and abused me, and he once knocked me down, and fractured my head—I had done nothing more than ask him for money to support the family—I knew he had received many pounds that night—he put 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the table—I said I could not do without money—he was perfectly sober—it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—I believe it was before the birth of the prisoner that I received the blow which fractured</p>

               <p>my head—I cannot say whether it was at the time I was pregnant—he cut my head with a quart pot, while I was pregnant with the prisoner—he threw it at me, and it cut my straw bonnet through, and cut my head—I did not know my head was cut till I felt the blood coming down—I do not remember, how far advanced in pregnancy I was then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe any thing remarkable about him from his infancy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he would burst out crying when there was no one near him, and no one speaking to him, and he was always very troublesome—it was different to the mere waywardness of childhood—if he sat still or stood still, he would burst out crying—that was after he had learned to walk as well as before—all children cry, but this was when he was three or four years old, and he has continued to do so through life, to cry without any apparent cause—I have known that to be the case up to the time of my going to Birmingham, or just before that—that was in the present year—he had a great many other very singular habits—he would get into a violent rage without any cause; he would deliberately break any thing, and willfully destroy any thing that he took in his hand—he once pointed a pistol at me, that was the first day he brought them home—I should have told you that my husband, during my pregnancy with the prisoner, pointed a gun at my head—the prisoner was particularly fond of fire-arms and gun<lb></lb>powder—I have frequently taken it from him when he was young—he would sometimes play about with other children, and at other, times he would amuse himself with letting off cannons, and he was once very much burnt with gunpowder all over the face—he was very much hurt, that is eight years ago this summer—he was at play in the yard with a little boy, and the cannon exploded, and he was very much burnt—his eye<lb></lb>brows and eye-lashes were burnt off, hit hair was very much singed, and his face was a complete mass—I sat up two nights to wash it with a lotion—it was very much hurt—he behaved very fractious indeed, and screamed terribly, so that the doctor was angry with him, and gave him a sleeping medicine—when I first saw him, after he had burnt himself with the gunpowder, he was crying dreadfully—I was absent at the time, and when I returned I found him washing his face with water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has he any habit of laughing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have frequently beat him for it when he was much younger—that habit has continued up to the present time—he would laugh hysterically after these gloomy fits and fits of violent passion—it is an involuntary laugh—I told Mrs. Robinson so the day he left—he was in the habit of alarming me dreadfully, by making strange noises, firing off cannons, and flourishing a great stick before his sister's face, and before the looking-glass—complaints were made to me by the customers of his laughing, and if I asked him to do any thing when I was in business, be would make such a disturbance, that it used to dis<lb></lb>tress my feelings dreadfully, and annoy the customers—I was at that times keeping a pastry-cook's shop in the Westminster-road, but he has annoyed them since then at a coffee-house which I afterwards took—when the gen<lb></lb>tlemen have been reading the newspaper, he has made such a dreadful disturbance that it was very annoying and very distressing to my feelings—the customers complained of it—I shut him in the cellar, on one occa<lb></lb>sion, when I kept the pastry-cook's shop—the customers came to com<lb></lb>plain of him—I lost a great many of them in consequence—I lost my business entirely—at times he was very affectionate, and at other times the contrary—he would break out unawares, and if he wanted any thing, and it was not reached him in a moment, lately, he would strew the room with litters, and throw every thing down that came in his way—he was sometimes very gloomy—he would sit. for a long time with his hand to</p>

               <p>his head, and not speak, and he would be impatient if I spoke to him, especially if he was reading, and we spoke to him, he would get in a violent rage—I went into a situation at Mr. Prescott's, the bankers, as con<lb></lb>fidential housekeeper, and was there a year and a half—I saw the prisoner occasionally during that time—I placed him with a person named Sandon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After you left Mr. Prescott's, and he came from Sandon's, did these peculiarities appear to have subsided or increased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Increased consi<lb></lb>derably—I could not manage him at all—he broke windows to the amount of 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he used to jump on the sofa, and throw the pillows about, and destroy things wilfully—that is eight years ago—since that time he has been under my own observation until the last four years, and then he has only been with me for a week or a month occasionally, having gone out to situations—he was with my sister at Hounslow first for about two years—she then kept a public-house—she does not now—he then went to Mr. Minton's, at the Shepherd and Flock, in London, and from there to Mr. Farr's, in Wilderness-row—when at home he was in the habit of going on the roof of the house and throwing at people as they passed—he was brought home one night by a policeman, who informed me he had been taken to the station-house—he had got behind a carriage, and frightened a lady who was in it by making a great noise, and she was pregnant; and her husband, who was a solicitor, was exceedingly alarmed and angry—that was stated in his presence—I went next morning to inquire after the lady's health, and apologize—he took no notice when he heard this ac<lb></lb>count—he did not appear conscious of having done wrong—he used to look very indifferently about all these things—I think this was somewhere about six years ago, between five and six—when he was at home of late, I knew of his having no companion but Master Linton, who has been exa<lb></lb>mined—he never, to my knowledge, belonged to any club or any meeting—I left London for Birmingham about four weeks and three days, I think, before this occurred—at that time he was out of place—he had left his place just a week before I went to Birmingham—he received 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year wages where he had been—he did not purchase the clothes he has on with that money—he has had that coat a long time; he had it just as Mrs. Minton died, more than two years ago—he then had a suit of mourning given him, consequently this coat was saved—he has had it in his posses<lb></lb>sion full two years, I should say—I do not know whether it is so much as two years—I should say he has had these clothes nearly two years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How lately has any thing occurred between him and you in allusion to Macbeth, or any thing of that kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has always been talking in that manner, repeating parts of plays, from a very little boy, and we used to imitate him because he said it so badly—he wanted to go to sea last winter—he wanted me to go to Birmingham for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to provide him as a midshipman—I told him of the folly of his going to sea when he knew nothing about nautical affairs—he said he should have nothing to do but to walk about the deck and give orders—I said, "But you must first learn navigation"—he said he would allow me half his pay, and how proud I should be of my son when I saw his name in the papers, Admiral Sir Ed<lb></lb>ward Oxford—when he brought the pistols home, I said, how could he think of laying his money out in such folly, and he said they were not his—he was saving them for a young man—I do not know whether there was any thing in the pistol when he presented it at me—he had only just then brought them in—he has behaved violently towards me—the day</p>

               <p>before I went to Birmingham he made my nose bleed by a blow from his fist—I was playing with him and turned round, and he hit me on the nose—that was not in the course of the play—it was after—he turned round suddenly as he was going through the door, and struck at me—it hurt me very much—I screamed out—the landlady came up stairs, and she said, "If I was to strike my mother I should expect my hand to drop off"—he appeared very sullen.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I collect from that, the only particulars you do recollect, are, that sixteen years ago you attended a man of colour, who had taken laudanum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is about the sum of my recollection—I received the information that he had taken laudanum, from others—I cannot say whether he sur<lb></lb>vived the effects of the laudanum by the assistance of any excitement or stimulant, or whether it was removed from his stomach by an emetic—I have no recollection of the particulars of his case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As a medical man, you are perfectly aware that a large dose of laudanum, may be taken without producing death, if a party is sti<lb></lb>mulated, and kept in motion by counteraction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The majority of such cases would recover, when properly treated, when treated in the usual way—he was drowsy—I am sure of that—I was not able to form any no<lb></lb>tion whatever of his state of mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As a physician, you think every crime that is plainly committed to be committed by a mad man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing of the kind; but a crime com<lb></lb>mitted under all the circumstances of the hypothesis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are the circumstances in the crime itself, which you think show madness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The crime is committed in open day, it being obviously of great magnitude and danger; of great atrocity; it is committed without any precaution, without any looking out for the means of escape; it is afterwards spoken of openly, so far from concealing the criminating facts; facts which might afford a chance of escape; the existence of the balls is acknowledged, the free discussion of the circumstances, the absence of motive—by the free discussion, I mean a free respondence to the questions put to him immediately afterwards in the cell—the questions which Lord Uxbridge stated yesterday he did put—he said, on Lord Uxbridge entering the door, "I did it."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, in that sort of mental disease, is it quite consistent with the person performing the functions of life and the duties of life with accuracy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is no doubt of it; they can perform the duties of life with accu<lb></lb>racy; I do not say with the same facility—I saw the prisoner in Newgate the day before yesterday, by permission of the Secretary of State, in com<lb></lb>pany with Dr. Conolly, Mr. Clark, and Mr. Maule—I had some conversa<lb></lb>tion with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, from the conversation you had with him, and the opportunity you had of observing him, what is your opinion as to the state of his mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should consider his state of mind is essentially unsound; there seems a mixture of insanity with imbecility—I regard the incapacity of controlling laughing and crying, as proofs of imbecility, not as positive proofs in themselves, but as assisting to form my opinion.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This propensity to suicide in the patients you speak of, were they persons performing all the duties of social life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were persons proceeding with their duties of life, and in all their ordinary avocations—despondency of mind is very often connected with disorders of the stomach, but it very often happens that the physical cause has not been obvious, and has not developed itself at all; it is not at all necessary that the physical cause should be obvious—in such cases, I prescribed for disease in the stomach; I found those re<lb></lb>medies did operate on the mind—laughing and crying without control is connected with hysteria, and also with imbecility—generally, when con<lb></lb>nected with hysteria, it is associated with the sensations, there must be fainting and <hi rend="italic">globus hystericus,</hi> which arises in the throat—the ques<lb></lb>tions put to the prisoner were not numerous; some were put by one gentleman, and some by another; I endeavoured to impress upon him that he was labouring under error when he considered it was in<lb></lb>capable of being proved there were balls in the pistols; I assured him, in a manner I thought most likely to make him believe, there really were;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184007060096"></xptr>
               <p>that the fact of there being balls in the pistols would be proved against him; that his responsibility was a terrible one, and in all likelihood it would end in capital punishment, and if he knew whether that was deca<lb></lb>pitation—he said he had been decapitated in fact a week before, for he had a cast taken of his head—I endeavoured to make him understand it would be proved that there were balls in the pistols—I knew he had the impres<lb></lb>sion that it could not be proved, from questions asked by myself—I cannot tell what he had said to induce me to form that opinion, but something was said to that effect by him—I concluded, from something he said, that he entertained that opinion—he insisted that there were no balls there—the fact did not occur to me before—I do not remember his words, but the remark was to the effect that it was impossible—the question as to whether he was not concerned about his mother he treated with indiffer<lb></lb>ence, and seemed to be totally destitute of feeling, apprehension, or thought on the subject—during the whole time I was struck with a very peculiar manner—he was not an instant (though I believe it is partly habit) that he was not playing with a pencil and a piece of Indian-rubber, with which I found him drawing—when we went into the room he was quietly drawing, with a pencil on a piece of paper, something like a landscape—during the whole conversation he was leaning with his head on one hand, with the other flapping about with a piece of Indian-rubber, sometimes clapping one pencil against another; in fact, a manner entirely without acute feeling or acute consciousness; and in order to ascertain how fax what I would call dullness of manner, that peculiar manner, might indicate idiotcy even, I desired him to get up and walk; and if I had supposed that he was acting when he was clapping the Indian-rubber about, that idea would en<lb></lb>tirely have been done away with by the manner in which he walked across the room, which he did with a great deal of lightness, liveliness, briskness, and smartness, not at all as if endeavouring to put on a peculiar manner—it occurred to me that it was perfectly natural, not as if he was acting or making the least pretence—the interview lasted, perhaps, about three quar<lb></lb>ters of an hour—I did not make any note of the conversation, neither at the time or after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it not have been wise to note the time of going and coming away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps it would, but I did not use that precaution—Mr. Maule was present during part of the examination, not during the whole—he came in during the latter part—I was in Court all yesterday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you form any opinion at all from the prisoner's manner during the trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I considered that manner was a continuation of the same kind of manner, but under some restraint here—I have no observation to make as to the form of the head—I also subjected the prisoner to what is called the arithmetical test—I infer nothing from it—I merely mention it because it did occur—he was pretty ready in casting up, but not ready in subtraction—I am not quite certain whether at the moment he was giving his attention to it; indeed I consider it is a fallacious test.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a practising surgeon, and have been so between three and four years. I am surgeon to the Dorcas Charity, and Honorary Secretary to the Westminster Medical Society—I have had some experience in the treatment of insane persons, such as usually falls to the lot of the general practitioner, perhaps a little more, for having been so short a time in practice—I have been in the habit of attending the family of the prisoner—I have known him nearly two years</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184007060097"></xptr>
               <p>—I accompanied Dr. Conolly and Dr. Chowne, in their visit to him, the day before yesterday—I have formed an opinion as to the state of his mind; not from that alone, but from other circumstances which I had had personal opportunity of seeing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the opinion you have formed as to the state of his mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That it is decidedly that of imbecility—I consider it more imbecility than any thing—I do not like giving definitions—in my judgment he is decidedly of unsound mind—during the time I have been attending his mother and sister occasionally I have had opportunities of seeing the prisoner, and his mother has frequently mentioned to me that she thought there was something exceedingly peculiar about him, and asked what I thought—the chief thing that struck me was the laughing, which has been so much dwelt upon, the involuntary kind of laughing—with what perhaps we might call a kind of general hysterical tendency in him—he did not seem to me to have that sufficient control over the emotions which we generally find in sane individuals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you notice, at any time, any other symptom that is usually con<lb></lb>nected with hysteria? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My interviews with him were not prolonged, and my attention was attracted to him chiefly by the desire of his mother, who said she was afraid he was getting in the way that his father was—I did not know his father—I put one or two questions to him, when I saw him in Newgate—I heard questions put by the other medical men as well, and the answers which he gave—I watched his manner during the interview.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it appear to you to correspond with his manner on former occa<lb></lb>sions on which you had seen him, or to differ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Much the tame cha<lb></lb>racter—great insensibility to all the impressions which were attempted to be made upon him—on one occasion some time ago my attention was more particularly directed to him, from a circumstance which this occur<lb></lb>rence has brought very strongly to my recollection; I think it is about five months since I was on a visit at his mother's house; I called in my rounds to see her; she was very poorly at the time; if I recollect right, he was sitting at the fire reading a book; he took no notice of me when I entered, and seemed to be absorbed in what he was reading; his mother made some observation to him; such as, "How rude you are;" "Why not take notice of Mr. Clarke?" "Why sit there and behave in this kind of way?" He did not seem to notice the observation of his mother at all; he seemed still to be absorbed in the book; she put the question to him again, and there was still the same apparent reverie; and when she touched him, to put him in mind that some one was there, he jumped up in a fury; such as at the moment alarmed me, and swore that he would "stick her," I think was the expression he made use of; but certainly it was such an expression that at the moment I drew back, thinking he meditated some violence. After this transaction bad occurred, the mother called on me in great trouble, and made a communication to me, upon which I wished to see the prisoner, accompanying that with some opinion of my own, which I had formed. I did not see the prisoner until the day before yesterday, when the permission of the Secretary of State was obtained—I had made application at the Home Office on the Monday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In cases of hereditary insanity, is there any particular period of life at which medical writers consider it likely to break out, to appear? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In that kind of insanity particularly, which is connected with acts of violence,</p>

               <p>Escoreaux says, in several cases which bear great analogy to the one which we might suppose to exist at present—in six of those cases I think that three of them took place at the age of puberty, between the ages perhaps of fourteen and twenty.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SIR FREDERICKK POLLOCK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you have attended the family for some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I live in Princes-street, Leicester-square—that is perhaps a mile and a half from where Mrs. Oxford and the prisoner lived, but they did not live there during the whole time I attended them—Mrs. Oxford has lived in Commercial-road within the last month—I never prescribed for the prisoner—I did not recommend any course of treatment—I considered that the disease was mental, one of those weak minds which, under little excitement, might become overthrown—I did not alarm the mother, for she is an exceedingly nervous woman—I recommended no course of conduct, diet, or treatment whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In short, I am to understand that you never gave any advice on the subject, of any kind whatever to his mother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Simply in conversation, I gave my opinion rather as to his state than any advice, nothing further—I never gave any advice, I was never asked my advice.</p>

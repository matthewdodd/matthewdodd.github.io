               <p>Was it a light night? - So light I could have read in the street; I knew the prisoner by his coat, and his figure, and his face.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about him now? - As much as I believe any thing in the world, I believe him to be the man; I saw him the same morning at ten o'clock in Bow-street, in custody.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you immediately discover him to be the man? - When I came in the room I saw my watch laying on the table, I was surprized it was there so soon, and immediately after the man was brought in; as much as I believe any thing, I believe him to be the man.</p>

               <p>Did you take any notice of the person that robbed you? - Yes, I saw him exceedingly well, because he was on my side and spoke to me three times.</p>
               <p>Did you at that time take notice of his person? - Oh! extremely well, it was so light.</p>
               <p>What have you to say as to the prisoner at the bar? - O Sir! he is the very same man.</p>
               <p>Did you see him the next day? - I did not see him till Thursday.</p>
               <p>What day in the week was he robbed? - It was a quarter after twelve o'clock on Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him on the Thursday? - At Bow-street, he had a white waistcoat, round hat, and brown coat on; I am very sure it is him that robbed us.</p>

               <p>I was coachman, I drove the coach at that time; I was called off the rank in Oxford Road to take up in Soho Square, I stopped there about 5 minutes, and the same man that stopped the coach walked by me while I was at the door; I sat on the box the whole time; the gentleman said, drive into Greek-street, and into King-street, and stop at the corner of Nassau-street; this same man came up to the right-hand side of my coach, and told me to stop, I looked down at him, and I thought to myself you do not belong to the company I have in my coach, and I did not stop, he said, damn you, if you do not stop, I will blow your brains out this instant; I looked down at him, and saw he had a pistol, he bid me drive on, and take no notice, or else he said, I will blow your brains out; he was a thinnish man, and had a brown coat on, and it seemed to me to have a white collar to it.</p>
               <p>Was you sent for to Bow-street the next day? - No, I cannot say I was, I saw him the day I was called to Bow-street, I cannot say it is the prisoner, nor I cannot say it is not him, I cannot swear to him.</p>

That is pretty extraordinary, you took notice of that man so as to be able to say positively that was the man that committed the robbery, and yet cannot say now positively whether this is or is not the man? - No, he had not the same clothes on, he had a brown coat and a white collar.</p>
               <p>Court. You remember you are upon your oath, he is entitled to your evidence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290056"></xptr> if you know he is not the man, and the public are entitled to your evidence if you know he was the man, and you ought to tell us so? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How was the man dressed that you saw in Bow-street? - He had a brown coat on, but not a white collar to it, but whether his was a real white collar, or whether it was made white, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>On the 16th day of September about nine o'clock in the morning I came to the office, they told me there had been a robbery done in Greek-street, Soho, I asked them if the gentleman described the man, they said he had, he was a little man in a brown coat with a white cape to it, I immediately judged in my own opinion who this man could be, and I went to one of our people to know where this man lived, and he told me in Prince's-street, Drury-lane, we went there at a chandler's shop on the left-hand side, and peeped through the key hole of a one pair of stairs backwards, and I saw a pair of dirty shoes, I tried the door for some time, and at last we forced it open, he was in bed, I immediately went and caught hold of his arm: After I had got him on the side of the bed, I turned the pillow where his head lay on, and the first thing I saw was this watch under the pillow; he must have been in sleep as I tried nine times before I could get the door open; I then searched his waistcoat pocket, and there I found two shillings, one a good one and one a bad one, in his coat pocket was this pistol loaded with shot, I then made him get his clothes on, it was a brown coat, the cape of it was remarkably powdered, as white as if it had been velvet, it was as white as my shirt is at present: I brought him and the watch to the office, then the gentleman came and owned his watch.</p>

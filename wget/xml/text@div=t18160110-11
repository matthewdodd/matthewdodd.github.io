            . I am a Manchester warehouseman. At about half past twelve o'clock, on Tuesday, the 2nd of January, I was standing at our warehouse door, in Size-lane, talking with a person of the warehouse, and the two prisoners at the bar passed by; I looked at them, and saw that they were the same I had seen in Lawrence-lane the day before. I followed them down Size-lane, into Budgerow, along Watling-street, and I met with an officer in Red Lion-court, and pointed them out to him. I turned down Bread-street, and went into Little Friday-street, where I saw the prisoner Thompson with a truss on his shoulder; I walked on gently after him, on the contrary side of the way, and Haines, who was behind, observed me noticing Thompson, and called out "old one" I passed, and stopped him with the truss; I asked him where he got it from; he said, if I would go with him, he would shew me; Haines also stopped. I gave the truss in charge of Shipton, the ticket-porter, who took it into a house, with me, and the two prisoners. I sent for the officer, Jackson, and had them immediately conveyed before the sitting Alderman. I never lost sight of this man with the parcel.</p>

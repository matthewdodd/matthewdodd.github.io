                  </hi>. I am a letter carrier, and live at No. 2, Lower's-buildings. I recollect Wednesday morning, 17th Jan.—I had been to the Victoria theatre the night before, with my wife and three friends; we were returning home at 20 minutes or a quarter to 3 o'clock—it was my inten<lb></lb>tion to ride, and I went to the comer of the Palace New-road, Westminster, to engage a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, who said he would take us to Cadogan-pier, Chelsea, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not know his name; I should not know him again—I went back to inform my friends, but they were going to walk home, and I said, "Perhaps the man will take me and my wife for less money"—I engaged this man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to a man in Court</hi>)—he wanted 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the five, but the others walked home—I was about to get into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> when a policeman came up; it was the prisoner—he said to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man that if he were he, he would not take the fare at all; he said, "Have your money first"—on that the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man said, "I want my fare"—I said, "How much is it? "—he said, "2<hi rend="italic">s"</hi>—I put my hand into my pocket, and tendered 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and then the prisoner said, "If I were you, I would not take the fare at all;" and then the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man said he would not take the fare—my wife said, "Do you think it is not 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? "and the prisoner said, "Go on, ma'am;" and pushed her off the kerb into the road—she said, "Who do you call ma'am? "and he went into the road, and pushed her twice—I took hold of her arm, and said, "Come with me to the station house, and we will see whether he will not take the fare—the prisoner then commenced pushing me very violently; it was a frosty night, and I had hard work to prevent myself from falling—I went down the Westminster-road, and he kept treading on our heels as we went down—we afterwards went to the station; he charged us with being drunk and disorderly, and making a noise, and we were locked up—I was sober, and so was my wife; we were not making a disturbance in the road—I tried to persuade my wife to go to the station, because she kept crying about her child—she did not threaten to twist the defendant's nose; no such word was spoken—she made no threats, and used no bad language towards the defendant.</p>

Q.</hi> How long do the performances at the Victoria Theatre last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was over about 10 minutes to 1 o'clock on this night—it is not far from Palace New-road to the Victoria—we had had a pot of porter between three of us men, and a quartern of gin and some water—that was not all that we had—I had a share of two pints in the evening, among me and two men, before the time of coming out, but no spirits—we did not drink it in the theatre, but in front of a bar—I will undertake to say that that was all the refreshment I had—we walked to the theatre—I had none of the gin; I do not know who drank it—I was present, but was engaged talking to people—I suppose my wife partook of it—I did not see what she had—I sat down and smoked a pipe after leaving the Victoria; it might have been two pipes; I cannot tell you what I had exactly—I did not pay for what I drank—I did not share with my friends in anything they ordered—I was in my wife's company all the time that she and the defendant were there, except when I came out of a pie shop to engage a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I had nothing to drink or to eat in the pie shop, but my wife and my friends had some pies—my wife and I were married seven years and a half ago; I am not bound to answer where, but can say if I think proper; it was at Hammersmith; but I Hid not know that I was bound to answer all these questions—I distinctly pledge myself that I am married to the person whom I represent as my wife—two or three other policemen came up while this was going on—I did not notice their numbers—I do not know that I could swear to them again—I saw the sergeant at the station, and I see him here to-day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. I recollect going to the Victoria Theatre, in Jan.; the performance was over about ten minutes to 1 o'clock—I had nothing to drink during the performance; I did not come out till it was over—I was with my husband and three friends when we came out—we went to a public house, and I and the females had a glass of gin and water and some bread and cheese, which I think they paid for—from there we went to a public house in Westminster Bridge-road—we did not go straight there; we met a person, and were talking in the street—four of us partook of half a pint of gin there—we had nothing else there—we were there about half an hour, and then went straight to a pie shop, in the Westminster-road, and when we had been there some few minutes, my husband went to get a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and in consequence of something he said, I went out to a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> which was in the street, and the man who my husband had engaged had gone, but there was another man a short distance lower down, with a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoner was there—our friends would not agree to go, because Pigram wanted 36<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so we bade them good night, and they walked away—my husband said, "Perhaps you will take me and my wife for less?

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am no relation of the prisoner, my name is not spelt the same—I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, and was on the stand on the morning of 17th Jan.—Skinner came to a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> before mine, but did not engage it; he wanted to go for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the man said he would not go for less than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then came out of a pie shop with his wife when the first <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was gone, and demanded of me to go for half a crown—I said, that as there were five, I could not go for less than 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when his wife found that I would not go for half a crown, she got very passionate, and wanted to know where the police were; the defendant then came up, and from the opposite side four other policemen came up—I said, "Here are the police now"—the prisoner wanted to know what was the matter—I said that they wanted to go for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. under the fare, and I would not go—the wife applied to the prisoner to know whether he could not compel me to go—the prisoner said that he had nothing to do with that; if I did wrong they had got their remedy—she got very passionate, and the prisoner said, "We cannot have this noise here, the man will not take you, you must go on, ma'am"—she directly said, "Who do you call ma'am, I am no ma'am; if you call me so again, I shall wring your nose;" or, "wring the <hi rend="italic">snot</hi> out of your nose;" and then she repeated the same words, with some other expression which I do notrecol<lb></lb>lect—the prisoner then gave her a push on the shoulder, pushed her off the pavement, and said, "Why don't you hold your tongue, your tongue will get you into trouble"—they then walked a little way down the road, and I saw no more of it—I have known the prisoner for years, as a police<lb></lb>man on the beat, but nothing more—they were not at any time getting into my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—when I would not take the five for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Skinner said, "Then <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and my wife will go;" and he said to the others, "You know where to meet us"—one of the policemen said, "Have you got any money? "and Skinner pulled out two or three 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces—the prisoner said, "You had better have your fare first"—I stood at the door of my <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> and would not let anybody get in—I do not say that they were drunk, but they were the worse for liquor, the woman more than the man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, L</hi> 20). On the morning of 17th Jan., I was on duty at the police station, and the defendant brought Skinner and his wife, and made a charge against them of being drunk and riotous in the street, which I entered in the charge sheet—they were both drunk, there can be no mistake about it—neither of them complained of being assaulted they made no charge against the prisoner of what he had done.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On 16th Jan., about 3 o'clock In the morning, I was on duty in the York-road, very nearly opposite Astley's—my attention was attracted by a woman hallooing out very loud—I went up and heard her say that she would wring the <hi rend="italic">snot</hi> out of Pegram's nose, and she put up her hands, as if to make a scratch at his face; he pushed her away; she did it a second time, and he pushed her away—they were decidedly drunk, but the woman was worse than the man; she was hallooing out—I was 100 yards down the street when I heard it; it was a scream, but not as if in distress; as a woman does who is drunk—I cannot say whe<lb></lb>ther I saw Pegram there, I saw Claridge and Keefe—there were five or six persons when I went up; they were on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> rank—I heard the defendant advise the woman to go quietly, or else he should take her to the station; and he advised her several times to go home—I saw her put up her hand twice, if not three times.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On the morning of 16th Jan. I was on duty in Westminster Bridge-road, opposite Palace New-road, and my atten<lb></lb>tion was called by a dispute with a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man—there were five persons there; three went away, and Skinner and his wife remained—they were both making a noise—I first heard it when I was on the York-road side of the way, and went over—Skinner wanted the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to take him for a certain amount; the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man would not—the policeman said, "If I were you, <hi rend="italic">Don</hi> (which is the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man's nickname), I should have my <hi rend="italic">tin</hi> first"—Skinner said that he was under Government the same as we were, and insisted on being conveyed in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man said that they were drunk, and he should not take them without he got the money first—they were drunk, and the woman was much worse than the man—the policeman told her to go away and keep herself quiet, and she threatened to wring his nose if he laid hands upon her—he said first, "I cannot have this disturbance; there have been complaints here by the people;" and she said, "You d——d vagabond; if you touch me I will wring the <hi rend="italic">snot</hi> out of your nose" (I was on the spot before Winterbourn)—after that Skinner and his wife said that they would go down to the station, and see if they could not make the <hi rend="italic">cab<lb></lb>man</hi> take them; and the prisoner said, "I will not have any more of this; I will take care that you do go down to the station"—they went to the station, and Pegram walked about two yards behind—I went; I was about three yards behind—at the corner of Oakley-street they wanted to go straight down the road, and Pegram said, "No, this is the way"—Fowne said, "No, this is the way"—that was the nearest way to the station—there was noise enough to call the attention of other officers—I did not see the woman do anything, but I heard her threaten him twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You went down to the station, did you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was examined before the Magistrate on the 17th—I gave evidence before the Magistrate on Monday, the 22nd, also—I am still in the police, but am suspended in consequence of what took place then—the whole discussion in the street with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man took about ten minutes—it was after the con<lb></lb>stable had pushed the woman once that she threatened to pull his nose—they were not then in the middle of the street, but just by the side; they had not started on their way to the station—they were not in custody at first; but when they left that spot they were—it is thirty or forty yards from one side of the road to the other—after the woman made use of that expression, Pegram pushed them two or three times—I believe it was be<lb></lb>cause they continued the disturbance that he took them into custody—Mr. Powell came up at the time they were crossing the road.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>towards it, and found, to the best of my opinion, five or six people at the comer of Palace New-road, near Astley's, close by the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> rank—there was a woman there—I did not go into the crowd, but I stood and heard a female say that she would give a constable a smack in the face, and that she would wring his <hi rend="italic">snotty</hi> nose—she was noisy—I did not cross at all; they came across the road in less than a minute after I got there—I then saw Skinner and his wife—the woman continued talking very loud—I considered that they were very much the worse for liquor; they were walking with linked arms—they walked all along Westminster-road, and I walked three or four yards behind them, as far as the corner of Oakley-street—the defendant was walking behind them—I saw Powell, and the gentleman who was with him.</p>

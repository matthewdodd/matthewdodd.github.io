On the 7th of December, about three o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop accompanied by another woman, the other woman asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs, I produced forty or fifty silk handkerchiefs. The prisoner staid in the shop until the other woman had bought two, after which she left the shop before the other woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you up to the time that she left the shop seen her take any thing. - A. No. When the other woman, who had bought two handkerchiefs, left the shop, I followed her into Great Newport Street, at the bottom of Newport Market she was joined by the prisoner, I ran and overtook them both, I asked them to step back with me. They went willingly until we got to the middle of Newport Market, where the other woman said she must return and buy a joint of meat, I turned to see where the other woman went to, the prisoner ran off. I followed the prisoner and overtook her, the other woman made her escape. I took the prisoner into our accompting-house, she produced five pieces of silk handkerchiefs from under her coat. The five pieces contained sixteen handkerchiefs, I have kept them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner near the compter. - A. She was while the other woman was dealing. The handkerchiefs are the property of Thomas Flint and

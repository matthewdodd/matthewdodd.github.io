                  </hi>. I am barman to Nicholas Walker, who keeps the Golden Eagle public-house, in High-street, Shadwell, in the parish of St. Paul. On the night of the 23rd of Dec. I went to bed a few minutes after eleven o'clock—I saw the prisoner sitting in the tap-room, and left him there when I went to bed—it is the duty of Richards, our waiter, to close that room—I was called up by the police between one and two—I found the corner door of the house, leading into the street, open—the bar door was fast—I unlocked it, went in, and found two sixpences lying on the floor—(I had the keys up stairs with me)—I counted the remaining money—there were only four sixpences and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece left in the till, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper—I had not been to the bar before I went to bed.</p>

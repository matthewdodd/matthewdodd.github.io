On the 30th of March, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw the prisoner come to his shop - he looked in at the window, and at the same time he was unhanging a pair of Wellington boots; he took them, and ran away - I followed, and called Stop thief! he ran down a court, and I lost sight of him for about three minutes, when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q.Had you seen him before? A.No - I know him by his face; I saw him about five minutes - I lost sight of him for about three minutes while he ran down a court; he had brown coloured trousers, a blue coat, and a black hat - his hat fell off in St. Andrew's-street: he had the same trousers on when he was taken - I can tell he is the person by his face and by his nose - he has a round nose.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where did you see him throw away the boots? A. In Great St. Andrew's-street - I saw him running with the boots in his right hand, about forty yards from me; he threw them from him - there were many people pursuing him, but the prisoner threw the boots away; he was a head - it is a crowded part, but he was running alone; I will swear positively I saw him throw away the boots, and I pursued him through tcourt into Queen-street.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cook, and live in Little Guildford-street. On Monday morning, the 19th April, I called at a public-house, in high-street, St. Giles's—I had a watch, either in my fob or waistcoat pocket—I found the prisoner in the public-house—I afterwards missed my watch; it was worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Soho. I was at the Crown public-house that morning—I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor, and two other parties, drinking together at the bar—I saw the prisoner take something from the prosecutor's waistcoat pocket, and I saw the guard fall down, which seemed to have been attached to a watch—the prosecutor complained of the loss—he said, "You have taken my watch, give me my watch"—the publican went and shut the door—the prisoner then gave the prosecutor his watch, and said to him, "who wants your watch?"—the prosecutor gave the watch to the landlord—a young man said he would not let it go off so, he would have a policeman.</p>

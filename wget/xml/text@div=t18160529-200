I saw my watch in another man's hand, but not the prisoner's; I catched the man who had my watch by the waistcoat, and said, in our vulgar way, d-n your eyes, you have got my watch. The prisoner and another man then dragged me from him, and he ran off; at the same time I hallooed out stop thief; but there was no one came to my assistance, and as I turned myself to the prisoner, he said, d-n your eyes, you ought to lose your watch; I told him he was the man who was the instigation of it. Before Nichols came up, the prisoner offered me the number of his coach, and said he would appear the next day; his coach was third from the curb-stone. When Nicholls came up, I gave charge of him, and told my fellow servant to tell her ladyship that I was gone to the watchhouse, where I made good my charge.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. Nicholls and I received information of this disturbance at the corner of Pall Mall. On going to the spot, I heard the prisoner say, d-n his old eyes, he is an old son of a bitch, and ought to lose his watch, or something to that effect. The prosecutor charged the prisoner with assisting to rob him, and we took him to the watchhouse. The prosecutor gave us the same account that he has now.</p>

            . I am a coachman, and drive for Mr. Duffy, hackneyman, in Black Horse Yard, Tottenham-Court-Road. On the night of the 23rd of May, I was with my coach near the Opera House; I was in conversation with the prisoner at the time the prosecutor charged him with robbing him. We were near our coaches; I believe we had been talking together ten minutes or quarter of an hour; we had been talking concerning the fight that was to take place the next day. At the time the prisoner was conversing with me, he did not strike any man, nor pull any one from another man; nor could he have done so without my seeing him. Lady Dudley's footman came up, and made a piece of work, and the prisoner said what a foolish man he was, not to take care of his watch when he had one, or something to that purpose. The prosecutor then said, you are the fellow, that knocked the flam out of my hand; upon which the prisoner said, you are a liar, and said he was talking to this young man; meaning me. The prisoner then very much abused the prosecutor, and he asked him where his coach was, and he told him it was 226, which it was; he drives for Mr. Miller, in Hanway street, Tottenham-Court-Road. The prosecutor said, you are not the man who robbed me; I had the man by the celler who robbed me, and he was a short man with a brown coat; and I being a short man, and having a brown coat, did not go to the Watch House, for fear of getting into trouble myself.</p>
               <p>Examined by the COURT. He described the man who robbed him, as short, and wearing a brow coat. I answered that description, and kept away.</p>

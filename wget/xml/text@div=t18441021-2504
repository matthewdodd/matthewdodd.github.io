                  </hi>. I live in Wood-street, Old-street, and am a carman. In consequence of some direction, I went a little after seven o'clock lasl Friday morning, to the White Swan in Upper Thames-street—I had Mr. Wilcox's van with me, and met the prisoner there—he said I was to go to Whitecross-street, to load some casks, and he went there with me—we went into a yard, and there was another man there—they rolled the casks up into my van—the other man said he was going after a note—I cannot say whether the prisoner heard that—the other man said I was to take the casks to Love-lane, Shadwell—I was going through the Minories with the casks, I met a policeman, and told him.</p>

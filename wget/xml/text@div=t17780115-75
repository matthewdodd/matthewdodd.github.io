               <p>I went to bed with them both, and left my cloaths on a table in the room. I put my breeches under the bolster or pillow; my money was in my pocket; I did not sleep any; my knee-buckles were in my breeches, my shoe-buckles in my shoes under the bed. I had a cane with me, the property of Mr. Wallis; I left it in some part of the room. I was there about two hours; the prisoner got up and went down for a light; they contrived to put the light out, and the other woman bid her go for a better light; she went and staid a good while; then the other got up and went for her, and left me in the dark; they never returned. I got up and missed the things.</p>

               <p>When the gentleman took me up, I told him he had left the book on the bed, and I sent for Green to produce it. He asked me if I knew any thing of his buckles? I told him I did not; he said if I produced them, he would make me a present of half a guinea.</p>

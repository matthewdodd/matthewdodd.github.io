                  </hi>. I am waiter, at the Wrekin Tavern. I remember the prisoner being there on 28th Oct.—I was told to follow her when she left—she went into Drury-lane, and down a court leading to Bow-street—she went into a public-house at the corner, and called for a pennyworth of something, I do not know what—I went in, and called for a pennyworth of gin—I asked the landlady what the prisoner had given her—she said two halfpence—the prisoner went from there to the Globe Tavern—as she was going she stooped down—I watched her into the Globe—I stood outside a few minutes, and I heard money pass—I went in, and the prisoner was there—I asked the land<lb></lb>lady if the money the prisoner had tendered was good—she said that one that she had then was a good one, but she had tendered a bad one just the minute before—I called a constable, and desired him to take the prisoner back to my master, and he gave her in charge.</p>

The prisoner came there on 28th Oct., about 7 o'clock in the evening—she asked for some gin and peppermint—I served her—she gave me a half-crown—I found it was bad, and gave it her back—she gave me a good one, and I gave her change—the last witness came in and asked what she had given me—I told him she first gave me a bad one, which I gave her back, and she then gave me a good one.</p>

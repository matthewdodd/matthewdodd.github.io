I had seen the prisoner before that day, but was not acquainted with him. He was in the tap-room about eight o'clock in the morning. I had three sovereigns, two crowns, four half-crowns, and some shillings and sixpences in my pocket-handkerchief. I gave it to the landlord till I left; we went away together; he asked me to let him ride in my cart to Waltham-cross; he shook some hay about in the cart, and said,</p>
               <p>"Lay down and go to sleep, and I will drive." I did so. We kept on till we came to the Two Brewers public-house, at Ponders-end, and I was rather sleepy, but I saw that the horses were going wrong; the prisoner was then gone. I called to the horses to stop, and a man in the road stopped them; I then felt in my pocket and found it was cut, and the money was gone. I did not see him again till the Sunday week following, when he was in the cage at Cheshunt. I charged him with having my money, he said he had not had it.</p>

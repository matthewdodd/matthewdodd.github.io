                  </hi>. I was in the employ of John Knill and Co., who live in Frogmore-lane, Wandsworth—we had a tub of palm oil on the premises—it might have been there two or three months previous to the 9th of Jan.—there was 1 cwt. of the oil—it was the property of John Carvallo de Me<lb></lb>deiros—he is a partner in the firm, but this was his private property—on the 9th of Jan. I searched in the warehouse for it—I found the tub, but a quantity of oil, about 21lbs. missing—the prisoner was occasionally em<lb></lb>ployed by me, but he was not allowed access to the warehouse—some palm oil was produced to me in a pail—the oil is here in a cloth—I believe this to be part of that oil that was in the tub—it resembles it in quality, smell, and other particulars—I can positively identify it as having undergone a partial chemical process—I have compared it with the oil left in the tub, and I believe it to be some of the oil that was missing from it—it was worth about 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton.</p>

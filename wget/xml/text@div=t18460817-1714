On Tuesday, the 7th of July, between three and four o'clock, I saw the prisoner Lawson there—she asked me whether Mrs. Sonnex was at home—I said she was engaged—she said she came from Mr. Edwards, for the loan of 21.—Mrs. Sonnex is my sister—I went into</p>

On the 7th of July, about three o'clock, the prisoners came together to my shop—Wild said, "Will you oblige me with pen, ink, and paper, as I have lost two notes, and do not like to go back for a third"—she asked me to write for her—I wrote the note produced—Wild told me what to write—I then said, "It is to be signed"—she said, "Yes, 'J. Edwards" 1—I wrote "J. Edwards"—I inquired if it was to be sealed—she said it was of no consequence—I gave it to Wild and she gave it to Lawson—I had never seen Lawson before—Wild had been a customer of mine—she said she wai tired, and told Lawson to take the note—she went away with it, and Wild remained at my shop about twenty minutes—Lawson came back and said, "Mrs. Sonnex will send it; here is your half-crown," and gave her half-crown—she had other money in her hand—I did not notice what it wai—Wild had purchased goods in my shop, and paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I bad to give her 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, which she refused to take—she tied some money in the corner of her handkerchief, and they went away together.</p>

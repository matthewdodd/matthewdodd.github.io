                  </hi>. I live in Goswell Road—on 17th January, about 10.30, I was in Little Turner Street, a man asked me if I would treat him, I said no; he asked me a second time, I tried to get away, and he held my arm, and the prisoner came up and took my watch from my waistcoat pocket and broke my chain in two places—he went about 10 yards, I followed him, he caught hold of me round the neck and held me very tight for about a minute and a half, so that I could scarcely make a noise—the other man put his hand against my trowsers pocket outside—they both ran up the Commercial Road—I pursued them, lost sight of them, and gave informa<lb></lb>tion to the police—I saw the prisoner at the station about 11.15 the same night, and am certain he is the man-this is my watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

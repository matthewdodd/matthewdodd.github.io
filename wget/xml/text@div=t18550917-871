                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Joseph Fisher, of Nos. 4 and 5, Brokers'-alley, Drury-lane—his shop door opens into the alley—the house is about ten yards from Charles-street. On Friday night, 10th Aug., I shut up the premises at 9 o'clock—I secured the shop, and a window that I afterwards found open—that was shut the night before—there were rolls of cloth hanging up to dry in a first floor room, over the shop—about 3 o'clock in the morning I fancied I heard a noise—I lay in bed till about 20 minutes before 4 o'clock—I then turned myself in bed, and sat up, and fancied I heard a noise again—I lay down again, and about 20 minutes past 4 o'clock, I heard a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drive down Charles-street, which is about ten yards from the shop—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came down very slowly, and I heard some one unlock the shop door inside—I jumped out of bed, put the window up, and saw a man take a single piece of cloth to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the cabman was holding the door open, and the man threw it in—I called out, "<hi rend="italic">Cabman</hi>! stop thief!" as loud as I could halloo—the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi>, looked up at me, but still</p>

               <p>kept the door in his hand, and there were four or five men brought a piece each, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and slipped round the corner—when the last piece went into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, the cabman jumped on the box, and went off as fast as he could go—one man ran alongside the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and turned the handle of the door, to keep the goods from rolling out—when I saw that he was determined to drive away, I ran down two flights of stairs, to the ware-house—I had been on the second floor—I was in my shirt—when I got to the warehouse door the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was just turning the corner of Castle-street, about 100 yards from the door—I ran after it till I got to Queen-street—I was making a noise all the time, and in Queen-street the policeman stopped the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, just opposite the Freemason's Tavern—the prisoner is the man who had held the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> door, and afterwards drove away—some persons had joined me in running—I called out, and the driver must have heard me—he turned round and laughed—when I came up with him, I asked him what he was going to do with the cloth—he said a man had hired him to take it over the water—I looked at what was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and knew it as being my master's property—the prisoner was taken into custody, and we took the property down to Bow-street—I went back to my master's, and found some pieces had been removed out of the up stairs room down into the shop—there were two pieces below, and five had been taken away in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—my master afterwards saw them—the inspector afterwards examined the premises, and found the first floor window open, which had been safe overnight—if any one had got in at that window they could get into the shop, because I had left the key in the door—there were some lucifer matches, a crow bar, and a chisel found in the shop, which had not been there over-night—the house is in the parish of St. Martin in the Fields.</p>

Murray, the attorneys—when the account was first opened he described himself as a gentleman residing somewhere at Notting Hill—he afterwards described himself as an agent for the sale of steamships—the first letter we had from him directed us to answer to him "Post Restante, Marseilles"—from that I took it that he was on his homeward voyage—the money came in the shape of two bills on Glyn &amp; Co.—I cannot tell when they were drawn, we have no entry, merely that Glyn &amp; Co. had to pay them—we do not take the full particulars—we received the money from Glyn's.</p>

               <p>there about fifteen or sixteen months ago—while be was in the prison, by his direction I sold certain coupons of foreign bonds—I got them cashed for him—in June or July he gave me two coupons of Turkish Bonds, I think of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I took them to the Ottoman Bank in Princes street—they were not paying them at that time, and referred me to Messrs.

Mr. Graham from the prisoner</hi>: "Whitecross Street Prison. 24th January, 1868. Sir, In reply to your notice, I beg to inform you that I dispute your right to my present estate and effects, and I hold you, and all others connected with you, responsible to me for the spoliation of my property and deprivation of my liberty, and I call upon you to reinstate me in possession of the <hi rend="italic">Cathcart</hi>; and I require my body to be set at liberty, and ample damages to be paid me for the un<lb></lb>just deprivation of my liberty. I delivered up the whole of my property in 1857, which, if properly cared for and administered, should have left me a surplus of many thousands. I repeat I then gave up all my property, I concealed no part of it, and my books, lodged in Court, were correctly balanced. No charge was ever alleged against me, but owing to an impro<lb></lb>per trade assignee being appointed, and other unjust doings, the unjust de<lb></lb>cision adjourning me <hi rend="italic">sine die</hi>, &amp;c. I shall look to the Court for full remu<lb></lb>neration. It is now upwards of seven months since you told me you did not wish to keep me a prisoner, but that Murray and Hutchins held me—whose fault is it now?"</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the office of Messrs. Murray and Hutching, and have been, with slight intervals, since November, 1857—I have more particularly attended to this bankruptcy—the terms upon which the claims of the <hi rend="italic">Cathcart</hi> were compromised were these: in the first place, we gave notice to the mortgagee's solicitors, who were defendants in the suit, that we claimed the ship, and the damages payable to the prisoner: then, after a little time, we entered into some negotiations to settle the claims between the parties, hearing that there was to be an appeal by the mortgagees against the decision of the Court of Admiralty: at that time there was not one</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170112"></xptr>
               <p>farthing of estate to pay the expenses of any defence to the appeal; that was one reason why it was considered advisable that a compromise, if possi<lb></lb>ble, should be effected—we made enquiries as to what would be the probable amount of the damages awarded to Robinson: I also more than once wrote to him for an account of what damages were claimed; I could get no reply from him—I saw his solicitors in the suit in the Court of Admiralty, and talked the matter over with them, and ultimately an offer was made of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nett to be paid to the estate, in discharge of the ship, the ship to be made over to the mortgagees—at that time we had had the ship valued at 1660<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the mortgagees' claim was 2200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was told that the damages would not amount to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if I could get 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should make a very good settle<lb></lb>ment upon it—that arrangement went off for two or three months—they wanted us to take 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the arrangement ultimately carried out was, that 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid by the mortgagees, they were to have the ship, and the assignees were to pay Robinson's charges in the Admiralty Court, and the possession fees; 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid over to the mortgagees, out of which 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to Robinson's solicitors for their charges, a little better than 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for possession fees, and the ultimate result was, about 620<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received for the benefit of the estate—I may say that I saw the Registrar of the Admiralty Court on the subject, and he said it was a very good arrangement; it was not only the best that could be made for the creditors, but, I think, was a very fair arrangement—Wolfe &amp; Smith were the mortgagees of the ship—so far from our acting in connexion with them, we were acting very much against them; we acted throughout in opposition to them, to get as much is we could from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-cxamined Q.</hi> Who gave you notice of this <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Gibson and Mr. Price gave the firm notice of the <hi rend="italic">Cathcart</hi> affair—I know very little of Gibson further than I know he was a bankrupt, and Mr. Price was hit solicitor—it appears that under Gibson's bankruptcy Robinson was ex<lb></lb>amined, and the Commissioner recognized him, and it came out that he was an uncertificated bankrupt—Mr. Price searched the records, and came and told us of it, and of the prisoner's claim on the <hi rend="italic">Cathcart</hi>—Price and Gibson came together—they both got the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that reason—I thought it a very fair sum; it was the sum which perhaps they might claim under the Act of Parliament, 5 per cent—I took the opinion of my principals upon it—neither Wolfe or Smith communicated with me about it; with one exception, I have never seen either of that firm—Gibson told us of them; he knew Robinson's affairs, and of the proceedings in the Admiralty Court—he was examined at the Police Court, but merely to prove the hand<lb></lb>writing of these documents—I think the judgment in the Admiralty Court was somewhere in February, 1867, and Gibson came to us in March 1867—notice of appeal was given and entered—I received a notice of it from the proctor for Wolfe &amp; Smith, and from time to time they obtained an ex<lb></lb>tension of time to lodge their appeal—the official assignee was appointed immediately after that—we had a meeting about a month ago for the pur<lb></lb>pose of appointing a trade assignee—I believe Mr. McMillan, who was appointed, is a member of the firm of Halliday &amp; Co., who were the acceptors of the bill of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which Gilmore and Co. were pressing—that pressure was not the reason of the prisoner petitioning the Court, or of his trying to make an arrangement; I swear that—I swear boldly, from the documents put in my possession—an action was not being brought on the bill at the time he presented his petition; Gilmores were instructing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170113"></xptr>
               <p>us in the matter—I am only speaking from documents, because all this was four or five months before I entered the office—I have examined all the proceedings—Gilmores took up the bill, I believe, on behalf of the acceptors—we knew that at the time they were proving—the proof was admitted when I entered the office—we opposed the proof on behalf of Gilmore; I was in Court at the time—we opposed the proof of the sister's—it has been recently held that a person taking up a bill to the honour of the acceptor has a right to sue the endorser—it appears from the proceedings that we compelled further and better accounts to be furnished from time to time—I did not do it personally, the solicitors did it; we instructed Counsel to do it—we were then acting for the estate—I can't say who proposed that McMillan should be trade assignee; I was not in the office at the time; I only know as a fact that he was appointed—Gilmores voted for the choice—I should think it was not done at the instance of our firm—it must have been known at that time that the bill had been taken up; they had net dishonoured the bill, they had got it taken up—it must have been dis<lb></lb>honoured before it was taken up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that you, a solicitor, knowing that the bill was dis<lb></lb>honoured by Hallidays, proposed a member of Hallidays' firm to be trade assignee, when you were acting for Gilmores, who were pressing this man on that bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I see nothing wrong in that—you ask me whether we did so; it appears so—I believe Hallidays afterwards stopped, about three years ago, about eight years after that transaction—I don't know that they were in difficulties at that time; it does not show that they were by dishonouring an accommodation bill—I can swear that I am perfectly un<lb></lb>aware that they were in difficulties—McMillan has a house in the East Indies, and he went there—I believe there were two or three partners; one partner came home, and another went out—McMillan afterwards became managing partner of the firm abroad; he did not file any receipts; he could not; he had no right to receive any money: I say that as a lawyer—the Admiralty judgment says that the damage shall be assessed by the registrar and two merchants—it never was asesessed—nothing was done formally, but we could approximate from our knowledge of the way in which they do business in the Admiralty Court—I was told by the bank<lb></lb>rupt's own solicitor that if we received 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we ought to consider ourselves fortunate—Wolfe &amp; Smith are not acting in this prosecution in the slightest way—they know nothing of it—they have not given a farthing towards it, to my knowledge; I swear that most positively.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there any assets? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The only assets I received were 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid in with the petition, the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. returned as a good debt, turned out nothing; except that, there was not the slightest property.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I see in the balance sheet it is stated that certain hips were on their way, and there were expected assets, do you know</p>

               <p>whether McMillan received any of those? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had no power to do so—does it appear on the balance sheet? show it me—I have not the prisoner's books, they have been lost, and it is presumed they were lost between the accountants—I am not so sure they have not been lost by the prisoner's fault—they were given up to the Bankruptcy Court, but the accountants had to make out the assets—Pulling &amp; Co. were the accountants—I am not aware that it was stated by the prisoner that there were ships on their way home; and cargoes which would be available—I have heard of a ship called the <hi rend="italic">Free Trader</hi> in connection with certain transactions of the prisoner's—I am not aware that he alleged that he had any claims upon it—I believe some of the bills were given in connexion with it—I am not aware that he was to have the cargo, or any part of it—I never heard of such a state<lb></lb>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that as the official and trade assignees, who were originally appointed, had both died, and an interregnum had occurred before the appointment of fresh assignees in</hi> 1867, <hi rend="italic">there was no person in whom the property could vest, and therefore there could be no embezzlement or concealment of property by the bankrupt during that period; and that the official assignee recently appointed had no legal right to deal with the property, which was by law vested jointly in him and the trade assignee; and further, that as the property which the prisoner was charged with con<lb></lb>cealing, was acquired subsequently to the bankruptcy, the parting with it did not entail a criminal prosecution, the term" concealing, &amp;c." applying only to the property in his possession at the time of the bankruptcy</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a feather-bed-manufacturer in St. John-street-road The prisoner has been my porter for three years—I had not missed any thing till I received information—I then searched, and missed a spoon, which was safe on the Sunday before, I am certain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I had a person named White in custody—I got this spoon from the witness Turner—White was charged with stealing it—I had some conversation with White, and while he was at the station-house, the prisoner came there of his own accord, and said, "I am the person who gave the spoon to White"—I asked him where he got it—he said he picked it up in St. John-street-road—I asked him if he worked</p>

               <p>in the neighbourhood—he said he worked for Mrs. Swan in Goswell-street—I went there, and she said she had not lost one, but I found it had been stolen from her son—I searched the prisoner's lodgings, and among other articles found these scissors, which Mr. Swan identified.</p>

                  </hi>. This is my spoon. I know it by the initials, the peculiar make, and the engraving—I have not the least doubt of it—the scissors were made on purpose for me—the maker's name is on them—I had seen them about seven days before.</p>

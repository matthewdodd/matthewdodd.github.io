               <p>Q. How long did he live at this lodging of your's? - He was there about four months.</p>


               <p>Q. Were all these things let to him with the lodgings? - Yes. He went into the country about the 25th or 26th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260005"></xptr>of March 1793; I received a note from him on the 27th, it was sent by a porter, as soon as I received the note I had a suspicion that something was the matter, I immediately got a smith to get into the room, we got into the room and I found all these things at that time were missing; my wife was with me, and the porter that brought the note; I detained him; we had afterwards an information that he was lodging at No. 1, Plow court, Fetter lane; I went there and took four constables with me, and saw the prisoner there, it was between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; the woman that went as his wife was with him; the officers went into the room and said they had got a warrant; they immediately examined the desk and found duplicates that led to a great part of my property, and the key of my room; the prisoner was then taken into custody; I did not go to the pawnbroker's, my wife went, I saw some of the goods again in a few days, I saw them at home, they were the same goods as I had in the room, and were let to the prisoner; the constables brought them home, Baker and Slane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gardener. How many rooms were let to him, one or two? - Two rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say a room in your first examination? - He wanted only one room at first.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was this that you let him have possession of this room? - On the 22d of November; I let it him on the 19th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever deliver up any part of this property that was let to him? - Yes, he delivered a curtain and some trifles of one of the rooms to my wife, by that means I thought he was what he said, it was the curtains off one bed that he delivered up two or three days after he was in, and some few more articles; the rooms were both compleatly furnished.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gardiner to the Court. My lord, an objection arises here, it now turns out from the evidence of the prosecutor himself, that the prisoner quitted the apartments on the 25th or 26th of March, and in the indictment he has laid this theft to be committed on the 27th, therefore he has laid it to be committed after he left the apartments.</p>
               <p>Court. The day is not at all material if it is laid before the indictment is found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gardiner to Prosecutor. Did the prisoner bring any goods in? - I never see any.</p>

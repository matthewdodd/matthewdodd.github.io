               <p>On Wednesday last I lost the things in the indictment. I went to look after a place. I went into a publick-house; and I don't know how I lost them. I did not feel any body's hand in my pocket: I was intoxicated; it was cold, and I went to get a glass of something; it was in <placeName id="t17890114-69-crimeloc360">Shug-lane, at the sign of the Black Horse</placeName>

I believe I was intoxicated when I went into the house; I never was so before, nor never since. The weather was very cold; I had got my coat, I believe, under my arm. I am sure I took it into the the house, but whether I dropped it or not, I cannot tell. I fell asleep, and laid my head on the table. I first had some purl and gin; I did not feel any body take any thing from me. It was towards the evening when I went in, not quite dark. I missed my petticoat when I awaked, and the landlord said the prisoner had it.</p>

               <p>I lodge at the Black Horse in Shug-lane; this woman and the prisoner were drinking together. I saw the prisoner several times put his left-hand into her right-hand pocket; and this bundle lay under the table; he put it under his coat, and sat down; he went to go out of the door, and I laid hold of him. I went for a constable, and the prisoner pulled nine shillings and a guinea, and a silver thimble out of his pocket; and I wanted to return it to the prosecutrix. I have had the bundle and the money ever since.</p>

               <p>I keep the Black Horse, in Shug-lane. The prisoner at first said this woman was his wife; and she said she did not know him; I sent for a constable, and before he came, the prisoner pulled out of his pocket a guinea, nine shillings, and a silver thimble; the woman was in liquor. I carried the prisoner a quartern of peppermint, and the woman gave him half-a-guinea to get change; I gave it him; he laid it on the table. I cannot say she took it up; she had only one shilling afterwards.</p>

               <p>I did put my hands down to her petticoats, but not into her pocket. She gave me the money to take care of.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

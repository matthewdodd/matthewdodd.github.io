                  </hi>. I carry on the business of an engraver, in Regent-street. On Monday morning, the 13th of August last, the prisoner came to my house, and said he had several orders to give for engraving, and di<lb></lb>rected me to call on him the following morning, at Beety's hotel, Conduit-street, where I should receive instructions about it—that is the principal of what passed—I had never seen him before—he was with me some time, and looked at a great many impressions, and that sort of thing—I went next day to Beety's hotel, and found him there in the coffee-room—he pro<lb></lb>duced this genuine note on the Toronto Bank—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it was then perfect—the piece now detached then formed part of the note—he told me that he wanted the note re-engraved, and asked me what I would do it for—I agreed to do it for fourteen guineas, and he ordered me to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> on with the plate immediately—I looked at the note, and saw the names on it at the time, and he stated, after giving me the note, that he was one of the part<lb></lb>ners of the firm—he had previously told me that his name was Mr. John Hannon—he requested I would be particular in doing it like the original note, that he should require a great many done, having other notes to be engraved—it was arranged that it should be done in three weeks, I think—I then left, and proceeded with the engraving of the plate—he came to me constantly during the three weeks, every day, I should say, and saw the plate upon which I was working—he took it from my hands repeatedly to examine with the original, to see if I was doing it correctly—when it was nearly completed, he asked me to put the names of "Rorden Wright, Hatch and Co., New York," on the note, as it was on the original—their names appear at the bottom of that note as the engravers of it—I de<lb></lb>clined doing that, and offered to put my own name—he said that was of no use, and offered to give me a sovereign if I would do it—I refused to do it altogether—finding I would not do it, he said it was of no con<lb></lb>sequence, he would get it done in America—two or three days prior to the 10th of September, I made inquiry of a friend of mine, who had just returned from America, and in consequence of what he told me, I commu<lb></lb>nicated with the Bank agents in London—on the 10th of September the prisoner called for the plate and notes, which, according to appointment, I was to deliver to him that morning, (there were eighty notes,) but in con<lb></lb>sequence of what I had heard, I refused to part with them—I put him off with some excuse, and made another appointment with him—I think the 14th was the day fixed—I was then acting under advice—on the morning of the 14th, I think, he came and paid me, altogether, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I de<lb></lb>livered him the plate, and the eighty impressions—I was aware at the time I delivered them to him, that the police were on the watch—I had an im<lb></lb>pression taken from the plate, in addition to the eighty which I kept—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the eighty were fac-similes of this—on the 18th of September the prisoner came to me again—he told me that he had lost the</p>

               <p>notes, and the plate, at some house of ill fame, where he had been some few nights before, and that he should require the same plate re-engraved, and another exactly like it, with the exception of its being for five dollars instead of ten, and two other plates for the City Bank of Montreal—he at the same time produced an original note for the City Bank" a price was fixed on, and I agreed to do it—I was in communication with him up to the 27th of September—I went immediately to the solicitor, in consequence of his giving me these further orders, and made an arrangement with the police—I afterwards made an appointment to see the prisoner at a coffee-house, where he was taken into custody.</p>

PRENDIRGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you give up this genuine note, as you call it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some few days previous to the 10th of September I went with the gentleman I had communicated with, and gave it myself into the bands of the solicitor for the bankers—it was marked at the solicitor's chambers, I think, the day it was given up, but I will not charge my memory with that—it was marked in my presence—I will not swear when—it was marked by the clerk at Bow-street, and I believe it was marked at the solicitor's chambers, but I know the note so well, that I require no mark—I saw the prisoner cut the piece off—I will not swear it was marked till it was at the police-office, which was some time in October, I think—the prisoner was remanded from time to time, for fresh evidence from America—I know the note, by some acid which is on it, which makes all the vignette part green—(<hi rend="italic">pointing it out)—</hi> I can swear to it by that mark, and I copied the note, line for line, therefore, I know it well—I should most likely know it from any other similar note—it is dif<lb></lb>ficult <hi rend="italic">to</hi> print two impressions alike. <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean difficult to engrave two plates alike? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not exactly so—if impressions are taken one after the other from the same plate, they would be very much alike, but there may have been same thousands printed between that and another—it is difficult in that way to have two impressions alike from the same plate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now are not these two impressions very different from each other<lb></lb>should not you know the difference? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I should, the ruling is not at all alike in the corners, and the paper is as different as can be, quite of a different grain and manufacture—I do not see any thing particular about the edges—when I saw the prisoner at the hotel every thing was quite open, and very business-like—it was in the public coffee-room in a very respect<lb></lb>able hotel at the west-end—his manner all along was such as not at all to excite my suspicions—there were no persons in the coffee-room—Mr. Beety, the landlord, came in for a few minutes just before I left—the prisoner asked if there was a letter for him—Mr. Beety answered him, and gave him one that had come there—he was calling to the landlord or waiter as is usual<lb></lb>I went to him twice there—once about ten o'clock in the morning, and the other time about twelve o'clock—I never engraved notes for "banks of fashion," or any thing of that sort.</p>

                  </hi>. I was lately in the Surveyor-general's Office, in Upper Canada—I know the Toronto bank, and know Mr. Ridout per<lb></lb>sonally, and Mr. Proudfoot, the president of the bank—I think this is a genuine note—(<hi rend="italic">the me first produced by Mr. Hayes)—</hi> I have not the slightest doubt of it—the prisoner is not Mr. Ridout. <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES RUBRIDGE</hi>. I resided in Canada, and have done so many years—I know the bank <hi rend="italic">at</hi> Upper Canada—Mr. William Proudfoot is the president—I know Mr. Ridout the cashier—I am acquainted with the notes issued by that bank—I believe this to be a genuine note of the bank, at the same time I consider the signature of Mr. Rid out is not exactly the same as I have generally seen it—the capital letters are not quite the same, but I believe it to be a genuine note—these notes circulate extensively in Canada—I think this other note—(<hi rend="italic">the engraving produced</hi>)—if it were filled up, would pass in Canada.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The signature is not like Mr. Ridout's signature much? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The capital letters are not like his usual signature—the other letters are quite so—I have not a doubt of it being a genuine note—it ap<lb></lb>pears a very remarkable capital letter—the "R" does not look much like Ridout's certainly—his ordinary signature is generally very plain. <hi rend="smallCaps">ALEXANDER GILLESPIE</hi>. I am a merchant, living in London. I have transactions in Upper Canada, and have been there—I know the bank of Upper Canada—I should say this is a genuine note—(<hi rend="italic">the one first pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—I know Mr. Ridout—I believe this to be his signature—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the engraving</hi>)—I think, from the general appearance of this note, if it were filled up, it would pass among ordinary persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You think that is Mr. Ridout's signature—is the "R" like his? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is somewhat different to signatures I have seen, but taking it altogether, I have no doubt of it—I should undoubtedly take that to be a note of the Upper Canada bank—so I should the other, when complete, I think—I am not particularly acquainted with such things. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there not a remarkable difference in the paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One is new, and the other has been circulated—I should not hesitate much, before I considered it a genuine Upper Canada note, if it was filled up and com<lb></lb>pleted.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined. Q.</hi> Are you aware of a secret mode by which the genuine notes of the Upper Canada Bank may be known—I do not want you to disclose it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not so secret as that, but it is not generally known—I looked for the mark, the first thing I noticed in it; and I found it bear that test.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This is a great secret then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my honour I do not know—it may be known in England, and not in Canada—I am not connected with the bank at all, but I have had many notes pass through y hands.</p>

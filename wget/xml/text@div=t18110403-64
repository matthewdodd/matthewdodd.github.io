The prosecutor described the pattern of the handkerchief before I shewed it him, he said he was a druggist it smelled of opium. The gentleman went with me to the compter, he was well pleased that I had got the handkerchief, he wanted the handkerchief and to give me something for my trouble, I told him I could not let him have it. He promised to meet me the next day before the Alderman, he did not give me his address. The boy denied the hat first, and then afterwards said it was his hat.</p>

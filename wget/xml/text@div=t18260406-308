            . On Monday, the 27th of February, I was at the East India Company's sale-room, at <placeName id="t18260406-308-crimeloc1657">Cutler-street</placeName>

The prisoner came into the room, and asked for some samples of tea - he had six breaks of Hyson tea set before him, and he took samples of them all - it is usual for persons to bring samples of the same sort of tea as they intend to buy; I was so placed in the room, that I could see exactly what he did - he was sampling the tea, that is, taking a small quantity from each, in a little measure like the top of a cannister, which is the limit of the quantity allowed to be taken away; there are rules stuck upon the show-room, that no persons but such as are known are to have samples, and that none of them are to have more than the in measure; as the prisoner was sampling the teas, the man who was attending to him, went to get some more from another break, and I saw the prisoner, in his absence, take some of the tea, and put it loose into his right-hand small clothes pocket - he did this several times; I told Mr. French, the elder, he told me to watch him again, and not to accuse him without good reason; I then saw him put some Hyson tea into his breast-pocket; Mr. French then desired him to walk into the counting-house, and the tea was found on him; Mr. French said, "It is a pity a gentleman like you should act in such a way;" he seemed to be quite cut up about it, and begged Mr. French's pardon, and hoped he would let him off, and not take any further notice. Mr. French said he must tell the warehouse-keeper, and he might do as he thought proper - he said he had been a long while out of work, and was very much distressed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there a number of persons in the sale room? A. Yes; I was kneeling down, your face was towards me, and your back to the corner; I cannot state what breaks of tea you took most out of - you had about sixteen trays handed to you.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw what was going on, and informed the elder? A. Yes - the prisoner was still at the tray - when he had done he got up to go away - he took his bag and went down stairs - the elder was at the bottom, and stopped him.</p>

            . I am assistant elder to the Company. There were from twenty to thirty persons nailing up chests - when the prisoner came in, the commodore came to me, and said, "That gentleman has put some tea into his pockets - I desired him to watch him more closely, and I went down - when he came down stairs, and was going into the yard, I told him to walk into the counting-house, and said, I was very sorry to say he had got some tea - I had ordered the excise-officer to be there, and the tea was found upon him - he first said, "We were very short of samples," and then said, "I am very much distressed, and I did it for myself, being out of a situation."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear you did not come into the room where I was, and say, "Before you go I want to speak to you"? A. No - I never once spoke to you, nor came near to you - the business was never communicated to you till you came down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When people come to buy teas, do they bring samples and leave them there? A. Yes; the prisoner brought six samples, and I counted six samples which he had in his bag - the tea in his pockets was beyound the samples he had brought.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you asked me if I had any tea in my breeches pocket, I said I had - you said I must leave it - and did I not give it out? A. Yes; I took up your coat pocket and turned it out - you made no resistance.</p>

            . I was the Excise officer. I was present when the tea was found in his breeches and his side coat pockets; French took it from him, and said he had understood he had some tea - he trembled very much, and said he had, and he hoped Mr. French would not do any thing in it - he said he came from Messrs. Whitridge and Co., No. 91, Cheapside; I did not hear him say any thing about his own situation.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not in the room when I sampled these teas? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sampling the tea for some friends, having a great many friends, and having been twenty years in the business. I sampled a number of breaks of Hyson, and the sixteenth and seventeenth breaks appeared to me to be of a particular quality, and I took some of it. I do not deny taking it, but I do deny its being with a felonious intent; the last witness was at the end of the table, and twenty or thirty men were nailing down tea chests - and was it likely I should have gone to commit a felony at two o'clock in broad day. When I was asked if I had not tea I immediately gave it up.</p>
               <p>COURT to WILLIAM FRENCH. Q. What did he say? A. I said, "How came you to take this?" and he said, "I am short of samples;" and then he said it was for himself.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it customary to allow the parties to take their samples themselves, or is it given them by the officer of the Company? A. He takes the sample out in a tin measure - it is put into a paper, and the sample they bring is measured in the same measure.</p>

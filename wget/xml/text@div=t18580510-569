His shop is at the corner of Monmouth Road—there is a board outside his window, on which I am in the habit of placing pieces of bacon and cheese, and various things—on 19th April, about a quarter before 9 o'clock, I placed some pieces of bacon on that board—during</p>

               <p>the next hour, I was engaged in going from the cellar to the shop—about 9 o'clock, in consequence of something I heard, I examined the board, and missed one or more pieces of bacon—I can speak confidently to one, which is commonly called the collar of bacon, a piece from the shoulder part—itweighed about 3lbs.—that was one of the pieces that was placed out shortly before 8 o'clock—it was after half past 7 o'clock.</p>

On 19th April, I was serving in the shop in the evening—one of my shopmen was absent; the other was partly in the shop and partly in the cellar—I saw him bring some pieces of bacon and put them on the board, about half past 7 o'clock—I did not in the course of that evening sell a collar or shoulder piece of bacon—there was no one else except Rumins, who could have done so—about 9 o'clock, Mrs. Wright and Miss White came in—Miss White spoke to me first, and in consequence of that I went to Wiltshire, the police<lb></lb>man on duty, and gave him information of what I had ascertained—after hearing what I said, he referred me to the station—I went to the station and communicated what I had heard to inspector Grant; he said he would go with me to the superintendent—we went to Mr. Hughes' house; he was from home—Iwaited till about 12 o'clock; I saw him, and he directed inquiries to be made—we went to inspector O'Brien, the prisoner, about 1 o'clock, he was up and dressed—I saw his children, he was at that time keeping an empty house; I found no bacon in the house—I did not see a red pocket handker<lb></lb>chief found—I saw the prisoner in custody the next evening—after we had searched the house, we all returned with O'Brien to superintendent Hughes—heasked O'Brien where he was that evening—he said he did not know where he was, he was at certain places during the day—Mr. Hughes asked him to confine himself to between 8 and 9 o'clock—he said he was quite confused, and could not do so at the time—he said he was in the New Buildings during the day—he was ultimately taken into custody, and the inspector came the next morning and saw Mrs. Wright, and took her statement—I said, "I am now in your hands, Mr. Grant"—I gave directions for the prisoner to be taken; he was taken that evening—when he was brought into the inspector's room the charge was entered; he did not say a word—I did not at any time hear him make any statement about the charge.</p>

Monmouth Road is on one side of Mr. Page's, and my house on the other—I rent the shop and part of the premises—my husband carries on business as a matting and basket maker—previous to 19th April, I had known the prisoner by sight, passing up and down Marylebone Lane, where I had been brought up by my parents—I had spoken to the prisoner; he had come to the door, and asked how father and mother were—I did not know his name before—on 19th April, I saw him pass my door, with his arms free, and he passed Mr. Page's—he returned, and took a piece of bacon, and I saw him conceal it under the front skirt of the coat he had on, while passing my door—he passed Mr. Page's; he did not remain a minute; he crossed Monmouth Road, and returned directly—he took the bacon from the corner next Monmouth Road—I do not know whether his coat had bright buttons or not—he went towards the Galway Road; the next turning on the same side, past our shop—he returned in not more than five minutes, and had something in a red handkerchief, under his arm—he had nothing at all under his arm the first time; his arms were swinging—when he came back, he</p>

                  </hi>. On Monday, 19th April, I saw the prisoner standing by the side of Mr. Page's shop, on the Monmouth Road side, about 8 o'clock—he was about a yard and a half from Mr. Page's shop; he was about a yard and a half from the board at the window—I did not see him doing anything, but saw him standing there—he went from the Galway Road, and went past to the Monmouth Road; I saw him go a few steps—he crossed Monmouth Road into Westbourne Road; he went towards Palmer's shop—I only saw him go a few steps across the Monmouth Road; I was was going on my business—I saw the prisoner again, about ten or twelve minutes afterwards; I met him between Galway Road and Mr. Page's shop, about thirty yards from Mr. Page's shop—he had a red parcel; it appeared to me to be a pocket handkerchief—I noticed that he had no parcel before.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said he was crossing from Page's towards Palmer's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was crossing Monmouth Road, towards the Hereford Road—he was not going towards Palmer's, but opposite to Palmer's—when I first saw him, I was against Mr. Page's shop; I was going towards the Galway Road—I passed him as he was standing there—I looked back, and saw him crossing the road.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 113). The prisoner was my inspector. On 19th April, while I was on duty, about 8 o'clock, I saw him in the Galway Road; he went up the Westbourne Road, towards the prosecutor's shop; he was thirty or forty yards from it—that was about seven minutes</p>

               <p>past 8 o'clock—he had a bundle under his arm, in a red pocket handkerchief—Iwas coming by again, about forty minutes afterwards, and Mr. Page spoke to me—I referred him to my superior officers.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police inspector</hi>). The charge was made to me at the station, and I referred to the superintendent, Mr. Hughes—Iwent with him; I searched the prisoner's house; I found nothing—I took the prisoner into custody afterwards; I found on him this red pocket handkerchief, exactly in this state; it has been in my possession ever since—Ifound this on the following day, at 5 o'clock—I should say, from the state of it, that it has not been used since it was washed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you open it, at the time you first found it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I cannot say whether it is now in the same condition, as to the folds—Ifound it loose in the pocket; it was not folded, as if it had just come from the washerwoman; I folded it—I searched the house that night—I searched pots and pans, and everything of that sort—I did not find anything that could indicate the presence of bacon—I did not notice whether his coat smelt of bacon; I did not examine the skirts of it—he said the charge was entirely untrue—he offered every facility in searching the house—he stated that he had been out making inquiries that night, and I believe he had—he is a man who has borne an excellent character in the force; he had a large amount of money passing through his hands every week—he was living in an empty house, to take care of it; that is only done to persons of good character.</p>

On the 5th of November, a little after nine o'clock in the morning, I was standing at the door; a woman came past me, and asked me if I had not lost a coat; I looked at the door, and missed a coat; she pointed to the man that had got it under his arm; I ran, and overtook the man, and another man had got it on; the prisoner had sold it for fifteen shillings; the man that bought it told me so, he was just going to pay him for it when I got up. I had lost the coat for five minutes I suppose. I brought the prisoner back, and gave him in charge of a constable.</p>

            . I have got four children besides the twins, six in all I have had. The twins were born in the week after Bartholemew Fair, in September, and then I had four children alive besides them. I lost one of my twins. One day I was sitting in St. Paul's Church-yard; the prisoner came up to me; I only had sit there two days, She came up to me, and gave me a penny; she said, poor woman, you have got two fine babies. I said yes; she then said, you do not seem to get much money here; if you will go along with me. I will take you to a fine lady that will give you half a guinea. I walked with her, I took notice of her person; I saw there was a tooth out on the right side of her upper jaw, pock marked, and dark eyes. She had a reddish spotted gown on. I walked along with her, I was carrying both the twins; in Cheapside, the wind blew my cloak off the babies, my child of five years old was following me, I asked the prisoner to put the cloak over the babies, for fear they should get cold, She offered to carry one of them; I yielded to give her the biggest of the twins into her arms. We went into the Commercial road, and she kept close to me all the way, until I got to the Commercial road at the corner of a public house. She put her hand into her pocket, and gave me three pence, and told me to get a pint of beer; I told her I did not want beer or gin, I wanted to see the lady. She said, my dear woman, I'll not be long from you, I will go and shew this fine lady this twin. I followed her up a court, I kept sight of her until my child of five years old fell over a heap if bricks. I turned round to see whether my little girl was coming after me, I went and picked up my child, and when I turned back again, the prisoner had turned the corner out of my sight directly, I did not see her again for six weeks. This happened on the 14th of October, about three o'clock; then I screamed out; I searched about for my child from three o'clock in the afternoon until seven. When I lost the child, the child had on a striped cotton bed gown, a shirt, a flannel cap, and a cotton light bonnet. When I saw the prisoner again, I knew she was the woman that took the child from me; I saw her on board a ship; I wanted to have a kiss of my child; the sailor that was with her would not let me kiss my child; the sailor is here to day; the officer took tho child and the woman into custody. My child had not on the same clothes as I left with it; I undressed the baby at the public house for the first time again; I found my piece of flannel on it. I told the prisoner that was my piece of flannel. I claimed it in the hearing of the prisoner and in the hearing of the officer. I had handbills printed; I gave description of the baby and the prisoner, and I went to Lambeth-street office.</p>

I told the prisoner that she was charged with stealing the child, that it did not belong to her. I said it was stolen from Mrs. Cremer. The prosecutrix was in a boat along<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110054"></xptr>side of the ship. The prisoner seemed very much confused; said it was her own child; that when she came to London she would shew me the room where she was delivered on a Friday, six weeks before that very day. On the 26th of November she had been taken bad in the Minories, a young woman came by and took her to her room, where she was delivered, the young woman took her to her room in White Rose Court, Rosemary Lane.

The prisoner said she lived in Bly's buildings, Sun-street, Bishopsgate-street, that she went out of her mother's room at three o'clock, and went home to her mother at five o'clock the same day. She went home in a coach; she lived in the same house with her mother in the room above her; she said the name of the father of the child was Swaine.

When Mrs. Cremer saw the prisoner, she would have struck her had not I interfered; she said that is my child, and that is the woman that stole it. The description in the handbill corresponded with the prisoner very much but as to age. On the next day I went to White Horse Court, Rosemary Lane; there is twenty houses or more in the court.

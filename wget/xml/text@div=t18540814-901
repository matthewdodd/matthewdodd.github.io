                  </hi>. I keep the Grapes, in George-street, Minories. On Tuesday, 18th July, the prisoner and another female came to the bar, and asked for half a quartern of gin—the prisoner laid down a sixpence—I looked, and had my doubts about it—my wife was standing on my right; she said, "I can see here that it is a bad one"—it was tried in the detector, and it was bad—I put on my hat to go to look for an officer, and the prisoner ran out at the side door—she turned up Little George-street, which is not a thoroughfare—she came back, and as she was coming down the street she saw me, and said, "What do you want with me, you d—d old b—r?"—I made up my mind to stick close to her—she ran up and down Jewry-street two or three times, crossed the Minories, and went down by Moses'—a policeman brought her back in custody—I kept the sixpence in my pocket wrapped in a piece of paper till the day the prisoner was committed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George William Mayne, and live at Poplar. On the 6th of December, I got up about half-past six o'clock—I went into the shop, and a man rushed from before the counter into the street—he had rather a difficulty in getting out at the door—I went to the door, and saw Forrester, the constable—I told him, and he pursued him—I examined my shop, and saw the till was cut, and the loek almost off—there were some knives on the counter, but I might have left them there the night before—the man in the shop had a cap on—I had locked the till the previous night—there was no cutting then—he had got into the shop by breaking a panel in the door, putting his hand in, and opening it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the morning of the 6th of December I was on duty, about half-past six o'clock, and saw the prisoner run out of Mr. Mayne's shop—I pursued and took him—I found on him a box of lucifer-matches and three duplicates.</p>

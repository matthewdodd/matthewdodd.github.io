                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Norwich-court, East Smithfield. On Sunday night, 30th May, about half-past 9 o'clock, I went to the Three Crowns public-house, East Smithfield, and stopped till about 11—Thomas Murley was with me, and Daniel Tennison—we three were drinking together—Angelina Heath, a girl of the town, was there—she was not drinking with us—I do not know that she was with any particular party—I only saw her there—there was a party of foreigners at the Three Crowns—I did not see the prisoners there—two glasses of liquor were upset on the table, and a dis<lb></lb>turbance took place between Murley and one of the foreigners—it resulted in a fight between Tennison and one of the foreigners—the girl Heath was <hi rend="italic">growling</hi> and <hi rend="italic">going on</hi> at Tennison, and saying they ought to know better—she did not strike them—she only scolded them, and abused Tennison—the landlord turned the whole party out of the house—I do not know whether one of the foreigners got a blow at that time—Tennison and me then went to the One Crown, in Butler's-buildings, East Smithfield—Brown Bear-alley crosses Butler's-buildings—a man named Conolly came in, and I asked him to drink—the foreigners were there, but neither of the risoners—I was there drinking a couple of hours, till twenty minutes past 1 on Monday morning, when we all four came out into Brown Bear-alley, where Conolly lived—I saw Angelina standing at the door of No. 5—that was not Conolly's house—he lives at No. 6, next door—Tennison went up and spoke to her—she said something to him, and I heard him say he would spit in her eye if she did not leave him alone—he was drunk—I cannot say whether she was sober—she had spoken to him in the Three Crowns—when he said that to her, I saw Guiseppe standing by himself behind Angelina, in the middle of Brown Bear-alley—he was near enough to hear what Tennison said to her—Conolly went from his own steps, put his arm round Tennison's waist, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185206140059"></xptr>
               <p>said, "Now then, I won't leave you till I get you home"—Conolly was sober—while he had hold of Tennison by the waist, I saw Antola come out with a poker from No. 6 passage on the opposite side of the alley to which Angelina was standing—he struck Conolly across the back with the poker as he had hold of Tennison—his back was towards Antola—Murley ran to Antola, laid hold of the poker, and pulled it out of his hand—he came back about six feet from No. 6 door, with the poker in his hand, towards the top of the court—that was further from No. 5 than he had been before—when Murley took the poker away, Remorino was standing across the gutter on the other side of the court, against No. 5 door, and he ran up and hit Murley under<lb></lb>handed in the stomach; I mean upwards—that was before Murley had gone the six feet up the court—it was just as he had got the poker from Antola—he came back with the poker in his hand—Mrs. Wallis came to him and said, "Murley, that is my poker"—he said, "Take it, I am stabbed"—I pulled his trowsers down, lifted his shirt up, and saw blood running down his belly, and his entrails coming out—I led him away, met a policeman, and told him—I set Murley down under a chandler's shop-window, and went with the policeman to the place where the stab bad taken place, but the prisoners were gone—on the Monday morning the girls gave us some information, and we ran and took Antola—he was taken to the hospital, and I went with him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 91). On Monday, 31st May, I was on duty in the neighbourhood of Brown Bear-alley about 1 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I heard a disturbance in Butler's-buildings and Brown Bear-alley, close to the One Crown—I saw two foreign sailors there, not the prisoners; one had got a blow on his eye, which looked very red, as if it was just done; they were quarrelling with some landsmen—I got them to go away—Angelina was there, and she was giving them in charge—I do not know what they said—this was in East Smithfield, 300 or 400 yards from the Three Crowns; it was close to the One Crown—about ten minutes after I got the foreigners to, go away, I was getting a man away who had struck the foreigner, who had got the black eye; and I heard cries of "Murder!" and "Police!" in Brown Bear-alley—I ran there, and as I got to the entrance three men passed me; they were running—I did not stop them, as there was no cry to do so—there was not room for two persons to pass—I turned, to allow them to pass, and saw that one of them was Antola—when I got up I found Murley wounded; he was not able to walk, and was taken on a stretcher to the London Hospital.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 198). I was on duty, and assisted in taking the deceased to the station, and from there to the London Hospital—Antola was taken about an hour afterwards—I was at the London Hospital when he was brought into the ward where the wounded man, Murley, was—previous my taking Murley to the hospital, he said, "I am dying"—he appeared to be serious at that time—I took him to the hospital, undressed him, put him to bed, and the surgeon saw him—he said nothing more about dying—what he did say was before the surgeon had seen him, and before he came to the hospital—he appeared in a fainting state when I took him there—I noticed the wound—his bowels were partly out—he was bleeding very furiously—when Antola was brought before Murley, Murley said, "That is the man that handed the knife to the other man that stabbed me."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, H</hi> 25). I apprehended Guiseppe on the 31st May, about 4 o'clock in the morning—I searched him, and found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his trowsers pocket—it was not open—I saw marks on it of blood, apparently—I told him I took him for stabbing two men who were in the London Hospital—he pointed to his head, and said some</p>

               <p>Englishmen struck him on the head with a stick—he spoke English rather imperfectly, but I perfectly understood what he said—there was a slight mark on his forehead—I took him to the London Hospital, where Murley was in bed, about half-past 4 o'clock—I asked Murley if he knew him—he said, "Yes; that is the man who stabbed me with the knife"—Guiseppe spoke in Italian, and I could not understand what he said.</p>

The deceased was brought there about half-past 2 o'clock in the morning—he died there about 10 minutes past 12 that night, from a wound on the lower part of his person, from which the bowels were protruding to the extent of four inches—there was hope of recovery, but it very seldom happens—it was a wound which might have been inflicted with a knife of this kind.</p>

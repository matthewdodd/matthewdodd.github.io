                  </hi>. On 19th July I went to Mr. Bono's stables, with Allen, and found Brown and Halliday—inside the coach house door we found a bag of paper, and a quantity of wrappers, and bags of string like these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked Halliday how he came by the wrappers—he said that he bought them of Cox and Wyman, in Great Queen-street—I asked him if he had an invoice of them—he said, no, but if I went there, I should find that it was correct—there are two rooms up stairs—Halliday lives there—I went up, and in one room found a large quantity of paper, two bundles of the <hi rend="italic">True Briton</hi>, two bundles of the <hi rend="italic">Athenœum</hi>, and several reams of newspapers—they were on a table, covered over with a shawl—Halliday said that he bought the newspapers of a person named Barclay—I asked him how he accounted for the <hi rend="italic">Athenœum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">True Briton</hi>—he said that he bought them of some person, he did not know who the man was—I took him to the station—there was about 3 cwt. of printed paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Wertheim and Mackintosh, pub<lb></lb>lishers, of Paternoster-row. They publish the <hi rend="italic">True Briton</hi>—they sent it to Messrs.

A sort of newspaper; there are two volumes of it published—they had a great quantity of the back stock which had been accumulating—they never sold it for waste paper; it was not their property, but the author's—it might ultimately come to waste paper—some thousands of it remained on the premises—there is none of it there now, we sent the whole stock to Messrs.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200081"></xptr>
               <p>ago we received 15 cwt. Home odd pounds, I believe, of the <hi rend="italic">True Briton</hi>. from Wertheim and Mackintosh, but the account is locked up, as Mr. Henry Spicer is in Paris—it was deposited with us to be kept—it was put in what we called the nineteen house, which is part of the warehouse—there were not any <hi rend="italic">Athenaeums</hi> in the same place—the <hi rend="italic">True Briton</hi> was moved in June to where the <hi rend="italic">Athenœum</hi> was—subsequently to discovering the <hi rend="italic">True Briton</hi> at Halliday's, I had weighed that which was left at our place, and found a deficiency of 1 cwt. 1 qr. 1 lb.—I stood by and saw it weighed—that which was found weighed 56 lbs.; it was rather less than half the deficiency—this is the same description of tying up, but I cannot swear to it—I have seen Halliday at Messrs. Spicer's premises on one occasion; he came to the front door to ask if he could put his horse and cart in our stables on account of the place being repaired, and permission was given him—the stables are at the back of the warehouse—I have seen him on other occasions at the back of the premises talking to Calthorpe—it was three or four weeks previous that he put his horse and cart there—I cannot say what be has been doing on other occasions, but I have seen him talking there—we had no dealings with Messrs. Bone—the value of these wrappers is 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have sold them at all times, but have never sold any to Halliday.</p>

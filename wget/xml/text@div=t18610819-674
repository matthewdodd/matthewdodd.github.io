                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of letter-carriers at the General post-office—the prisoner was employed in July as letter-carrier at the eastern district, Commercial-road—he also assisted in sorting the letters before his delivery—in consequence of instructions I went to that office on the morning of the 24th—the prisoner was then engaged in sorting letters—Bingham came to me, and I placed myself in a situation where I could see the prisoner, but he could not see me—I saw him feel some of the letters—he found one and felt it with his finger and thumb—he then placed it at the back of other letters which he had in his left hand, and went on sorting till he came to that letter again, and then placed it at the back of some other letters—he then collected the letters which he had been sorting, and took them to hit seat to arrange them in order for delivery—when he got to his seat I saw him feel the letter again—it was then among some other letters—he laid it apart from them while he was sorting, drew it towards him, looked round him, drew his handkerchief out, wiped his mouth, and dropped his hand<lb></lb>kerchief on the letter, which he took up under his hand<lb></lb>kerchief and pat it in the inside pocket of the flap of his coat—I asked him his name, and then said, "Step into the inspector's room; I want to speak to you"—Bingham came into the room directly afterwards and said, "You have been seen to pot a letter into your pocket; is that so?"—he said, "No, I have not"—I directed Bingham to search him, who took the handkerchief from his pocket and this letter fell from it—it is addressed Mr. W. Tripple, 17, New-street, Londen, Limehouse—I could see that there was coin in it—I said to the prisoner, "How do you account for that letter being in your pocket?"—he made no answer—I said, "How came it in your pocket; who put it there"—he said, "I did"—it was not in his delivery, and he had no right to take it with his letters to his seat—it bears the post-mark of London, S.E.—Erith is I think in that district—that would come in due course to the Commercial-road office, for delivery at Limehouse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many persons were engaged sorting letters at that time beside the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps ten or twenty; they were in the same room as he was—this letter might rightly pass through the prisoner's hands in process of sorting, but it had no right to be at his seat—the sorters each take a bundle to sort promiscuously into different alphabets, and after they are sorted, they are taken to the letter-carriers' seats by themselves—several letters, including this, were taken by the prisoner to his seat, but they were not tied up in a bundle—it has always been my notion that he separated a particular letter from the others, and threw his handkerchief over that identical letter, because I had had infor<lb></lb>mation that he had done it before—that has always been my account of how this occurred—it is very possible that his handkerchief may have fallen over other letters, and he then picked it up and put it in his pocket—when I asked him who put the letter in his pocket, he said, "I did"—I did not hear him say subsequently that how the letter came into his pocket he could not say, unless he had picked it up with his handkerchief—he never said that he was innocent, or that it was a mistake; nothing of the kind—he said, "I put it there," and then ended the conversation—I gave him in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the sorting table, are the letters thrown out indiscrimi<lb></lb>nately from the bags? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a number of clerks are employed there sorting letters—they sort the letters to particular walks for the different carriers—a letter-carrier sorting, would have some letters for his own walk, and some for other walks—this letter was not in the prisoner's walk, so he should either have sorted it, or given it to the proper letter-carrier—the letter was just in advance of him—when he returned his handkerchief to his pocket, I could not see whether the letter was gone or not—I could not tell one letter from another—when he removed his handkerchief, I could not positively say whether a letter had been removed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable attached to the post-office—on the morning of 27th July, I accompanied Mr. Clare to the eastern district office, Commercial-road, and placed myself where I had a full command of the prisoner, who was sorting letters at the sorting table—I saw him feeling them with his finger and thumb—he put a letter at the back of other letters, I which he had in his hand; and when he came to it again, he sorted it to some letters which he took away to his seat—he then singled the letter from the others, pulled it a short distance nearer to him, in front of the others, put his hand in his pocket, took out his handkerchief, wiped his mouth and I nose, put it down on the table, picked it up and put it into his flap coat<lb></lb>pocket—Mr. Clare called him into the inspector's office, and I followed—Mr. Clare told him he had been seen to put a letter into his pocket—he said that he had not—by Mr. Clare's directions, I drew the handkerchief out of his pocket and shook it; this letter fell from it, and I picked it up—I could feel that it contained a coin—Mr. Clare then asked him how that letter came to get into his pocket—her made no answer—Mr. Clare asked him again, and he said, "I put it there"—I then went away to search his premises, and left him with Mr. Clare.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were those the words he made use of, "I put it there?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there is no mistake about that; I am quite sure of that—the words were not "I did;" he said, "I put it there"—I was examined at the police-court—I did not say a word there about watching the prisoner', and seeing all this done, because I was not asked—I considered that portion of my evidence of importance, but Mr. Clare had given it—I took the prisoner from the post-office to the police-station, and the charge was entered of stealing the letter—I did not hear him say, "I did not steal it, I must have picked it up with my pocket-handkerchief" nor words to that effect—nothing of the kind—he did not deny stealing the letter in my hearing at any time, nor did he offer any excuse—he was not asked.</p>

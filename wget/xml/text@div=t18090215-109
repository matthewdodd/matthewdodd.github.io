               <p>Q. Look at the 5th of April last, killing two pigs, two shillings, did you make that entry - A. I did; I killed the pigs, the two shillings was paid to me; I was present at the delivery of the pigs to Mr. Warboys.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that pig that was delivered to Mr. Warboys one of these two, for which there is two shillings charged for killing - A. Undoubtedly it is. I was present when Wager paid three pounds; I signed the receipt with Wesley's name, by Wesley's desire. This was on the 2nd of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look in the book and see if there is any entry of three pounds received of Mr. Warboys, does it appear on the 2nd of May, or afterwards - A. No; that is the book I kept for Wesley. Some time after he expressed himself as though he thought he never should get the remainder of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that time give you directions to put down the three pounds - A. I never received any directions to put down the three pounds; he said let it be till I receive the remainder, it will make a short account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after that under his direction make up the book for the quarterly settlement - A. Undoubtedly I did; that was at Midsummer. The balance was then struck and settled, without that three pounds being brought to account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to cast up the book once a week - A. Yes; I used to come on a Sunday, take his directions, and cast up the book, On Friday the money was sent up to pay the men.</p>

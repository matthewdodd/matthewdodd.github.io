                  </hi>. I am a silk-dyer in the service of Sarah Reynolds and her partner. The prisoner was a labourer there, and prepared the silk for dyeing—on the 6th of July, I saw him in the skeining-room with a small quantity of silk in his hand, contrary to the mode of working, which raised my suspicions, and I informed Williams the foreman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman at the factory. I was in the dye-house when I received the information—I watched the prisoner, and saw him break the thread of the skein, and take about one-sixth from the skein, and then tie it again—I then went to him, and said, "You are a long</p>

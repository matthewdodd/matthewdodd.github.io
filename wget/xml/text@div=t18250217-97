            . I am a constable of the Thames Police. I was stationed in the West India Docks. In consequence of information I went on board the ship of which the prisoner was mate - I found the jacket and waistcoat in the after part of the ship, stuffed into a place which is never used for clothes; the prisoner was with me, and said he had put them there; he begged me to say nothing about it, but to consider his wife and children.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you known him long? A. Yes, about ten years - he has a good character, and has been master and male of several ships.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a most excellent character.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. On the 24th of October last, were you going towards Pentonville? - A. I was, from Falconer-square, Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time in the evening? - A. It wanted about ten minutes of nine when I set out from my father's house; I had passed through St. John's-square, Clerkenwell, and met with no interruption till I came to <placeName id="t17961130-4-crimeloc17">Rosoman's-row</placeName>

               <p>Court. Q. Where were they at this time? - A. Just before me, in the street leading to the field where I was afterwards robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the place where you were robbed? - A. I suppose, about a quarter of a mile; they before crossed me, looked me in the face, and I thought they were thieves, and then determined not to cross the fields; they crossed the fields, but took a circuit towards Sadler's-Wells, and I saw no more of them till I came within 150 yards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300007"></xptr>of my own door; when I came near the reservoir wall, three persons rushed from the side of the wall, I had then a stick in my hand, so they could not come in front of me, they sidled round, and laid hold of each arm, and clapped a pistol to each of my temples, one stood in front, a tall man, and said, no resistance; I made answer, you have taken away all power of resistance; they having my hand so, one asked me for my watch, I took it out, and gave it the man that stood in front; then another man on my left hand said, where is your money, I gave him the money, and counted it, and said, there are four guineas; about this time, my brother, who was with me, was much agitated, they said to him, don't be alarmed, we won't hurt you, these were the words; the tall man then gave the watch to the man on the right hand of me, and he put the watch, I think, into his pocket; I said, you won't do me any harm of course, they said, no, they would not; I had before heard somebody coming across the field, I said to the men, I am going to Pentonville, they said, I must not go there, for they were going there; I then asked them if I might cross the fields to Sadler's-Wells, they told me I must not go that way at this time, the tall man

             a handkerchief thus over here, just across his nose, and slouched his hat, I asked them(then I was rather hurt, they would not let me go any way), which way then am I to go, they said, you must turn back towards London; I then, in consequence of what they said, did turn back, two of them holding their pistols at me; I said, I certainly should turn back, as I should not like to have the contents of those in my head.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did this transaction take up? - A. Above a minute.</p>

               <p>Q. How were the persons dressed? - A. All in dark great-coats.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be the same persons you saw in Rosoman's-row? - A. Yes, it struck me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light or dark evening? - A. It was a light evening, a fine star-light evening.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you an opportunity of observing their faces? - A. I had a full view of them, especially of the man that stood in the front, I thought they had not been robbers, but drunken men; I should know the tall man and the little man that stood on my right-hand side; I had gone but a few paces before I met two gentlemen, Mr. Riley and Mr. Richardson, they asked if I had been robbed, I said I had, and we all joined in the pursuit; at that time two men were running before; I came opportunity own door, about 150 yards from where I was robbed, and found the prisoner in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. In whole custody? - A. In the custody of Day; there were a number of persons round him before that, he said he was not one of the men that committed the robbery, he had none of the property about him; when I came up, I said, you are one of the men that robbed me; he said, he was not, he had none of the property about him, he said, search me; he was taken to the watch-house, and desired to pull his great-coat off, he then drew the handkerchief in the same manner as after he robbed me, upon which I exclaimed, you are the man that stood in the front of me and took the watch, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance of time was it, between your coming up to him, and the robbery? - A. About two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon seeing this prisoner again and again, have you any doubt he is one of the men that robbed you? - A. The more I look at the man, the more I am convinced he is the man that robbed me; I have no doubt he is the man, because I had a full view of him, and from all the circumstances that happened, I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you take any particular notice of him at the time? - A. Of him particularly, because he asked for my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man in front hold a pistol? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You conclude, by saying you have no doubt of him? - A. I have no doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say before the Justice? - A. That considering every circumstance, I had no doubt he was the man that robbed med; Mr. Bond said, he admired my caution.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you did say at that time you were not certain the prisoner was one of the men? - A. I did not say so; I said, when I consider all the matter, I have no doubt he is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not from a recollection of his person then, but from the circumstances? - A. From his person.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first meet with them? - A. In Rosoman's-row.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, you met with them in the fields? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not the fields where they robbed you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in the public highway? - A. There is a path through the field, it is a field belonging to the New-River-Company, there is no way for horses and carts, except the New-River-Company's with pipes.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 4, Jermyn street, and keep a shop in the Strand; on the evening this matter took place, I was about ten yards from Mr. Chetham when this happened, I heard a voice say, don't be alarmed, I won't hurt you.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300008"></xptr>Q. Did any person make his appearance? - A. A little boy ran up to me, Mr. Chetham's brother, and begged I would come forward, for his brother was robbed; I said, take my parcel, my dear, I will assist your brother directly; Mr. Chetham met me, and said, sir, I am robbed; I said, there is no time to talk of it, but pursue directly; I followed the prisoner, and in ten minutes he sell, I mixed in the crowd, not wishing to have any thing more to do with it, not knowing Mr. Chetham; I carried the parcel I had, and then had the curiosity of going to the watch-house, and upon hearing the prisoner's voice, I said, that is the man that said, don't be alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of the opinion still that that is the man? - A. Yes; after the number of gentlemen had gone out of the place, and I came again to the watch-house, the prisoner said he hoped Mr. Chetham would have mercy upon him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you hear the prisoner say so? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe at the time he made use of that expression if he did use it, the constable had hold of the handkerchief about his neck? - A. No; he was locked up at the time, and nobody with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say you first heard the voice, how far might you be from where the robbery was committed? - A. Ten or twelve feet.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were so near the place, you must have seen the robbery? - A. It was took dark for me to see the robbery, I could see there were a number of persons together, but what they were about I could not tell, but I was soon informed by the boy; when the child came up, I was upon the move, for I had said I believed there was a robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. How long from that time was it before you heard his voice in the watch-house? - A. Four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not repeat the same words? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Though he did not repeat the same words, could you swear to his voice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So you undertake to say, though he did not repeat the same words that he was the same person? - A. I can.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You attended at the watch-house after the prisoner was apprehended; did you come to the watch-house twice, or only once? - A. I accidentally made use of these words, when I went into the watch-house, I said to the watch-house man, that was the voice.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard him afterwards apply for mercy? - A. He said, he hoped they would have mercy upon him, and not touch his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that as if he was conscious of guilt, or that they would not do him violence, supposing he was not the man? - A. I wish I could put the sense upon it, that they would not do him violence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing at the watch-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. When you stopped him, that was after you heard the cry of stop thief? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to the prisoner when you first saw him? - A. About three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether he cried out stop thief? - A. It was a woman's voice I heard.</p>

               <p>Q. He might have escaped from you if he had a mind? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>LEVI HOBURN sworn. - I am superintendent of the watch at Pentonville; I was in the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any expression of his? - A. After the charge was given of the man, and Mr. Chetham was gone, I said, my friend, you stand in an awkward predicament; he said, I do; I said, there is but one way to extricate yourself, by telling of the other men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. After this promise was made to him, he said, he hoped mercy would be shewed to him? - A. Yes; it was after that, he said he was not the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Is not that a thoroughfare, where persons drive horses and carts? - A. I have seen horses and carts belonging to the New-River-Company.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a common thoroughfare for horses and carts? - A. No; I believe it is not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my Counsel. - I have one thing to observe to you; directly they took me into custody, they throttled me; I said, have mercy upon me, don't murder me; I had not power to speak any thing, but that they had their hands in my handkerchief.</p>

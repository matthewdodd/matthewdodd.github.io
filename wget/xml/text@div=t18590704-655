I live at Was worth—on 10th June, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning, I was walking in Whitechapel, between Aldgate and George-yard—I was a few doors from George-yard—I had a black silk reticule with me; the string was twisted round my arm, and I held the bag by the neck—it contained a handkerchief, a purse, a half sovereign, four shillings, a sixpence, and a fourpence—I felt my bag pulled from the bottom—I saw the prisoner, Taylor, by the side of me, and as soon as we got to the corner of the turning he got hold of it and ran up George-yard, and pulling the bag, be dragged me down—he stooped and took the bag from me, and I saw the side of his face—he was a pock-marked man—while I lay down, and was getting up, another man came, in his shirt sleeves, and assisted me up—he said he would help me, and he would run after the thief—that was the prisoner Merritt—he said, "I will run after the thief," and he ran off in the same direction as Taylor, but he did not call out "Stop, thief"—I was hurt very much, my arms were cut, my hand was cut, and I was very much bruised—while I was on the ground the tall man dragged me several paces.</p>

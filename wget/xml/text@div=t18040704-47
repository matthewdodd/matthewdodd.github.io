            , a pocket-book, containing two notes, one of 20 l. and the other of 10 l. the pocket-book unfortunately has been given to the constable, who is not here, and it is necessary, as the pocket-book is in existence, and can be produced, that it should be produced before you. There are certain rules of law which we can never deviate from, one of which is, that the best evidence which the case can admit of must be given to a Court and Jury, and therefore we must not indulge in fanciful ideas; the best evidence of the pocket book being the property of this gentleman is the production of it, and then he would say, that is the identical pocket-book which he lost, and that it is his property. Now, as it can be produced, it ought to be produced, and it is much better a guilty man should escape than either you or I deviate from the rules of law; for if we deviate from them, neither you or I can be safe, and though there can be little doubt of the guilt of the prisoner, yet, as the case is not made out, by the regular and best evidence, he must have the benefit of it. Whether it has happened from the negligence of the constable, or from any wicked design, or from having received a bribe, we have no evidence before us, and the only thing I can do at present is to estreat his recognizance, and you may be assured that that recognizance shall not be taken off; he is bound in a recognizance of 40 l. which shall be forfeited; but the prisoner, I am afraid, must, for this time, escape<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040053"></xptr>justice; the prosecutor will have his remedy against the constable for the money, he will therefore get back the money he has lost; and I say, thus publicly, that the recognizance shall be forfeited, unless it appears that it was occasioned by some act of the Almighty, or by something that will satisfy every one, that it was not the fault of the witness. Therefore, let the prisoner be acquitted, and I trust the hazard of his life which he has run this day, will be such a warning to him, that we shall never see his face again; I would have him recollect this circumstance will not be forgotten.</p>
               <p>(The Jury deliberated a considerable time, when the learned Recorder again called up the Prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Q. You had the pocket-book returned by a gentleman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you keep it? - A. Two or three minutes, and then I gave it my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was your pocket-book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open it before you gave it your wife? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the contents of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine it before you delivered it? - A. Yes, and saw the notes in it; they were both in the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. When did your wife deliver it to you to the constable? - A. As near as I can recollect it was a quarter of an hour afterwards, at a public-house on this side of London-bridge; we could not at first find a constable, except a poor old man, who was not able to take him into custody; my wife gave the constable the book to look at, and he kept it; he attended before the Lord Mayor, and was bound over.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you know the number of the notes before you lost them? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And, as between the prisoner and the constable, you had not observed any intimacy, or any communication, at the time you delivered your pocket-book to the constable? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Worton called again. Q. Did you know the pocket-book? - A. Yes, it was my husband's; I saw him look to see if the notes were safe, it contained a twenty-pound note and a ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you keep the pocket-book? - A. As well as I can recollect, pretty near a quarter of an hour; the constable asked to look at it, I gave it him, and he said, he should put it in his pocket, he was going to take the prisoner before the Lord-Mayor; we went, but the Lord-Mayor was not there; then he said he should keep the book till Monday; we went before the Lord-Mayor on the Monday, and he produced the same book.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the same? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the contents the same? - A. Yes; the Lord-Mayor allowed me to take the notes, and the constable kept the book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Then your husband has paid the notes away? - A. Yes; the Lord-Mayor said he might.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I changed them at the Bank at Portsmouth, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, I will tell you how I will put this case. The prisoner is accused of having stolen this pocket-book, the contents of which were two Bank notes; now the regular and the strict evidence would be, either to produce the book itself, in which the Bank notes were contained, or to produce one of the Bank notes, to prove that that was the property lost, for if a man loses a box of things, he is not bound to preserve the whole contents of that box; if the box itself is produced, and proved to have been stolen, that is proving the whole contents of the box, but the deficiency here is, that we have neither the notes or the pocket-book. The Chief Magistrate, before whom this came, could have no idea but that the constable, whom he took care to bind over, would appear, and produce to the Court and Jury the book in which the notes were contained, and that was sufficient; therefore the Magistrate says, you keep the book, and you take the notes and dispose of them; but it now unfortunately becomes somewhat material, because you have neither of them here, but if you are satisfied upon the evidence you have heard, that the prisoner was the person who stole this book, you will pronounce him guilty by your verdict, acquitting him of the capital part of the charge, for that is quite out of your consideration, and I will reserve the case so far as to have some conversation with the Judges upon it; on the other hand, if you have a doubt as to the facts, you will let him have the benefit of that doubt, by an acquittal. If the evidence satisfies you, that the prisoner's was the hand who stole the book, with the contents or without the contents is a matter of very little consequence, I shall certainly state the case to the Judges for their opinion, whether you are warranted on giving your verdict upon such evidence; if they should be of opinion that the evidence, in point of law, is not strictly such as to authorise the verdict, the prisoner will have the benefit of it; if, on the other hand, they are satisfied that the facts will warrant your verdict in point of law, it will then stand.</p>
               <p>GUILTY,</p>
               <p>Of stealing, but not privily from the person.</p>

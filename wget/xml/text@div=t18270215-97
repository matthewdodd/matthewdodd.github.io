I was passing the premises between eight and nine o'clock that morning, and saw the prisoner against the street door- knowing there was no door open, except Mr. Lainson's, I walked up as far as Star-court - I then turned my head, and missed sight of him; I turned back again from the corner of the court, and went to Mr. Lainson's; (not half a minute had elapsed since I had seen him at the door;) I then saw him in the lobby, on his knees - he had these pieces of calico partly in his hand, but the side of them was on the ground; they had been up in the corner of the passage, on the right-hand side; and he was then in the further part of the passage, with the goods; they lay on their side, and his hands had hold of them. I went into the passage, and said, "Halloo, what are you about?" he said he was going to look for employ, and was going to tell the gentleman of these goods laying in the dirt; I took him into custody, and sent for an officer; the prisoner had this knife, which he gave me himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The witness stated that the bale was cut and open, and the goods taken out; I wish to know whether there was time for me to cut the bale, cut the ropes, and take the goods out? Witness. I do not know; it is very easily done; here is one piece cut in two places with a knife, as it appears to me.</p>

            . I live at No. 43, Bread-street, Cheapside, in the parish of Allhallows, Bread-street, and rent the house. This calico is the property of myself and my brother, who is in partnership with me; it was in a bale in the lobby, about six feet from the door; the bale was ripped open, and this taken out; I should think it would take a very little while to take it out of the bale; it had been in the bale before, and was removed from it. I think the value of it is 3l. My warehouseman is here, who had seen it about five minutes before.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Lainson. I know these goods to be part of that bale of goods. I came in about nine o'clock, and wiped my shoes on some straw by the side of the bale - it was complete then - if it had not been I should have seen it; that was about ten minutes before the prisoner was brought into the warehouse - I think it was two or three minutes after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT to THOS. LEE. Q. What was the time when you saw him? A. It was about nine o'clock - I cannot tell to a minute or two. The property was quite out of the bale, and the side of it on the ground - the prisoner had hold of it in his hands; no part of it was near the bale.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left home to seek work, and seeing this warehouse I went in to ask for work; I went into the passage, and saw the bale cut, and this laying in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150059"></xptr>passage - I had to move it to get to the door; the instant I moved it the witness collared me. I have worked for several masters in Bread-street, and for a master-weaver in Steward-street, but I have not had time to let them know. I have worked for Messrs. Herring and Douglass, in Bread-street, who are weavers.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. LAINSON. Q. How many bundles were there in the bale? A. Six, and this was one of them - it contains nine pieces - they were tied up as they are now.</p>

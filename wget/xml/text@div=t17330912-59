The Prisoner went away about 3 in the Afternoon, and not returning, I examin'd my Drawers, and found they were broke open, and that I had been robb'd of my Money and Watch. On the Sunday following we heard of the Prisoner, by means of one whom he went to take his Leave of. He was pursu'd to Gravesend, and taken there at the Sign of the Whale. He had spent 15 Guineas of the Money; and the rest, which were nine Guineas, three Moidores, and a 36s. Piece, with the Purse and Watch, were found upon him. He was carry'd before the Mayor of Gravesend, and confess'd the Fact, said he was very sorry, and hop'd I would

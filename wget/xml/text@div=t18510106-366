The prisoner had been in <hi rend="italic">my service twenty-three days</hi>—she was <hi rend="italic">going to leave on 23rd</hi> Dec.—she had given us notice, and said the place was too hard for her—I told her to turn the things out of her pockets before she went away, which she did, in presence of the policeman—she pulled out a pair of shoes belonging to my son, who is thirteen years old, and lives with me—the prisoner told me she had taken lodgings in Wellington-street—I went there with an officer—while we were there the prisoner came, and I found in a box locked, which she opened, this silver teaspoon, these knives and forks, and a pair of tassels were in it—they belong to me—she said she hoped I would not transport her.</p>

               <p>I lost a watch the 11th of September; I only went from the parlour to the shop to serve a pennyworth of tobacco, I saw nobody take it; I suspected the prisoner, he came in with a pot of beer in his hand, and staid in the house half an hour, I was in the room all the time, except when I went out to serve the tobacco.</p>
               <p>Was your bed in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you miss your watch? - Exactly at nine, as near as I can suppose; I had known him before, he had been in the neighbourhood two or three months, and used my shop; we found him at a public house at ten o'clock, and we went to a pawnbroker's shop, where I suspected he had pawned it, and it was pawned in his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150151"></xptr> name; the pawnbroker's name is

               <p>On the 11th of September, I went to the prosecutrix's house and sat there some time, I went to see what it was o'clock by the watch, and Mrs. Scraggs thought the young woman might be jesting; she suspected the prisoner, who was there very much in liquor; I was fearful of being blamed for the watch; we found the prisoner at about ten, still in liquor, there was no money found about him, but three halfpence farthing: he said he did not take the watch.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Smith. Was the man in liquor, or sober? - He was not in liquor at that time.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>All that I have to say is, I went out three times for three pots of beer, my shopmate called me aside, and asked me to take a walk to Chelsea, we went to a public house, he pulled the watch out of his pocket, and asked me to go and pawn it, I thought it was his own, I did not know any further.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have only to say discreditable of him, being an old soldier and I an old soldier's widow, I had not the least suspicion that his conscience would allow him to wrong me; he was a discharged soldier for being infirm in mind, and when he is in liquor he is distracted.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury, I wish that had come out before, but since that is the case, you may reasonably suppose he has not a full exercise of his understanding.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Holmes. I was going out at the time she dropped the chicken by her side; I asked her where she had got that chicken from; she said in Bond street; I said it is my mistress's chicken, give it me; she stroked my head, and said Lord child, I bought it in Bond street. I took the chicken and brought it in to my mistress, and my mistress said upon her oath it was her chicken.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Holmes. Was that fowl yours - A. Yes, I can swear to the fowl. When the woman came back I asked her how she could come in my bar and rob me; I insisted upon her being taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the fowl killed - A. The neck was not broke. I think it was stifled in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 29th of August, I had been to Kensington; on my return I called upon Mrs. Holmes, I asked her to give me something to drink; she gave me some gin and water; I sat down and took the fowl in my hand; Mrs. Holmes was in the bar most of the time; when I went out there was a gateway, there stood the boy, and there laid the cock; he said it is dead; I took it up and said yes. I went to Mrs. Holmes; I told her I saw the boy with it; the boy said he saw it drop out of my pocket. I haved lived twenty nine years in St. Mary-le-bone parish, and nineteen years in East street, Portman square; where I brought up all my children and bore them all, and buried my husband.</p>

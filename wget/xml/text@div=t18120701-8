            . I am shopman to Mr. Peacock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoners coming to your master's shop - A. Yes; on the 6th of May. They came for a ball of cotton. I gave it them, and they paid three halfpence for it. They went out. In about five minutes after they were gone I missed eleven pair of stockings from off the counter. I had laid them on the counter about five minutes before they came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Had other people been in the shop during that time - A. Yes; but I knew them. As soon as I found the stockings gone, I suspected the prisoners had taken them; and the next morning, when they were passing in the street, I had them taken up. I brought them into the shop, and they confessed that they had taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they confess to you before the officer came - A. No.</p>

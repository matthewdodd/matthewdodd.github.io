Butler's Defence.</hi> Midwinter was my servant, and acting under my orders; I issued this cheque on the faith of there being a balance at the bank, not knowing that it was so short, the book not being made up. It is a very painful thing to tell the jury, but I got into trouble and was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude, and the cheque-book and pass<lb></lb>book laid at my house all that time, showing a balance of nearly 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and when 1 came back the book not being made up I believed that I had that amount at the bank. I took the premises to put my father into work as I had to keep him. All the goods have been returned.</p>

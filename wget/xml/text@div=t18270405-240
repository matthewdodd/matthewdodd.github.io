            . I am clerk at the King's Arms inn, Holborn-bridge, which is kept by Joseph Hearn; the prisoner was in his employ. On the 16th of March I received a puncheon of gin to forward to Messrs. Couningham and Co. of Wilts, and on the 17th, in consequence of information, I filled up the puncheon, and found three quarts were gone out of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you fill it yourself? A. No - the permit stated it to be full, but I did not raise the hung; I went to Anderson's, where it came from - they sent a man to fill it with a gallon measure; I measured what was left in the measure, and there was a quart.</p>

            . I am watchman at Mr. Hearn's. - On the morning of the 17th of March, about three o'clock, I let the prisoner in, and about four I saw him standing at the side of the puncheon of gin, with a bottle in his hand, and about a quartern and a half in it; I said, "When you have done with that, I suppose you will leave me a drop?" he said, "It is gin," and said he was very sorry - it was the first time, and he hoped I would forgive him; I said I should mention it to Mr. Hearn; he said if I would forgive him he would give me half a sovereign - I said I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050097"></xptr>could not for twenty. Here is the bottle - the gin had been got out by this tin machine, which was in the spilehole - it does not belong to the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You merely saw him with the bottle of gin in his hand? A. Yes.</p>

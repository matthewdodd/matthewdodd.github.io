                  </hi>. I am a carman, living in the East India-road. I have known the prisoner as a servant to the dock company some years—I attend the docks daily—on Friday, the 9th of September, at half-past twelve o'clock, I was waiting for orders—the prisoner said he should require me to move some goods the next day—he gave me this paper to get a couch from the baggage warehouse—I was to keep it in my stable till the following morn—ing and then to remove it—he gave me some money to pay the charges, and next day I was to take it to where he lived—I got it by means of the order, and took it to my stable, and the next morning about five I took it to the prisoner's place, in Mile End-road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the East India Docks. I took tike prisoner for stealing a couch—he said he had purchased it of a gentlenman in the baggage warehouse about three months ago, and it was at his house in Mile-End-road—I went with him, found the couch, and brought it away—this is Mr. Broderip the Magistrate's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—" The prisoner says,' This is a couch that had remained since September last in the baggage warehouse; it was landed as part of the luggage of Mrs. Duggan, a pas senger, and was left behind, as not belonging to her. About three month back, a person stating himself to be Mr. Beavan, who came home as a surgeon in the <hi rend="italic">Dartmouth,</hi> inquired for a couch belonging to him, and identified this as his; he made some inquiry of me as to what was necessary to be done; I replied, his own order would be required, and the payment of charges; he requested me to write him the form of an order; that individual signed the order, and took it away with him, stating he would send for it; some time elapsed, perhaps a week or two, after that, and the same individual came <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the baggage warehouse, and presented the order for the purpose of sending away the couch; he made a remark even then, that it would be almost useless to him, that he scarce knew what he should do with it, or words to that effect. I asked him if he would part with it; he agreed to do so, and the price was arranged for it; I handed the money to him, and in return he passed me the order; this has been lying from that time up to last Friday amongst other papers of a similar description; the order was passed over by me to Scott to receive the couch, and ultimately <hi rend="italic">to</hi> leave it at my house.'</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

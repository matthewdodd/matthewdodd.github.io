I am servant to Mrs. Coate, No. 7, Burton Crescent On the morning after 3rd April I came down, and found the parlour window open, and some things had been taken out of the house—I had on the pre<lb></lb>vious night fastened the doors and window—I missed, amongst other things, a flute and a case, which I had seen safe the night before.</p>

I think—the key was given to me some days afterwards by the prosecutrix; it was not in the public bar—there is a little door which separates that from the public bar—it was in a place where the cupboard and the table were, it was entirely a private part of the establishment—it had nothing to do with the public—no per<lb></lb>son would go there, only the family—the prisoner owned the case—I asked him if he had the key, and he said, "No."</p>

            . I am porter to Lord Bath. I let the prisoner in at the front door a little before seven o'clock in the evening before the plate was missed; the area gate was locked at that time, and I had the key - he went down stairs, came up, and spoke to the steward very soon afterwards; the plate was kept down in the pantry, where all the servants apartments are; he went down again in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - he came up again about eight o'clock, or it might be a little after; he was down stairs perhaps three quarters of an hour, but from the confusion I was in I cannot say, for Lady Bath was very ill, and I had so many inquiries to answer; she died soon after - he said he had heard about a situation at Lady Malmsbury's, and was going to decline it; that is all the conversation I had with him - he went out about that situation, and came back in about a quarter of an hour; he said he would not go, but should give it up, and take his chance - this was about half-past eight o'clock; he the staid till near half-past nine - he remained with me in the porter's hall all that time; I was busy, and he sat very quietly in my chair - I thought he was asleep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him go away the the last time? A. Yes, I let him out; he had sat in my chair all the time - there were a vast number of inquiries at the door while her Ladyship was ill; sometimes we had gentlemen and servants to the amount of two hundred in a day - he declined going to Lady Malmsbury's, as it did not suit him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had the two hundred persons who called any thing to do with the area gate? A. Nothing; the area gate was locked at five o'clock, and the key in my possession - that was the custom of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the key hanging up, or in your pocket? A. It hung up - I was never out of the hall; he could not have taken it without my knowledge: the area gate and hall door are the only entrances - the pantry is nearly in the centre of the house; I was confused, as I had to take the names of the persons calling, and enter them in a book - nobody was let in but by me - I know the servants had no visitors that night.</p>

            . I am boy in the steward's room at the Marquis'. On the 21st of April, about seven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in the pantry in which the plate-closet is - nobody else was there; that was where he used to be when he was under-butler - I was merely going by the pantry, and saw him there; he was standing with his back to the fire, with a card in his hand: I saw him again in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, coming in a direction from the area - he went into the pantry again; I did not speak to him - I saw him up in the hall rather better than half an hour after, when dinner was over; I saw no more of him - I had no conversation with him, except asking how he was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There are a great many servants in his Lordship's house? A. Yes; they were waiting at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270091"></xptr>dinner, which was not then over - the under-butler cleans the plate.</p>

            . I am under-butler to the Marquis of Bath. On the 21st of April, after seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner on the landing of the stairs leading from the servants' apartments to the porter's hall; I had put the plate into the strong-closet on the afternoon of that day; but that which has been stolen I had cleaned, and put into the closet on the morning of the 21st, and on the 22nd, in the evening, I missed sixty-one silver plates from the strong-closet in the pantry - none of them had been used at dinner on the 21st.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were they so placed that a person going to the closet would necessarily see them? A. It is rather a dark place - unless a person goes in to put something by them, or on purpose to look for them, he might not see them; they had not been taken out for the use of the family - I saw the prisoner again about half-past seven o'clock, coming in a direction for the area door; Freeman was in the dining-room at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have succeeded to the prisoner's situation? A. Yes; I am accountable for the plate - I have lived fourteen months with the Marquis, and four years in this country: I was with Lord Ravensworth before I went to the Marquis - I am a Scotchman; I cleaned the plate on the Tuesday morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and put it into the strong-room - it was missed on Thursday evening; I saw it safe on the Tuesday night, but not on Wednesday; there was nobody in the strong-room on Wednesday - I was going from the pantry to the dining-room; the strong-room is kept locked, and so is the pantry - the key was left in the pantry door; it was the custom to do so, but there was a private spring on the pantry door, which no stranger could open; I was about an hour laying the dinner cloth, but was up and down continually during that time - I was about an hour attending at dinner, up and down; I might be up stairs ten minutes or a quarter of an hour without going down.</p>
               <p>Q. How then can you say nobody could have gone into the strong-room? A. There was nobody down stairs but the prisoner and the maid-servants; I saw him at one time when I came down - I cannot say a stranger might not have gone down.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course the blame of losing the plate rests on you. and you will be glad to throw it on any body else? A. Any body I should suspect.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you steal the plate, or know who did it? A. No; the male servants were waiting at dinner - when the area gate is locked there is no way to the house but through the front door; the strong-room is large enough for a person to go into, and turn himself round - it is stone, and the door iron.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which of the servants have business in the pantry? A. I, and the footman who comes in after dinner, and assists to wipe up the things; it is my business to put plate away; I leave it in the pantry at night, and lock it up in the morning - the pantry door was fastened with a secret spring; the servants' hall, the kitchen, and pantry all have doors.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You succeeded the prisoner fifteen months ago? A. Yes - I never quarrelled with him; I did not know him till I came into the service.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he visited there daily from the time he left? A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How soon did you tell the steward? A. About an hour after; the prisoner was not the man - he was dressed in a brown surtout coat; he was a perfect stranger.</p>

On the 21st of April I was on the box of the coach just opposite the Maquis' area gate, which was on my right hand, about ten o'clock, or a little after; I had set Dr. Warren down at the house, and did not move away - I saw a man stoop down, lift something in a cloth over the area gate, and go away with it; it was inside the area, and the man was outside - I did not see any one inside the area; I did not see what was in the cloth, but thought I heard a slight jink just as it came over the gate - it was the sound of plate or metal I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. This was at ten o'clock or after? A. Yes - the man was not so stout as the prisoner; I think it was not the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I searched the prisoner's lodging on the 23rd of April, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, but found no plate there; he lives in Adam-street East, Manchester-square.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. He was not at home? A. No - I went to Lord Thyun's and found him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I merely went there for a bottle of beer, which I had left there.</p>

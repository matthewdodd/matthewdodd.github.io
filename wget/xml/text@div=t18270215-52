I lost my cart and harness at the same time. I do not know the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the 2d of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I went into the back yard of No. 29, Rochester-row, Westminster, and saw Pople, my brother officer, in conversation with the prisoner; there was a horse and cart in the yard, and four sheep in it - Pople asked him his name - he said it was George Williams, but refused to tell where he lived; we took him into custody, and found about 2l. 4s. in money on him; he said, after we had handcuffed him, "Take care of my horse and cart, and likewise the sheep;" we took the horse and cart with us- when we left him at the watch-house he asked what was done with his horse and the sheep; I told him we had put the sheep at a butcher's named Peek, and the horse and cart at a livery-stables in Great Tothill-street. When we came to the examination on Monday he asked me if his horse was taken care of; I told him it was, and when he was fully committed for trial he asked Mr. White, the Magistrate, if he would deliver up the horse and cart to him before he went to Newgate; Mr. White said, "Certainly not." On Thursday morning last Rattey came to the office, and described the sort of horse he had lost; I took him to the stable, and he claimed the same which we took from the prisoner - I do not know where the prisoner lived - he refused to tell us, or the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>JOHN RATTEY. It was my horse, and the one I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the horse at Romford-market, on Wednesday, the last day of January, for 3l. 15s.</p>

            . I was at Romford-market on the last day of January, and saw the prisoner buy a brown horse there - it was a blind one; he gave 3l. 15s. for it - it was in the forenoon - I cannot say the hour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you live? A. In Essex, in the parish of Vans; I am a labourer, and work for different farmers. I now work for Mr. Cole, of Vans' hall - Billericay is the nearest town to it - I have worked for him about six months; I was working for him last Saturday; I have known the prisoner about two years, by seeing him about - he is a butcher, and lives in Princes-street, Lambeth; he has a shop there, and is a married man; I went to Romford with half a score of pigs for Mr. Cole - that is about twelve miles from Billericay; I do not know who the prisoner bought the horse of, or what he did with it; he lived in Princes-street at that time; I was not intimate<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150039"></xptr>with him - I knew him by seeing him at market at different times - I did not go any where with him after the horse was bought. I have been in town about a week, and have been lodging in West-lane, Smithfield, at a private house, kept by Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you come to town? (Prisoner "Last Monday.") A. Monday, Yesterday week - I have been here ever since - I was working for Cole last Saturday week. I came up here merely to see a friend, named John Griffith; Mr. Cole knew of my coming - I asked his leave to come for a week, or a day or two more if I liked; Griffith is a carpenter, and lodges in Long-lane. - I was here yesterday - I came by myself about two o'clock, and left about half-past three; I saw the prisoner's wife; I did not go away with her - I do not know of any other man being here with her; I do not go by any other name - I did not speak to any officer here yesterday. Mr. Cole lives sixteen miles from Romford.</p>

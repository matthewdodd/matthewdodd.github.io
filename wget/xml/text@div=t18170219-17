On the 29th of January, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner and another man, came into my shop, and asked for a pair of shoes; the prisoner stood by the counter while the other man took me to the window to look at some shoes, I turned round and saw the prisoner, who appeared as if he was secreting something under his coat; I suspected all was not right, and called for a light, as an excuse to get somebody into the; the prisoner made towards the door to go out, I pushed it to, he opened it, and said something to his companion, who was trying on the shoes, my son came with a light, and the prisoner rushed into the street, I seized him, and told him he had some of my property, I pulled his coat back, and found the shoes under it, and I threw them into the shop; he set off again, I pursued him about forty yards, and took him; my son came up and helped me. I am sure he is the man.</p>

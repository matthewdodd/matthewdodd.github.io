            . The poor woman at the bar came to wash for my wife, and about half an hour after nine at night her husband came to fetch her home; presently after my wife was sent for to a publick house; I was on the bed, and the woman at the bar thought I was asleep. I saw her go and pull my drawer out, and take out a gold ring, and hold it up to the candle; I saw it; she went to give it to her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he at the time?</p>
               <p>Vincent. He was sitting by the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Vincent. I am a coach-maker by trade. The next morning I asked my wife where her rings were; she said she had put them both in the drawer; she went and found one was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was your ring which you saw in her hand?</p>
               <p>Vincent. I saw a ring, but cannot say it was mine.</p>
               <p>Elisha's defence.</p>
               <p>My conscience is innocent, and so is my wife's; it was between ten and eleven o'clock when I went to my dame; this man was in bed with his two children, he said, How do you do daddy? I said, I am very poorly, for I have got no business this blessed day. I am a butcher, and go about poultering, and selling what I can; he said sit down, I did, and never stirred from the place till his wife came in; then she said, How do you do daddy? She said to my dame, I have staid longer than ordinary; go and fetch a pint of beer from the Fountain in Rosemary-lane; I went for it; she asked my wife to eat her supper, and gave her some broken victuals home with her; but, as to the ring, as God is my true judge in heaven, we are both innocent of it. They have been to the cunning man about it, and after that he lays the ring to my wife's charge, and please you my lord, and gentlemen.</p>

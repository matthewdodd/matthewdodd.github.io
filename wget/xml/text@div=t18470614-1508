               <p>prisoner, Henry Farr, was in my service as pot-boy for about three weeks—on the afternoon of Easter Sunday my house was closed, and nobody but myself, the barmaid, and Henry Farr were in the house—a friend of the servant girl's was there—I had a cash-box in my beaufet, which was in my bar-parlour—it was not locked—it contained a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, 2 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, 2 or 3 fives, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and some silver—three was a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece among it which were remarkable, the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. had a hole in it—there was also a double sovereign—I missed that cash-box about a quarter to four o'clock—I had seen it safe at three o'clock—I went up stairs, and imme<lb></lb>diately I came down I went into the yard and found the back gate open—my suspicions were directly excited—I looked for Henry Farr, and he had gone out without his hat or cap, and left his clothes behind him—I went in pur<lb></lb>suit of him—I had seen Charles Farr once—I traced Henry to his mother's, but did not see him there—I went down to Bridgenorth on the 5th of May, and there saw Charles Farr, and on the 7th of May I found him in custody at Hoxton—I said, "I have got you at last," or something to that effect—he said, "Oh, you don't want me; it was not me that took the cash-box, it was my brother, and you did not see him take it"—he taunted me with that in the station-house—he was searched, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. some silver found on him, among which was a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with a hole in it on one side—this now produced is it—I will undertake to swear that it is the one I lost—I said to him at the time, "This sixpence was in the cash-box"—(it was along with a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece and a half-crown that was battered—there were several remarkable things)—he said it was not—I know it by the hole and by the general appearance of it—it has been through my hands repeatedly—it is knocked up at the side—I also said to him, "Why, you are dressed like a gentleman now, and you had no clothes before, where have you got all these from? it is my money that has bought these"—he said, "You cannot prove it," or something to that effect—on the same night, I saw Henry Farr at Bow-street, and charged him with stealing my cash-box—he said, "I did not do it," or something to that effect.</p>

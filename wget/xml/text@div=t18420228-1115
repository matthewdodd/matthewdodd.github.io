I was on duty between eight and nine o'clock on the 5th of February, and saw a wagon in Black<lb></lb>man-street, Borough, laden with oats—it drew up at the entrance of Lant's-yard, in Blackman-street—Weller was with the wagon—"John Newell, Shad Thames," was on the wagon—I saw Weller put two sacks of oats from the wagon, and take one of them to Gale's stables, adjoining, and another man took the other—I went to the stable in Lant's-yard, and found Wright there with two sacks of black and one of white oats, and two of beans—I asked Wright where the oats were that were brought in—he pointed them out immediately—I asked if he was aware they were coming—he said he was not, but they were brought for the name of "Gale," that was his master—I made a communication to Mr. Newell, in conseqnence of which I then went down to the stable, took Wright, and the two sacks of oats.</p>

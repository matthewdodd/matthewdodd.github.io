I life in the Green-yard, over the stable of the Commissioners—from what my wife told me I followed the cart on the 24th of May—it went to No. 88, Wilson-street—I took possession of the haybands there—I weighed the bands, and they weighed 83lbs.—I know something about hay, as I have been a gentleman's coachman—these were not such bands as are used for tying up hay—I have some of them here—there were fourteen dozen bands altogether—I remember the prisoner coming to Sir William Magnay's service—I had I been over the premises—there were very few haybands there—I should I say half a dozen were the most that were left there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go over the stable sufficiently to ascertain that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I am certain there were not more than six or eight bands left—some of these bands that are here would go round a proper sized truss, and some would not—they are of various lengths—I do not know on what day the prisoner came to Sir William Magnay's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>Could you tell by the skin, whether it was a ewe sheep? - I cannot be sure, but I am sure it was my own skin, it was hardly cold then, Mrs. Shirley said, she would tell me the truth of all; says she,

               <p>They were not reputed to be man and wife? - Not as we know of, Sir, she said she had been married three or four days; Meads, he run away from the saw-pit, he was there when we first came to the house, and we went to seek for him there, but he was gone; he was found on the Saturday night, at Uxbridge, I was before the Magistrate when he was examined, I saw him make his mark to the paper, and I saw the Justice sign it, it was read over to him, and he admitted it to be true, this is the paper, I saw the Justice sign it; this is the Justice's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Was the former examination read to him, at the same time? - No, it was not; Saville owned that he helped to dress the sheep, that was brought home in the middle of the night, but he did not know where Meads had it from; I have no doubt of this being my sheep.</p>
               <p>Did you compare the carcase with the skin that you found on the bed? - Yes, it all fitted.</p>

               <p>Recollect yourself, was it so or was it not? - There was a man talking to him, he might say so, I cannot say, I heard him say, tell the truth, he said, it will be the better for him.</p>
               <p>Who was that man? - I forgot his name, he lives at Uxbridge, he is not here, but I heard him say so.</p>

               <p>Did the Justice or any body else say to him then, it would be better for him to tell the truth? - First the Justice examined me, in the presence of the prisoner, then I told him what I told you, and the Justice asked the prisoner if he had stole the sheep.</p>
               <p>Did the Justice say any thing more to the prisoner? - He asked him if he stole my sheep, and he answered yes; and he told him where and when.</p>
               <p>When was it then, that he told him he had better tell the truth? - That must be at the last.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, had he said so before the prisoner had said, he had stole your sheep? - No, Sir, not before, it was after, I am quite clear of that.</p>

               <p>Did you say, I take you up for sheep-stealing? - He heard me speak of it in the house.</p>
               <p>Court. You took Meads up? - Yes, at the Mar quis of Granby, at Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him what you took him for? - I told him as soon as ever the constable came to take him in possession, that it was for stealing Mr. Nailer's sheep, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>What did he say to that? - I cannot tell the words particularly.</p>
               <p>To what purpose? - No otherwise than that he seemed to be very sorry for it for it.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - I cannot recollect the words, but in the discourse while we sat there, I said to him, now Joe was you the person that stole the sheep or Thomas? no, says he, I did not steal it, Thomas did it, and I was with him, and he caught it behind the hay-cock.</p>
               <p>Had you said any thing to him before, that he had better confess? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you ever present when Saville was examined? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he give you any directions about where you might find any thing? - Afterwards, but not before he was examined a second time.</p>

               <p>I went with Mr. Nailer to execute this search warrant, Saville and the woman both sat by the fire, I told her I had a search warrant, to search for a sheep, she said, search and welcome; and the first thing we found was the caul on the shelf,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230034"></xptr> in short the story Mr. Nailer has said, is true.</p>
               <p>When Meads was there before the Justice, did you hear the examination read to him? - I heard the paper read to him.</p>
               <p>What did Saville say? - He said he knew nothing of the matter at first; but after we found the sheep, he said, Meads came there some time in the night, and called him up, and he said he got it downright honestly, he said it was alive, and he helped to kill it; the woman said, she knew nothing of the matter, she said, at eight she saw it in a box.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Saville always continue in the same story? - Yes, Sir, all the while I was there.</p>

             (police-constable S 124). I live in Pratt-street. The prisoner was given into my custody, with a cab, No. 1614, on the <rs id="t18340904-157-cd886" type="crimeDate">29th of June</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. The prisoner went willingly with you? A. Yes. He said he pulled up as soon as he could, and he was very sorry - he has an impediment in his speech.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 29th of June, I saw a gig pass as I was at my front garden gate - it was about four miles from London - the gig was going, I should imagine, as fast as the horse could go - there were two men and a female in it - one of the men was driving it, and he was urging the horse on with the whip - I then saw a cab pass in the same direction - there were two men in it, and the prisoner was driving - he drove very furiously - the horse was on the gallop, and he hit him with the whip as he passed my garden - it was about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and quite light - one of the men in the gig beckoned his hand towards the cab, as if for it to come forward - as soon as I had seen them pass, I heard the screams of some females, and said, "There is an accident" - I ran out, and saw a child who had been picked up, in the arms of one of the witnesses, and the cab was turned back - I took the horse and cab, and the prisoner, and gave him to an officer as soon as I saw one, which was nearly half an hour - I put the person who was driving, and the same cab, into the hands of Heath - the child was carried to Mr. Richards, the surgeon - the road was forty-two or forty-three feet wide - there was no carriage but the gig and the cab near the spot - they were going twelve or fourteen miles an hour, to the best of my judgment - the child appeared to be about seven years of age - I never said I saw the child on the road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw the two carriages, how far was the gig in advance of the cab? A. I should think from twenty to thirty yards - the cab was, in my opinion, attempting to get up to the gig - they seemed to me to keep about the same distance from each other - I did not notice the gig horse, but I did the cab horse, as I had it in my hand for half an hour - I did not see any boots on the horse's fore-legs, but as I did not particularly notice, in the confusion, I cannot swear there were none - I am in the habit of going in wheel-carriages - I have gone twelve or fourteen miles an hour years ago - I never rode in a cab.</p>

            . I live in Blackman-street, Southwark. I was in the Hampstead-road on the evening of the 29th of June, about half-past eight o'clock - I saw a girl, who appeared to be about seven years of age, crossing the road - a gig had just passed me, going twelve or fourteen miles an hour; as fast as it could; and a cab was following it, about twenty yards behind it - it was gaining on the gig- the cab knocked the child down, and the wheel went over her body - I should think the cab was going twelve or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040081"></xptr>fourteen miles an hour, but I am not a judge of that - it was quite light enough for the driver to see the child, but it appeared to me that it was going at such a rate that the driver had not the control over it - I cannot tell how far the driver went before he stopped, as my attention was occupied with the child - I gave it to a gentleman, who took it to the surgeon's - I saw it go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw these carriages, what distance was there between them? A. I suppose, three or four yards - I was forty or fifty yards behind the cab when the accident happened - they both passed me - there is a considerable descent in the road there - the cab was nearer to the gig, when the accident happened, than when they passed me, I should think, ten or twelve yards - the cab certainly was gaining on the gig to the best of my knowledge - the child ran from the edge of the road to cross it - there was a girl and a boy there - one was near this child - the other had crossed.</p>

            . I live in Whitehall-place, Kentish-town, and am a tallow-chandler. I was coming from Chalk Farm, and saw a one-horse chaise going in the direction of London - I saw a cab after it - they were going at full gallop- I saw a child crossing the road - the cab struck the child, and the near wheel went over it - I ran with Fortune - he took up the child - I took up her bonnet - there was light and space enough for the driver to have avoided the accident if he had driven in a proper manner - I saw him hit the horse once with the whip, while it was galloping.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take notice of the cab horse? A. I believe it was an iron-grey. I did not look at its legs - I was behind them, coming out of Chalk Farm-lane - the gig had rather a better horse than the cab - it was going about fourteen miles an hour - it was going rather faster than the cab - the cab, I should think, was going about twelve miles an hour - I should not think it was gaining on the gig - the prisoner drove the cab - he pulled up as soon as he could - I did not hear him request that a policeman might be sent for - he said he was willing to go, and he was sorry for what had happened.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw the two carriages, was the cab first? A. Yes; and the gig passed it, going twelve or fourteen miles an hour - I was only sorry I had not a horse to follow it - I am in the habit of driving and riding too.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Henley Lodge, Hampstead-road. When the child was brought in, my house was full of people - I do not recollect seeing any of the witnesses - the child was labouring under symptoms of a concussion of the brain, with a deep cut over the left eye - I attended to it, and dressed the wound, and let it lie quietly till I sent for a cab to take it to the Middlesex Hospital, which was the nearest - the child was in my house about half an hour, till it was in a fit state to be removed - the wound appeared as if it had been struck by some instrument - I saw no marks of its having been run over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might not the injury have been occasioned by the fall of the child on the ground? A. Not on the ground, but on a stone.</p>

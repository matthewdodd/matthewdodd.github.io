                  </hi>. I am an optician, and live at No. 14, Tottenham-court-road. On the night of 14th Dec., I went to bed about half-past 12 o'clock; I had previously secured the doors and windows myself—about 2 o'clock in the morning, ray attention was arrested by the noise of the breaking of a window—I had not gone to sleep—I went into the front room on the first floor—I found one of the panes of the window broken; that window had been fastened, but it had been unfastened and closed again—in going about the room, I perceived something under the table—I felt under the table, and there was a person with a pair of cord trowsers on—I went to my bed room to get some instrument—I went again to the</p>

               <p>front room; I had never lost sight of it—when I got back, the person was lying under the table—I told my boy to light the light, and immediately the person ran and threw up the window, and rolled out on the flat—I saw Mr. Handy at his door, which is opposite to mine—he rushed across at the time, and the prisoner dropped nearly into his arms—to the best of my belief, the prisoner is the person that I found in my room—when he was brought back, he had corduroy trowsers on.</p>

About 2 o'clock on that morning I was going into my own house; I heard some person shouting out from the other side—I saw some person inside the window with a nightcap and shirt on, and a person outside the window endeavouring to escape from the house; he dropped down into the street—I did not take hold of him immediately, but I did not lose sight of him—I captured him some dozen or fourteen houses off, and gave him into custody.</p>

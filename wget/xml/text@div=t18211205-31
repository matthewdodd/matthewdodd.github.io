On the 20th of November, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was returning home; I was near a house which was on fire, which alarmed me, and as I got up Brick-lane, the crowd was very great. I had the apprentice-boy with me, and sent him home to see that my husband was at home, as the fire was very near our house. I went up Brick-lane, a young lady accompanied me; I could not get by church in consequence of the crowd, and went down <placeName id="t18211205-31-crimeloc184">Princes-street</placeName>

There was a gaslight over my head, and a number of torches about, I was about fifty or sixty yards from the fire - I noticed the man who held me particularly, the prisoner is the man, I am certain; I knew him the moment I saw him again, and have no doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Q. While he held you, what happened to you - A. My clothes were lifted up and my pocket torn down and picked, it was not cut off - they ran away, the man who held me ran at the same time. A gentleman took hold of me as I fainted away, and I was taken home in a quarter of an hour. About an hour after I got home, I was fetched to the watch-house, and saw eight or ten men there, the prisoner was among them - I knew him immediately, and selected him from the rest as the person who held my pelisse - he was not pointed out to me, I have no doubt that he is the man. I lost a pocket-book, containing one 10 l. and a 5 l. Bank note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You was in considerable alarm in consequence of the fire - A. Yes; but I am certain of the prisoner, it was done in an instant - I suppose it must be near eleven o'clock when I got to the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say at the watch-house "I cannot tell who robbed me, but he had a blue coat on, if you will examine and find he has a red pocket-book, that is the man" - A. No; I said I could not identify the man who took it, but the man sat there who held me - I did not charge the officer with being one of them at the office; I said one of them had a white coat on, like his, and was much such another man. The gentleman who assisted me said I was robbed; I felt, and missed one of my pockets.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Union-street, Spitalfields. On the 20th of November, I was a special constable. I went to the fire about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, and saw the prisoner about one hundred and fifty yards from the fire, in company with two young women. I apprehended him about eleven o'clock that evening, not in consequence of any information - I was at the watch-house when Mrs. Wade came, that was between eleven and twelve o'clock. The watch-house was full of people, some standing and some sitting; she pointed out the prisoner herself, and said she believed him to be one who robbed her. I took no particular notice, and did not hear what she said further, as I went to the fire again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She said she believed he was the man - A. I think she said she believed, and at the office there was a man who she believed to be one - I said that was impossible, as I had him in custody at the time she was robbed. After speaking to the prisoner, she turned round to me and said she believed me to be one of them; I said "You do not think I was one," she made no answer - I had a light coat on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are sure she said she believed you to be one - A. Yes; she only spoke to the prisoner and another besides me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at a public-house in Lambeth-street, and about half-past ten o'clock, was coming down Brown's-lane, to go home, and in Red Lion-street Miller took me.</p>
               <p>JURY to WADE. Q. Do you know the gentleman who assisted you - A. No; he appeared a respectable tradesman, and had a white apron on. He took me to my door, and called on me the night before last, but I was out.</p>

            . I was servant at the White Hart, public-house, Lambeth-street. On the night of the fire in Spitalfields, the prisoner came to our house about a quarter of an hour past eight o'clock, to a raffle, and did not leave till a quarter past ten - the raffle was to be at seven o'clock, but they could not get members enough.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the exact time that he left - A. Because the fiddle was to be stopped at a quarter past ten o'clock, and I went to tell the man my master would not let it play any longer. The prisoner was up stairs, sitting at the corner of the table with

Scott was also with them and went out with them - a young man was with her.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was you in the room all the time - Yes; I am sure neither Sanders nor the prisoner danced - Scott did. The rest of the company had beer - nobody waited on the company but me.</p>

More persons left the room with us, but they were not in our company, we three went away by ourselves; I know the girl brought some rum and water, and while I was dancing some gin and water was brought.</p>

I danced - two girls waited on the company, we drank some rum and water, three or four glasses. I drank with the prisoner out of two or three glasses, and with another young man.

               <p>COURT. Q. What distance were you behind - A. Very little; Sanders had hold of his arm, Atkins waited on the company, she went down to fetch what was wanted - I had walked behind Chapman ten minutes before he was taken, as there was a crowd at the fire.</p>

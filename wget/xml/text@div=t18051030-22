               <p>Q. When was it that you missed any thing from your premises? - A. I missed several articles for about these nine months, they were mostly working tools.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner work for you down to the time he was apprehended? - A. He had been absent for about a fortnight; I had lent him half a guinea to buy his children somewhat, and he had never come afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know that he was going to quit your service? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that he lived? - A. At Mr. Rust's, in King-street, in the Haymarket: On Monday the 14th, in consequence of information I went to Rust's house; we went into the prisoner's room in consequence of what he told me about the prisoner working at home, we found a great many articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there? - A. No, the prisoner had absconded, and the children were out at nurse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find things there which you knew to be your property? - A. Yes. Some of the things were in a table drawer, and some on the table, and there were several articles we found in different parts of the room, they were put in this box; I knew them to be mine; the box was locked, and I had the key of it; the box was deposited with Mr. Coe, a working sadler, who worked for Mr. Gibson, in Coventry-street; it was sealed in the presence of Rust, after it was taken from Coe, it was taken to Marlborough-street Office; it was opened there, and the officer Warren took it in his possession at the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in the same state when produced at the Office, as when it was delivered to Coe, sealed and locked? - A. It was.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the room that you had shewn Mr. Manton? - A. Yes; he had lived with me about three months; he occasionally worked at home on Sundays.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of work did he seem to be employed in? - A. He used to melt something in a ladle on the fire; he left my house about the 12th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of his going? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present, when Mr. Manton found the several articles contained in that box? - A. I was, I saw them put in the box. The reason I suspected he would not come home as usual, I found the key in the lock, and I missed the sheets off the bed, I looked round and saw a great many tools about the room; I knew where he worked; I went to Mr. Manton.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion of the tools, before he went away? - A. No. I never saw but few tools before.</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk to Mr. Manton; I know the prisoner as working with Mr. Manton; I was present when the room was searched, and these are the articles that were found in the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manton.) I divide these things as they are stated, first the steel counter sinks, I know them because they are made in my own premises; I have a particular machinery for making my barrels<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300023"></xptr>which cost me upwards of a thousand pounds. These are steel taps and screws that belong to a machine; they have been taken out to repair.</p>
               <p>Q. A person without a machine could not make any use of them? - A. They could be made taps to make screws of for other purposes.</p>
               <p>Q. There are no marks on any of these things? - A. I have seen them often enough to know that they are mine; these steel broaches I missed, I can speak positively to them; this is a mander, it was made to finish the collar of a machine; this the prisoner made himself for me, I have a thing at home that it fits; I know all the things perfectly to be mine; this is a patent gun broach, nobody in the trade has them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you entrust the prisoner with these tools to work at home at all or out of your premises? - A. Never, they were tools that were very expensive, and that he could not work at home with, except he cobled up for the trade, which I expected; we cannot swear to ram-rods, they are so much alike; all the others I can speak to, I have not the least doubt they are mine; I paid him two guineas a week when he worked; I had lent him five guineas to bury his wife; he now owes me above thirty pounds which I lent him in different distresses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The time I was at work, I had 14 s. a week to pay out of my wages, I was out of work at this time, I could not work for the pain of my arm that I hurt in the machine, I made the mander.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I bought several tools of him when he came to work for me, and part of these tools were stole by a fellow that worked with me before; the mander he helped me to hunt for some months before; I have lost two guns that I found out since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Messrs Taylor and Sons, at No.3, Bankside. The prisoner, who was my masters' carter, came there on Saturday week, about three o'clock, and said. "They have sent me from Redcross-street (where Messrs. Taylor's other firm is,) for two bags of glue, which I am to take to Redcross-street, and then I will return, and take your goods out "—he went and took the two bags of glue, and took them away in Messrs. Taylor's cart—I saw him put them in, and put up the tail-board and drive away—when the prisoner was taken, he said it was true he took the glue, that he drove his cart under the arch of South<lb></lb>wark-bridge, while he went to get a pint of porter, and when he came back the tail-board was down, and the glye was gone; but who took it, or where it went, he did not know.</p>

I watched these prisoners from Market-head to Hare-street, from there to Powis-street, and back to Mr. Andrews's shop, in Hare-street—they were all together—I there saw the prisoner Williams go by the side of Miss Tucker, who was standing looking in the shop—the two male prisoners stood close behind Williams, and I stood close behind the men, so that I could notice what Williams was doing—I saw Williams's face—I saw her put her hand into Miss Tucker's pocket, and take something out—she turned herself and spoke to the two men prisoners—I saw silver in her hand; I saw her pass something to one of the male prisoners, but I could not see which of them—I caught hold of the male prisoners; Williams, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> back into the crowd, and my brother officer caught her—I saw her throw something away—I said, "She has thrown something away; if you look for it you will find what it is"—I told the men I took them into custody for picking pockets—they said they had picked no pockets—I did not speak to Miss Tucker, having the two prisoners, and I thought she would follow me to the station—I knew her, and could find her—I found on Cheeseman six half crowns, twenty-three shillings, two sixpences, a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and a flash note—he was carrying this basket, which contains a few apples, a little tea and sugar, a piece of soap, and one female's glove.</p>

I was with the last witness—I had been watching these persons about an hour—I had the opportunity of seeing Williams's face several times—I was on the opposite side to Mr. Andrews's shop—I saw Williams go in the crowd, opposite the china shop, and the two men followed close to her—they stood a short time, and I saw Gladwin seize the two men—Williams made off, and I took her—she swung herself round, and said, "Let me go"—I told her I took her for picking pockets—she said she had done nothing of the kind—I had seen her that evening opposite a butcher's shop, about a quarter of an hour before she put her hand into a female's pocket, and take it out again—when she swung herself round I saw something go from her hand, but I could not see exactly what it was—I called out, "She has thrown something away!"—I searched the prisoner Barry; J found on him two sovereigns, one half crown, a pawn ticket of his jacket, and two keys—I asked him how be accounted for the possession of that money; he said he got it by going about to different houses singing—I asked him his address; he said No. 45, Angel-place, Islington, and that is false—I went to make inquiries; there is no such person to be found; there is no No. 45; there are only about two shops in Angel-place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single; I live in Ann-street, Woolwich. On Saturday night, 10th Dec, I was standing in front of Mr. Andrews's, I think about half-past 8 o'clock—there were some baskets outside, with things marked—I was selecting some cups—I had a purse in my pocket; I had seen it about ten minutes before; I had been to a butcher's, and had it out—I had in it a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had paid for some meat at the butcher's, changed a half sovereign, and had 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I had tendered the florin to pay for the meat, but they demurred about taking it, and I said, "Never mind, I have a half sovereign"—when I was at the china shop I put my hand into my pocket to pay for my cups, and missed my purse—I did not see the prisoners taken; there was a crowd round the door, and I made the best of my way home—I said I could not pay for what I had bought, I had had my pocket picked.</p>

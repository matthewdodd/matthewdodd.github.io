               <p>Q. When did Mr. Bristow come into partnership<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200071"></xptr>with you - A. On the 26th of June. On the 25th we took our stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been employed with you at any time - A. Yes, about four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You took stock on the 25th - A. Yes, some time after a customer, Mrs. Goodall sent for a certain size of black beads which we were positive we had, upon our looking for these beads and not finding them, and Mr. Bristow knowing that there were such a stock in our shop, he ordered the stock to be retaken, that was about three weeks after the 25th of July, upon our retaking the stock we missed 348 dozen of French beads and a paper of white ostrich feathers, containing from 20 to 30, and a quantity of straw plat, some garnet and a variety of other things to the amount of two hundred pounds. We sent hand bills round to the different pawnbrokers and we had bills stuck about the street with the reward of 50 guineas, Mr. Hackleman came to my solicitor, and my solicitor came with him to my house, and there I saw the beads, I went to Mr. Hackleman's house in the beginning of August and saw these beads there I saw 60 dozen of beads; they were part of the articles that we missed, these are some that I have still in my possession, and the article that I found at Mr. Hackleman's exactly correspond with these.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any thing in these beads that you saw at Mr. Hackleman's that you can swear that they are yours. The jury cannot be positive if you are not - A. They were in short rows and we had them all threadled in long rows after we took stock, I have no doubt they are my beads.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How many of them that were found at Mr. Hackleman's that you would swear to - A. I would swear to 40 dozen; they were pledged at Mr. Hackleman's in the name of

            . In consequence of finding these at Mr. Hackleman's, I immediately went to the office to obtain a warrant to have Bell taken up, I went to Kensington, we apprehended the prisoner, we searched his lodgings but found nothing, this was about the ninth or tenth of August, we brought him to the watchhouse in a coach, on his road with us in the coach, with one of my warehousemen and the officer, he made an observation which was to know if I should like to have my feathers back again, I answered I should certainly be happy to have back my property, he told me that he had destroyed them, I told him if he was not the thief I would do every thing to clear his character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. And that you would not hurt an hair of his head if he told you - A. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you promised him any thing before you got him in the coach - A. I conceive I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Before he said any thing you made that promise in his own apartment - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After this you must not tell us any thing he said - A. I had Paddington Canal searched. I discovered no feathers whatever. Mr. Barlow of Berwick-street, had purchased some feathers, I there saw six, they are here, I cannot swear to the feathers, some of my warehousemen know the feathers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you assist in taking stock in June in that part respecting the beads - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted there are many dealers in beads besides yourself - A. Certainly there are, I do not think that any house imports half the quantity I do.</p>
               <p>Q. And importing a large quantity you sell a large quantity - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself superintend taking the stock the second time - A. I assisted.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean, Mr. Hughes, to swear that these are your beads. - A. To the best of my knowledge they answer to the colour.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost 348 dozen, and the whole quantity found that you supposed to be yours is 60 dozen - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no knowledge of your house being broken open - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no knowledge of any person having access to your drawers - A. If they could get possession of the key of the warehouse they could have access to the drawers. The prisoner knew where the key was.</p>
               <p>Q. That is four years ago - A. They are in the same place now.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived with you - A. Six or seven years, I had a good opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner living with you must also know your customers - A. He might know some.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew Mr. Barlow as a customer - A. No doubt he did.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot take upon yourself with certainty to say that they are your beads - A. I cannot take upon me to say point bank that they are my beads, although I am most sure that they are my beads. There is one circumstance that I would wish to mention, the circumstance I allude to is this, they were pledged in paper with the hand-writing of

               <p>Q. At the time that he brought them to you, did any conversation take place between you and the prisoner - A. He wanted more money than I liked to lend him upon them, I did not wish to take them in, they were things that I did not understand, he said that he had a bill to take up which would be due in a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hughes. How many rows of beads are there that you will take upon you to swear to - A. About twenty dozen, ten dozen in each of them rows, they are stringed as those I had, we had them threadled upon these long threads, all our sky-blues.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Bristow. Look at that No. 2, upon that paper, do you know that - A. Yes, it is my own handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when you put that - A. It might have been done two months before we took stock, it is my hand-writing, and it was made for a feather paper. I made one, two, and three, afterwards it was entirely spoiled and dirty from being used, consequently it was put aside as waste paper. It was in our possession on the 25th of June, our goods require nicety, we never send goods out in paper like that, we burn them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever searched to see whether the other two parts of the paper were in your possession - A. No I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Parkhurst. Look at these beads, whose property are they - A. I have no doubt but they are Mr. Hughes's property.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you say to the blues - A. There is a dozen that I can speak more positive to than the others. I was looking for a bit of paper that I had let fall behind the counter, I took a stick and raked out a dozen of beads, I said there is a dozen of beads, we could have sold them five hundred times over, we had no beads of that size. I have no doubt of them beads whatever.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 8th of last month at Kensington, I searched him, I found upon him a small row of beads which Mr. Hughes looked at, and believed them to be his.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Hughes. Look at that small row of beads - A. I think I can challenge any house of having any of these beads, they are a sample row, I believe them to be mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

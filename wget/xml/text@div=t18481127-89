                  </hi>. I am a confectioner. On the night of 14th Nov., about half-past twelve o'clock, I was going through Holloway, near the brewery on the right hand path—I had a brown paper parcel under my arm, containing a pair of boots—I met the prisoners walking together towards me—they parted to make way for me to pass between them, and as I did so Lawford attempted to strike me—I parried the blow, and Knight struck me on the head with his fist, and knocked my hat off—I got away from them and began shouting out for the police—they advanced towards me and followed me—I kept retreating from them, <hi rend="italic">baching</hi> out, and they were menacing, and attempted to pick up stones—Lawford said they would soon stop my noise—I continued calling police, and retreated some little distance—Lawford left Knight, and attempted to make liis escape up a turning which was no thorough-fjre—by that time I had got to Highbury gates, and got the assistance of the police—I lost sight of Lawford, and followed Knight till I got to the lower road—I did not lose sight of him till the policeman caught him—Lawford came up at the time Knight was being taken, as if he was a perfect stranger—I recognized him, and gave him in charge also—I am quite convinced he is the person—the transaction took place under a gas lamp, and it was a moonlight night—I had plenty of opportunity of seeing him—not a word was said by me or them before they attempted to strike me—Lawford was slightly intoxicated, but far from being insensible.</p>

                  </hi>. On the night of 14th Nov., about half-past twelve o'clock, I was following the prosecutor about fifty yards from him—I heard a cry of "Police!" listened, and in the course of a few minutes heard cries of "Stop thief!" and saw Lawford part from Knight—I gave chase with the prosecutor after Knight, and came up with him at Highbury Chapel, and saw him taken—I saw Lawford come up—they are the same two persons that I had seen with the prosecutor.</p>

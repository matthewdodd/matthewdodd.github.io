The prisoner and two other men came into my house on the 24th of January, about eight at night; they called for six-pennyworth of rum and water, and, after that, another. I made it; the prisoner asked me to drink; I did; there was then a silver mug, which weighed 28 ounces and a half, standing on the table, which some people had been drinking out of, which was missing after the three men were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other persons in that room before you missed the mug?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, there had not: we missed it in about two hours after they were gone. I was at home all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, I never saw him before. I lost two tea-spoons out of the tea-chest, and a table spoon out of a closet in the same room, at the same time: I have since advertised them, but never heard any thing of them.</p>

            . I live in Knaves-Acre, opposite the prosecutor's house: I was at Mr. Jones's that evening about eight o'clock; I saw three men come in; the prisoner was one of them; they called for six-penny worth of rum and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner was one of the three?</p>
               <p>Russell. I am.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jones. I am wife to the prosecutor. I remember three men coming into our house on the 24th of January; they came first about four that afternoon; they called for six-pennyworth of rum and water, pen and ink, and wanted a back room. I said our back room was full of company, they might go up stairs, but there was no fire. One of them said, Then we will go down there; I suppose, meaning some other house: then they turned round to me, and said, We will call again, and they went out. They all came in again much about eight, and called for six-pennyworth of rum and water, and went directly into the parlour: I made them six-pennyworth, and carried it in myself, and shut the parlour door, and came out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you carry it in?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jones. I carried it in a china bowl. When they went in, there was a silver mug on the table, and a large silver table spoon in a closet, and two spoons in a tea-chest. After that, my husband made them six-pennyworth of rum and water in the china bowl. I cannot take upon me to say I know either of the three men; there was a relation of mine, and a nephew of my husband's, at the same time at my house; they and the maid are here.</p>

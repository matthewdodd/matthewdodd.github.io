                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Cock Tavern, in Portman-street. On 9th Feb. the prisoner and two other men came to my house—I was not present when they came in; I came in while they were there—there was no gin before them—my barmaid had taken it away again—she told me that the prisoner had put down a bad shilling that she had broken up, and thrown the pieces down, and the other two men, who came in with the prisoner, took the pieces up, and one of the other men put down another shilling, and said, "Is that a good one?" and she found that to be bad, and broke it up—I saw the pieces of the last broken shilling—I told the prisoner and his companions to go out, and they went away—I gave the pieces of the shilling to the policeman.</p>

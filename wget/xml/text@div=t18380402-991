On the afternoon of the 23rd of March, I saw the three female prisoners in the shop, about four o'clock—Carroll and Morgan first came in, and asked to look at some silk pocket-handkerchiefs—I showed them some—they objected to the price, and went out—they came in again in a few minutes in company with M'Carty—they bought one hand<lb></lb>chief between them—it came to 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—M'Carty gave me the money for it, and they left the shop—in consequence of information which I received from a person named Lathart, I missed from the windows two pieces con<lb></lb>taining four handkerchiefs, one three, and the other a single handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bath-place, Bayswater. On the afternoon of the 23rd of March I saw the four prisoners together in my Oxford-street—I followed and saw them go into several shops—M'carty and Morgan went into the first shop, Carroll waiting outside—the next shop they went to, the three women went in, and the man remained outside—they went down Oxford-street, by Foster's shop, to Mr. Taylor's—I met a policeman, and told him my suspicions—we followed—they met some more companions, and went over to a public-house, after which they left their companions—they went over to Mr. Taylor', the three women going in, and the man remaining outside—in a few mimutes Carroll came out with something bulky under her cloak, and turned up Hanway-yard—the man followed her close up—I did not see M'carty or Morgan in Foster's shop—I saw three loose handkerchiefs drop from M'Carty at the station-house, and a red one from Morgan—I met them, I suppose, after they had been into Foster's shop.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Brentwood. On the 6th of January, about half after seven o'clock, I went into <placeName id="t17790113-26-crimeloc145">New-street, Bishopsgate-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17790113-26-crimeloc145" type="placeName" value="New-street, Bishopsgate-street"></interp>

I could not find the person; I met the prison Wright, and enquired of her if she knew such a man; she said she did, and took me into a house, where she said the man lived. She went up stairs, and came down and told me the man was above and would come down presently; I sat down and sent for a pot of beer. When I got up and was coming out, Perry knocked me down, and took my money out of my pocket, my watch, and my knee buckles. I struggled and got my watch again; my buckles and money I never got; I was glad to get out of the house as soon as I could. I went and got a constable, and returned to the house, they were not in the house; then we went to the next door to see after them, and as we were coming out, we met Perry coming in with a quartern of gin in a glass. I said to the constable that is the woman that knocked me down; she said she never saw me; I said constable that is the woman, take her. As we were coming out with her she produced the buckles to the constable; as we were going out Wright came in, and we took her also.</p>
               <p>Wright. Did not you spend two shillings in liquor, and one shilling in victuals? - No.</p>
               <p>Perry. I fetched in the liquor? - I believe she did, and locked the door on me. When they got me in she took the key in her hand, and swore, you bloody buggering villain, if you do not deliver us your money we will kill you. When they had got my money they opened the door and turned me out; then I went and got a constable.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. On the sixth of this month, between ten and eleven at night, the prosecutor came to the watch-house, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130027"></xptr> said he had been robbed of his buckles and seven shillings. I asked him if he knew the prisoners that had robbed him; he said yes. We went to the room, the prisoners were not there; we went into the next room, and the tallest woman (that is Perry) came in with some liquor in her hand, and the prosecutor gave me charge of her. I said if you have the buckles let us have them? She went to the chimney-piece, and gave me the buckles. I searched her and found a shilling and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>(The buckles were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Wright came in, and we took her, but found nothing upon her; she had no pockets on.</p>
               <p>Wright. Did not I say if he would give me the three shillings for lying with me, I would give him the buckles? - No.</p>
               <p>WRIGHT's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was in Bishopsgate-street, just come from work. I saw this man; he asked me where I was going; I said home. He went home with me, and sent for something to drink. He spent three shillings; he had no more in the world. When he was going to bed; he said, my dear, I will make you a present of these knee buckles to sleep with you all night. I went to bed with him; he got up in a rage, and said he would not stay any longer he was going into the country. He took his watch, and said give me my knee buckles; I said I would not, he might stay all night if he would, and he gave me a smack of the face.</p>
               <p>PERRY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was washing next door to this place; I was just finished. Wright came and asked me for the key of the room, and she and this man went in. I fetched two or three pots of beer, then a shilling-worth of ham, and he gave her the buckles to sleep with her.</p>
               <p>Wright. He was very much in liquor.</p>

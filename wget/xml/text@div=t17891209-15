               <p>I am a constable; on Sunday night, Nov. 29, about half after six, I met the prisoner in Houndsditch, he passed me with this coat on his shoulder, pushing on very fast; I went after him and collared him, I asked him if the coat belonged to him, he would not answer me, but threw it down into the dirt; taking him to the counter I met the coachman, I went with him into the stable, the coachman claimed the buckles and gloves, and said there was a tear in the coat with a nail; it has eight capes.</p>

               <p>Going down Shoreditch, there were six or seven men having many words, and of course they were going to fight; one man threw off his coat, and he asked any body to take his part. I stood by and said nothing; in the God's speed somebody came up and they went away, and this man asked me if that coat belonged to me; he took me to the watch-house.</p>

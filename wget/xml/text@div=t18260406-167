            . I was watching the prisoner, with two others, for twenty minutes or half an hour; I saw the prisoner attempt to take a gentleman's handkerchief, but the gentleman looked over his shoulder, and he went away; I then followed them to Waterloo-bridge, when they went up to Mr. Sowray - the prisoner lifted up the pocket with his left-hand and took the handkerchief with his right; I saw it immediately thrown down, and the prisoner ran across the road - I attempted to catch him but I could not - he ran towards the coaches - I stooped down and waited till he came nearly abreast of me - I then collared him - I had not known him before.</p>

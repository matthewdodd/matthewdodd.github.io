            . The prisoner Gapes was one of our workwomen. On the 29th of August, a young woman, named McCartney, produced a bundle to me, about halfpast twelve o'clock; I examined it - it contained two foreign hare skins: the prosecutor had about ten persons in his employ then - I put it where I found it, which was at the next board to Gapes'; they work at separate boards - she had left the room to fetch something for her dinner - when she returned she took the parcel from the next board to her, and put it on her own board; she then eat her dinner, and after getting up I saw her put the parcel into her basket - I did not see her leave the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q.Are you related to the prosecutor? A. I am not; the boards are parted from one another - it was on McCartney's board at first; it was not concealed - I said nothing to her about it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Were the skins wrapped up in a handkerchief? A. In white paper; nobody could see they were skins without undoing the bundle.</p>
               <p>MARGARET SCAGO. I am in the service of the prosecutor - I have heard Nathan's evidence, which is correct.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you see the parcel? A. Yes, every body in the room could see it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you see it on McCartney's board? A. I first saw it in Nathan's hand - she put it on Gapes' board: it was in whitey-brown paper - none of the skin could be seen.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's service. When I came up at half-past twelve o'clock, Gapes was out of the room; I found a parcel, wrapped in whitey-brown paper on my board - I turned round and showed it to Nathan - Simpson was by; we opened the paper and looked at it; Nathan opened it - I saw two foreign skins; it was put back on my board, I am sure - I had put it on the board opposite; I saw Gapes come back, and after she had dined, she put it on her own board, and then into her basket - Simpson stood behind me at the time at work; I saw Gapes leave between six and seven o'clock - she took her basket with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had Scago had an opportunity of seeing whether the parcel was placed on your board or Gapes'? A. I cannot say - she was about two yards from me; after the prisoner put it into her basket, she fastened it, and put it close to where she was at work; every body could see the basket.</p>

            . I am in the service of the prosecutor. I saw the parcel; it was on McCartney's board - Nathan opened it, showed it to me, and put it again on McCartney's board; it was put on a little place between McCartney's board and Gapes' - they both worked about one spot; it was put on a board opposite theirs - the boards all join; Gapes came in in about ten minutes, took it up, and put it on her own board - she then took and put it into her basket; I saw her go out about half-past six o'clock with it.</p>

               <p>MR. LIALTER. In consequence of information, I had Gapes apprehended on the 31st of August, and at the watch-house I asked if she had any of my foreign hare skins at home - she declared she had not; I then said I was informed she had taken two skins, wrapped up in paper, on the Monday, and likewise that she had taken two on the Tuesday, that we had the keys of her lodging, and were going to search - (Potter and her both lived together;) she said I might, I should find nothing at home but a lot of rubbish, which I had given her to work on on the Saturday - we took her with us to her lodgings, No. 2, Lock-street, Commercial-road; the door was open- she struck a light, and there was nothing; she then took us into a back room adjoining, and said, "Sir, I will tell you the truth, I hope you will forgive me;" she went to one part of the room, took up two paper parcels from the corner, and said, "There are two skins which I brought home on Monday in this paper parcel, and two which I brought on Tuesday, and four which Potter brought home;" she got them all from one place - the four were not in paper, but she said she meant to bring the produce of those skins back again - I said, "How did you mean to bring them back, when the work I gave you on Monday you returned on Tuesday, and when you brought down that work, I said it was very light; you said it was all you could get off the skins, you could not bring more than you had;" I found a quantity of my felt in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do these persons work by the piece? A. Yes - it would not take ten minutes to manufacture this - they earn 3s. 9d. by cutting sixty skins - we cannot count them when they bring the produce, as they are obliged to cut the skins up; I am certain I have correctly stated what she said.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took Gapes in charge - the prosecutor's statement is correct; I went with him, Roberts and Gapes, to the house, where the prosecutor picked out his goods, and said they were his; Gapes said she had brought them home on the Tuesday, and some on the Monday - they were in two parcels; I heard her ask him to forgive her, two or three times - I did not pay much attention to the conversation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you not asked if what the last witness related respecting the conversation as true? A. Yes, I say so now; but they were talking for nearly an hour.</p>
               <p>JAMES ROBERTS. I was present at the examination of the premises - Mr. Lialter's evidence is correct, every word of it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a surgeon, living at Shackelwell. On the 9th May, I was called in to see Breakwell - I found two large wounds on his head - one about two inches or two inches and a half long, and the other about half the size - they appeared to have been given by a truncheon or stick - a truncheon would have inflicted such a wound - there was a very considerable effusion of blood - it ran all down his coat - I considered the wound dangerous to his life at the time, because such wounds are frequently followed by very serious consequences - he was under my hands three weeks, indeed a month I may say - he was off duty for three weeks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you able to say which wound was occasioned by the fall, or which by the staff? A. I should say the lower wound was produced by the staff, for if it was by a fall, the scalp would have been torn up - the wounds were about an inch and a half apart - it was not calculated to produce immediate danger - a fortnight may elapse before danger arises - I apprehended inflammation of the membrane of the brain - he is out of danger now, and quite well.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He was for three weeks disabled from doing his duty? A. Yes - I should call the wound a grievous bodily harm.</p>

            . I am a sergeant of the station where Breakwell was. He came into the station-house on the 9th of May, bleeding very much - his coat and clothes were covered with blood - he gave some towels into my hand which were very bloody - I went with Finch and Cheek to trace out the path the prisoner had gone along - I saw Finch pick up this handkerchief, containing three skeleton and a pick-lock key - they were tied in it - I found a common key on the prisoner - next morning I went to a garden, and had a toast rack given me by Baddiley - two more towels were given to me by a man not present, and another by a witness who is here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Which have the blood on them? A. These have blood sprinkled on them - it is six weeks ago, and does not show so fresh as it did at that time - I saw a man pick the keys up in the corner of a field - I never saw them in the prisoner's possession - I searched the field all over in the track I was informed he had gone - I did not go all over the field - the towels are marked "S. W. 1834, No. 8," and the other "G. S."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What kind of box had the Italian? A. A mahogany box strapped round him - I did not see what he gave to the prisoner - it was something small - nothing like these towels - I saw the first attack - the prisoner kicked the policeman - when the policeman went up to him he touched his breeches pocket, and then caught hold of his collar - he said something to him which I could not hear - then they began to hustle - the prisoner kicked the policeman three or four times - I did not see them fall, as I went inside the lady's house - I gave the policeman the night-cap in the field, directly he pulled it out of his pocket - he ran after the prisoner immediately he ran away, that instant - he threw the night-cap away after he was apprehended.</p>

            , of Newington-green. On Friday evening, the 9th of May, I was at the window of the house sitting at work, to the best of my recollection - my notice was attracted by hearing the words, "You must go with me" - the prisoner refused - I saw it was the policeman and the prisoner - the policeman collared him, and that action was almost instantly returned by a blow, and I believe in the face - the prisoner struck the blow in the policeman's face - he threw the policeman on the ground, and kicked him two or three times when rising - the policeman drew his staff, and it was almost instantly wrenched from his hand by the prisoner - he was thrown to the ground against a stone, and most brutally beaten with the staff over his head, two or three times while he was on the ground - the policeman called"Murder" twice - I was so terrified I had not power to speak or move - I did not see any blood at that time, but I saw the policeman wiping his face, as if wiping blood from it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear the whole of the conversation between the prisoner and the policeman? A. I only heard what I have said - I did not hear the policeman charge him with felony - I heard an altercation, and heard the policeman say, "You must go with me" - I saw the policeman fall - he fell in the road, which was stony - they are paving stones - the stone he fell against was a stone fixed against a wall - he fell against that - I cannot say that it was with any particular violence - it was owing to the prisoner's violence that he fell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 9th of May, I was coming from my sister's to take tea, and from there went to the New River to bathe - coming from there the policeman stopped me, and asked me what I had - I said, "Nothing"- he said he would take me to the station-house - I refused going - he drew his staff, and struck me across the eye, and then across the back of the head - we stumbled and fell down - I ran away - he called "Stop thief" - I stopped and asked where he was going to take me - he said to the watch-house.</p>

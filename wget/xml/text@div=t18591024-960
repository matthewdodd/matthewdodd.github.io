                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Ireland, of 11, Old Compton-street, Soho, a boot closer—we let apartments—the prisoner had apartments there and gave the name of Victor—he came about the beginning of August, and occupied a double-bedded room—he left about the 11th or 12th of September, without notice—I did not know that he was about to leave—he never gave me the street-door key, and I suppose he took it with him—he owed me some money for rent—on the night of 18th September, I went to bed about 11 o'clock; everything was then safe—next morning, Monday, about 5 minutes to 6, I came down, my husband having gone down first, and he called me—I found the window open, and missed a quantity of things, among which was a looking-glass and eight table-cloths, six of which have been found; also a leg of pork, some sugar, tea, and butter—the looking-glass had been between the bar door and the bar window—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and these are my table-cloths; this is part of the bag in which my sugar was—I know it by its being marked 6 of 6, that means 6lbs. at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—my sugar is always marked so, as the grocer made a mistake once—I next saw the looking-glass at a broker's in Tower-street.</p>

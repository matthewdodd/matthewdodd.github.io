On the 9th of this month, in the evening, as I was coming into the shop with a tray of china on my head, I saw the prisoner and one Newland in the shop; my servant was selling Newland a pair of shoes; just as I came into the shop, I saw the prisoner put his hand in the back window and take two pair of shoes, before I could get to the counter and turn round, he was run away; I went to the door but could see nothing of him. Newland said, he supposed he was only gone to the door to make water: I told him the man had taken two pair of shoes, and I should detain him till he was produced. Newland went to the door and called the prisoner, and he returned. I charged him with taking the shoes, he denied it and said, I might search him. I told him I did not think it was to any purpose to search him, for I supposed he had given them to some of his companions. I sent for a constable, and took them to Justice Welch's where they were searched; and they had no money, they had only a bad shilling.</p>

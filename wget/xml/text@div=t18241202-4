I went to my stable and found it locked; and when it was opened, I saw the meat on a truss of hay in the loft, slightly covered with hay. I left it there, and saw him about twenty minutes after, coming home from market with the horse and cart. I told him to get out of the cart and take the mare away - he went to the stable, and I followed him with an officer. I found him in the hay-loft, and called him down. I then told him to fetch the piece of meat down: he said, he would not; and I gave him in charge, and went to the loft; the meat was not then where I had seen it before, but the prisoner went up and found it behind three trusses of hay a little further off. I had not sold it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. - Q. Was not the hay to feed the horse - A. Yes; there is a space of about six feet from the roof of the stable, and the top of the partition which divides it from the next stable; he had an opportunity of taking it away in the morning - he asked me to forgive him, and said it was his first offence.</p>

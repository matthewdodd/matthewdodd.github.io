I am the prisoner's wife—I lived with him at 28, Sandgate Street, Lambeth—he is a hawker—about the 30th June I was in the house with my husband about the middle of the day—he had had a good deal to drink—he asked me to give him some money to pay his fare in the country—I refused—he got in a passion and struck me with his fist in the face—I fell down—after a minute I felt a kick on my leg—when I was on the ground he took the money from my pocket—he went out and left me lying on the floor—I got to the bed as quick as I could—I found my left leg was no use to me; I could not stand up—the landlady came up—I was then taken to the hospital—I stayed there a fortnight and afterwards went to the infirmary—I was there for three weeks and came out on a Monday—I cannot use my left leg now.</p>

I live at 28, Stangate Street, Lambeth, with my sister, who is the landlady—on the 30th of June I heard a noise on the ceiling like somebody falling down—about half an hour afterwards, when Mr. Thomas left, I went up—I found Mrs. Thomas lying on the bed, crying—she made a complaint—I examined her leg—it was swelled very much—a constable was sent for—the prisoner did not come back—I next was him at the Sessions House, Kennington Lane, in July, when he was brought from Liverpool—his wife appeared there—she was brought from the infirmary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—on the evening of the 30th of June I examined Sarah Thomas—I found she had a fracture of the lower end of the left fibula, or outer small bone of the leg—there was a great deal of swelling—there were no marks of very great violence—it was not discoloured; it became discoloured afterwards—the fracture might have been caused by a kick or a blow—it must have been caused by some amount of violence—the injury will not be permanent; the bone has united and is going on very well.</p>

I caught hold of her, and being a heavy woman she fell, with her leg underneath. She never said anything to me about the broken leg. When I am turned into the street I have not a farthing. I am entirely at the mercy of the Court.</p>

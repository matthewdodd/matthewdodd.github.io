I am a widow, living at 4, Ring's Square, Goswell Road—on 12th May, I was living at 4, Weat India Road—I went out about 9.15 that evening—before I left I bolted the back door inside, and shut the front door after me—I returned about 10.50, and could not open the front door—a neighbour forced it open—when I went in I missed a waistcoat from the shop window, and found it on the counter—I found the back door open.</p>

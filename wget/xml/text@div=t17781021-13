On Monday the 5th of this month the prisoner came into the house, and called for a pint and pennyworth of beer; it was our club-night. I came down stairs, and seeing the prisoner in a part of the room I thought she had no business in, I watched and saw her take a quart pot off the upper shelf, and put it under her apron; I told my aunt of it, but I bid her not take any notice till the prisoner went away; when she went out I sent the girl after her to bid her come back, but left she should not, I went after her myself; she came back; I asked her what she had in her apron, she said some bread and cheese, which I found she had; I asked her what she had underneath; she said nothing; I felt under her apron and took the pot out of her hand; she said good lord, I did not know what I was about when I took it.</p>

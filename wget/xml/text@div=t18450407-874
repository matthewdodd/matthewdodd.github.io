On the 26th of March, about four o'clock in the morning, I was going home, and met the prisoner about half a dozen doors down Field-lane, as I passed out of Holborn—she made no remark, but took hold of my chain, and tried to get my watch—I got it from her and got away—I then missed a shilling, which I know I had in my waistcoat pocket two minutes before—I met a policeman, and told him—I went back, and gave her in charge.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Wollin—I searched the prisoner at the station—I first asked if she had any money, she said, "No, none"—I did not find any, but as she stooped down to put her boot on, this shilling dropped from her person, and she put her foot on it—I asked her what she had dropped—she pretended to know nothing about it—I pushed her foot off, and took it.</p>

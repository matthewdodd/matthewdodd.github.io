                  </hi>. I am one of the Great Western Railway-poliee. On Tuesday night, the 17th of March, I was on duty at the lodge-gate of the terminus, which is about seventy yards from the front of Mr. Smith's, across the road—about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock the prisoner Dawes came to the lodge-gate and went in a detection towards Smith's—at one o'clock in the same night I saw him again—there was somebody with him—I do not know who—he was then standing within seven or eigbt yards of the corner of Mr. Smith's house with the other person—that is the corner round which you must go to get to the cellar-flap—I went within about twenty yards of him, or rather nearer—I then went back to the lodge—about half-past two o'clock the same morning I saw Dawes again pass through the lodge-gate in a direction from Smith's and towards his work—I do not know</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 13.) On Thursday morning, the 19th of March, I went to the Mint public-house, and in a stable near there found five trusses of straw in one corner—I have always understood Smith let that stable to Culverhouse—I have seen Captain Abbott's men go into the stable—Dowsett was with me—it was the stable from whence the staple had been drawn—on undoing the straw I found two bottles, and one broken—one was ginger brandy, one was wine, and the third had contained wine, but the bottle had been broken—on the same day I went to the stable, in Bedford-row, and found Culverhouse in Mr. Abbott's yard—I told him I should take him into custody, on suspicion of robbing Mr. Smith of wine and other articles—he said he would put on his jacket and come—I waited and he came—he afterwards said he knew nothing about it—on the 11th of April I went to the town of Buckingham, and found Kimbrell in the tap-room of the Wool-pack—I said to him, "Well <hi rend="italic">Knockey</hi>, I suppose you know what I have come about?"—he said, "Yes, my boy, I will come with you directly if you will wait till my mother comes"—I showed him the warrant—he said, "Yes, that is all right, my boy"—his father came in and said, "What is all this about?"—he said, about a bit of a spree that took place in London, but he was innocent—his father said, "They would not come down here and take you if you were innocent"—I took him to the gaol, and they locked him up for the night—on the way to Woolverton he said he never was in the stable at all, and no one could say he was, and if he got transported for seven years, or for life, it would be an unjust thing, and he desired to have fair play—he repeatedly looked at his handcuffs, and said it was all through keeping bad company.</p>

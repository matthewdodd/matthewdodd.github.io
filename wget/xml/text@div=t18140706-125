I happened to be locked out of my lodging; I would not disturb my landlord or landlady, and being a fine morning I walked up and down the street. After I had walked about two hours, the watchman came up, and said, you have got some property in your bundle; I said, it was my own. He said he saw a parcel of bad fellows walking up and down the street; he said I had better sit in his watch-box, it would be safer than walking backwards and forwards in the street, and while he was crying the hour of three I sat in his box. I felt asleep in the box. My property was taken from me. My bundle was taken from under the seat of the watch-box. My bundle contained two pair of boots, five shoes, a pair of breeches, some meat and bread in the apron. Soon after the watchman cried the hour of three, I awoke, and missed the bundle. I got up and saw the watchman I told him I had lost my bundle. After this, the constable came; the watchman related the circumstance to him; the constable said he had taken a man with a bundle.</p>

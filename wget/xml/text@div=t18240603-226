               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If you had sold the cloth that morning, you would not have rubbed that mark off, should you - A. Certainly not. These goods were in a loft which was open I suppose to many other persons.</p>

            . I am a watchman, and was going my rounds last Thursday, and met the prisoner in Oxford-street with this piece of cloth concealed under his jacket. I asked what he had got - he said,</p>
               <p>"What is that to you;" I said,</p>
               <p>"I am an officer, and insist upon knowing;" - he then showed me the cloth. I asked him where he got it; he said from his own house; that he had bought it in Clare-market. I asked what he gave for it - he said 1 s. 8 d. I told him to come back, and when we got to the end of Clare-market he started, but was afterwards taken.</p>

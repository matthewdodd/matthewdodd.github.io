                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Roberts, and lodge in the house of James Griffiths, who lives there himself. My husband is a bricklayer, and is sergeant of the 2nd regiment, of the Tower Hamlets militia—on Sunday night, the 30th of November, I went out about eleven o'clock—my hus<lb></lb>band had gone out about half-past eight o'clock, and I went after him—I left all my property in the room quite secure and safe—I did not lock the door—it fastens with a padlock—I put the hasp on inside, and fastened the hasp with an iron holdfast besides—if any body took out the iron holdfast, it could be opened, but not without—he must take out the iron holdfast which I put in, instead of putting on the padlock—I am sure I fastened it in that way, and went out leaving every thing in the room secure—I was not out more than a quarter of an hour—I re<lb></lb>turned about a quarter past eleven o'clock—the street door was not latched, it was put close to—my husband went home with me, but I went up stairs first—I found the street door wide open, and the candle on the stairs where I had left it—when I got to my room I found the room door wide open, and the prisoner standing with his back before the fire—he had my husband's working jacket on his back, and my husband's great coat on his arm—as soon as I could speak I said, "My good man, what do you do in my room?"—he said he had made a mistake—that he had been to a wake on the Saturday night, and he had come into the wrong room—he never lodged in ray house—he was quite a stranger—I have lived there twelve months—he never had a room in the houses while I hate lived there—he pretended he had been to a wake, and was tipsy—my husband came up stairs directly, took him down stairs, and gave him in charge—he said if my husband meant to give him in charge he would, not go—that he should carry him—there was no candle in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I returned home with my wife, about fourteen minutes after eleven o'clock—she went up first with the candle, I found the street door wide open—she held the candle while I fastened the street door, as every body was in bed—I followed my wife up stairs as close as possible, and heard the conversation between her and the prisoner—he had my jacket on, and my great coat on his arm—I never saw him before, to my</p>

               <p>knowledge—I took him into custody, and gave him to the policeman—I drew out my bayonet, not knowing whether there was any more in the room—I told my wife to examine and see if any body was under the bed, and while he was pulling off my jacket I found there was nobody else, and took him down stairs—my house is in the parish of Christchurch, Middlesex.</p>

I was fetched from the station-house to take the prisoner—I found him lying down on his back in the road, and the prosecutor holding him—he would not go further—I returned and examined the door—I found the staple forced out, and parts of the door jamb broken out with it—great force had been used to get it open—it was very dark in the passage, and I suppose he could not tell it was not padlocked, and wrenched it out.</p>

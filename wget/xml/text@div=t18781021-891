Brown"—I was not the only person who came from Aldersgate to Worship Street; there was a cellarman named "Cathaie," and believe one carman, whose name I forget; a Mr. Chitty and Mr. Lazarus, commercial travellers; practically the whole staff went—Mr. Brown managed the firm at Aldersgate Street before I left—I Was clerk to the firm under him and next in position to him in the office; I assumed precisely' the same position when I got to Worship Street.</p>

I think—she drew nothing in 1872—at the end of 1871 her share of the capital was over 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.: I think it should have been 4,555<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the balance at the bank on 31st of December, 1871, was 643<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the value of the stock was 3,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believe—stock, including implements, 3,782<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I cannot tell what the debts were (<hi rend="italic">Affidavit read</hi>)—the balance of 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd depended upon the acceptances of the customers held by the firm being met, and the book debts being good—quite 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. turned out bad—I remember the bill of the 22nd September, 1871, being filed of Godfrey <hi rend="italic">v</hi>.

Godfrey, Miller and Miller were acting against Brown, and they are the solicitors in the Chancery suit now before the Court—they conducted the case before the Magistrate—when the con<lb></lb>spiracy was tried here, they were the solicitors, naturally—it is only recently in this case that it has gone to the Treasury—I do not know that any more than 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to Miller and Miller for solicitors' expenses—I had to attend in the Chancery suit about a dozen times to produce the books—during 1872, while the Chancery proceedings were going on, I went to the business place in Aldersgate Street, as I had done for many years before—Godfrey had a certain part in the management—from 1872 the business gradually fell off, except in one month—the purchases in June only amounted to something like 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and from the end of June to the date of my appointment, 28th August, only one bottle of champagne was purchased—Mrs. Saull died in March last year, aged 72, she was not examined at the police-court—she died of a broken heart, she dwindled away—she was an exceedingly healthy woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 2, Sherborne Lane, City—I was trustee of W. D. Saull and the deceased in the matter of this partnership—my son was called on the trial in 1876, and produced the partnership deed—I was the attesting witness to it—W. D. Saull was the brother of Mrs. Saull's husband; he died in 1855, and shortly afterwards Mrs. Saull's husband died, after which she carried on the business with her son, who was about 21 or 22 at that time—he managed it—it was a very good business when her husband died—in 1858 it had been entirely destroyed, and but for the assistance of the trustees of W. D. Saull the whole thing must have been shut up—I saw Mrs. Saull about the state of affairs—at that time Godfrey, who was afterwards a partner, was either the traveller or manager, and Brown was a clerk—Mrs. Saull told me then that Godfrey had lent her money; I don't know how much, but about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I thoroughly explained to her that I acted for the trustees, and the nature of the transaction—my impres<lb></lb>sion is that there was no power for her to give permission to sell—lending 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a breach of trust, but the family must have starved if we hadnot done so—I advised my father to commit the breach of trust for the pur<lb></lb>pose of saving Mrs. Saull and her children, and Mr. William Saull, of North<lb></lb>ampton, joined to save us from the consequences—he is in Northampton—I opposed the suit of Webb <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Saull against the trustees to make them pay the money—I was not beaten in that; I was solicitor for the trustees; it was a—suit calling upon us to account for the trust—I do not remember a suit of Saull <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Saull in 1875—I remember taxing the costs of two Chancery suits—I do not remember what I paid Miller and Miller for costs—if I said before, "I remember taxing the costs in two of the Chancery suits, and I remember an Order of Court to pay Miller <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Miller 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," that is correct (<hi rend="italic">See Sessions Paper, vol</hi>. 84, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. 251).—I known that there was a suit of Godfrey <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Saull in 1871—I was acting for the trustees of Devonshire Saull—a decree was made in Miller <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Saull, and the 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid, part in cash and the balance in bills; the Court decreed that we were to take the bills as cash, and we did so.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Upon Friday the 4th of April my house was broke open.</p>
               <p>Was the house fast over night? - I am always last up at night and first up in the morning; I fastened it that night; I went to bed about half after nine, at about two in the morning I heard the parlour door crack, then I heard the stair foot door crack; that door was fastened with a tibber, and I heard the tibber tumble down; then I jumped out of bed and called to Mr. Reeves; he jumped out of bed and threw open the window, and cried out thieves; I saw an uncommon light on the staircase, and heard a great many footsteps; I was then so frightened I had no power to move; they broke open Mr. Reeves chamber door in an instant; they threw me down, and I tumbled over a close-stool; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177707020025"></xptr> got up again, I believe without any assistance; they trod upon my naked foot; I began to grow very sick; the prisoner came and put one hand over my eyes, and with the other laid hold of the back part of my head, and led me to the foot of Mr. Reeves's bed, and bid me lie down there, and no hurt should come to me.</p>
               <p>How came you to know the prisoner? - He came three times on the 4th of April to ask Mr. Reeves to employ him to work in the brick-fields; when he came the first time he had on a remarkable hairy cap that frightened the dog, and almost frightened me; I asked why he came in such a frightful cap? he said he had no other to come in; he threw stones at the dog; what he did to the dog I don't know, but it never barked when they broke the house open; he came the last time at four o'clock with another man, and asked if Mr. Reeves was at home.</p>
               <p>Had he that cap on when he put his hand over your eyes? - Yes, and I knew his voice; I knew him very well, I had a glimpse of his face before he put his hand over my eyes; Mr. Reeves made his way to my room, in order to get out of the window and get on the top of the house to hide himself from them; they immediately followed him, but stopped of a sudden, I believe the candle went out; afterwards I think I heard them strike a light, then they followed Mr. Reeves; I heard one of them say,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, shew us where the money is;" and another said, Let him alone, he is going to shew us where the money is; they then brought Mr. Reeves back and made him lie down on the bed, and a man stood over him with a cutlass and a pistol, I believe, but am not positive, and made him lie still while the rest broke open every box they could; Mr. Reeves shewed them where his breeches were, and the next morning I saw the pockets were turned inside out: the man that stood over us was a tall man; they took away the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them): when I came down in the morning I found they had got in at the kitchen window; they broke the glass and opened the casement; I am sure it was fast over night.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner there all the time? - Yes, he was very busy helping them to break open the things, and lighting them with a dark lanthorn; they found a blunderbuss in the house, and cried out with a loud voice,</p>
               <p>"You old Reeves, you heep blunderbusses in your house;" he told them there was nothing in it but powder; they broke the slint to pieces and took the blunderbuss and set it on the outside of the house.</p>
               <p>LINSTEAD REEVES sworn.</p>
               <p>I had purchased an estate, which I intended to let out on a building lease, but being informed there was good brick earth, I was advised to make use of it in the brick way; I was awaked in the middle of the night by the tibber falling down; then I heard Mrs. Pollard call out thieves; I jumped up and went to the window and called out thieves; they immediately broke open my room door; I rushed out and went into Mrs. Pollard's room; one of them followed me; I believe the light went out; he did not catch me immediately, but he got a fresh light, and then took me by the nape of the neck, and threw me down, and said,</p>
               <p>"Blast' you, why did you cry out?" I said, I waked out of my sleep and did not know what I did; he then asked for my money; the prisoner came with a cutlass and held it to my throat, and swore he would cut my throat; the other said, Hold, he is going to shew us where the money is; the prisoner struck me over the shoulders with the flat part of the cutlass, and they took hold of the collar of my shirt behind, and led me into my own room; then they laid me on the bed and stood over Mrs. Pollard and me with a cutlass in one hand and a pistol in the other; they broke open and rifled all our drawers; every time any light were brought in, if we turned our heads the man that stood over us said,</p>
               <p>"Blast you, who do you look at? blast you, if you look I will chop your heads off:" then one of them below cried out, Holloa, and the man that stood over us said that they were going down to drink, and if we stirred he would come up and chop our heads off: they went down, I lay about five minutes; then hearing all quiet below, and finding it very cold, the window being open upon me, I crept from the bed to shut it, and saw them going over my land with a dark lanthorn: they took out of my breeches my watch, five guineas, and eleven or twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177707020026"></xptr>How do you know the prisoner was one of them? - When he came with the dark lanthorn and threatened to cut my throat, I looked wishfully at him; I am sure he is the man; he had the hairy cap on at the time; my men came in the morning and found the house broke open and the blunderbuss at the door; I described the prisoner, and heard he was sometimes in the brick-fields in Kingsland, at Mr. Brown's; I went and enquired after him and took him.</p>

               <p>I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

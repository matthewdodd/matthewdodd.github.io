                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Hammond, of No. 240, Oxford Street. I locked up the shop about 10 o'clock on 31st Aug.—I sleep in the house—I came down between 5 and 6 o'clock the following morning, and found it in great confusion—the shop door had been broken by a screw—I opened the front door, which the burglars had pulled to after them; it was merely closed—I had locked it the night before—the entry had been made through the area gate—they had forced open a lock which fastens the chain, and got in at the kitchen window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Hammond's employ. I went to the shop on 1st Sept, and found the stock in confusion—I missed eight pairs of trowsers, two pieces of doe skin making twenty yards, and upwards of 100 yards of angola—they were worth about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) to be part of the angola—we had 16 3/4 yards on the premises, and one piece the night before, with a damaged end like this—it has a brack, or white thread, on it, which is the mark of the cloth worker, and you will find by the invoice that the 3/8 are given in on account of the brack, and it is charged as 16 yards—the pattern and quality are also the same—this other piece is the property of my employer—these are torn out of what we lost.</p>

On Saturday, 5th Sept, about 8 o'clock in the evening I went to the prisoner's shop; it is a hair dresser's, at No. 33, Upper Park Place, Dorset Square—he was shaving a man—I asked him if he knew me—he said he did not I told him I was his namesake, and an inspector of police, and asked if he had any cloth in his house—he said, "No"—I asked if he had any trowsers—he said, "No"—I</p>

               <p>asked if he had anything that did not belong to him—he said, "No"—I asked if he had any objection to my searching his apartments—he said, "No"—I was accompanied by sergeant Chowne, and other constables—I searched the back parlour and the shop, and in the shop found a box which was locked, and was used as a seat—I inquired for the key, and he told his wife to bring it—she brought it, and said, "You do not want to look in here, Sir"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "We are very much confined for room, and I am frequently obliged to put things here out of the way of the children"—I told her that if there was anything she did not wish me to see, it should be done as delicately as possible—the box was opened, and she took up the skirt of a dress, and threw over one corner of the box, took something rolled up in the skirt into the back parlour, and placed it on a comer of the bed—I followed her—she told me to have respect for a woman's feelings—I said that if there was anything she did not wish me to see in her presence she must retire—it was a coloured skirt—I shook it, and found it contained this remnant of cloth, which has been produced, this jacket made up, and some other articles, which I cannot say, for they afterwards became mixed with the other remnants—I know they were all found in the box, and so were these two strips of basket cheque, and these two strips of black ribbed cloth, two strips of angola, and other remnants, which are positively sworn to—I placed them on the table in the back parlour—Chowne brought some others in my presence, and they were placed on the table—I then asked Webbe how he came by them—he said that he bought them—I asked him where—he said, "At various shops"—his wife spoke to him—I could not hear what she said—he then said, "Two men came to my shop on Wednesday last; one had his hair cut, the other was shaved; they had a pint of beer and a drop of gin, and left these remnants behind them"—I took him to the station, and on the Sunday I went to Mr. Hammond's shop, and selected two pieces of ribbed angola, with other pieces which were left behind—I have been a cloth worker, but have been nineteen years a policeman—my impression is that this little piece of cloth which I found in Mr. Hammond's shop is a portion of this other—here is a very curious tear in it—I think if you were to tear 1, 000 pieces you could not tear it as this is torn—I also found two pieces of basket cheque in the box, corresponding with this remnant of basket cheque at Mr. Hammond's shop—they exactly match in width, but the length is shorter—I matched the selvage of this jacket which is sewed up—it corresponds with the cloth.</p>

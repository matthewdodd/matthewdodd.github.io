            . - Mr. Gurney. I believe you are a servant to a friend of Mrs. Ore. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the prisoner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. During Mrs. Ore's absence at Brighton, did you visit the prisoner. - A. On Monday the 15th of June I was there a very short time; she asked me to take wine. I refused; she immediately took a key from her right hand pocket, she told me to follow her; I did, to the wine cellar door, she unlocked the door, I was very much surprized, I asked her if Mrs. Ore left the key of the wine cellar door with her; she said no it was the key of the garden, she said she had access to it in that manner whenever she pleased; the took out a bottle of wine, she told me to look in at the stock; I did, it was large; she said there was wine and spirits of every sort. I refused to drink the wine with her that day; I came away, and informed my mistress the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You had been an intimate acquaintance of the prisoner. - A. No further than going backwards and forwards for my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem very comely and well made - you are not a friar - it is very singular she made this free confession to you - she knew you were a servant. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a very sober young woman, you are not fond of drinking at all, it is a character you deserve - did not you drink tea with her. - A. No, I only called in to know how she was; she met me and took me to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Although you are a sober woman, she would take you to the wine cellar and show you how she opened it - you never tasted it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you undertake to say it was wine. - A Because I saw it in the glass. She did not make use of it then; I saw her put it in the copper hole.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Mrs. Ore, did you receive the information from this servant. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

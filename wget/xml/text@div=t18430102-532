                  </hi>. I occupy a house at Hounslow, next door to Mrs. Mary Davis's house, from which the copper was taken. On the 19th of Dec., I discovered that house was unfastened—I went to make it secure, and saw the prisoner in the yard with a short ladder, which did not surprise me, as he was in the habit of going there at all times—I went into the kitchen, and there was no copper there then.</p>

I had missed a copper from this empty house—I went to Mrs. Mills, and found a copper there—I had not seen it before it was taken away—Mr. Thomas Baker was in Mill's shop, and he said, "That is mine "—the copper was marked in my presence—I was going down the town, and met the prisoner—I said he must consider himself a prisoner for stealing that copper which I had in my hand—he went on to Mrs. Davis, plunged in at the door, went into the kitchen, and sat down by Mrs. Davis—he said to her, "Aunt, do you mean to prosecute me?"—she said, "I shall leave it all to the policeman"—he jumped up directly, and said, "D—your b----eyes, you <hi rend="italic">Nipper</hi>, you mean to transport me, I will have your b----life first"—he came and struck me—I seized him by the collar—he caught me by my hair, and beat me with his left hand—we strug<lb></lb>gled a quarter of an hour, he swearing he would have my life, before I should take him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a slipper-maker, and live in Rose-lane, Spital<lb></lb>fields. On Friday, the 7th of September, after I had done work, I went out to get a pint of beer for supper, and at the top of Rose-lane, I met my sister, who lives three doors from me, and we had the beer between us—we were coming home together, arm in arm—it was rather before eleven o'clock—I saw the prisoner in the middle of the road—it is a very narrow street, and there is only one footpath, to it very narrow—he was in the middle of the road with a large knife in his hand, and said he would run it through either man, woman, or child, that came near him—I was about six yards from him—he was jumping about the road, and ran after several people—I and my sister were coming past him on the pavement on the flag, as far as we could walk away from him—my sister was nearest to the wall—as we came opposite to him, he said nothing to me, but ran towards my sister, and made a blow at her, saying nothing—I saw he had an open pocket knife in his hand—he made the blow towards my sister's breast—I immediately pulled her away by putting my arm across her breast, and in so doing, I received the blow in the thick part of my arm, below the bend of the elbow—he did not say any thing—we went towards my door, and I did not know I was cut for five or ten minutes afterwards—I was going home, and on opening the door, I heard the blood go splash in the gutter, and found I had received a cut—I was taken to the London Hospital that night—I had never seen the prisoner before, and know nothing of him—he was rather in liquor, but not so much, but he knew what he was about—he was taken into custody—I saw him at Worship-street, about our weeks ago—he was sober then, and seemed steady like other people—never had any quarrel with him, nor ever spoke to him in all my life.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's sister. I had been to the public-house with him, and had a share of his porter—I went to fetch my husband home—it was just before eleven o'clock—I and my brother were walking home, arm-in-arm, and coming down the street, the prisoner was waving about an open knife, jumping about in the middle of the road, and through the man, woman, or child that came near him he would run through—it was necessary for us to pass him to go home—we were not</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter. On Friday night, the 7th of Sep<lb></lb>tember, I saw the prisoner in Rose-lane—I saw him rush out of a house, with a shawl in his hand—he crossed the road, and in a minute he had a knife—some girls were following him, to get the shawl from him, which they said was their property—I do not know whether they got the shawl from him, but I saw him brandishing a knife in his hand, and then he had not got the shawl—that was not above two or three minutes after he had the shawl—he swore that any body who approached him to take the shawl from him, he would stab, man, woman, or child—I did not see the pro<lb></lb>secutor stabbed—I do not know what became of the girls—they went away afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. I was called on the evening of the 7th of September, and found the prisoner in Rose-lane, about ten minutes before eleven o'clock, standing among a quantity of people—the prosecu<lb></lb>tor made a complaint against him of having stabbed him—he had a knife in his hand, flourishing it about—he said he would stab the first one that approached him—I approached him, and he made a stab at me, but Pom<lb></lb>fret assisted me, and I took him—he had been drinking, but was not so drunk as he made out.</p>

On 18th June I was at Guildhall police court when two of the prisoners were discharged and watched them with Halse—from the police court they went to Lee's Place, Westminster Bridge Road—we kept watch on them up to June 10 and on that after<lb></lb>noon I saw the three prisoners go to the New Kent Road—Martin-was carrying this reticule, they went to the corner of Gurney Street where they had a conversation and Martin gave the bag to Montague I believe and went into the Duke of Gloucester public-house at the other end of the street—she was there a minute or so and came back to Montague and Jones said, something and took something from a purse in her hand and gave it to Montague who then went into the Duke of Gloucester, called for a glass of something and tendered a coin in payment—I spoke to the barmaid who showed me a bad shilling—I marked it and went back and saw Montague give something to Martin who took something from a purse and gave it to Jones who came back and looked in at the door of the Duke of Gloucester, but she did not come in—she went back to Martin and gave her something, I do not know what, and they walked to the London Road where we got assistance and caught hold of all of them—I took Martin and said "Give me what you have got in your hand"—she declined—I forced it open and found this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) containing a small paper parcel in which were seven bad shillings with paper between them—Montague said "What do you want with me?"—I said "You will be charged with uttering a counterfeit shilling at the Duke of Gloucester"—she said "I was never there."</p>

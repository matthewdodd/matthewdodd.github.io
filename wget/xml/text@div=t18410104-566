                  </hi>. I am a deputy storekeeper to the London Gas com<lb></lb>pany, and live in New-street, Princes-street, Lambeth. The prisoner was a labourer employed on the premises—on Friday night, the 18th of December, 1 saw him coming to work, at half-past five o'clock, and saw him about eight o'clock coming up the yard from the water-side—I stopped him out<lb></lb>side the factory, and said, "Stop, what have you got here?" putting my hand over his left breast, which was very bulky, and he appeared to be hiding himself, as he came along—he said, "Don't hurt me, don't say any thing at all about it"—I said, "I must," and called a policeman, and gave him in charge—he was taken into the lodge, and searched, and I saw the policeman take this brass bearing off the crane at the water-side from him—we have a great many on the premises—it is the property of Andrew Spottiswoode and others—the value to the Company is 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

On 23d March I was on duty in the Minories, and saw Baker come out of Mr. Goodman's yard, about half-past 3, and go to Hobson's cab—that was about 170 yards from Baker's watch-box—I have known Hobson some time, and know the other prisoners as being in the service of the Dock Company—Hobson was on his stand opposite John-street, inside his cab—he got out and went on to the footpath with Baker—they conversed together for five or six minutes—Baker then went down Goodman's-yard and Hobson stood on the footpath oppo<lb></lb>site his cab—I expect they saw me; they might have seen me, I passed by with the sergeant at 10 minutes past 4—Baker came up the yard and spoke</p>

                  </hi>. I am night foreman to the Dock Company—Wackett's duty is to assist in <hi rend="italic">dropping</hi> the trucks by the hydraulic machine, and unloading them, and unloading the vans—it was his duty to come on at 1 o'clock—he was unloading sacks that morning—he had no business to be out in the street till after he had done his work, which would be about 5 o'clock.</p>

I am one of the foremen of porters, at the Victoria Docks—Baker was the night watchman there—it was his duty to watch in Goodman's-yard, at the outside of the premises—he had a watch-box there—he ought to remain there from 6 at night till 6 the following morning—his beat extended up to the entrance of the Dock premises—the entrance in Goodman's-yard is the only one by which you can get into Goodman's-yard from the Minories—Baker had no right to leave his beat and go into the Minories—it was contrary to his duty—Wackett ought to have come on duty at 12 o'clock, and remained till 12 next day—on the morning of 23d March, I received information that a robbery had been committed—I went down to the truck at twenty minutes past 6—there is an abutment of the railway-arch just where the truck was—I found the tape had been cut, and was entirely gone—the tape had been sealed—the lock was forced, and one chest of tea was taken out—I saw the vacant space—that might have been taken out by some person from behind the abutment, without being seen from the premises—this sack was in the Company's possession—it is one of fifteen—I had not seen them safe at all.</p>

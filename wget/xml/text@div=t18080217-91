               <p>Q. Do you let lodgings - A. Yes, furnished lodgings. I let the prisoner a three pair of stairs back room furnished, she was to pay me five shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a married woman. - A. I believe she is; her husband came at night; she lodged with me ten weeks; and she left my apartment on the 9th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the husband go away too. - A. Yes, when she went away she owed me ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she get her bread. - A. She told me her husband was a carpenter; she got her bread by shoe binding. I had a suspicion that she was gone; I took the bed down, I found two blankets and a sheet were gone; and the ticking torn to pieces, and part of the stocks and feathers were taken out; I found them at the pawnbrokers when she was apprehended.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BOONE. I belong to the public office, Bow street; on the 11th of this month, I apprehended the prisoner at No. 32 Great Earle street, Seven Dials; on searching her I found three duplicates; I went with Mrs. Alexander, she identified the property.</p>

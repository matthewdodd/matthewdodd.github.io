               <p>JOHN MASCALL. I am servant to John Reeves. On the 21st of March the prisoner came into the shop, and tried a pair of shoes on - He said he had not got enough to pay for them, but if I would come to the George he would pay me; I took them there, and gave them to him; he said he would return in a few minutes. I waited there an hour - He never returned; I was not to deliver them without the money. We found him offering them for sale.</p>

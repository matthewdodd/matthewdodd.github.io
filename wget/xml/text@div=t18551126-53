                  </hi>. My father keeps a draper's and haberdasher's shop. On Saturday, Nov. 17, I was having my tea, and was called into the shop, and missed some calico from the rail inside the door way—I went down the street, but saw nothing—there were three or four customers is the shop, and one or two persons behind the counter, and a little girl, Mary Ann Camp<lb></lb>bell, a customer—two of my assistants are my sisters, they are not here—I went round the corner of the next house almost directly, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soners—the little girl pointed them out to me, and I followed them down the street—they crossed the road into Dudley-street—I saw constable, C 200, and gave them into his charge—they were taken to Bow-street—I saw them searched, and some bad money found on them—Johnson was committed from Bow-street, for having the base coin, and has been tried here, and I was ordered to attend—I was at Marlborough-street as well—I was not bound over—I was ordered to go before the Grand Jury by the constable, and by the inspector, who had charge of the base coin—I was ordered by the police to come here, and by the Magistrate, he said, "You will attend."</p>

                  </hi>. I was outside Mr. Taylor's shop, about a little after 5 o'clock—I saw a woman and a girl looking at some prints just in<lb></lb>side the shop door—they were both standing, and a man, Taylor, was stoop<lb></lb>ing down in front of them; I saw him take a roll of calico off an iron rail, and walk away with it in his hand, and they followed him—when they got to the corner of the court, I went into the shop and got some cotton which I was going for, and gave information—I came out again, and was going across the road, and saw the prisoners both walking past the shop—they turned round the corner, Mr. Taylor's servant was standing by, and I told him that they were the people who took the calico—I am sure they are the same persons—I saw their faces by the gas light in the shop window.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, C</hi> 200). The prisoners were given into my custody at Dudley-street, by Taylor—they were about twenty yards ahead of me when he pointed them out, and I ran after them directly—they were walking together—just before I took them, I heard Johnson say, "You do not know me," or, "You must not know me"—I told Johnson I wanted him for a case of felony—he said, "I suppose that is stealing"—Walker then ran away some distance—I gave Johnson into the prosecutors charge, and followed her, and took her without losing sight of her—I told her I wanted her for stealing some calico—she said that she knew nothing of Johnson, but had just asked him to treat her with some gin—I had never asked her whether she knew him—I took them to Bow-street, and found on Johnson four half crowns and three shillings all counterfeit, a pair of scissors, a screw driver, and a knife—they were brought up at Bow-street, but this case was not gone into there, or at Marlborough-street—it was never gone into before a Magistrate—Mr. Bingham sent it here—he said that I was to appear here, and they should both be tried together—I was bound</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective K</hi>). On the morning of 20th March I went with Hockley to the Milk Yard in Green Street, Bethnal Green, and there saw a cart with the name of William Scammell, Green Street, Bethnal Green, on the side—I saw Scammell and Watson come towards the yard, and took them into custody—I told them they were charged with breaking into a house at Finchley yesterday—Scammell said "You have made a mistake, I know nothing about it; that man (Watson) is out of work, and he has been working for me about a fortnight"—I took them to Whetstone and charged them, leaving Rolfe at the Milk Yard—next evening, the 21st, I was with Rolfe and met Pascoe in the Old Ford Road; she came across and said something to Rolfe which I did not hear—I said "You had better come back with me; we are going to make a further search at your house"—we went there together—I said "We want to find those three boxes that were brought here yesterday;" she said "I know nothing about any boxes"—I searched the house, and in the back bedroom, under the bed, I found this deal box; it was then empty—in another box in the front room I found this Bible and these letters and papers, with the name of the owner, Mr. Malcolm, on them—Rolfe said "We want to see what jewellery you have"—she produced some rings</p>

               <p>from her finger and some earrings—this watch was found on her—I said "I shall take you into custody for receiving these goods, knowing them to be stolen;" she said "I know nothing about them; I was out all day yesterday"—I then took her into custody. <hi rend="italic">Pascos</hi>. I gave you the watch immediately you asked me.</p>

               <p>William Rolfe (<hi rend="italic">Detective K</hi>), I was with Waller—I took Watson, and told him he would be charged with breaking into a house near Barnet the day before—he said he had never been there—I took him to the station, and returned to the yard, where I remained till 9 that evening, when Mrs. Scammell came in—I spoke to her—she gave me a marriage cer<lb></lb>tificate and a pedlar's licence in the name of Scammell—I went with her to 11, Middleton Road, Old Ford: she unlocked the door—in a corner of the room behind the door I found this shirt, with "C. Hayward" on it, and in a black bag under the bed I found this coat, and this silver top of a scent-bottle in a drawer—I took her into custody—next morning, in consequence of what she told me, I went to 515, Old Ford Road with Inspector O'Callahan—the door was opened by Jones and Pascoe toge<lb></lb>ther—I asked Pascoe if any one lived there named Jones—she said "Yes"—Jones came into the passage, and I said "Is your name Jones?"—he said "Yes"—I told him we were police officers, and I wanted to know if he was partner with a man named Scammell—he said he did not know any one of that name—I told him I should search the house to see if I could find any of the property that was stolen from Barnet the day before—I asked if the house belonged to him—Pascoe said she was the landlady, and all that was in it was hers—I searched the house, but found nothing relating to this matter—I took Jones to the station—I went the next evening with Waller and took Pascoe into custody for receiving the things there found—she said she was not at home when the things came there, and she knew nothing about it—I told Jones that these boxes had been found at his address—he said that Scammell had asked him to mind them for a few days for him, that he had fetched them from Scammell's house the day before, and that this particular box Mrs. Scammell had asked him to mind for a few days, and before he fetched it away he had asked her if there was anything in it that was stolen, and she said "No."</p>

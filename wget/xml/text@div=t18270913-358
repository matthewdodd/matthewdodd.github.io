On the afternoon of Tuesday, the 11th of September, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to look at some gold pins; I showed him some, which did not please; he then asked for some brooches, and while I was reaching them I saw him take a pin from the card, (with the two fingers of his right hand,) and put it into his pocket - he was then about twenty minutes bargaining for another pin, for which I asked him 6s., and he offered me 3s. 6d. - he went out, without buying any thing - I followed and brought him back, before he got out of sight; I made him produce the pin, which was in his watch pocket - I could not understand half he said, being a foreigner; I said, "Produce that pin you took away;" "Here is that pin," said he - he appeared to understand me, though I could not understand him. I then sent for the officer. He did not appear at all intoxicated.</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Young sent for me, about a quarter after four o'clock, to take charge of the prisoner - he gave me this pin, and said he had stolen it; I took him to the Compter; I found 11s. in his possession, and in a bundle which he had, was a new pair of stockings, some butter, bacon, and pork - he offered me the 11s. if I would let him go - he spoke plain.</p>

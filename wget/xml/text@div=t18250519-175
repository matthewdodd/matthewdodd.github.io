On the 23d of April, in consequence of information, I went with Joyce into Aldersgate-street, to a print shop - the name of Follett is over the door - I asked a man for prints; he said they belonged to a female, and called the prisoner, Oxley, down; she was asked if she had prints to call for a scrap box; she produced a port-folio - I immediately recognised a print in it as being one of mine, which had never been published: I went for an officer, and on my return Joyce had selected a number of prints, all of which I knew; I bought one of them for 2 s. 6 d., that had not been published; I then laid my hand on the whole, told her they were stolen, and begged her to tell me who she had them from; she said she could not tell; she had bought them of different persons who came to the shop - they were delivered to the officer - there were a good many belonging to works printed at my house, which had been published.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was fetched to Aldergate-street - these prints laid on the counter - Mr. Fenner looked them over and said "Madam, these are stolen." I took charge of her, and one print, which he gave me - I have the whole which were selected.</p>
               <p>MR. FENNER. Here is the one which I bought - here are about two hundred in all: I suspected Gore, and took an officer to my house, called Gore aside and charged him with taking prints out of my house, and selling them to his daughter-in-law; he said he had never sold a print out of my house in his life, but that he had given these to his daughter-in-law.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is it not common with those who take off prints to take one for themselves? A. Not to my knowledge - I know nothing of such a custom: about sixteen sheets of waste paper is allowed in a ream - they generally strike off one or two more than the number in case of accident, but are directed by me to burn all prints that are waste - if they are not burnt they remain in the warehouse: Gore had been a printer but worked in the warehouse, having broken his thumb: he was employed to clean these very prints - they are not allowed to take them out of the house, and are not allowed to have the waste - many of these are quite perfect.</p>

            . I have been a copper-plate printer thirty of forty years, and have been five years in Mr. Fenner's employ - the men have no right to take prints - the Stafford gallery had been in hand six months; all these plates were in Mr. Fenner's possession in April - many of them could be cleaned - it was Gore's business to clean them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not workmen often take one impression? A. It is understood that if a man works a print he should have one to keep, to compare, in order to arrange prices, but never to sell - but here are three of one sort.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mesrrs. Hurst &amp; Co. I went with Mr. Fenner to Aldersgate-street - Oxley produced a port-folio, containing these prints and many others. While he fetched an officer I selected what I thought belonged to the Stafford gallery. Mr. Fenner returned and bought one - she said she bought them of various people who came to the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there prints in the window? A. Yes, one side of the shop has books, and the other prints.</p>
               <p>GORE'S Defence. I never stole a print - every one was given to me under the idea of their being spoiled impressions - I could have had five times the number - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190059"></xptr>gave them to Oxley, telling her they were spoiled, and of no value.</p>

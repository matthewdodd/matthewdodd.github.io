                  </hi>. I am a publican, and live at the corner of New Milman-street, near the Foundling Hospital. The prisoner was further months in my service as pot-boy, at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, besides his board. On the 24th of April, 1837, I suspected all was not right, and told him I should receive the bills myself—I went out, and when I returned he was gone—he knew I was gone to make inquiry about the bills—I have been looking for him ever since—I found him on the 25th of May.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Bradley, a pawnbroker, in Cable-street, Wellclose-square. About half-past six o'clock on the 20th of April, I saw the prisoner and another female outside the shop—the other was urging the prisoner to come in, and said, "If you come in you won't wait long"—the prisoner then came into the shop and tendered me this table-cloth and napkin, and asked 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them—T looked at them and found "United Service Club" woven in the pattern—I asked the prisoner if they were her own—she at first said they were, and afterwards that they were the property of another person, who had sent her to pledge them, and said she would redeem them on the Saturday following—she did not give me any account whose property they were—I sent for a policeman, and gate her into custody.</p>

On the evening of the 20th of April, I was called to Mr. Bradley's—I taw the prisoner there—I was desired to take her into custody—I looked at the table-cloth, and found it was marked "United Service Club"—I asked the prisoner where she got it—she said she did not know, she would tell another time—at first she said it was her own—I asked her how it could be possible she could have such a valuable table-cloth as that—she said she would tell another time—I said I would take her to the station—she said she would not go—I said I would force her to go—I took hold of her, and on the way to the station I asked her where she got it—she said she found it—she did not say where—Vokins gave me the table-cloth and I kept possession of it—I found this purse and two duplicates on the prisoner.</p>

On the morning of the 5th of August, I heard a cry of Murder! as I was going my rounds at half-past one o'clock; a female in the street gave me an alarm, and showed me this house, No. 265, High Holborn - the prisoner lived there and Mr. Lazarus - when I got to the house, the street-door was fast-Lazarus opened it to me - I had rang the bell - I will not be certain whether Lazarus had a light, but the kitchen-stairs were on fire, which gave me a light - I went through the passage to the back part of the house down the kitchen-stairs, over the part that was on fire - the fire was under the stairs - it was then burning quite in a flame through the joists of the stairs - I could not then judge how long it had been burning - I got water and extinguished the flame, then broke up two of the kitchen-stairs with my stick - people up the stairs threw more water on it - those people did not belong to the house - I thought it was the watchman; I broke down the lath and plaster to see if there were any embers remaining - the engines came, and I left the en<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260045"></xptr>gine-keeper and men in the house, and I was ordered to my duty - it must have been burning some time, because two steps of the stairs were nearly burned through.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing occur to you to observe what had produced the flame? A. I saw part of the flame coming down at the time - it seemed to be hanging down and dropping, as if it was from gas burning - about half an hour afterwards I went there, and Riley showed me two pieces of links - I have seen links burning, and my notion then was that the links had produced that flame, which was hanging down - it was similar to what I have seen with links burning - I believe that flame was produced by links - I looked at the place, but there was no gas-pipe there, which could have produced it - the shop was lighted with gas (the witness here examined the model of the house, and pointed out the spot where the fire had been found) - Furzeman, Riley, and a fireman, named Mills, had all come before I left the place - I found a kind of step-ladder placed against the cupboard-door; I was about the house all the morning till I left duty; I went in, but did not go down-stairs afterwards; I saw the prisoner and Lazarus when the fire was burning; the prisoner was coming down the stairs, not exactly dressed; I think he had a long grey frock morning-coat on; I went into the back-parlour every time I went into the house; I saw nothing amiss there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have talked a great deal about this since you were examined at the office? A. I have been answering questions that were asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at Marlborough-street, say one word about the flame, which was supposed to come from links, descending? A. I was not examined till the last hearing; I gave evidence, with regard to the flame burning down, to the best of my belief; but I was not sworn about the fire on the 5th of August; it was about the one on the 18th.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of the door having been shut, to exclude anybody? A. No; the doors were all open - he said, he suspected Lazarus's servant, that is

            ; she was called down-stairs, and there was some altercation between Lazarus and the prisoner, who should give her in charge - White insisted that Lazarus was the most proper person to charge her; Riley came and begged of me to come back, and search the place under the stairs - I did so, and on searching among the mortar that had fallen down, I saw Riley pick up two pieces of link, he has had them ever since - they were eight or nine inches long - one rather longer than the other; they appeared to have been burnt very much - I then examined under the stairs, and on one of the beams, on a sort of ledge, I found a quantity of pitch, which I supposed had come from the links - either Riley or I tried if one of the links would fit the place on the ledge, where it appeared to have stood, and it fitted the place - I do not think Mr. White went under the stairs with us - I went into the kitchen again, and asked White whether he ever had any links in the house; he said, he had never had any think of the sort in his house - the girl was then taken into custody - none of the gas conductors came near the place under the stairs, I observed nothing more that night - on Friday, the 11th of August, Lazarus and the prisoner called on me; I had sent for them in consequence of information I had received - White said, he had been dining with his mother the day before, and she had told him there were some links in the house, six or eight months ago - I said, "You told me the last time I saw you, that there were no links at all in the house, and that you had no occasion for any; it is very strange" - I said, I wanted them to go down to Mr. Bradford's, where I understood links had been bought, but I could not go then; it was appointed to go next day, which was Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing else pass when he mentioned about his mother saying there had been links in the house? A. Yes; I said, "What in the name of God could you want with links six or eight months ago;" he said, he had had a party of friends, and they were sitting in the yard - the candles had blown out, and they had the links to light them.</p>
               <p>Q. That would have been about Christmas, that they were sitting in the yard? A. It was in the winter; I I made some observations to him, which I do not recollect; we met next day (Saturday) at Bradford's; Lazarus, the prisoner, myself, and Davies, a broker, who lives in Holborn, within sixty yards of the prisoners house - Bradford is an oil-man, living opposite George-street, St. Giles, just by middle-row; on entering the shop, Lazarus said to Bradford, "Am I the person who bought the links?" Bradford said, "No, you are not" - the prisoner then directly said, "I can prove, by two witnesses, that I was in bed at twelve o'clock that day," meaning the 4th of August - Bradford had said, they were bought between ten and one on the 4th of August - Bradford then said, he could tell better if he saw White in his morning-gown; he had not at that time said anything about White being the person; Lazarus said, "I will go home and change my clothes, and put on every dress I have got, and you shall see me;" I said to the prisoner,"You will have no objection to go home, and put on your morning gown, and let Mr. Bradford see you;" he hesitated a minute, and said, "Indeed I shall not do any thing of the kind, for I shall not make a puppet-show of myself;" I had seen him in his morning-gown at the time of the fire, and when I saw him in it afterwards, it appeared to have been altered in the sleeves, and it had been cut shorter.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260046"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner is a married man? A. Yes; his wife slept in the house that night - I cannot say that he declined giving charge of the servant; Lazarus, I think, ultimately declined it; I said,"It don't matter which of you charge her, if you have any suspicion;" when she was in confinement, some things were brought her - I cannot say whether they came from White.</p>
               <p>Q. What breadth was the ledge, which you say the links appeared to fit? A. Under the stairs is lath and plaster, and in that lath and plaster was a hole, where it appeared the links had been put in - I believe the prisoner afterwards went to the Fire-office, and gave notice of the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he go voluntarily before the parish-officers? A. He would not about the first fire; a summons was sent to him on the 1st of September, and he did not come.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that summons to show some cause, why he did not pay some money for the engine? A. I think so, but the gentleman is here who wrote the letter - business prevented my going to Bradford's on Friday - we went on Saturday afternoon; I proposed to White, to go home for his morning-gown, and come back, and show himself - his house is about a quarter of a mile or rather less, from there - it is a crowded neighbourhood; and he said, he should not make a puppet-show of himself - Bradford and his boy were quite silent in his presence, as to whether he was the person who bought the links.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose on the night of the fire, there was great confusion in the house? A. I got to work directly down below - I saw three or four respectable inhabitants round about - I staid there about two hours examining the premises, and talking to persons.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Bradford declared distinctly Lazarus was not the person; the prisoner immediately said, he could prove he was in bed, and nothing further was said? A. No, nothing further was said.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. Giles. I went into the house on the 5th of August, rather before Furzeman; the fire was partially burning - I found two pieces of links, which I produce - I have preserved them as well as I could; I found him under the kitchen stair-case, among the lath and plaster, which had been pulled down - (Here the witness pointed out in the model, the place where he had found them) - the next morning I went with Furzeman, to examine the front kitchen; I examined the floor and the range; one of the bars of the range appeared as if some greasy substance had been on it; it was dirtier than the other part; and in a direction from the fire-place, to the place where the fire was, I found several droppings of pitch or tar in a train; I cut them up from the floor with my knife, applied them to a candle, and they burnt; I think them the same stuff as links are composed of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. They extended from the range to where? A. Under the stair-case, as far as the floor went, and to where there was no water; and where the water was I saw spots, but cannot say whether they were far; there was a line of spots from the range to the fire.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Bradford, an oilman, of St. Giles. On the 4th of August I recollect a person coming to purchase two links; I really believe the prisoner is that person - it was between eleven and one o'clock, or it might be half-past one - I cannot exactly say: he was dressed in a grey morning-gown, and took them away with him, rolled up in a blue bag; there was more pitch on them than links generally have; it is not very common to sell them in summer time - (looking at the pieces of links produced,) these appear very much like them, as far as I am able to judge. I saw the prisoner about two months afterwards, at St. Giles' watch-house, in a grey morning-gown - I thought it the same gown, but it was cut shorter at the tail, no where else that I observed. I recollect Furzeman, White, Lazarus, and another person coming to my master's house a few days after the 4th of August - I was not at home when they came, but the day before that the prisoner came without Furzeman, but with a short gentleman, whom I do not know; they came in, and asked if Mr. Bradford was at home; I said, No - he said, "My name is White - I called concerning some links;" I told him we did not want any at present - I thought he was come to sell some: he said, "I do not mean that - I understand you have been telling the beadle that I bought some links here;" I said, "How can you say that, when I did not know you?" I did not tell him what I said to the beadle, but told him we had sold some links, and described the person who purchased them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe him by his clothes? A. Yes; I said the person had a grey morning-gown on who bought the links; he replied, "That is just such a dress as I wear;" the short gentleman asked me what sort of a person it was, whether he was like a Christian or a Jew; I said I did not notice enough of the man. I have seen Lazarus, and am sure he is not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your opinion at this time, although you might not have expressed it? A. My opinion at that time was, that the prisoner was the person; I did not like to say so then. I did not like to accuse him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you not say as a reason for your knowing the less about him, that you had not dealt with him, but your master had served him? A. Yes; my master had served him - there were no other customers in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, have you not always said it was between eleven and one o'clock? A. I have - I told the Justice so; it is quite uncertain what time I dine - my attention was called to the circumstance about a week after they were bought.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not always said from then till to-day, that it was between eleven and one o'clock? A. Yes, but I cannot speak exactly to a minute; I have no reason for extending the time.</p>
               <p>Q. If the coat which you saw on the prisoner at the watch-house was the one he wore on the day he bought the links, you are sure it was cut shorter? A. It was shorter than when he bought the links, I am certain.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you frequent demand for links since gas-lights have been established? A. Very seldom indeed - we mostly sell them about the 5th of November.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you saw him in the shop you thought he was the person who bought your links - why then did you say you had no orders to give him for links? A. Because I did not take much notice when he first came in.</p>

            . I am a colourman, and live in Broad-street, St. Giles - Dodwell is my shopman. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260047"></xptr>the 4th of August some person came to buy some links - I at first said it was from eleven to one o'clock, but I think it might be a little after one; I had no knowledge of him before - he was dressed in a mixed morning drugget-coat; he bought two links, paid 4d. for them, and took them away, in a blue bag, something like an attorney's bag. I produce a link taken from the same bundle; they are more pitched than they generally are; I have compared the pieces produced before they got rubbed so much - they appeared to me to be of the parcel. On the 11th of August I heard, from my boy, that a gentleman named White had called. On the 12th Lazarus and Furzeman came with the prisoner - Lazarus said they came on the subject of the links, was he at all like the person who had bought the links on the 4th of August; I said, No, neither his person nor his voice would do (he is a Jew, I could tell that from his face); I said the person had on a morning-gown, and I should be able to say more about it when I saw him in that dress - Lazarus said he would go home and bring all the dresses he had, to convince me he was not the person who purchased them; Furzeman said it was evident some one in the house must have placed the links there; Lazarus said, perhaps Mr. White would not mind coming in his morning-dress, for me to see him - White said he did not see why he should make himself a puppet-show to please any one; they then went away. I have since seen the prisoner in a grey morning-coat, at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Having seen him now, and on other occasions, what is your opinion? A. He very much resembles the person who bought the links; when I saw him at the watch-house his coat appeared as if cut shorter in the skirts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It might be a few minutes before one o'clock as well as after when he bought the links? A. It might; I could have seen the time by locking out at the church, but I did not; I think it must be a little after one, from what I recollect since - I think I was not asked about the time at the office; the grey coat appeared something shorter when he was at the watch-house; when he was wrapping them up he took the cross way with his bag, and I noticed his dress more than his face, as I had not a full view of his face while he was wrapping them up, but I saw him come into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not venture to swear to him without seeing him in his coat? A. I wished it to be put on - I say now he is very much like him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. There was nobody else in the shop at the time? A. No, except the servant; I generally dine about one o'clock; my wife was coming in with a few steaks, just after he was gone. In the summer time we sell very few links, except to a few drovers, and boys about the Theatres.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you usually sell many of them to persons of the prisoner's description? A. Very seldom, except persons go into the country, or it is a very foggy night.</p>

            . I am a jeweller and general-dealer, and live at No. 3. Rutland-street, Gloucester-terrace, Commercial-road. In August last, I lodged at the prisoner's house with my wife, one child, grandmother, sister, and servant - there were six of us altogether - I lived there since August 1825 - Mr. White occupied the house then, and lived there till after the fire - I occupied the first floor, two rooms on the garret-floor, and the front-kitchen - the gas-cocks were in the front-kitchen; the prisoner and his family had access to the front-kitchen for the purpose of turning the gas on and off - it is turned on about dark - the kitchen-door is always open, they may go in and out when they please - I and my wife slept in the garret, the servant in the middle-garret, my grandmother and sister in the first-floor, back-room; but at the time of the fire the servant slept on a sofa, in the first-floor, as she complained of being annoyed by bugs - the prisoner and his wife slept on the second-floor, I believe - on the 4th of August, I and my wife went to bed near twelve o'clock - I was awoke in an hour and a quarter, or an hour and a half, by a smoke and smother in the room - I called my wife, got up and opened the door, as the room was full of smoke - I called out, "There is a fire in the house;" I took my child in my arms, and went down stairs as fast as I could to the street-door, having only my trousers on; I unlocked the middle passage-door, and while I was unbolting the street-door, the bell rang - the watchman came in as I went out; the middle-door prevents people coming to the shop, communicating with the stairs - I made no observation, but went down with my family to Little Turnstile - and when I returned, the prisoner was in the parlour - suspicion fell on my servant-girl - Furzeman had her in the parlour, questioning her about the fire - she said she knew nothing about it; but White suspected her - and she was suspected on a former occasion - they asked me to give charge of her - I said I did not know what to do; they said I must give charge of her - and I went and left her at the watch-house; I called to see my family - then returned, and the prisoner stood in the passage laughing - he was talking to nobody - I said, "Mr. White, I really see nothing to laugh at;" he made no answer - I went into the parlour with him, and he said, "Lazarus, if I was you I would not prosecute her;" he did not say why - I said, "Mr. White, I don't know what you mean, you first make me take up the girl, thinking her intention was to burn nine or ten persons in their beds, and now you tell me you would not prosecute;" he made no answer - I afterwards attended the Police-office, and the charge was abandoned - there is a trap-door over the garret, communicating with the roof; on the night of the 1st of August, when I went up to bed, that trap-door was open, and a ladder placed against it - I called to Catherine Taylor, the prisoner's servant, to know what the ladder did there - I removed it down seven stairs - I could not shut the trap-door down - I had never seen it open before, to my knowledge - it was never open at night - the ladder was kept between the front-kitchen and cellar-door - I never saw it up-stairs before - it was not a heavy one - it remained down six or seven stairs, where I had removed it, till the fire - on the Friday after the fire, I met with the prisoner and Furzeman, and it was agreed we should go altogether the next day to the place where the links were bought - I did not go before the next day - when I went, White was asked to put on a morning-coat - he said he would not - I said, "Mr. Bradford, if you think I am like the man at all, I will go home and put on all the clothes I have;" I never bought any links, and never placed them under the stairs - I quitted the house on the 8th of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. What do you mean by a general dealer? A. I buy jewellery, clothes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260048"></xptr>and any thing; but do not work at any trade - I attend sales - I am of the Jewish persuasion - the place under the stairs where the fire broke out is where I kept some things which belonged to the feast of the Passover; they belonged to my grandmother - that place was in my occupation; it was not fastened at all. White attended at Marlborough-street on the Saturday and Wednesday when my servant was examined - I do not think he was examined; there were two or three examinations - the magisstrate said that nothing could be made of it, but the charge stood open against her.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you charged her with stealing some property of yours? A. Yes, she was detained on my charge, tried here last Session, and acquitted; I was not allowed my expenses.</p>
               <p>Q. You slept in the garret, the furthermost place from where the fire was? A. Yes; I was the first person who gave the alarm; I did not knock at White's door as I came down; I think he was coming out of his door - I called out Fire! directly I opened my door; they were all down as soon as us. My first care was to put my wife and family in a place of safety, at Mr. Davies', in Little Turnstile - my grandmother and all went there - I was not gone five minutes, and on my return I heard that suspicion had fallen on my servant Drew; she was taken to the watch-house, and then I came back and saw him laughing - the fire was out then - I said nothing to him about the trap-door, as he was out of the house that night; I mentioned it to Catherine - it remained open from then till the fire, but I had taken the ladder away, and it remained where I left it - I had left his house myself before I went to Bradford's about the links, but all my property remained there.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, he had levied a distress on it? A. No, not then, not till the Tuesday afterwards - I swear he did not levy the distress till then: we were not to leave his place till the 29th of September; I owed a quarter's rent, but no distress was put in till after I went to Bradford's. I received a letter about the rent on Tuesday, (it was sent to my mother's, at 33, Maiden-lane,) and on Wednesday a man came to let me know of the distress - no application was made to me about the rent till after the fire, but the agreement was that it should be paid half-yearly - my property was moved from the house six weeks before Michaelmas-day; we were to go to Bradford's on the Friday, but Furzeman being engaged, I went on Saturday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had the girl lived with you? A. Since August 1825 - we had had no difference before the fire; nothing had passed so as for her to have any spite against us; I never heard of her having any dispute with the prisoner or his family.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Why did you cease to sleep in the house - did the prisoner remain at home after the fire? A. No, he went out on Saturday, and said he was going to Fulham - he was gone three nights: finding he did not come home, I thought it right to leave. I and all the family had sat up two nights, and I left the house on Monday. I paid 50l. a year, and paid the rent half-yearly; here is a receipt for 25l. up to Lady-day (read) - nothing was due till Michaelmas, but he distrained on me for a quarter's rent - I was not under difficulty about the payment, if the proper time had arrived. The trap-door leads to a loft, and there is a way out on the roof.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On Tuesday night, the 1st of August, as I was going to bed, I observed a ladder placed against the trap-door, which was open - I had never seen it there before, nor the trap-door open of a night - I said I should not be easy unless the ladder was taken away before I retired to bed; Mr. Lazarus then moved it on the stairs - it remained there, and the trap-door open till the fire - it was usually kept by the kitchen-door. The fire happened on the 4th. We had been on the most amicable terms with Mr. and Mrs. White, and I had a great respect for him and his family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you seen the ladder there during the day? A. No; I think I had not been up stairs that day - I had seen a ladder against the trap-door once, in the day time, during the time I lived there, but never at night; it is a flat trap-door in the passage, and leads to the loft, and then outside the house.</p>

I am servant to Mr. White - I am still in his service; he and Mrs. White slept in the middle-room, on the second floor; all the rooms not occupied by Lazarus, were in his possession; the ladder was generally kept down-stairs, but the boy had taken it to get some wood from the top of the house; he asked master if he should bring it down; he told him to please himself - this was on the 1st or 2d of August, I believe; I remember the night the fire broke out; Mr. and Mrs. White had gone to bed about twelve o'clock that night - I went to bed about ten minutes afterwards; he slept from home two nights after the fire - he had a previous engagement at his mother's, at Fulham - I sat up both these nights till four o'clock, as Mr. and Mrs. Lazarus wished me - Mrs. White slept out with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long before the fire had you lived there? A. Nearly three months; I went to bed on the 4th of August, about twelve o'clock; I was not down in the lower kitchen that night; my own kitchen is level with the parlour; master was engaged in the parlour with a friend for half an hour, before he went up to bed - I was not in Lazarus's kitchen, and cannot say whether there was a fire in his range - I sleep in the back attic, on the same floor with Mr. Lazarus - I heard an alarm of fire about one o'clock, and we all went down.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night before the 4th of August, where had your master been - I mean the 3d of August? A. Master and mistress had been out, to go to the Coburg Theatre; it was nearly two o'clock when they returned - it was a very tempestuous evening indeed; master came down stairs next morning at twelve o'clock; I made no observation to him about it; he breakfasted in the parlour adjoining the shop, and even with the kitchen; he dined about half-past three; I moved the breakfast things after one; he was then still at the table where he had breakfasted; it was ten minutes or a quarter past one, when I moved the breakfast things away; he was reading when I left the room; I was in and out of the room frequently; when I went in, he was sometimes in the shop, and sometimes in the parlour; he could go out through the passage without going through the shop; I did not see him go out; I have every reason to believe he did not go out; I was about on my business all day; he had his morningcoat on that morning; I recollect it up to the time he was taken into custody; he had had new sleeves put to it, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260049"></xptr>I never observed it shorter; I never took particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was it your master's habit to wear that coat in the course of the day? A. He always wore it, except when he went out; he generally breakfasted between nine and ten o'clock - I have two beds to make up-stairs after breakfast; I seldom go up-stairs till after the breakfast things are cleared away; my kitchen is on the same floor with the shop and parlour, but detached from the house.</p>

I am a mill and machine-maker - I live at No. 266, High Holborn, next door to the prisoner's house - he occupied the house at the time of the fire - Mr. Treacher, a tallow-chandler, lived on the other side - on the second day after the fire, I had some conversation with the prisoner; something was said about Lazarus's servant being detained; he told me Lazarus's servant had been remanded for a further examination at Marlborough-street, and that he had no doubt, but she was the person who sat fire to the house - he said, the marks of the links were found on her hands - I am certain of that expression, but do not know whether he said links or torches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was this after the examination at Marlborough-street? A. After the first examination; he said, it was a very shocking affair; that the girl had been remanded, and he had no doubt she set fire to the house, for marks of the links were found on her hands - I understood it as his opinion; not what any one else had said.</p>

            . I was in Lazarus's service when he lived at the prisoner's house - I did not set fire to the house, on my oath - I had no pitch in the house, nor had I ever used any - I never had any on my hands when before the Justice, or at any time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you recollect on the night of the fire seeing Furzeman? A. Yes; he examined my hands; there was some black on them - I was putting my boots on, and they were all wet and dirty; I had left them in the kitchen before the fire - they were wet and dirty with the water which had been thrown on the fire; after putting them on, Furzeman looked at my hands, which were wet and damp; he said, it was pitch; but it was not; it had come off my boots; I said, it was not pitch; Furzeman asked Lazarus if he would give me in charge, and he said, Yes; I had been twelve months in his service - I never had any dispute with him, but when I had been out - Lazarus accused me of burning a table, and I was uncomfortable ever after - I had not burnt it.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the fire, how soon before the alarm had you been in Lazarus's kitchen? A. I think about twelve o'clock - I was going up the kitchen stairs to bed, and met Mr. White coming down into the kitchen to turn his gas out - I bade him good night, and likewise his wife and servant, who were at the top of the kitchen stairs in the passage - I went up-stairs, and sat down for about half an hour, before Mr. and Mrs. Lazarus went to bed - it was customary for Mr. White to go down-stairs every night to turn his gas off.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any dispute with Mr. Lazarus about your wages? A. No; I have asked him several times for my wages; he said, he could not and would not pay me, he would see me at the devil first.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you been paid your wages now? A. I summoned him for a quarter's wages, which he paid me; he will not pay me more; when the fire happened, all my clothes and every thing I had were in the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now, assuming your master and you had a quarrel, did you set fire to the house to be revenged of him? A. No, my Lord. The charge about burning the table, was not a dispute; I never had any dispute with Mr. White or his family.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FURZEMAN re-examined. I examined the girl's hands - the first moment I opened them there were two or three little bits of dirt; I thought it might be pitch - I wetted my finger and rubbed it, and it came off quite easy - I found it was only dirt; that was not my reason for taking her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you state that you thought it pitch? A. I did - I cannot say whether Lazarus was present; it was early in the morning, just after the fire was got out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on your saying that there was pitch on her hands that he gave her in charge? A. Oh! no.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You immediatety rubbed her hands, and found it was not pitch; did you represent to Lazarus or White that it was pitch? A. Never - it was dirt, and if she had been in the kitchen it might easily have come from her boots.</p>

On the morning of the last fire I went into the prisoner's shop, to look over it: I cast my eye round to observe the nature of the books - my opinion, giving them a fair full price, which they would fetch to a retail customer, is, that it is not worth 800l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, in commencing my defence against the accusation you have heard, I solicit your indulgence, for my natural defect of an imperfect utterance, the disadvantage of which I now most painfully feel. In the evidence, which has been brought forward, you cannot fail to remark the total absence of every thing like positive proof, and that my conviction is sought only upon one or two circumstances feeble in themselves and requiring the aid of strong inference to connect them. I will recall the facts briefly, and first draw your attention to those upon which my prosecutors rely. In the night, between Friday and Saturday, the 4th and 5th of August last, and when eight persons were in my house, it was set on fire clearly by design, and the instrument made use of was a link. It is in evidence that the day before two links had been purchased at an oil-shop, about half a mile distant, by a person habited in a dress similar to one I frequently used to wear, and resembling me in person; the prosecutors assert this person to have been me, and thence infer that I was the author of that fire. Their real evidence does not go beyond this, nothing else applies to me, but I am not the man who purchased those links, and I shall be able to prove this to you. On the night of the fire, a friend had been spending the evening with me, and did not leave me till past eleven o'clock, and I and my wife retired about twelve, leaving our servant to follow. My house was then occupied by myself, my wife, and servant, and my lodger's (who was a Jew) family of four persons, and their servant. On that night the Jew's servant, his sister, and grandmother, slept upon the first-floor, my wife and myself on the second-floor, and my own servant in the back attic. Between one and two o'clock in the morning, a fire broke out in the basement-story, in a closet under the kitchen-stairs, and belonging to the Jews; this fire was discovered, before it had made any progress, by Lazarus, who slept in that part of the house, the very furthest removed from the fire - he alarmed my servant, who awoke my wife and me; the whole house was presently alarmed, and we went down stairs - the fire was extinquished without any difficulty, and was discovered to be occasioned by a link placed in the closet and lighted; Furzeman, the officer, affirmed that he could trace droppings of the link along the passage, from the fire-place, in the Jew's kitchen, to the closet; the Jew's servant had come down-stairs nearly dressed, and had been, a few months ago, suspected of setting on fire a table in the kitchen; this drew suspicion on her; her master, not I, therefore gave her in charge on suspicion of having committed the fire; and she was taken to the watch-house. My wife and servant had sought refuge at the George and Blue Boar inn, and remained there; the rest of the night passed over quietly. - On Saturday morning, Lazarus and myself, and, I believe, most of the persons in the house, attended at Marlborough-street Police-office, on the examination of the Jew's servant. Her master stated his suspicion that she had set fire to the house, and she was remanded for further examination on the following Wednesday, when there did not appear sufficient evidence to warrant her committal on that charge, as the fire had been discovered in time to prevent any serious damage. I did not attach any great weight to it; and certainly thought, with reluctance, of taking the life of an ignorant girl for the crime. I call your attention to the fact that immediately afterwards I wrote to the British Fire-office, in which I am insured, acquainting them with the fire, and the day appointed for the re-examination of the servant of Lazarus, that their solicitor might attend and inquire into the matter. Between the committal of the servant, on the Saturday, and her re-examination, on the following Wednesday, not the least extraordinary circumstance of this mysterious affair was the receipt of two anonymous threatening letters, one by Lazarus and another by myself, apparently by some friend of the girl, accusing Lazarus of knowing all about the fire; the girl has since strongly denied all knowledge of these letters or the writer; they were placed in Furzeman's hand, I believe he still has them; the discovery of the place where the links were bought, by which the fire is said to be communicated, had been an object to all; and on the following Thursday, Lazarus and another Jew, his friend, one Davis, called at my house, and told me they had discovered where the links were bought, and that they were purchased by a man in a grey coat, and with a blue bag. I was glad to hear of the discovery, and they wished me to call with them on Furzeman to consult what was to be done - I was too busy then, but told them I would go on the following day; the next day I went with them to Furzeman's; we saw him, but he was going to Marlborough-street, and said he would go with us to the oilman, at four o'clock. I asked him who the oilman was, who had sold the links, for I did not then know. Furzeman and Davis said. Bradford. I then returned home; the same day a friend, who called upon me, advised me to go and see Bradford - I went with him - he happened to be out - when we got there, we saw his shop-boy, Thomas Dodwell; I told him, who I was, and inquired if he knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260051"></xptr>the sort of person to whom he sold the links, and the day; the boy said it was a tall young man, about my stature, as far as he could recollect, and dressed in a pepper-and-salt morning-coat, and had a blue bag with him, into which he put the links; but his master had cut down the links, and would know better about them - I and my friend then left. On the following day, Saturday, before four o'clock in the afternoon, the Jew, Davis, called upon me to go to Bradford's - I and my wife went with Davis, and presently we met Lazarus and another Jew - we proceeded towards Bradford's, and I, having my wife with me, objected to go to Furzeman's, but agreed to meet him at Bradford's, which I did in five minutes afterwards - Bradford was questioned, and said he sold two links to a man between eleven and twelve o'clock the preceding day, Friday, and being asked whether he could recollect the person to whom he sold the links, he said, he could not exactly tell, he was more like me than Lazarus, but that he had his face towards the door, and he (Bradford) had only a side view of him - I told them then, I was not out the whole of the day, and could prove it - I was asked by one of the Jews to go home and put on my grey coat, and bring my blue bag with me; I refused, and said, I would not make a puppet-show of myself - we then left - and by the advice of my solicitor, I offered first, two, and afterwards five guineas, to the person who purchased the links of Bradford to come forward, but no one ever appeared; and I afterwards, time after time, pressed at Marlborough-street-office for inquiry and examination; repeated my communication to the Fire-office, and also to that in which the house was insured, and gave to the parish board all the information they asked for. But even without this, mark how every thing tells against my having purchased the links, and how completely I refute the charge - Bradford's, although above half a mile from my house, is within a hundred yards of the house where I was born, and had passed the greater part of my life, and not three hundred yards from the house where I was apprenticed, where I was known to almost every one - and it is singular, that I was not known to Bradford himself - and where my being seen buying these links, would have called forth half a dozen questions at once; but leaving out these improbabilities, it happened I was not out of my own house on the day the links were bought - and particular circumstances make both my servant and shop-boy recollect this, and enable them to be quite positive of my not having been out long after the time the links were hought. - Besides all this, you are to add the absence of all motives on my part; the only one alleged by my prosecutors, is the amount of my insurance - but this motive has been very much misrepresented - the actual value of all my property on the premises, considerably exceeded 2,000l., although that is not equal to the amount of my insurance, and I could not have proved a greater loss, even if I had ventured to claim it - I wish also to draw your attention to this, that it is now three months ago since this fire took place - the purchase of the links was known within a week afterwards, and every fact now urged against me was then known - not the slightest charge, however, was made against me, and a Session at which I might have been tried, has passed. - I do not know the author of the fire - my suspicions I confine in my own breast - but I hope I have proved to you my innocence of the crime I am charged with, and the consciousness of this enables me to wait your verdict without fear - I have been brief in my defence - but I look forward with humble confidence to the result.</p>

            . I was in Mr. White's service in August last, as shop-boy. About a week before the fire I took a ladder up-stairs, to get a piece of petrified wood from the loft, and I left it up there; I asked master whether I should leave it or bring it down - he told me to do just as I liked, and I left it - it had been made no use of before, to my knowledge: we have steps and another ladder in the shop, to reach the books with; I left the trapdoor open, but not the one which leads from the loft to the roof; I did not sleep in the house when this fire happened. On the morning before the fire my master came down stairs, from bed, about twelve o'clock in the day - I asked if he knew what the time was - he said, "About ten, I believe;" I said, No, it was twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he go then? A. I do not recollect; I do not think he was out all day, but am not positive. When I told him it was twelve o'clock he went into the parlour to breakfast; I saw him again about half-past one - he came from the parlour, and had been there all the time - I am sure of that; I had not been into the parlour to him, but can see from the shop into the parlour, and saw him there all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came into the shop did he go out of the door or stay in the shop? A. I think he staid in the shop - he did not go into the street that I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he out long enough to walk half-a-mile and back? A. I cannot say, but in my own mind he was not out at all.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. This is a long time ago - when were you first desired to remember the time when your master got up on the day before the fire? I cannot tell - he sometimes takes out a blue bag to carry books in.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he take the bag out that morning? A. I am not positive - it is kept in a drawer by the side of the counter; it was not taken out of the drawer that morning. I told my mother that night how late master had got up.</p>

            . I mended a morning coat for the prisoner - I fetched it on the 20th of September, but did not do it till next day; I half-sleeved it, and covered the buttons, but did not make any alteration in the length of it; this is it (looking at it).</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Hold it up, and see if any alterations have been made in the length since you worked on it? A. Not that I know of - I did not observe the length.</p>

            . I am secretary to the British Fire Insurance-office. Immediately after the 5th of August. I received this communication from the prisoner respecting the fire - it is dated, Monday, the 7th of August, and signed C. T. White - I laid it before the Board of Directors, but nothing whatever was done about it; the Directors assigned no reason why they sent nobody; the prisoner called afterwards to know if it had been received.(The letter was here read, as follows.)</p>
               <p>265, High Holborn.</p>
               <p>SIR, - Ibeg leave to call to your recollection the narrow es<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260052"></xptr>cape of my house and property insured in your office, in March last, when considerable suspicion rested on Margaret Drew, the female-servant of my lodger, as the cause- not with standing this, Mr. Lazarus continued her in his service till now; and on the 5th of August the lower part of my house was discovered again to be on fire, and under circumstances evidently the result of design; fortunately it was got under without serious damage; but in consequence of this, Drew, on Saturday, was examined at Marlborough-street, where the Magistrate thought there was not sufficient evidence to warrant her commitment, but remanded her till Wednesday next, at twelve o'clock - at my suggestion Lazarus gave her in charge. I intend to attend the examination on Wednesday, and give you this information, that you may send and inspect the premises in the meantime, and, if you think proper, attend the examination on the part of the office.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's attorney. I attended with him at Marlborough-street, on the second examination of Lazarus's servant - the magistrate went into the examination, and to the best of my recollection the remark he made was, "Will you, Mr. White, prosecute the girl?" he said, "My landlord wishes me to do so, but as she is Mr. Lazarus' servant, he ought to do it." The prosecution was declined - I know he circulated some bills about the links; this is one of them - (read)</p>
               <p>Links. - Two guineas reward: Whereas, on Friday, the 4th of August, between eleven and one o'clock in the day time, a man bought two links at the shop of Mr. Bradford, at Broad-street, St. Giles - this is to give notice, if such person will come forward to the office of Mr. Blunt, solicitor, Union Court, he shall receive the above reward.</p>
               <p>GODFREY LAZARUS re-examined. We have a feast of Tabernacles, as well as Passover; the things in the cupboard were never used except at the Passover.</p>

In May last I was engaged in watching a case in reference to the Com Exchange—Farrow attracted my attention—I saw Oliver and Poulden in his company several times previous, but on 28th and 30th I made a note of it—on 28th May I saw Farrow in Mark Lane—I followed him by way of Great Tower Street to Trinity Square,</p>

               <p>to the Old George public-house—Farrow put the nose-hag on his pony and went in the public-house—Oliver and Poulden then came up, and put two cans of oil each into the pony-cart, and covered them up—they carried one in front and one in a basket—they then went into the public-house, and remained ten minutes, and then came to the door with Farrow and walked away—Farrow went to the pony and trap and drove away—on 30th I saw Farrow at the Corn Exchange—I followed him to the Old George public-house—he gave his pony some water and went in—I saw Oliver and Poulden each with two large cans and a small one—they came from Tower Hill, put the cans into the cart, went into the public-house, and remained seven or eight minutes—they came out with Farrow and went away, and he went away too—I finished my Corn Exchange matter, and on 20th June I went to Mark Lane and saw Farrow unloading a cart—Inspector Leman followed him—he went away from Tower Hill—I saw Oliver and Poulden in Postern Row, and go through Trinity Square to the Old Cheshire Cheese in Crutched Friars—Farrow's cart was outside—they each put two cans into the cart, went into the public-house, remained five or six minutes, and came out with Farrow, who drove towards the Minories—we followed Oliver and Poulden to different police-stations—from inquiries I made (not at those places) I went to Messrs. Macqueen and Co.—on 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi> June I watched Nunn and Co.'s premises—I saw Oliver and Poulden come out and take oil to different police-stations—on June 24th, about 8.20 am., I saw Oliver and Poulden each carrying two cans of oil—they went to the Old George, Trinity Square, and waited there twenty-five minutes, and then went on to the Royal Exchange, took an omnibus, and went on to Bethnal Green Road—they got down and took the cans into Farrow's shop—after a time they came out without the cans—Farrow came to the shop door with them—they went towards the City—on 25th June I saw them about the same hour—Oliver was carrying two cans—he went to the Nag's Head, Postern Row, Tower Hill—he then went to the Old Cheshire Cheese, and then to the Old George public-house—he was there joined by Poulden, who Leman had been watching—both had cans—they took a tram car to Bethnal Green Road—I followed them—they went into Farrow's shop and came out without their cans—on June 27, about the same hour, I saw Oliver leave the warehouse with two cans, and ultimately go to the Old George public-house—Farrow and his cart were outside—Oliver spoke to him—during the conversation Oliver put the two cans into the cart—Farrow covered them up and both went into the public-house—shortly afterwards Poulden passed by and went towards the Old Cheshire Cheese—Farrow and Oliver came out of the public-house—Farrow got into his cart and drove towards St. Katherine's Docks—he stopped his cart in East Smithfield opposite the docks—on Friday, June <hi rend="italic">28</hi>, I saw Poulden leave the warehouse with two cans—he went to the Nag's Head, Tower Hill—Oliver came up with two cans—they took a tram to Farrow's place—I fol<lb></lb>lowed them into the shop and bought a pennyworth of blacking—the prisoners were five or six yards from the centre of the counter, where I stood—Oliver was pouring the contents of a can similar to these into a large can—Poulden looked on—I went outside—I saw Oliver and Poulden come out carrying the cans in such a way that I should say they were empty—on July 2 I again watched the premises of Nunn and Co,—I saw Oliver and Poulden come out in the morning—Oliver went to Trinity Square, and</p>

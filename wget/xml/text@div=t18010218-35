             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Addison; In consequence of having lost hay, I placed myself in Mr. Addison's garden close to his hay-stack, and about one o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoner at the bar; and a person unknown, come to the hay-stack; I saw the prisoner put some loose hay from the stack into a sack or bag; the person unknown then went away with it; the prisoner took up a truss of hay from the bottom of the rick; that truss had been placed there and marked; it was new hay; he then went off with it; I pursued and took him with it on his head, at the distance of about thirty yards from the rick yard.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you at all lose sight of him? - A. Yes; while I was going round the hay-stack, that was all; I seized the prisoner and said, what, I have got you at last; upon which he threw down the truss of hay and put his hands in his great coat pockets; I told him to take them out or I would cut them; I then made him take up the truss of hay and carry it to a pair of high yard gates which opened from the yard; I got over the gates to unfasten them; the prisoner then threw down the truss of hay and ton away; I pursued and retook him, at the distance of about forty yards from the gates, and made him come back; I desired him to take up the truss of hay and carry it into the high road, which he would not do; I then threatened to cut him unless he went into the high road, which threats I repeated three or four times to no effect; I was under the necessiry then of cutting him on the leg with a sword; after this the prisoner went with me, and I put him into the custody of the watchman of the night; I then returned to the yard gates where the truss of hay was; I took it to the accompting-house, and there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180023"></xptr>it has been ever since; he acknowledged before the Magistrate that he had taken the hay for his horses; he keeps a cook's-shop at Highgate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Did he not tell you that the man who ran away had told him that he was a servant of your's, and had desired him to take it? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you weigh this hay? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>(To Mr. Addison). Q. Do you know what this hay weighed? - A. No; a truss ought to weigh 56lb.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who had known him fourteen years, and gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010218-35-verdict191" type="verdictDescription">

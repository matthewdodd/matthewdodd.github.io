Longman's—while waiting there I was standing by the side of the van—I saw the two prisoners there together against the tail of the van, and afterwards I saw Willbud with a parcel on his shoulder—I asked him where he was going with it—he said the other prisoner gave it to him to carry, he was about half a dozen yards from the van—Hayter went round another van and got away—I found a constable near, to whom I gave Wilbud in charge—I am quite sure the prisoners are the two men.</p>

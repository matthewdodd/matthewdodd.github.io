                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, and have one partner—my place of business is No. 36, Crntched Friars—I have had some dealings with the prisoner. On the 12th of November, about one o'clock, he came to my counting-house—he said be came to settle the purchase of the wine, and to pay the balance—there was a balance of I think 391<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or something of that sort to pay on the purchase of some wines—the original amount was 691<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid by cheque ori<lb></lb>ginally, and wine to the value of 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. delivered—Mr. Boyn, our clerk, showed him into my room, and at the same time brought me the delivery orders which had been already signed, with the date, I believe, of the ori<lb></lb>ginal purchase, and reminded me in the prisoner's presence that it was a cash, or ready-money transaction—after a little conversation had passed, my clerk brought me in a little slip Of paper, showing how much the balance was, and said as it was a cash transaction interest would be charged—the prisoner looked at the paper and said that he thought there would be a discount for ready money, to which I said, "Why it is a cash transaction, and consequently there is no discount"—these are the two delivery orders which my clerk brought in—I said, it being a cash transaction I should have the money on the delivery orders, but previous to this, when he paid the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he had told us that these wines had been bought for a party in the country who had given this 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and not being able to come forward with the rest, was the reason he had not paid the balance at this time—he said the party in the country had sent orders to town to the house of Messrs. John Mitchell to pay it—I did not know that house at that time—he said they lived in Broad-street, and it was a very respectable house—his words were, "You will find it is all right, the order has come to Messrs. John Mitchell and Co., a very respectable house in Broad-street"—I then said if he would allow me I would send one of my clerks with the delivery orders to receive the money at John Mitchell and Co.'s—he said that would not look well, it would hurt his character, and it would appear as if he was not trusted—I said, but if I sent anybody I would send him in his name, not send him with him, but with the delivery order, so that his credit should not be affected—he said he had promised to be with the parties himself, personally to deliver the orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> To whom? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To those who were to pay—I understood John Mitchell and Co.—I cannot exactly say whether he said that at the moment, but he had mentioned John Mitchell and Co. before, and that the purchasers were in the country—he said he had promised to be with the parties who had the orders to pay—he did not say the purchasers were in the country, but that the house was in the country—a person estab<lb></lb>lished out of town.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there anything to exclude the parties In the country having agents in town on the spot, at the docks for instance, notwithstanding the fact that some other house would be the parties to pay? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not meant so, at least I did not so understand it—when I proposed to send my clerk with the delivery orders I proposed sending him to Messrs. John Mitchell's, and after I proposed that, he said he had promised to go to the</p>

               <p>parties himself with the delivery orders, and would prefer taking them personally—I then said to him, "Well then, it is understood that you will either bring me back the money, or these orders"—he assented to that—he said, "Yes, sir"—we were speaking in Portuguese.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you upon that deliver the orders to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I remained at my office till nearly five o'clock that day—I sent, I believe, once after him, in the course of the day, about one o'clock—I went on Change and returned to my counting-house—I sent Mr. Boyn for him, and he came with Mr. Boyn, at very near five—he said Messrs. John Mitchell not understanding much about Dock business, preferred having, instead of the delivery orders, the warrants made out for the wines, that they had gone to the Dock to get them made out, but as that took some time, they would not be ready till the next morning (Saturday.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Messrs. Mitchells' name first mentioned on that day, or had it been mentioned in the original transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was first mentioned on that day—I always supposed the wines had been bought by some third party—I thought Messrs. Mitchell were only agents to pay, not the purchaser of the wines—I made the prisoner promise that he would come, either with the bonds or money, the following day—he did not come next day, or at all—and from information I received I applied at the Mansion-house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does not a sale for cash, mean that the money is either to be paid at the time, or within a few days after? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on the credit you give to the parties—I have dealt with the prisoner for small amounts, on the understanding that he was to have the delivery orders, and to pay me shortly afterwards—that is the custom in the wine trade when you trust the parties—the original bargain was made with my partner, who is now in Spain—I was not present at that time—a great deal of this conversation passed in the Portuguese language.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was no part of his proposition to bring you the war<lb></lb>rants or the money, but a suggestion of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a promise, it was my suggestion at first—a condition put on the contract.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you are over-paid for the wine which he has actually got in his possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not now—I was overpaid—the wines are yet in the Docks, deliverable to the bearer of the warrants—I parted with the orders, in the belief that there was an order from the person who had bought the wine to pay the balance—the respectability of the house of Mitchell and Co. was partly an ingredient in my consenting to his pro<lb></lb>posal, at least the naming of a house in Broad-street was—I did not at the moment remember whether I knew that house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you understand that he must actually have got rid of the delivery-orders first, or the warrants afterwards, before he could be in cash to complete the bargain of paying you the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That he was to deliver them to some one who was to pay for them—if they did not furnish</p>

               <p>him with the money, he was to bring back the warrants—it was in the al<lb></lb>ternative—if the party did not pay, he was to return the delivery-orders; if the party paid, he was to bring me the money—if Mitchell and Co. had been the agents, they would have given him a cheque for the amount—I did not expect to see the delivery-orders again if he had brought me the money—the only way he had of turning the delivery-orders into money was by parting with them to some one else—I did not suppose he was going to pay me out of his own funds, but out of the funds of a customer of his—I did not suppose the party would give the money till he had the vouch<lb></lb>ers for the goods—I supposed the party wanted to see either the delivery-orders or the warrants, and to pay for them; that is why I offered to send my—clerk, because I could not suppose for a moment that the third party would deliver the money to him before he produced the value of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that box, and tell me whether that is the box - A. It is; I saw Mrs. French bringing the box up the street in her arms when I returned home.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up Whitechapel, it was a very windy day, I had my little girl in my arms; my little girl's bonnet bew off her head, a woman behind me came and picked it up, she said it was very cold; I said it was; we came into discourse, she asked me whether I would go into a public house and have share of a pint of beer with her, she told me that her husband's tools were in danger of being taken by the landlord for rent, she said if I would go with her and carry the box, she would give me a shilling; I left my little girl at an acquaintances of mine. I went with her to the house I was to carry the box to, King alley, Red Lion street; she went right into the house, I believe she must have been acquainted with the house, or else she could not have gone so perfectly in the house; she brought the box down, I went no further in the house than the door; she gave me the box, I was taking it along, I put it down on a step, a gentlewoman came up to me whom I did not know, nor should I know her again; she said where are you going to take that box; I said a gentlewoman gave it me, she is in the house now; she took the box from me; I went back with her, but I saw no person.</p>

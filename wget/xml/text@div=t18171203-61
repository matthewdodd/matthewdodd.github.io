On the 24th of November I went out at nine o'clock in the morning, and returned at twelve. I had left no person in the house but my lodgers. I went up stairs, and found the door of my upper room had been opened, apparently with a key-it was fastened with a padlock. I went down to my other room, and as I went down stairs I saw the prisoner come out of the room(which had been broken open), with a bundle. I called out, "Who is there?" he made no answer. I pursued him down stairs. He threw the bundle down in the passage. I called out, Stop thief! - He was stopped immediately; I collared him - I never lost sight of him. I brought him back to my passage, and asked him how he could think of robbing me? He said, "There is your things, and what more do you want?" I gave him in charge to Turner. The bundle contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

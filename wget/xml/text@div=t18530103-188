                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at No. 2, Princes-street, Whitechapel, the prisoner is my own brother; I would not wish to hurt him. On Wednesday night, 8th Dec., I was seated at home with my wife, by the fire, about half past 10 o'clock, my wife had her shoes and stockings off: in comes my mother, and she said, "Alfred, your brother wants you;" I said, "I am not going out to-night"—my brother came in and said, "What have you got to talk about me?"—my wife said, "Nothing <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—he made no more ado but <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and struck her on the nose, and it was cut—I cannot say whether he had anything in his hand, but it was cut open and bleeding—I was in the passage when the blow was struck, and my mother and my brother's wife were holding me, preventing me from getting to my wife—I tried to get to her, and I at last got away and went to my wife's assistance; and during the time I was making the way to my wife, I received a blow on the forehead from my brother—I did not fall but I staggered; took my brother by the handkerchief and held him, and Mr. Greenwood held him, a gentleman who lived upstairs—I did not at any time see a knife in the prisoner's hand—before this was done, I had not given him any provocation at all—I was sitting quietly by the fire with my wife—the prisoner might have had a little drop, but he did not seem as if he had—we had had two pints of half and half, and a quartern of gin and cloves—he appeared a little the worse—I went to Mr. Mears, and had my wound dressed—it is now nicely, and well, thank God for it.</p>

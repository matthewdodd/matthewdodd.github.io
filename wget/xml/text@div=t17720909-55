On July the 5th, between half after eleven at night and three in the morning, my house was broke open. I went to bed before 12 o'clock; I fastened the doors myself: about four in the morning one of the neighbours called out in the street, that my house was robbed and broke open; a lodger in the house got up and called me; I found the house broke open, and missed in the bar all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) the bar window was broke open; the rail the shutters slide on was cut on the outside, and then the shutters fell down. I found the marks of three chissels which had been used to force the window, one large, another smaller, and the other smaller than that; there were two panes of glass in the window broke, and I suppose day light came on, or they would have taken all the things I had there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day light when you got up?</p>
               <p>Mahoney. Yes. I went to Justice Sherwood and laid an information of the robbery, and his men found them out about a fortnight after, and the Justice sent for me; a China bowl was there produced which I knew to be my property.</p>

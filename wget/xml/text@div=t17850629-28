               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He is a labouring man, and has done business for us frequently , I never intrusted him with the key, Mr. Anderson kept the key; when I saw the prisoner at the Compter , I believe somebody told him it would be better for him to confess.</p>

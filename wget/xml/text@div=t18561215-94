                  </hi>. I was clerk to the prisoner. When parcels were sent into the country I used simply to enter them in the parcels book, under his directions—in the expenses book of 3rd June, here is an entry, in the prisoner's writing, of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., paid in respect of carriage of thirteen parcels to the country—the entry in the parcels book is identical—on 7th June, here is an entry, in the prisoner's writing, of 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for four parcels—this entry in the parcels book is identical—in the expenses book, here is an entry, on 11th June, of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for thirteen parcels; the cor<lb></lb>responding date in the expenses book of that date is precisely the same—it was the prisoner's habit, on returning from the booking office, on each occa<lb></lb>sion, to enter in the book the amount paid—these particular entries are in his writing; others are in mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you in the habit of receiving money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, subscriptions of members—the amounts were entered in the two books last produced, in the last case—I very seldom took money to the bankers—I am in the employ of the society still—I am not in the same situation as the prisoner was—I get 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day—an assistant clerk is employed there now—the sums received were disbursed by Mr. Ruffey, and by me, on his account, and the balance was paid into the bank—this entry of 3rd June in the rough expenses book is Mr. Euffey's entry—that contains the names of the places to which the parcels are sent—I am quite sure that entry is Mr. Ruffey's writing—in going through the books I have found several other cases in which there has been a charge for making up, porterage, and carriage of parcels, and which has been allowed to Mr. Ruffey—the parcels were made up with brown paper; they had to be packed and sealed, and carried to different booking offices, for various places in the country—I have myself made entries by the prisoner's direction for making up, porterage, and car<lb></lb>riage of parcels—he said that he claimed 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for the parcels—he told me so—it does not appear to have been a uniform claim according to this—he said he had charged 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, that was his extra charge—it was not constantly the case that there were two parcels contained in one, it would occasionally happen—when it does occur it is mentioned in the book—I cannot tell from memory whether these parcels did or did not contain two of three each, but it is usual to put in the names of the places to which they had to go—there is a branch assurance society which the prisoner also had to manage as secretary, and to which he was in the habit of sending many parcels—sometimes the agents for the society also acted as agents for the life assurance branch—I cannot say the exact time that I knew of this charge for making up parcels—I imagine there has been a charge of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. extra made for parcels during the three years I have been there—this book did not go before the auditors—it is called the casual expenses book—it was kept in the office, anybody could see it—I know from what the prisoner told me that he made this extra charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know that on 3rd June he had charged more than he had actually paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know what amount was charged—there was a porter paid by the society for the purpose of taking out the par<lb></lb>cels—the porter's salary was charged by the prisoner against the society; it was 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—it was before my time that the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week was given to the prisoner for extra services—I can find the minute of it in the books—it was a proposition of the delegates from the country—I have seen these books in the prisoner's possession, and have seen him referring to them—this</p>

               <p>book would be in his custody as secretary—the proposition is dated March 7th, 1851, and the resolution upon it is dated 13th April, 1851—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—I never knew that his claim for porterage was allowed by the society—I never heard it mentioned in the presence of any of the directors—the book that would go before the auditors shows the total of each week's expenses—the office to which these parcels would go is more than half a mile from the St. Pancras Athenæum—he would occasionally pay for the parcels out of his own pocket, and at times he would have it from me, from the society's box, which was kept in the office, tinder his desk and mine—it was locked—I held the key, as his servant.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

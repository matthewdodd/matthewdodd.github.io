                  </hi>. I have been in the employ of the Mint authorities twenty-seven, years—from information I received I went on 30th No<lb></lb>vember to 1, Bloomsbury Court, Holborn, accompanied by inspectors Brannan, Garfort, Fife, and other officers—we waited till the street-door was open, and then went up to the third floor, which consists of one room—the door was forced open with a sledge-hammer by Inspector Bran<lb></lb>nan—we did not knock first—when we got in Vine was sitting at a table near the fire in his shirt sleeves with a florin let into a stick in his hand, and he was filing it—there was a clear bright fire—the filing is to take the loose edge of the coin—Sweet was sitting at another table under the window with a bad florin or half-crown in her hand, paring the loose edges with a pair of scissors—on our entering, Vine threw down the stick and the florin and the file, took up an open knife and made a thrust at Inspector Brannan—I had a stick in my hand, and pushed bim back with great force on to a bed, or he would have thrust the knife into his body—Sweet had some coin in her lap—she stood up and threw it down—122 florins, 20 half-crowns, and 164 shillings were found near where she stood, also some imitation gold napoleons, and thirteen half-france—a saucepan was on the fire containing 10lbs. of metal in a state of fusion—I said to Vine, "<hi rend="italic">Well, Jack</hi>, I need not tell you who I am; we came here with a search warrant signed by the Magistrate at Bow Street—he said, "All right, Mr. Brannan, I will acknowledge to it all; she only came here last night for the first time," alluding to Sweet—I knew that to be incorrect—I found a galvanic battery on a bench, and some sulphate of copper, zinc acid, plaster of Paris, and an iron spoon, which are all things used in coining—Inspector Garforth handed me nine double moulds, some of them charged with hot metal; they are for making half-crowns and shillings—here is an article to perfect the</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Mint—I have examined the things produced; here is everything necessary for coining on a very large scale—here is a sovereign mould and two counterfeit sovereigns from it; a twenty franc mould and two coins from it; a double sovereign mould and thirteen coins from it; a half-crown mould and twenty coins from it; a florin mould and 122 coins from it; a double shilling mould and 162 coins made from it—among the good money are the patterns which were used for making those moulds—they are very highly finished and very well done—the milling where the surplus metal comes off the get is better than I have ever seen—one of the moulds represents the obverse side of a half-crown.</p>

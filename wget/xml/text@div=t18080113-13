               <p>Q. Did you ever see your truss again. - A. Yes, the same day, I saw it before the magistrate, when the prisoner was in custody.</p>

Yes, I took it in that morning; I put it by the side of the waggon, to be loaded with the rest of the goods; I saw the prisoner in the yard while the goods were laying by the side of the waggon; I did not see him do any thing; in consequence of information, I went to the Castle and Falcon, there I saw the prisoner with the truss in custody of Hawkins the officer; I asked the prisoner how he came by the truss, he said he was coming down Carthusian-street, some man asked him if he would carry the parcel, he would give him a shilling to carry it to Wood-street; I am positive the parcel belonged to the Bedford waggon; I recollect booking it.</p>

            . I am a carman to Messrs. Rainsdon in Red Lion yard. On the 2nd of January, when this parcel was taken, I was coming up the yard to fetch a truss of straw, to pack a gentleman's furniture in my cart; I saw the prisoner coming down the yard with the truss on his shoulder, running from where the waggon stood.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the waggon, when you saw him with this truss. - A. About twenty yards from the waggon when I first saw him; and when I first saw him he was running; as soon as he saw me, he stopped running, and walked the rest part of the yard till he come to the gate; then he turned round to see if I followed him, and ran down Long-lane into Cloth-fair; I followed him; when I first met him in the Red Lion yard, the direction on the parcel was outermost; in Cloth-fair he shifted it next to his shoulder, so as nobody could see it; he came into Aldersgate-street, I followed him; when the prisoner came to Little Britain he made a bit of a stop, looked to see if there were any body after him, and then run as fast as he could, till he come into St. Ann's-lane; I collared him in St. Ann's-lane; I said you are a pretty rascal are not you, this property is not yours; he throwed the truss off his shoulder, said let me go, my master does not live far off; I said you shall not go from me; I took him and the truss into the Castle and Falcon, and had him secured; the truss has been in the constable's hands ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You have been drinking a little to night. - A. No, I have not been drinking to night; I have had only one pint since dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before. - A. No, not till I saw him in Red Lion yard, and then my eyes were never off him till I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted all the time you saw him his back was towards you. - A. No, he turned round and went on again; I saw his face at the Red Lion yard, when he passed me, and I saw his face in St. Ann's-lane; I can swear that is the lad.</p>
               <p>Jury. What was the weight of the truss.</p>
               <p>Mr. Forster. Better than a quarter of a hundred.</p>

            . I am a constable, I heard an uproar; I came up to the prisoner at the Castle and Falcon gate; I took him into the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Bignel there. - A. He was, he charged the prisoner with stealing the truss from the Red Lion gateway; I asked the prisoner how he came by it, he told me directly that a man had given it him to carry; he was to carry it to the corner of Wood-street, he said he thought he should know the man again; he was a decent man, he was to have a shilling for carrying it; I had a knowledge of the lad, not in any bad way; he is an apprentice to a silversmith in St. Ann's-lane; I sent to his master and for the book-keeper; he came down with the waggoner; we proceeded then to Guildhall; that is all I know.</p>

               <p>Court. Can you take upon yourself to swear whether it was the prisoner or Parker? - The prisoner at the bar I am sure.</p>
               <p>Because at first you expressed some doubt whether it was the prisoner or Parker? - I am almost sure, I can take upon me to swear it was him.</p>
               <p>But do not stretch? - I am sure, it was him; the things in the room appeared to be filled for coining lately, but were shook out.</p>
               <p>Court. The sand was not in the flask when you found it? - No, there was a great deal about it, but it was knocked out; there were 200 people, and the alley was full.</p>

               <p>I went to this house in Fryer's Alley, Seasons got in, and I went up stairs, and heard some people cry out that were in the next house; I ran up stairs immediately and seized upon Parker, I brought him down, and then we brought the other down; then they desired to go up into the room for their cloaths.</p>
               <p>Into what room? - Into the room where we found the implements.</p>
               <p>Who desired? - Both of them.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner desired? - Yes, I had a pair of shoes and buckles in my hand, and I put them there purposely, and Parker asked for his shoes and hat, and then there was a stick that Parker said was his.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you first see the prisoner? - I believe it was in a two pair of stairs room in the next house.</p>

               <p>Where did they come from? - Out of the next house; I found the metal in the room where the prisoner requested to go up.</p>
               <p>Who requested? the prisoner? - Both of them.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He wanted to go up stairs for something; the other particularly wanted his hat and shoes; I do not know what the prisoner wanted to go up for; he said he was in the house.</p>
               <p>Who said he was in the house? - The prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Court. What did the prisoner tell you he was in that house? - He said he was afraid of a press gang when the door was knocked at first.</p>
               <p>Court. What did the prisoner say so? - Yes, my Lord, and before the magistrate he said so openly.</p>
               <p>Who was the magistrate? - Mr. Justice Blackborow.</p>
               <p>Jury. He says that the prisoner at the bar acknowledged he came out of that house; what house? - The house where we found these things, up in the two pair of stairs, he said he came there to see a person, and when we were knocking at the door to get the door open, he thought it was a press gang.</p>
               <p>Did he say so when you first took him? No.</p>
               <p>Did he claim any thing in the room as his property? - No, I do not remember he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Parker said he wanted to go up for his shoes and hat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say? - I cannot say that he particularly wanted to go up so much as the other did; I cannot rightly recollect in the hurry of getting in.</p>
               <p>This man you say asked to go up stairs, what did he say? - The other asked for his hat and shoes, I do not recollect that this man asked for any thing.</p>
               <p>What did he want to go up stairs for? I do not know indeed.</p>
               <p>Court. In what words did the prisoner ask to go up stairs? - I believe it was the other that particularly asked to go up.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did this man at the bar ask to go up stairs.</p>

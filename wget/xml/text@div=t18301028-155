I let lodgings, but never to seamen; the prisoner was very anxious to have a respectable lodging, and I took him in on the 28th of September - he was a stranger; he said he wanted board and lodging, and had just arrived from a long voyage on the South Seas, by the George, which laid in the City-canal; I agreed to take him - this was on Tuesday; he brought nothing with him - he said his linen was all dirty on board, and begged I would accommodate him with some clean shirts - he asked me to recommend him a person, who had a cart, to fetch his things from the ship; he slept at my house on the 28th, got up at seven o'clock in the morning, and breakfasted - he had borrowed 8s. 6d. the day before; he went out about nine o'clock, and said he was going down to the ship to order his things up - I did not see him again till the Saturday following, when he was in custody: I have not the least doubt of his person - my niece missed her watch from a case in the front parlour on the Tuesday, and on the Wednesday I missed mine from the kitchen - the seals and every thing were taken; I have seen them both since.</p>

               <p>EMMA COOPER.

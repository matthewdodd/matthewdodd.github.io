                  </hi>. I keep the Crown and Anchor, in Great Guildford-street, Southwark. The prisoner was in my employment for about eight months—it was his duty to take out beer to customers, to receive money, and account for it to me when he came back—Richard Baldwin and Thomas Hickson are customers of mine—the prisoner did not account to me for 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Baldwin, or 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Hickson on 4th Jan.</p>

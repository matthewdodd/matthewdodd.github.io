            . My husband is a labourer, and lives at Pinner. On the 12th of March, about eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner at Pinner, coming in a direction from Moores' house - he was coming across Mr. Hill's field, and walking quite fast; he was about a quarter of a mile from Moores'; my landlady was with me: we made some observation about the prisoner, which he must have heard; I turned round, and said, "Lord, there is

            . I am a constable of Aylesbury. I saw a paragraph in the New Hue and Cry on the 21st of March, stating this robbery, and that John Short was suspected. I went to the pawnbroker's to make inquiry, and found nothing; I went from there to where the prisoner had lodged for a few days that week - I had seen him near the house on the morning of that day myself, and several times in the course of the week, and while I was in the house, speaking to the landlady, the pawnbroker's boy fetched me; I went to the pawnbroker's, and found the prisoner there, offering a watch in pawn: the shopman produced it in his presence, and said he had come to pawn it; the prisoner said nothing to that - I said to him, "That is Mr. Moores' watch;" he said, "No, it is not - it is my own;" I said, "Where did you get it?" he said he bought it in London; I asked in what street; he said he did not know: I asked what number, and he did not know; I took him to my own house, stripped him, and on his person found this shirt, with the initials W. M. on it; I secured him.</p>

About the end of November, a person came to my shop, who I believe to be the prisoner, he bought one ounce of black tea, one ounce of green, and half a pound of sugar, which came to 1 s. 6 d.; he was served, and paid me a 1 l. bank note. I asked him for his address? He said Mr. Marchant, Ingram-court, Fenchurch-street, which I wrote on the note, and gave him change - (looks at one) - this is it. I paid it to my bankers, and it was returned to me two days after as forged. I went to Mr. Marchant's, and he showed me his lads, but I could not discover any of them to be the boy who brought me the note.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened on the 12th of December - A. About three o'clock in the afternoon the prisoner came to the shop - I am certain it was him. As soon as he entered the threshold of my door, the impression upon my mind was, that he was the boy who had given me a forged note a fortnight before, which I have spoken of. I thought I would see what he wanted, and if he paid me a note, I would notice him. He asked for two ounces of 8 s. black tea, and one pound of 9 d. sugar; I served him - it came to 1 s. 9 d.; he then presented me a 1 l. bank note. I took my pen, and said,</p>
               <p>"Now my lad, what name shall I put on here?" He said Mr. Watson, No. 5, Bell-yard, Gracechurch-street. I then took my hat, took hold of his hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"I know you are telling me a great falsehood, for a fortnight before you brought me one of a different address, and now my man, you and I will go to Bell-yard together." I went to Bell-yard with him, the house that is called No. 5, having no number on it, there was a difficulty in finding it - it was the fifth house, and went in the direction as they were marked - it is the Excise Permit Office. When we got opposite to it, I said, we have passed No. 5, the prisoner said No, it is further on, and took me into the George and Vulture Tavern, George-yard, Lombard-street - Bell-yard communicates with George-yard. I asked for the landlord, and asked him, in the prisoner's presence, if he had any knowledge of the prisoner? He said No. I then asked him if he had any knowledge of the note? He said No. 1 then related the circumstance to him, and asked him to let me see the waiters - they came; there were two or three; I asked them if they had any knowledge of the prisoner - they said No - the prisoner said nothing; the landlord reproved him very severely, and as we went out, he said he found it. I returned home with him, left him in charge of my shopman, and went for an officer. On my return I found him in charge of Sheppard, at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then give any account of himself - A. He said his name was Williams, and he had either a brother, or friend, who was a silversmith, and lived in Smithfield - I think he mentioned a number, but I do not know what; he said he found it at the top of Lombard-street - it was a very wet day, and the note was quite clean - he was given in charge of Sheppard. I then went to the inspector's office at the bank, and marked the note there,</p>
               <p>"Watson, No. 5, Bell-yard, Gracechurch-street" - it was never out of my possession until I had marked it, except in the hands of Draper, whom I had fetched, his master, and Sheppard, but I never lost sight of it, and am certain I marked the note that he offered me - (looks at one) - this is it. The inspector returned with me to my house to the prisoner, and asked him his name? He said Williams.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. Can you undertake to say that the man who passed the note a fortnight before, represented himself as coming from Marchant, or that his name was Marchant - A. As coming from him; Marchant showed me two young men, and said he had another, who was out; the second time he represented himself, as being sent by Watson - there is about twelve houses in Bell-yard; I could find no such person. I understood him to say he got it from the George and Vulture; it looks into Bell-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. A person might suppose it to be there - A. No. I had told him it was forged, and the constable had arrived when he said he found it - he was alarmed.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. When you said you had passed No. 5, what did he say - A. He said further on, and took me to the George and Vulture; the landlord and waiters denied giving it to him; he did not say he took it of anybody else. When he first mentioned Bell-yard he did not say the George and Vulture - the George and Vulture cannot be considered as in Bell-yard.</p>

               <p>Q. When he came out of the George and Vulture, did he propose going to any other house in Bell-yard, to find out any other person - A. No; the constable was sent for - I said I thought it was forged, he then said he found it.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 12th of December, I was fetched to the prosecutor's house, and took the prisoner into custody; I searched, but found nothing on him. I asked him his name? He said it was Williams; I asked him where he got the note? He said he found it in Bell-yard, and that he lived with his brother, who kept a silversmith's shop, No. 15, Smithfield - the streets were very wet and dirty on that day. I took him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130028"></xptr>towards Giltspur-street Compter? he asked me where I was going to take him to? I said I was going to take him to Smithfield, to his friend's. He smiled very jocularly, and said</p>

               <p>"It is no use taking me there." I took him to the Compter, then went to No. 15, Smithfield, and found it was a private house. I looked round Smithfield for a silversmith's shop, but there was no such a shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He knew you was a constable - - A. Yes. You can go from Lombard-street to Bell-yard, but you must go through the George and Vulture and St. Michael's-alley. He said he had just found it in Bell-yard.</p>

            . I am an inspector of bank notes. It is my business to discover genuine notes from forged - (examines the note uttered on the 12th of December) - it is forged in every respect. It is not the bank paper nor water-mark - it has the imitation of one, which is done afterwards, by pressure; in a genuine not it is made in the paper. The date line is engraved - in a genuine note it is stereotype. It purports to be signed by R. Clough - we have a cashier of that name; he is not a signer of small notes - he was once, but was not at the time this is dated - it is not his hand-writing; I have known it for years. The letters No. are engraved - in a genuine note they are printed. The first note paid to the prosecutor is also forged in every respect, the same as the other, and the same plate and signature - one is 75112, the other 75052. In neither of these numbers do the figures 34689 occur. The dates are different. Clough was not a signing clerk at the date of either of them.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If they are both off the same plate, how can the dates be different - A. I suppose the date line may be done with a slip plate, which is run into the plate - it can be done so.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you do things with the greatest accuracy at the Bank - it is almost impossible to make a mistake. Look at this note - (handing one) - A. It is what I have often seen before; it has no signature, but is a genuine note.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Have you ever seen plates with a slip line for the date - A. I think I have.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any appearance of a slip-line being used - A. No. I am not aware that it would make a difference - it would be easier to stamp a note without a slip.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not known forgeries so executed that they have been received at the Bank - A. I have; they have been passed by the inspector.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. The slip-plate merely contains the date - the impression could make no difference in the appearance of it - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many instances of forged notes having been passed at the Bank, have you known - A. Several. Some of them were, new and some worn.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the least doubt about these two notes - A. None whatever.</p>

On the 26th of December, the prisoner came into my shop, he said he wanted a pair of shoes, I shewed him a pair; he said they were too little; I shewed him three pair more, he said they would do; I told him they were nine shillings, he bid me eight; I told him I could not take it; he said he would not give any more. I saw him secrete a pair of shoes. He turned to go out of the shop; I knew he had got a pair of shoes under his coat. I clapped both hands to his collar; I said, d - n you, I will not be robbed.

It appear'd by the Prosecutor's Evidence that he had received the 30 Guineas mentioned in the Indictment that Morning, and had not been at home since; that he had been at 3 or 4 places since he saw his Guineas before he came into the Prisoner's Company; though he did not miss them till he went out of it. And there was one Evidence deposed that he heard the Prosecutor say, that he verily believed the Prisoner had not his Money, and if he would give him a Bond to indemnifie him, he would not prosecute.

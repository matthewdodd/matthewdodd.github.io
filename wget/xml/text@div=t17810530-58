Being upon an errand of this nature, I took my watch out of my fob, and put it into my waistcoat pocket. I was with her on the bed five minutes. Somebody tapped at the door, and she started from the bed. I examined my pocket, and found the watch was gone. I apprehended her. She had her arm extended out at the door, and I suppose she then gave the watch to the person who had tapped. She was taken to the watch-house, and searched; but nothing was found upon her.</p>

             delivered up the watch, and said Douglas asked her to dine with her; and as her husband was a soldier, and not to be at home that evening, she permitted her to lie with her. Next morning she observed the watch upon the chimney-piece: she asked Douglas where she had it? and she said she had it from Jackson.</p>

               <p>To the Prosecutor. How long have you been in possession of this watch? - I think, ever since January was twelvemonth. It was a present sent me by my father from NewYork.

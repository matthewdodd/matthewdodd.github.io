            . I am an officer. I was sent for to the Fox-under-the-hill public-house, and there I received information that the prosecutor had been robbed - he appeared to be out of his mind - he related to me in substance what he has now - he described the girl, and I went to the King's Head, and took her up; I am quite certain she denied ever having the watch, and so she said at the watch-house - the prosecutor was sober - he could describe her person.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that the prosecutor had sent her to pledge the watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I Jive in Pleasant-row, Kennington, and keep a chandler's shop—on the 9th of Dec. the prisoner came to my shop, between two and three o'clock, and said he had got some tobacco to sell and some tea—he showed me some samples, a little gunpowder-tea, a little black tea, and a bit of tobacco—he asked me if I would buy it—he said he was a stoker on board a vessel, and the way he got this away was by a lighterman taking the dust out of the vessel, and this was put underneath the dust—he said he would bring 10lbs. of gunpowder-tea, 10lbs. of black tea, and 14lbs. of tobacco, and I was to give him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I agreed that I would buy it—he came a little after six o'clock, and brought three parcels wrapped up in a bag which he had borrowed of me to wrap them in, and the parcels were wrapped in three separate papen—he said, "I have brought your goods, master," and he threw them off his back behind the counter—I told him I should like to weigh them, and see them opened—I weighed two of them, but he would hardly let me touch them—I did not open them, for, by the way of his talking to me, I had not any suspicion of him—he said they were good weight—I weighed two of them—the tobacco was 16lbs. instead of 14lbs., and one parcel of the tea I weighed was 11 1/2lbs.—I was going to open them, and he said, "D—it, do you think I am going to do you"—he struck a knife into all the three parcels—he took a little tobacco out of the tobacco parcel, and a little tea out of the gunpowder-tea parcel, and a little out of the black tea—I then told my wife to pay him—I took the money out of her hand and gave it him myself—I was to give him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "Per<lb></lb>haps 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will do?"—he said, "I don't mind giving the old woman 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I then wanted to get change for a half-sovereign—he said, "Never mind," and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184601050133"></xptr>
               <p>I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "That will do"—he then said, "God bless you, I should like to stay an hour and smoke a pipe with you"—he had bor<lb></lb>rowed a little bottle to bring some whiskey, and he had not brought it—I said, "You have not brought the whiskey"—he said, "It is down at the bottom of the street in a cab, and I have got a quarter of a hundred weight of tobacco in it"—I went out with him, and there was a cart in the street—he said I had better stay behind the cart—he went on and I still followed him—he held up his hand to stop my coming—I went on to the end of the street—I could see nothing of the cab or of him—I have examined one of the par<lb></lb>cels—it is sawdust, with a bit of tea inside the middle of it—I spoke to a constable next morning, and I gave him the parcels when he called on the 24th, which was fifteen days after.</p>

            . I am in the 1st Regiment of Guards, and know the prisoner - I have often seen her with Constantine - they were intimate. On the 4th of October the prisoner came to me, about twelve o'clock, and said she had bought two gold seals for Constantine - and said she had thrown them down to him when he was on sentry - she told me to tell him to put them on his watch, and wear them the next guard-day, that she might see them. Soon after that, Constantine sent me to her for some tobacco - she said, she dare not be seen out, for she had robbed a gentleman of a gold and silver watch; but after dark, she would go out and send him tobacco and money also; that the gentleman was drunk, and did not know what he was doing - I saw Constantine sign his examination.</p>

            . I am an officer. I found Constantine with these seals, and from his information I took the prisoner; he said he got them from her.</p>
               <p>DAVID LING. Constantine told me, half an hour ago, that he would deny knowing any thing about her, and wished me to do so also, that he and she might get over it; the prisoner told me the gentleman was a medical man, and wore spectacles - that she had robbed him of a pencil-case, a case of instruments, and various other articles.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she had bought the seals.</p>

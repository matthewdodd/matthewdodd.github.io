             (police-constable G 182). On the 24th of November, I was on duty, in Goswell-street, at half-past three o'clock in the morning. I saw the prisoner with a bag in his hand - I stopped him, and asked what he had - he said, "Some fowls" - I asked him to allow me to look at them - I took them in my hand, and asked where he brought them from - he said from Finchley, and was going to take them to his brother in Old-street - I said I would go with him; I went with him to the end of Gee-street - he then ran away - I followed him - he ran on to the Willow-walk; I took him there - I asked him how many fowls there were; he said four, and he gave 4s. for them, to a man on the road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. The fowls were in a bag? A. Yes.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Lumley my brother-in-law. There are three gates in the garden, which lead to the poultry-house, but that does not join to the dwelling-house - on Saturday week, at nine o'clock in the evening, I shut the poultry-house up secure, and these fowls were missed the next morning - I knew the prisoner - he has occasionally worked as gardener for my brother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the habit of feeding them? A. Yes; very often - there was a padlock on the door of the fowl-house - the outer gate of the yard was shut the night before, but in the morning it was open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a pork-butcher, and went down to Finchley for work, and on coming back I met a man, who said, "Will you purchase these fowls?" He asked 5s. for them, I gave him 4s.; I came on towards home, and was stopped by the policeman; I told him what I had got, and walked a few paces with him, but being agitated I ran away; I was then taken to the station-house. I was taken to the magistrate, who, having a good character of me from Mr. Stroud, and Mr. Van, the officers; gave me up, till the following Tuesday; I went to work, and was taken again.</p>

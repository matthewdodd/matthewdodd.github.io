                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Upper-street, St. Martin's lane. I was in a public-house in Farringdon-street, between two and three o'clock in the day, on the 29th of August—these two girls came and asked if I would stand some gin—I said "No, I had no money to pay for gin, I had no money for myself"—I had come from Leicester-square, and had got a waistcoat with me—I wanted to go to the London Docks, and I went into the public-house, because it rained—I said I had no money to buy gin, so they played tricks with me, one in front and one at the back—I tried to get away, and while I was trying, my waistcoat was gone—I cannot say who took it—I am sure these are the girls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fitzgerald</hi>. I never was near him, only when I was in the house—when he came in with the young woman, I was in the room talking to another person—this other young woman went out at the side door, and he went after her—I went out, and this man came, and said I had stolen his waistcoat—I saw this other young, woman, and I said, "This man says I have taken his waistcoat"—she said, "He cannot say that, as he gave it me to pawn"—he then gave me into custody. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. She asked just the same as the other girl did, whether I would stand some gin—I did not go out after the other girl, till I lost my waistcoat.</p>

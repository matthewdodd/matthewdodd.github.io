                  </hi>. I am no relation of the deceased; I live in Dove<lb></lb>row, Goldsmith's-row. About a quarter past 12 o'clock, on Monday night, 30th Oct., I was at the King's Arms public house, near Kingsland-gate, with Ann Hayes, the deceased James Taylor, and Jane Jenner—we all went into the tap room—I was afterwards standing at the public house door—the prisoner came up to me, and asked me if I was the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> that had had the scratched face a few weeks ago—I said, "Yes;" and he asked me if it did not serve me right—I said, "No"—at that time the deceased and Hayes came up—the prisoner asked what they wanted—the deceased, said, "This is my niece, and whilst I have a pair of hands I will protect her"—nothing occurred to render his saying that necessary—I do not know what he was to protect her against—the prisoner up with his hand, and fetched him a smack over the head with his open hand—it was a very hard blow—this was inside the house, against the tap room door—the deceased went outside the house and the prisoner followed him—I went back towards the bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married to Samuel Hayes, but do not live with him. I live along with my aunt, Mrs. Jenner, in Goldsmith's-row, Hackney-road—she lived with Mr. Taylor, the deceased; he was my uncle—on 30th Oct. my uncle, Mrs. Jenner, and I were at the King's Arms, in the Kings-land-road—we had something to drink there—my uncle was rather the worse for liquor, and so was Mrs. Jenner—I was sober—as I came out of the tap room, I saw the prisoner standing in the passage, talking to Joseph Taylor—I went and stood against the street door—my uncle came out of the tap room, and stood against me, and the prisoner asked him what he wanted—he said, "I don't want anything"—the prisoner directly up with his hand, and hit him underneath his ear—my uncle made answer, and said, "All right," and passed through the passage, and out at the street door—the prisoner followed him, and struck him again, and knocked him off the kerb, and he fell down, and the prisoner took and kicked him twice when he was down; once at the back of the head, and once in the back—my uncle had a cap on—I said to the prisoner, "Don't hit my uncle again, nor yet kick him again;" and he directly made answer that he would serve me the same—he knocked me up against the stone place—I went away to fetch my aunt from the tap room—she came out with me, and she ran and took the prisoner by the handkerchief, and he ran away—I asked a man who was coming past to help me lift up my uncle, which he did, on to the path</p>

               <p>—he was not able to stand—he said, "Oh! my neck and my legs are broke"—a policeman came up—he examined his legs, and found they were not broken—the policeman helped to put him on the man's back, and he carried him on his back to Mrs. Brown's, and put him on the stairs—Mrs. Brown was not at home, and I went to seek for her—when I came back, my uncle was lying in the yard, just outside the door step, not far from where I had left him—I had left the man with him, and found him there with him when I returned—my uncle was then taken round to Mr. Lam<lb></lb>bert's on the same man's back—I did not go there with him—it was some-where about fifty yards from Mrs. Brown's—my uncle did not fall off the man's back at all—the man put my uncle's arms round his neck, and carried him <hi rend="italic">pick-a-back</hi>—I went to look for Mrs. Brown again, and returned in about ten minutes, and then my uncle was being carried back again to Mrs. Brown's, on the man's back—he was put on Mrs. Brown's bed—I remained with him—he kept complaining of his neck and legs, and said they were broken—a doctor was sent for three times, but he would not come—about 7 o'clock in the morning we took him away in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and took him to his own house—I was with him, and Mr. Brown, and my aunt—I cannot tell how far it was; we paid half a crown for the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—they got him up stairs, and laid him on the bed—he kept complaining that his neck and legs were broken—I remained with him all the time—my aunt went and fetched Mr. Welch, the surgeon, and he came directly, about 9 o'clock—he gave my uncle medicine, and applied mustard poultices to his heart—he died on the Thursday morning as this happened on the Monday—he was very bad indeed all the time and insensible, until about 12 o'clock on the Tuesday night—he was sensible when he died.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had you been in the public house that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About half an hour—I had seen the prisoner before this occur<lb></lb>red, sitting opposite in the tap room—I had no conversation with him, nor had my uncle—the first thing that took place between them was the pri<lb></lb>soner saying to him, "What do you want?"—I did not say to the prisoner in the tap room, "I should like to give you something"—he did not ask me what I meant, nor did I say, "If I can't do it, there is one here who can,"meaning my uncle—I swear that—my uncle did not come up, and ask the prisoner what he was interfering with me for—I did not hear the pri<lb></lb>soner say, "I am not interfering with her, but she is with me"—I did not see my uncle then strike him—I did hear him say, "This is my niece, and while I have a pair of hands I will protect her;" and that was all I did hear him say—that was before the prisoner struck him—there had been no conversation between them about me before my uncle used those words—the prisoner and Joseph Taylor were in the passage in conversation together—the landlord was not there—I do not know where he was—I did not hear him turn them out, and say, he would have no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> there—somebody told them to go out—I do not know whether it was the landlord or no—I swear that my uncle did not strike the prisoner; I did not see him do so—I did not hear him tell the prisoner to go outside, and he would fight him; nothing of the kind—my uncle did not strike a blow—the prisoner knocked him off the kerb into the road—I have known the witness, Joseph Taylor, about three months—I knew his father and mother—I have seen him frequently since this—I am not living with him—I get my living by going out washing and ironing—my uncle lay in the road about ten minutes after he was struck, and then he was carried to Mrs. Brown's—I do not know who carried him to Mrs. Lambert's, whether it wan Joseph Taylor, or</p>

               <p>the other man, Ingleield—I should not know the man if I were to see him, because I went away to look for Mrs. Brown—my aunt was there all the time—I did not hear anything said to my aunt that evening; I must have heard it if anything had been said—I went in, and told her of this—I did not hear her say, "Let him fight the b—he is always interfering with some one"—I do not think it could have been longer than ten minutes before he was removed to Mrs. Brown's.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived with the deceased as his wife for nearly five years—I was with him on the night in question—I did not see the beginning of the transaction, I only saw the prisoner kick him when he was outside—he kicked him at the back of the neck—my husband was then in the road, on his back—I ran across to assist him, and laid hold of the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>kerchief—he said, "You b—w—if you don't loose me, I will serve you the same"—I said, "Why are you ill-using my master?"—I held him tight, we struggled, and fell both together, and he dragged me with him about two yards, and gave me a tremendous blow on my arm—I afterwards saw my husband taken by a man to Mrs. Brown's; he had no fall as he was being taken—I saw him on the stairs there—a man carried him from the stairs on his back, and sat him down in the yard; they did not throw him down; he could not keep on the stairs, his arms and legs were so stiff—he never moved hand or foot after he was kicked—he was taken to Mr. Lambert's, and back again to Mrs. Brown's, and laid upon her bed—he had no fall in going from one place to the other—I had been having a little to drink that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Hackney. I was called in to attend the deceased on Tuesday morning, at 9 o'clock—I found him dressed, lying on his back perfectly paralyzed, and the surface of the body completely cold; there was no action of the heart—he was unconscious—I directed mustard poultices and warm applications—he died at 1 o'clock on the Thursday morning—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—there was a large clot of blood surrounding the upper part of the spinal cord, and compressing it—that was the immediate cause of death—there was also extravasation of blood at the base of the brain—the deep seated muscles at the back of the neck were very much bruised, and blood effused between their fibres—violent kicks would produce such injuries to the head as I saw—the imme<lb></lb>diate effect of the injury to the spinal cord would be paralysis, and in severe cases death might ensue—the party would feel severe pain at the seat of injury, but not below it—it would prevent his moving his limbs—the upper and lower extremities were perfectly paralyzed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose the injuries you saw might have been caused by a fall, or a series of falls? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not believe a fall could have produced them, inasmuch as the deep seated muscles at the back of the neck were bruised—I cannot imagine that a fall could produce it—if a fall had produced injury to account for the paralysis, I should have expected to have found that the body of one of the vertebrae was broken, that he had really broken his neck; whereas the bones were perfectly sound—I do not</p>

               <p>mean that it must necessarily follow that the bone must be broken by a fall, but I think a fall could not have produced the extensive mischief with<lb></lb>out breaking the bone—I speak as positively as a medical opinion can be given, that it could not have been caused by a fall—I am a member of the College of Surgeons—I have practised since 1850—I was dresser at the London Hospital for two years—I have seen a great many injuries of the spine, but injuries of this description are extremely rare—I have seen very few of them—injuries to the upper part of the spine, without the bones being broken, are excessively rare—a kick might have done it—I have never seen an injury precisely similar to this before—a person under the influence of liquor would be more liable to receive serious injury from any local violence applied to him.</p>

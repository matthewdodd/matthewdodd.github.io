                  </hi>. I am a dyer, and live in Goswell-street—I am in partnership with my father. The prisoner was in our employ—there were three shawls similar to this—two of them were given to be fringed, and this one was left on the table—it was then missed by our forewoman, who asked if I had removed it—I said, "No; it must be in the room, and must be found"—I desired the prisoner to look among the girls' work, but it could not be found—in about an hour one of the girls exclaimed, "The shawl is found"—the forewoman ran to the place, and the girl said she saw the prisoner drop it.</p>

                  </hi>. I work at the prosecutor's—I saw the prisoner put the shawl under her stays, through her pocket-hole—I heard it inquired for, but I was afraid to say any thing, as I knew she had a bad set belonging to her—I knew she could not get out, because the door was locked—there were sixty or seventy persons there—I saw her drop the shawl from un<lb></lb>der her stays—I called out that it was found—the forewoman ran to the place and took it up.</p>

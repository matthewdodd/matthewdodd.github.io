             went with me; I came back to Frances Smith's room; Frances Smith went in and shut the door; Frances Smith, she said, there was a gentleman up stairs that gave her 2s.; Frances Smith went away then, and I saw no more of her; Elizabeth Smith then went and listened at the bottom of the stairs; I staid at the door, and saw the gentleman and Mary Box come down stairs; she ran down into Round-court, and the gentleman after her; she went into Mr. Shepherd's, a public-house in New Round-court; then she went away from there to Mr. Manley's, a public-house; then she knocked at the window, and asked me to lend her the key of my room; I live in Vine-street, and they live in Newton's-court, Vine-street; I gave her the key; then I went up into my own room; she was putting on a white bedgown of mine; I asked her the reason of that, and she said she had borrowed a gown of Mrs. Gorman, and she said Mrs. Gorman might want her gown; Elizabeth Smith then came up stairs into my room; then Frances Smith came up, and put her hand into her bosom, and pulled out a watch; she held it to the candle, and burnt the yellow string; it was a gold repeater apparently to me; there was a key to the string, but whether it was gold or not I cannot say; it seemed to me to be very little bigger than a dollar; it was not a large watch apparently to me; when I saw that, I told them to go out of my room with it, for they should not stay there; Elizabeth Smith then put it in her bosom, and took it down stairs; they all three went away down stairs; then I locked the door and came down stairs to them; then I saw the same gentleman talking to Mary Box directly afterwards; she told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300039"></xptr>him it was a story, for he was not worth a watch; then

             came up the street, and told me she wanted to speak to me; I then went with her across Chandos-street into Taylor's Buildings, which leads into Bedfordbury; then she put her hand in the mud; I asked her what she was doing there; she said it was the gentleman's watch; she went up Bedfordbury, I followed her but a very few yards, to the corner of Shelton-court, there I saw Frances Smith standing;

             gave the watch to Frances; then they went into Chandos-street; I asked them where they were going; Frances Smith said they were going to fetch George Street; then they went away; in a few minutes Mary Box came with George Street; Frances Smith delivered the watch to Street; I do not know what became of it afterwards.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you a Bow-street on the Tuesday, the first day? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined there? - A. I was asked where I lived.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell the Justice then, what you told on the Friday? - A. No, I was not asked any questions.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the prosecutor examined? - A. No, I was taken away, I was not permitted to stay there.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear him tell his story then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not tell the officer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoners were discharged? - A. No, not till Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not communicate it to the officer or the Justice? - A. No, I did not; I should have told it the first night, but I was threatened so in my own room that night; they threatened me for making them take the watch away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the Friday before they were taken up again? - A. They were discharged in the morning, and I gave information to Mr. Donaldson in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoners before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You see each other every day, I suppose? - A. Yes; I could not do otherwise, when I walked up and down the streets with them.</p>
               <p>Q. You mixed with them? - A. Yes, formerly.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not been quite so great since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had had a quarrel then? - A. No, I have not; but if people are unfortunate, they may keep themselves honest, and that is the reason why we have not been so great.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of the gentlemen that use their house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor they any of the gentlemen that come to your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never had a quarrel with them about any gentleman that frequented your house, and had afterwards gone to their's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason why you have not been so great? - A. Because they followed rules I did not like.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you lent them your key that night? - A. I did lend them the key; I did not know what they might want.</p>
               <p>Q. That was because they followed rules that you did not like; how many persons live in the house in which you live? - A. Four or five.</p>
               <p>Q. Men or women? - A. Women.</p>
               <p>Q. In the same way of life? - A. Yes; three of them; there is one that is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do any gentlemen lodge in the house? - A. Only the landlord and his son.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You had some conversation with them about the watch, and you afterwards saw the gentleman; why did you not tell him of it? - A. Because I was afraid of my life, and am now every day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Box. Q. Were you frightened when you came to Newgate to see us, and drink tea with us? - A. Her friends desired me to come; Frances Smith's man, whom she lives with, wished me to come; I said I should be ill used, and they told me, no, I should not: I went, because I thought to hear something more about the gentleman's watch.</p>
               <p>Box's defence. I am an innocent woman; I never saw the prosecutor before the watchman brought him to me; when the watchman asked him if I was the person, he said, no, I was not.</p>
               <p>Frances Smith's defence. I came up to the end of the court where the watchman and the gentleman were standing; I stood there a considerable time, and the watchman asked him if I was the person, and he said, no, and it was that that cleared us at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Smith's defence. I never saw the watch in my life, nor the gentleman, till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Street's defence. I am innocent of the affair.</p>
               <p>The Jury immediately declared themselves satisfied without giving the Court the trouble of summing up, and pronounced their verdict,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a student at King's College. About the 4th of March, in consequence of something, Mr. Langly, in my presence, placed a book called "Druid's Surgeon's Vade Mecum" on the table by the Classical Theatre room door—I placed myself in a situation so that I could see anybody who came there—after I had done so, several of the students went, looked at the book, and left it on the table—afterwards the prisoner came, took it off the table, put it into his left-side coat-pocket, and went out of the door into the court in front of the College—I followed him—he went through Somerset House—Mr. Langly followed him through Somer<lb></lb>set House—I went through one of our gates to look for a policeman—I could not see one—I then went before Somerset House and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner come out of the gate of Somerset House and cross the Strand—I met Mr. Langly, and left him to pursue the prisoner up New Church-court, while I got a policeman—I afterwards saw the prisoner come up New Church-court into the Strand—I pointed him out to a policeman—he turned up another court and ran away—I saw him no more till he was in custody—a person named Ann Kelly brought the book back to the Col<lb></lb>lege the next day—it was the book I had seen the prisoner take off the table—I afterwards attended at the police-office—the book was pro<lb></lb>duced there on the Tuesday following and identified—it was afterwards given up to Mr. Langly by the Magistrate's order—it has since been stolen again—I was in Mr. Langly's room when he missed it.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. James', Westminster, and was so on the 26th of September, when, on hearing an alarm at Mr. Stulzs' premises, I went to the spot, saw the prisoner there, and seized him, in order to take him into custody - I collared him; he presented a pistol at me, immediately pulled the trigger, and it burnt the priming in the pan; he ran up Boyle-street and New Burlington-street, pursued by Clark and another.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you seen him before? A. Not to my knowledge - he snapped the pistol at me momentarily.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he say any thing? A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In how short a time did you see the prisoner in custody? A. Not three minutes - I had not the least doubt of his being the man who pulled the trigger, and have no doubt of him now.</p>

            . I saw Bannister knocked down, and saw the pistol flash - I ran after the prisoner, and was present when he was taken; I afterwards returned to the spot where Bannister had been knocked down, and found a pistol on the very spot Bannister had been fired at, and gave it to Schofield in the same state and condition as I found it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had it ever been out of your sight? A. No, not till I delivered it to him.</p>

            . I have the pistol which Clark gave me on the 26th of September, the morning after the robbery; it had the appearance of having been snapped - there was powder burnt in the pan; I drew the charge - there were two small pieces of iron, and five large ones, two pieces of wadding, and powder.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those pieces of iron, if discharged against a man, capable of killing him? A. I should think so, at least of doing him grievous bodily harm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you do with the pistol? A. I locked it up in a cupboard, which I kept the key of; it was not out of my sight from the time I got it from Clark till I drew the charge - I was before the Magistrate at the time Clark put it on the table; I received it from him before the Magistrate at the office, on Saturday, the 26th - I know nothing about the robbery.</p>

             sworn. - I belong to the Bow-street patrol: On Sunday evening, the 11th of November, about seven o'clock, as I was going down Ball's-pond-common, I heard a muttering on the off-side of the road, it was very dark, I could not see; I and my party crossed over the road, and there were the three prisoners; Phillips had this bag upon his shoulder; we brought them across the way to the foot-path, and then we took them all to the Tull-house at Ball's-pond Turnpike, there we searched them; and after we had searched them, I secured them, I tied their hands; after I had secured them, I said, now let us see what is in the sack; I went to open the sack, and Gee said, you need not give yourself the trouble to do that, it is only a bit of a lamb that we have been making free with, which we ought not to have done; it had more the appearance of a sheep, it was so small, it was of the South-down breed; I found a knife upon Gee, and when I came to examine it, I found the handle full of blood; I examined the sack, and found a sheep in it, without entrails, with the skin on, and with the feet on; the skin had a small W upon the off-shoulder; I secured them, and took them to the watch-house, and the next day I went down to Mr. Willan's, and informed his servant what I had discovered, and by the marks upon this sheep it appeared to be one of his; I then went to the Bull-and-mouth Inn, and left word for Mr. Willan to attend at Bow-street, which he did, and there he saw them; the other sheep was found, and both were taken to Bow-street; as far as I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050037"></xptr>could see, the mark corresponded exactly with those in Mr. Willan's field.</p>

             sworn. - I was with the last witness at the apprehending the prisoners: They were brought up to Ball's-pond Toll-house, and searched; I took from Phillips; a tomahawk and a knife he had with him, (producing them); and that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You do not mean to call that a tomahawk, it is a sugar-breaker? - A. I do not know what it is.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you know there is a reward in this case, if there is a conviction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the sheep with legs on? - A. Yes; the entrails were not in.</p>
               <p>Q. There are many thousand sheep with the letter W upon them? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended, that as the indictment charged them to be wether sheep, the witnesses not being able to say whether they were sheep or lambs, and the declaration of the Prisoners at the time being that it was lamb, the prisoners ought not to be put upon their defence.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon this point of law I shall leave it to the Jury, upon the evidence, to say whether they were wether sheep or not. - You may make any observations you think proper, in arrest of judgment, but I think the justice of the country would be totally defeated if such an objection was to be admitted.</p>
               <p>Gee's defence. When Mr. Black apprehended me, he took me to the Toll-house, and said, what have you got in your sack; I made answer, it is as we picked it up; that is all we know about it.</p>
               <p>The other prisoners did not say any thing in their defence. The prisoner, Jones, called three, Gee, eight, and Phillips, two witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

             . I live in Spittle-fields; about this day month I heard somebody knock at the door, and I saw a man bowing and scraping, and he said he was glad to see me , and hoped I was well, and as soon as I opened the door he shook me by the hand , and asked me if I did not know him? and this woman [Eliz. Joblin] told me in French that the man who was talking to me had robbed me, and he said, there's nothing in it, Sir, there's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174805260037"></xptr> nothing in it; which made me believe he understood French; I asked her again, and she said, he had stole some handkerchiefs , and had put them into his pocket; I said, what do you mean by coming to me in this manner? you are an impudent fellow, and I will know you now before I part from you, and I said I would search him, and when he found me positive , he took the handkerchiefs out of his pocket; these are the handkerchiefs; I believe he thought that the woman saw him take them , and so came in that manner to make her think he was acquainted with me.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Joblin . I saw the Prisoner snatch the handkerchief off from the window , that hung up for sale, and I saw him knock at the door, and I saw Mr. Paine let him in, and I told him, the handkerchiefs were in his pocket, and I saw the Prisoner pull them out of his pocket.</p>

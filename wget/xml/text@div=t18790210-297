                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Benson and Hedges, cigar merchants, of 13, Old Bond Street—on 15th December a customer of mine, William Worth Newenham, left this country for Australia—I did not see him on board the Somersetshire—on 24th December, I received this letter: "December 24th, 1878. Coxe's Hotel, 32 Room. Sir,—he so good as to send me three boxes of Maria Victorias, and three of La Intimidads, and two pounds of your smoking mixture, as soon as possible.—Yours truly, W. W. Newenham." I went to Cox's Hotel, and made inquiries and went back, and then Mr. Adams, the clerk to Messrs. Beale and Inman, called on me, and I went again to Cox's Hotel about 1 o'clock with him, and saw the prisoner in the coffee-room—I produced the letter, and Mr. Adams also produced a letter—I addressed the prisoner as Mr. Newenham; he said, "Yes"—I said, "You have written to me for some cigars"—he said, "They are for Mr. George Newenham"—I said, "What is the meaning of this, did you write this letter?" he said, "No, it is written by George Newenham," either a cousin or brother of William Newenham, I am not certain which he said—I said, "How came you to come to this hotel in the name of Newenham, when your name is Jackson?"—he said, "I came for the purpose of receiving the goods—he also said that he knew that W. W. Newenham had gone to Australia in the</p>

               <p>Somersetshire—I told him it was a very serious case; he most make his explanation before a Magistrate, and gave him in custody—he said, "I was going to take the goods to Mr. George Newenham"—one of the witnesses said, "Where is Mr. George Newenham"—he said, I had rather not say," or words to that effect—Mr. Adams showed him his letter, and he said, "I posted that with one other"—I said, "To whom was the third letter written?"—he said, "I decline to say," but we discovered that after-wards—I know Mr. W. W. Newenham's writing, and I am certain that these three letters and envelopes were not written by him—I have his writing in our address-book, and have compared it—the cigars and the smoking mixture are worth from 20?. to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I fancy I have seen the prisoner at our place of business-his face is familiar to me—I have made several in<lb></lb>quiries, but cannot hear of hear of George Newenham's existence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known W. W. Newenham since June 11, 1878; that was the first time he came—he has had dealings with us to the amount of 3/. or 4?., for which he paid; but the amount standing to his debit now is about 30?.—he came to the shop, and was a constant customer up to the time of his leaving—he belongs to a good family; his father is an Irish gentleman of property—the defendant's brother has had dealings with us for about two years, and owes us about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have received a letter from him since the defendant has been in custody, asking for his account—he lives either at his father's seat, or at the town residence in Park Street—the family is one of position—there is no attempt to imitate Mr. Newen-ham's writing in my book in this order—when I went to the hotel on the second occasion the defendant had not come down from his bedroom, but he came down into the coffee-room—nobody else was there—I told him that his name was Jackson—I knew that, because I saw it marked on his clothes, which had been given to the servant to brush, but I did not know that he was connected with that family—I had no knowledge of a third letter till the defendant said that he had posted three—he repeated at the station that he had posted three letters, but he did not say to whom the third was sent—we discovered that afterwards.</p>

I am one of the firm of Beale and Inman, of 131, New Bond Street, hosiers—on the morning of 24th December this letter came by post and my partner showed it to me—I have not got the envelope now—we had a customer named William Worth Newenham: "Coxe's Hotel, 32 Room, Jermyn Street. Sir,—Kindly send me a fight-coloured smoking suit, the same as you sent me last tune; also three of your thickest coloured Jerseys, and ditto drawers, six made-up hunting ties, three white, remainder black and white. Kindly let me have them as soon as possible. Yours, &amp;c., W. W. Newenham." We had known W. W. Newenham since 1874, and were in the habit of giving him credit—the goods mentioned in the letter are worth about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not know the prisoner before this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Beale and Inman—on 24th December I went with Mr. Hedges to Cox's Hotel—we saw the prisoner in the coffee-room, and Mr. Hedges said "Are you Mr. Newenham?"—he said "Yes"—Hedges said "You ordered some cigars of me"—he said "Yes"—Hedges said "I have brought the cigars, but you are not Mr. Newenham, you are Mr. Jackson; you had no business to have ordered things of me, signing Mr. Newenham's name; you have committed a forgery; don't you know Mr. Newenham has gone to Australia?"—he said "Yes, I do"—I said "What about this letter?" handing mine to him. "Very likely you have been sending it to half a dozen others. Are there any more?"—he said "I only posted three altogether"—I said "Who was the other to?"—he said "I shan't tell you"—Mr. Hedges said "I shall give you in charge"—he begged him not, and said who he was, and said "Mr. George Newenham has written them, and I was to stay at the hotel for the goods"—I said "Who is Mr. George Newenham?"—he said "He is my cousin" or "brother," I won't gay which—I know the prisoner as a customer—I saw him in our shop about three months ago, and one of the young men said "There is Mr. Warren Jackson's brother."</p>

Jackson"—we had one written order of his, and the others must have been given personally—there are 20 entries to him under different dates, so that he must have been 17 or 19 times on our premises.</p>

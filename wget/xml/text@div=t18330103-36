On the 20th of November the prisoner came to my house - he lodged with me seven years ago; he called that day to ask how I was - I turned my back to go to the street door, to see after one of my children; I had a watch, a seal, and a key in my work-box; he staid five or six minutes after I returned to the room, and then he left - in a few minutes I went to look what time it was, and missed my watch; it was a large silver watch, and had a gold key - I found it in pledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. When had you seen it before he called? A. About half an hour; my mother was there and went with me to the street door, but no one else was there; he pawned it in his own name, at Mr. Townsend's, but he is not here.</p>

I took the prisoner on the 4th December - I told him what he was charged with - he said he knew nothing of it, but at the station he said he took it through poverty, and intended to return it in a little time; he said he had pawned it near Covent-garden, and had lost the duplicate.</p>

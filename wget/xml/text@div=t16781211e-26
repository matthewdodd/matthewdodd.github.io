               <p>The last for London was George Clethoroe, Indicted for stealing the goods of John Delavier.</p>
               <p>One Burbeck deposed, that about six of the clock in the Evening, the Prisoner came into the house, and going out, he saw him; and asked him what he did there; but received no answer. That he cried stop Thief, and upon that Outcry he ran, but was overtaken. That the Linnen which he is Indicted for, was taken out of the house, and dropt 4 or 5 houses from that house.</p>
               <p>Another man Witnessed, that upon the cry of Stop Thief, he made towards the Prisoner, who to save himself, cry'd Stop Thief too, and when the Witness came up to him, Struck him; but he was Apprehended, notwithstanding his resistance. And one that saw the Linnen in that place, and took it up, attested it.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner denied being in the house, and said, that he was pursuing one that came out thence: but the first man affirmed positively that he was there, and that his Wife three days after his Commitment came to entreat him not to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>The Jury, after a short recess, did give in this Verdict of the Prisoners under their charge.</p>

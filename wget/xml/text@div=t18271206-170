On the 4th of November, between two and three o'clock in the day, I was coming down <placeName id="t18271206-170-crimeloc901">Wheeler-street, Spitalfields</placeName>

My sister asked him for it - he called us a very bad name, and knocked us down; they then all ran away; there were several persons there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know the other man's name is Adams? A. I think that is the name he gave at the watch-house - I am not sure. He was taken to the watch-house, and the officer let him go - I told the officer he took it off my neck, and I stated so at Worship-street, but he ran away just before he got there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060087"></xptr>Q. Was there any fight? A. Yes - it was between the young man who took my handkerchief and some others; he was fighting with my brother, and after he beat my brother he took the handkerchief - he did not stay there after he took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not come next day and give up a shawl which you had lost? A. No, it was my sister who had lost that. The prisoner himself knocked me down, and called me a very bad name - my sister had gone up to him, and said, "Young man, give me that handkerchief - that is all I want;" he then called us a very bad name, and knocked us down - the other had beat my brother, but my brother never lifted his hand against him; he said it was of no use, there were so many of them; I was frightened - I said to the young man,"Pray don't beat my brother," and then he took the handkerchief from my neck; I had him in sight about ten minutes. I had a Jew and another person taken on the charge - I have heard the name of Reuben, but do not recollect whether that was the Jew's name.</p>
               <p>Q. And young Duff, who escaped? A. Yes - I had three taken altogether; I only swore to Duff at the office; I did not swear to Reuben. The Magistrate was not going to commit my brother to prison that I know of; he said something to my brother about it; he was never threatened to be committed before, that I know of; I know nothing of 4l. being left with any publican, nor did I go to any public-house about it. Duff was the one who beat my brother in the mouth - I swore positively to him, as positive as I do to the prisoner: it was not proved that he was a mile and a half from the spot.</p>

             take the handkerchief - he gave it to the prisoner, who put into his pocket; I went to him, and said, "Young man, have the goodness to give me that handkerchief - it don't belong to you;" he called me a very bad name: I said, "You had better give it me, or we may see further into it" - he then struck me, my sister-in-law, and my husband: I was quite senseless with the blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whose property was this? A. It belonged to my father. My husband is a bricklayer. I charged nobody with it but Early and the prisoner. I was at Worship-street; two other men were charged with assaulting us - they were a Jew, named Reuben, and a boy, whose name, I believe, was Duff; I said at first I thought Duff was the young man; the Magistrate said, thoughts would not do; I did not hear my sister-in-law swear against Duff - I was out of the room. I did not see Duff do any thing; I was senseless with the blow - I did not go to a public-house - I heard nothing about 4l. The prisoner knocked me down; my husband did not strike them, there were so many; the prisoner struck him before he struck me - they were round my husband about half an hour; there was no mob when I came to myself: he was ill-used about ten minutes before I was struck - I saw the blood come from him; my sister was knocked down first. The last blow I had was from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not a shawl returned to you next day? A. No; Early gave me my shawl before I had the blow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. As far as you know, was the handkerchief ever returned to your sister? A. No - I have not seen it since.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's brother. I was with her and my wife; I saw Early take her handkerchief - he gave it to the prisoner, and I saw it in his right-hand - that was after I was knocked down; I did not see what he did with it. I was knocked down twice before they touched the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you besides a bricklayer? A. I have been taken up on suspicion of being what they call a resurrection man - the last time was about a year ago, and about a year before that - it was only twice, to my recollection; I will not swear I was not taken up four times; I will swear it was not five: I do not know what I was taken for the last time - I will not swear that; I am on my oath; it was for taking out some windows; the first time was for going through Bethnal-green church-yard - on suspicion of a robbery of a place being broken open, where I was at work. I do not recollect being taken up three times before - I have only been three times before a Magistrate - I once was under bail. I took up a man named Duff, but his father said his two sons were much alike, and the Magistrac did not commit him. The Magistrate said he had a great mind to commit me, because I did not swear to the two prisoners the third time. I would not swear to Duff after what his father said.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street day patrol. On the 6th of November I went with Russell to King-street. Spitalfields: he pointed out the prisoner to me, looking out of window; I made towards the house, and the prisoner put his head in; I went up to the room, and the door was fastened. I got a poker to open it, but seeing a loft over my head, I got up there, and saw the prisoner near the chimney.</p>

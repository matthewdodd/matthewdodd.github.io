                  </hi>. I was an inspector of police—in consequence of information, I went on Saturday, 2d October, to a house in Fitzroy-market, which is opposite the Prince of Wales beer-house—five other officers ac<lb></lb>companied me—I occupied the two pair front room of the house—the officers were all placed where we commanded a view of everything that passed at the beer-house—about 10 o'clock in the morning, I saw Freeman and Swift go into the beer-house—Freeman was carrying this parcel, and</p>

               <p>Swift had a child in her arms—they went into the house together—I was in such a position that I could see beyond the door into the house—Swift sat down in front of the bar—Freeman disappeared at the back of the bar, and soon afterwards returned without her basket, without her cloak, and a bow that she wore—she and Swift sat down in front of the bar, and had something to drink—soon afterwards Joseph Sparks and Elizabeth Sparks came in—they went in and out; and Freeman and Swift went in and out frequently—about half-past 1 o'clock, Elizabeth Sparks came again alone; she apparently had some conversation with Freeman, who was in there—Freeman then disappeared at the back as usual; and she returned and received a piece of newspaper from the landlady over the bar, in which Freeman wrapped up what appeared to me to be silver, and gave it to Elizabeth Sparks, who held it under her shawl and came out carrying it in her left hand—she came away with it, and I gave the officer Elliot in<lb></lb>struction to follow her and apprehend her at some distance from the place, not within sight of the beer-house—I still kept watching, and about ten minutes before 2 o'clock, the prisoner Crawford came—he joined Freeman, and they were together a very short time; then Crawford disappeared at the back of the premises and left my view—he soon after returned, and at that time Freeman gave him what appeared to me to be a quantity of silver, which he put into his right hand trousers pocket—they had something to drink at that time—there was a good deal of drink going on during the morning—I observed Crawford go in and out several times, and he met several parties, and gave them something—some of them came to the side where we were, and some of them we saw had money in their hands—there were fifty-three persons went into the beer-house that morning; and I believe only two went for a legitimate purpose—about half-past 2 o'clock I saw Crawford disappear at the back of the place, and he came back and tore a piece of newspaper off the bar and wrapped up something which appeared to me to be silver, and gave it to Freeman—I and Bryant gave the con<lb></lb>stables some directions and we came down—Freeman was proceeding along the street—she turned round, and Bryant seized her—she then had this parcel in her hand in her pocket—she attempted to take her hand out, and I seized her hand and found in her hand this parcel containing six counterfeit shillings—I took her back to the beer-house, where I found Crawford in custody of Cook and the other officers—I called the landlord, and proceeded down stairs to make a search—I went down to the kitchen at the back of the bar—that was the direction in which I had seen the prisoners go at all times—under the window in the kitchen I found this basket, and in it was a counterfeit crown piece and seven half-crowns—the basket was on the floor under the window, and the cloak was laid upon it which I had seen Freeman go in with on her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 104). I was there—I followed Elizabeth Sparks about twenty yards from the house—she was joined by Swift and Joseph Sparks—Elizabeth Sparks passed a paper to Joseph Sparks—he unfolded it, and the white paper was thrown away, and something was handed by Joseph Sparks to Swift—I did not see where he got it from—Swift then left the two Sparks, and went to a butcher's shop, 1 Munster-street—she went into the shop, and the two Sparks waited ten or a dozen yards from the shop—Swift came out and joined the two Sparks again, and they were standing together three or four minutes—Swift then left them again, and she went to Mr. Hook's, 32, Munster-street—she remained there a short time, and then came out and joined the two Sparks again; they had been waiting a short distance away—they went on, and I called another officer, and we followed them to the King's Head in Cumber<lb></lb>land-market—they all went in there together—I went in and said to them, "I am a police-constable; I believe you have counterfeit money about you"—Joseph Sparks said, "I think you are mistaken;" and at that moment I saw Swift drop a purse, which I picked up and found in it four counterfeit half-crowns wrapped separately in paper—we then took them to the station—Joseph Sparks there put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and in it I found this counterfeit half-crown and a mark on it which I believe can be identified by the butcher—there was no counterfeit coin found on Elizabeth Sparks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller, and reside at Stratford, in Essex. On the morning of the 7th Nov., between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was in Stratford—it was between 12 and 1 o'clock in the night—I was in a public house; I got some porter for myself; the prisoners were in the room, and asked me to drink with them—I did so, and asked them to drink out of my mug—I was as sober, after drinking, as I am now—that I am sure of—Smith followed me out of the public house—she made an arrangement with me—I did not consent to it—I went down Stratford Bridge-road; that was in my way home—she went with me—I do not know what you mean by "Did I go with her?" we both walked down there together—I did nothing besides walking; I lost my money; she took it out of my pocket—I do not know what you mean by, "Did I have connection with her;" no other except talking, I stood talking with her for some time—I am not a married man—she put her hand in my right hand pocket and took out my purse, containing a sovereign—I said, "You have robbed me of my money, give it to me;" she said, "You are a b—liar"—I lost a handkerchief besides—two or three minutes after that, Neil came up—when I found I had lost my money, I laid hold of Smith—Neil came up just after, and Smith gave him my purse and money—I saw my puree hang down—Neil then went</p>

               <p>off, and came back in about two minutes after—when he returned I said, "You have got my money, Smith gave it to you"—he made no answer—I detained them both until the inspector came up, and then I gave them in charge—I never saw them before, except by drinking with them—my handkerchief was safe, in my jacket pocket, when I left the public house—it was safe when I was going down Stratford High-street—the purse was not found—that is my handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the purse was a wash, leather one, with two steel rings.</p>

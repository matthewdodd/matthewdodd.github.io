I was serving a customer with some steaks about half-past three o'clock, on the 21st of February, when the prisoner came into my shop - my customer had laid these two shillings on the board; while she was directing me to cut her some mutton chops the prisoner asked the price of a bit of meat, and then went out; I missed the two shillings immediately, and said to the customer,</p>
               <p>"I have lost the money;" she said,</p>

            . I am twelve years old, and live with my mother, under Mr. Woodward's shop. I saw 2 s. on the board near where the meat was - I stood outside the shop - the prisoner took up a piece of meat, and asked the price of it; I then saw her take up the two shillings, and come out directly; I told the boy who belongs to the butcher's shop, and he told his master; I then got an officer - when we came back the woman had got hold of her.</p>

            . I am a constable. The butcher's boy came to me, and told me of the circumstance; I afterwards saw Sheilston, who gave the same account as he has now. I then saw the prisoner, with the other woman walking by her side, who said she was determined to follow her. I found on her 3 s. 6 d., wrapped up in a bit of rag, and 5 1/2 d. in copper.</p>

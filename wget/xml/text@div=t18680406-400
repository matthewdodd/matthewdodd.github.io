I keep the Goldbeater's Arms, Peckham—on 20th March the prisoner came for a glass of ale, and gave me sixpence—I gave him four pence-halfpenny change—about five or six minutes after he left I found the sixpence was bad—I put it in the fire and it melted—I am sure the prisoner is the man—he was in the house ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I picked him out from about seventy at the prison three or four days afterwards.</p>

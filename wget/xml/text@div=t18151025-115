In the course of last month, he was working as such in Mr. Thornton's house; the drawing room was locked up. In the back room, there is an escritoir; I had seen a bunch of rings on an orange ribbon in that escritoir and two watches without glasses, on Monday the 18th. On Saturday the 23rd, the prisoner came down to me saying that he wanted the key of the drawing room door, to paint the edge of the door on the outside, which he could not do unless the door was opened; I said I would come and open the door myself, which I did. After I had done so, he related to me what direction Miss Thornton had given him about the back drawing room on the Wednesday preceding; it was to make good some places where the paint had been chipt off. He had paint to do the front drawing room door, but he had not paint to do the back drawing room. There is a door between them, which door was shut, but not locked. He came down to me in a very few minutes afterwards, he brought the key, but not to me; I was not in the servant's hall at the time; I afterwards went up and found the door locked. - He did not come on the Monday morning to his work at the usual time; I saw him on the premises at about a quarter before twelve. My seting him then, was in consequence of an information I received from one of the painters that somebody had gone up the back staircase; the prisoner had no business up there whatever. When I saw him there, I asked him what he wanted? he was up about fifteen stairs on the first landing place. He replied to my questions, putting his hand before his face, and appearing very much confused, that he did not wish to be seen, as he had been a bad boy, in getting tipsey, and not coming to his work. He then came down stairs, and said he would come to work in the afternoon, after dinner; that would be in about an hour, but he never came. On the Wednesday following, Limbrick the officer, and his master came to me; and in consequence of something they told me, I went to the escritoir in the back drawing room, and then I missed the watches and rings. The escritoir was not locked; it was not usually locked, on account of the lock being out of repair.</p>
               <p>Cross examined. The key of the front drawing room, was usually kept in the housekeeper's room; it was sometimes in the possession of one servant, and sometimes of another; there were sometimes five or six other painters at work on the premises beside the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker. I know the prisoner at the bar; I saw him on the morning of Tuesday the 26th of September. He came into my room as I lay in bed, it was before eight o'clock in the morning; he asked me was I in bed yet? I told him I was; he shewed me a ring on his little finger; I asked him where he had got that from? his reply was, don't you know I am a gentleman. He afterwards said, if I have any money I will give you some gin, and if you will come along with me I will give you some; there was another man in the room. We went out with the prisoner, and he went across Soho square to a pawnbrokers in Princes street, I believe the name is Bartram; in our way there, he shewed me a bunch of rings tied on an orange ribbon, and two watches without glasses to them. I saw him go into the pawnbroker's house, and when he came out, he said he had pledged a ring for twelve shillings. We then went and drank together the greater part of that day; the next day he came to me, and called me a b - y thief, and accused me of robbing him of his money and watch. There was a violent dispute about it between us, and he charged me with a constable, but I was discharged He did not finally take me before a magistrate, but accused me several times in the street. I after that went to Limbric and told him what I have been telling here now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never knew him as a gentleman, nor any body else, I believe.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Did he tell you how he came by these rings and watches - A. He said he had made a good haul at the gentleman's house where he had been at work.</p>

            . I am a salesman, I live in Swallow street; I produce a ring (producing it.) I received that ring from the prisoner at the bar, on Friday the 22nd of September. He came to me at about five o'clock in the evening of that day, and asked me to lend him one shilling and sixpence; I hesitated at it; he then took the ring off his finger, and said, there was security for me, I need not be afraid; he said he would call and pay me the next night, but he did not. I saw him at the beginning of the following week, when he called and asked me to lend him three shillings and sixpence more, and that would make it five shillings, and he would call on the Friday following, when he got his pension, and pay me, and buy something of me. On the Sunday I was reading the paper, and saw his name, and then I went to Bow street. It was a mourning ring.</p>

            , Esq. M. P. It is impossible to identify one mourning ring from another; Mr. Reakes's son married my daughter, and upon her death, both Mrs. Thornton and myself were presented<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250046"></xptr>with similar mourning rings. The ring given to myself, is now in my possession; that given to Mrs. Thornton was in this escritoir, where all the other rings were kept; the other ring belongs to Mary Ann Reakes, and was in the escritoir with the others; it was given to her on the death of her cousin. There were also two watches, without glasses in this escritoir; they cost about ten guineas a piece; their present value I am not so well able to speak to; but I know they are worth seven or eight guineas the two.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Head, of Gloucester-court, Whitecross-street—I keep a stall in the street there. On Saturday night, the 15th of August, I was engaged in trafficking for the sale of a comb, with a young woman—I was told something, and charged the prisoners with stealing a pair of combs—that proved to be incorrect, and I let them go—I then missed four pairs of earrings—I went and found them</p>

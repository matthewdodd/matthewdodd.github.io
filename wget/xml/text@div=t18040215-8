             sworn. - Q. Are you a soldier in the 20th regiment? - A. Yes. On the 17th of January I went to lie down about seven or eight o'clock in the morning; I lodge in the same house and in the same room with the prisoner; I was not very well, and some time of the day the prisoner came up in the room (what time I cannot exactly tell) and went down directly; in about five minutes after that he came up again, and stopped about a minute; he then went out of the room, and took the key out of the room door where I lay; the key was inside; he went to the room facing, and unlocked the door of the landlord's bed-room with that key; after he had unlocked it he went in, and stopped about a minute; he came out, and locked that door; he took the key out of that door, and put it in the same door he took it out of; he came in the room, and staid there a little while, and then went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take off your clothes when you laid down? - A. Yes, and got into bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you see all this? - A. When he took the key out of our door, I got out of bed, and looked through the key-hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you watched him all the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not see what passed in the other room? - A. I only saw him go into the room, and stay about a minute and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him flush of money? - A. No, I never took any notice of that.</p>

               <p>Q. You were not very well? - A. I was not very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to go and peep through the key-hole? - A. To see what he was going to do.</p>

They looked over the third Piece particularly, but at last did not like it. My Mistress shew'd 'em several more Pieces, and at last took down all the Printed Linens on the Shelf. They said they wanted 14 Yards, but when they had pitch'd upon one Piece they would have but 6 Yards; they agreed upon the Price, and it came to 16 s. and Brian gave my Mistress 2 half Guineas, which, my Mistress, having some Suspicion of them, gave me to change. I observed Brian drawing something under her Peticoats with a Hitch and a Hitch thus - but did not then imagine she had stole any thing, for I thought her Peticoat was got loose and that she was tying it up, and I did not care to speak of it because there were some Men in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173306280003"></xptr> Shop. As soon as the Prisoner were gone out, my Mistress look'd over her Goods and mist the third Piece, which was printed with a small Sprig. My Master and some others ran after them down Chiswel street, and I follow'd them into the Black Raven Alehouse. The Linen, it seems, was not found upon them, but they were carried before Justice Robe ; and while they were gone thither Mr. Brian, the Landlord of the Raven, came to me with the Piece of Linen, and said his Maid found it dropt behind a Door in an Entry, thro' which the Prisoners went to be searched; I knew the Piece, by the Shop-mark, to be the same that was lost.</p>

            . I was in the Prosecutor's Shop when the Prisoners were there, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Roper mist a piece of small sprig Linen, and said, Run Husband, Run Father. They ran and I with them, and we found the Prisoners at Mr. Brian's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brian. Were there not a great many People in the House when we were searched?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes, 50 or more.</p>
               <p>P. Brian. The Men searched us in the Kitchen, as far as Modesty would permit, and then the Women carried us thro' a Passage into a back Room and searched us to our Shifts, but found nothing.</p>

            . I only felt on the out-side of their Cloathes thus - and no body searched them any farther in the Kitchen. But the Linen might be folded up so as not easily to be felt by such a slight Search. Mr. Brian's Maid is gone out of the way, I suppose she is bought off, for I was offer'd 12 Guineas, and my Son 20 Guineas to make it up, by some of the Prisoners Friends.</p>
               <p>Court. But was it by the Prisoners Orders?</p>
               <p>Eaves. I can't say that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brian. The Prisoners came to my House and called for a Pint of Three-threads. Presently Mr. Eaves and his Son follow'd and charged them with stealing a Piece of Printed Linen; upon which they were searched in the Kitchen, by feeling about the out-side of their Cloaths; but nothing being found they were taken thro' a dark Passage into the back Room to be searched privately by the Women, and nothing was found on them there neither. However, they were carried before the Justice. Presently after they were gone my Maid,

I took it and carried it to Mrs. Roper's, and her Maid said that was the very Piece that had been lost, and afterwards it was carried to the Justice, and here it is.</p>

               <p>Mr. Brian. Yes, about my Bar there was so many that I could hardly stand for them, but not in the Passage.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see your Maid take the Linen up?</p>
               <p>Mr. Brian. No; but she came out and gave it me directly.</p>
               <p>Court. But her saying she found it there is no Evidence, except she was here to swear it. Where is she?</p>
               <p>Mr. Brian. She's gone out of the Way, under Pretence of going to see her Mother.</p>

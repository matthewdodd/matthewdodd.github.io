                  </hi>. I live in Hampshire-court, Whitechapel-road. On yesterday week, in the evening, I was in the taproom of the Three Neats' Tongues in Pearl-street—there was Crawley and Hayes, and Connolly and his wife, and some others there—I saw Daniel O'Brien there—I knew him, he was a fur skin dresser—they were sitting round the table, and drinking and singing—there had been some pots on the table, but they had been taken away by the potboy—O'Brien was not doing anything that I could see—he stood up at the end of the table—the prisoner was in the room all the time; for an hour I could see him there—he was in the room when O'Brien was standing up—the prisoner took his coat off, and took a quart pot, I could not see where from, and struck O'Brien two strokes on the head—I could not see what part of the head—he was about the length of his arm from him—I could not see any one between him and O'Brien—O'Brien fell down, and the prisoner struck him a second blow after he was down—the prisoner was sober, and O'Brien also—I afterwards got a policeman, and the prisoner was not in the house—O'Brien had done nothing to the prisoner before he struck him that I could see.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Pearl-street; I was at the Three Neats' Tongues—I was not in the taproom, all I know is about taking the man to the doctor—I have known the prisoner five or six years; I never saw any harm of him—he is a peaceable man.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the taproom; I had been there from half past 8 o'clock in the morning, till half past 8 o'clock at night—I did not see O'Brien struck—I did not see the potman come in—I was subpœnaed here, but I know nothing about it, I was full of liquor at the time—I have known the prisoner ten years—he has had a good character as a peaceable man and always had a good character amongst his neighbours.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the taproom part of the time—I left about half an hour, and came back—I did not see the man hurt, but I saw hint taken out—I was not in the room when the blow was struck—I had left the room—there was a bit of a quarrel, one party was on one side, the other on the other—if any one said anything, they were told to hold their tongue—I did not see any blow struck, but I saw the woman with two pots in her hand—that was Connolly, I think—there were three pots on the table—the potman came in and asked for the pots, and she took the two, but what she said I do not know—the potman took the pots, and I followed him, I was glad to get out—they were all fighting—I saw O'Brien when he was wounded—the man who was wounded was in there when the pots were in the woman's hand—he was not then wounded—I then went out—when I came back I saw him sitting on the seat, and the landlord was washing his face.</p>

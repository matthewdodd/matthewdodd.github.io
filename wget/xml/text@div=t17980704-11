               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say for what period? - A. I cannot recollect that; I remember his returning to Coleraine to her own brother; they took a house, and lived in Coleraine together; I resided about four miles from Coleraine; they lived together about nine weeks then; Mr. Forsyth then failed, and shut up shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When was that; in what year? - A. The very same year he was married; then he went to America.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know any thing of Mr. Forsyth after he went to America? - A. Yes; he returned back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then return again to Coleraine? - A. No; he returned to his wife at Ballymouthree again; that was in less than two years after he left Coleraine.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say how long he resided with his wife then? - A. Better than a month, and perhaps two.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps six? - A. No, I will not say so much.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it nearer two months than one? - A. Yes, I am sure he did at that time.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Buller.

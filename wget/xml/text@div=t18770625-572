                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer's assistant at 55, Duke Street, West Smithfield—on Friday, 25th May, I was in Newgate Street, about 8 p.m., and going towards Cheapside on the left hand side of the way—I saw two <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> go towards Holborn Viaduct, a yellow and a green one—they were near the General Post-office, and I was near King Edward Street—the yellow one was about the middle of the road, behind the green one, which was near the kerb on the left hand side, and both were going at a furious rate, though I am no judge of the pace of horses; they were gallop<lb></lb>ing—after they had passed me, I turned back and saw them in collision—I walked back and saw the large wheel of one <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> caught in the hind wheel of the other, and one of the horses was down with its leg nearly on the pavement, but I cannot say of which <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—there was a man and a barrow against the kerb on the left hand side, going towards Holborn—he was knocked down and run over, and the hind part of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> was turned round towards the other side of the road—I attended to the man and took him to St. Bartholo<lb></lb>mew's Hospital—I did not see a mail cart.</p>

I did not see the <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> for any great distance; they were going faster, than they usually travel—I should call 20 miles an hour a furious rate, or anything above seven—I saw them about two seconds and they went over about 40 yards—I believed what I said in my depositions about the horse in the Bayswater <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> being dragged down to be true, but I did not notice the colour—I saw the barrow go down before the man—the first I saw of the man was when he was in the road.</p>

I live at 42, Queen's Road, Dalston, and am salesman in a cigar warehouse—on 25th May I was in Newgate Street, near Warwick Lane, about 7.45 p.m., going west on the south side—I heard a noise, and turned and saw a yellow and a dark green <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> very rapidly driven—they were nearly level with each other—the yellow <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> was nearest the kerb—I should say "furiously" would be the proper expression as to their pace—I saw the deceased pushing a barrow along near to the kerb, and going west-ward, and away from the <hi rend="italic">buses</hi>—the driver of the yellow <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> tried to pull into the centre of the road when he was near the barrow, but the dark green <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> was in the way, and their wheels got locked—it seemed as if the dark green <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> was urging the other forward, and the yellow one could not get out of the way of the deceased, and the horses knocked him down and both wheels passed over him—the barrow was over-turned on to the pave<lb></lb>ment</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Charlotte Buildings, Gray's Inn Road, and am the son of Patrick Twohig, who was fifty-six years of age—he used to go about the streets with a handbarrow selling fruit—I saw him on May 25th at 7.45 p.m., in Cheapside, with his barrow—I was sent for from the hospital late on Friday night, where I saw my father very much hurt—he died on 4th June in the hospital.</p>

               <p>found his left thigh was fractured, and there was a severe contusion of the right thigh and other injuries, especially to the head and fingers, such as wont be caused by being run over—he died in the hospital on 4th June the cause of death primarily was congestion of the lungs, brought on by the injury.</p>

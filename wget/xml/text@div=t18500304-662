                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker, of the Waterloo-road. On Satur<lb></lb>day night, 3rd Feb., about half-past eleven o'clock, I was at the Flying Horse, Walworth-road—I met two friends named Skelton there, and went into the tap-room, and had some porter—the prisoners were there—they followed us out towards the Elephant and Castle—we went into a pie-shop—the prisoners came in—Cole asked me if I would give him a pie, as he had not had anything to eat these two days—I put down half-a-crown, and asked for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of pies—I was deep in conversation with my friend—he told me Pollard had taken the change up—I told him to ask him for it—William Skel<lb></lb>ton asked him, and he said it was all right—Skelton said there would be a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> if we stopped to have a <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> about it—I and Skelton went into the London-road, and turned down York-street—William Skelton stopped at the corner to make water—I was knocked down in York-street, and kicked, and saw Pollard seize me by the throat, and he nearly choked me—the other two prisoners rifled my pockets—I lost five half-crowns, some small silver, and a gold pin out of my stock—I was insensible for a minute or two—when I came to myself, they had escaped—William Skelton came and picked me up.</p>

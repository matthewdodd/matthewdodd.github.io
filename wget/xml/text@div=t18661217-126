I am a warehouseman in the employ of Humphries and Sons, of 19, Skinner Street, carpet manufacturers—on the night of the 23rd October I left the premises locked up and safe—on going there the following morning I found that the inner door had been broken open—it appeared that the warehouse had been opened by a false key—I have seen one or two pieces here to<lb></lb>day that I am certain were placed against the door the night previous—it is part of the prosecutors' property, but not the whole of what was missed—the value of the whole that was stolen was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the value of the property found is 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 9, Wharf Road, Caledonian Road—I let the house in lodgings—I let the front parlour to the prisoner in the early part of this year, January—I think a female was with her—on the night before the officers came I heard a noise like putting down a load in the prisoner's room over my head, but I was so busy at work that I did not pay attention—I said next day to her, "You had some goods or property come," and she said, "Yes, my husband was buying and selling at an auction room, and when the auction was closed he was obliged to bring home what was not sold"—after she had lived there about two months and a fortnight, a man used to come there—he lived there as far as I know up to the time the prisoner was taken—I did not see him on the day she was taken, but I heard him next morning.</p>

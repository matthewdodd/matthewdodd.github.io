                  </hi>. I am a grocer's assistant, at Walworth. On Sunday evening 14th Aug., I was opposite the King's Head in Walworth-road, about five minutes before 11 o'clock—I had a watch in my left hand waistcoat pocket, and a purse, and some money in it in my other pocket—I was standing still against a post—the prisoner Jones passed behind me, and she said, "Well, my dear, where are you going?"—I said I was going in—she said, "Will you take a walk a little distance?"—I walked with her a little distance down the Walworth-road, and into York-street—when we got there she said, "Just come up here a little way"—there is a turning there, called James-street—I went in that turning with her, about six or seven yards from the corner, she then placed one of her hands under my waistcoat—I placed my hand on my pocket, where my purse was—my watch was secured by a guard round my neck—a shortish young man passed just at the same time that the female was talking to me, and I had my hand on my purse—that was a short young man, not the male prisoner—as soon as the young man had passed, the female placed her hand on my watch guard—she took the watch out of my pocket—I saw her break it from the swivel of my guard—I got hold of her wrist directly, and said, "You have taken my watch"—she said, "I have not got your watch"—I said, "You have"—and I was trying to get it from her, and the male prisoner came from the corner and knocked me down while I was trying to get the watch from the female prisoner—I had not seen anybody at the corner before he appeared and knocked me down—I pulled the woman down with me when I fell, and the man placed his hand</p>

               <p>across my throat, and he said, "You ought to be ashamed to strike your wife in this manner"—I had not struck her at all, but I kept hold of her wrist and tried to get the watch from her—the man placed his hand on my mouth—I turned my head, and called "Murder!"—some people came up, and as I got up I let go the woman—the man made his escape, and the woman followed him—she left her shawl and handkerchief behind her, but not the watch—I took the shawl and handkerchief, and went after her—I overtook her, and said, "You have taken my watch out of my pocket"—she said, "I have not"—I caught hold of her, and a man said, "Hold her tight, I will go for a constable"—I held her till the constable came up.</p>

I remember being in the Walworth-road, near the King's Head public house, on a Sunday night in August—I do not know the date—I saw the prosecutor standing against a shop door—I passed him—I came back to the corner and saw him again, and the female prisoner with him—I saw her face—shortly after, I went down York-street as far as the corner of James-street—when I got to the corner I heard a cry of "Murder!"—I turned round the corner on bearing that, and I saw the prosecutor and the female lying on the ground—I saw the male prisoner; he bad his knees on the prosecutor's breast, and his hand on his mouth—the female struggled to get away—I saw she had a watch, and she gave it to the male prisoner—he ran away—I told a man who was there to call a policeman—I have not always told the same story that I have now, because I saw the state the woman was in, and I took compassion on her—I felt for her as if she were my sister, but she has offended me since—I told the Magistrate the first time that I did not see the male prisoner—the female was in her confinement; I took compassion on her, but she has offended me since.</p>

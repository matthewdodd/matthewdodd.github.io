I knew the prisoner by sight before, but did not know his name. The other of them presented a pistol to my head, and demanded my money. The prisoner put a pistol to my left breast, and demanded my money. They took from me 4 s. 6 d. some half-pence, and a Pinchbeck metal buckle out of my right-foot shoe, and an iron tobacco-box. They demanded my watch; I told them, I had none. They searched, but found none. Then they went on towards the turnpike, and I went home. I looked the prisoner full in the face, and knew that I had some knowledge of him. I cannot be positive to the other. I went to Sir

            , that was tried this session, and the prisoner. I took them in Black-horse-yard, East Smithfield, in his own room; there I found two horse pistols, an iron crow, two cutlasses, and two dark lanthorns in a box. ( Produced in court.) One of the pistols was loaded with a ball, the other with slug shot. They were examined the next day; the prosecutor came in and looked on the prisoner, and said, I am sure that is one that robbed me.</p>

He was pretty much in liquor; he staid with me all that night, till nine the next morning; it might be a quarter after.

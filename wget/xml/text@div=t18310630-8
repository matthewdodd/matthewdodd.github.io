I went out about eight o'clock in the evening of Sunday, the 15th of May, leaving my mother in the house - I saw the front parlour window was shut when I went out; it is a sash window - I cannot tell whether it was fastened; there were inside blinds to the window - I returned home about ten o'clock, and saw a man at the door; I do not know what he was doing - the door was shut; I did not speak to him - I examined the door after he went away, and saw some chalk marks on it; I had not examined it when I left - I went into the house; my mother opened the door to me, and on entering the parlour, I saw the prisoner in the act of jumping out of the window, which was open - I had not looked at the window before I went in; I ran out at the door, saw him in the garden, and followed him - I did not lose sight of him till I gave him in charge, which was about twenty yards from the house; it was dark - I am sure I did not lose sight of him from the time he left the garden.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was the window fastened when you left the house? A. It was shut, I do not know whether it was fast - the man at the door asked me if Mr. Taylor lived there; I said No - he then went out of the garden, asked me what number the house was, and I said No. 69; he said that was not the house - I did not lose sight of you; I never said the window was not fastened - I do not know whether it was or not.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the night of the 15th of May I heard a cry of Murder! about one hundred yards from Mrs. Sills' house - I ran up directly, and saw the prisoner in conversation with Mr. Sills and another man; it was rather after ten o'clock at night - I searched the prisoner, and found a phosphorus-bottle, some matches, and a small piece of candle on him; I went into the kitchen, opened the area window, and found a handkerchief and hat down in the area - the prisoner owned them directly I brought them up; he was without a hat when I took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to your merciful consideration.</p>

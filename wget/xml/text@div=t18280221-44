On the 5th of February I went to bed about twelve o'clock, leaving the house all secure. I was alarmed in the morning, at half-past seven o'clock, or near eight, by a servant and a lodger: I found the dial was gone from the middle room, where they had made an entrance by the side window: the bar was broken open, and I missed the property stated in the indictment. When I went to bed the bar was locked and bolted - they took a shutter down from the middle room window, and made an entrance; the shutter had been fastened by a screw, which was removed. My lodger is not here. I have not seen any of my property since, except this silk handkerchief.</p>

I am no thief!" I said I did not say he was, but it was on suspicion of breaking into the Crispin; he tried to get away - his hat fell off, and this handkerchief fell out of it; I took them up, and put them on his head again; his hat fell off again in Honeysuckle-court, with the handkerchief in it; Jennings then took it up, and put the hat on his head, but kept the handkerchief; we then took him to the watch-house: I had seen him before several times - he used to go about with baked potatoes; I do not know that I had seen him at Corcoran's for perhaps a month.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 5th of February, he went to the play, and came home between twelve and one o'clock- he had his supper with us, and asked his mother to mend his trousers - when he had had his supper he went to bed, and did not get up till a little after seven the next morning, when I called him myself - he is always in the habit of sleeping at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you live? A. At No. 14, Crown-court, Grub-street, near the prosecutor's; I have two sons and one daughter: the prisoner slept in the garret - no one else slept there; one of my children is in service and the other is an infant. I do not know who had been to the play with him that night; there had been two or three of them together: he had some bread and cheese and porter for his supper when he came home; he went to bed first, then I went, and my wife last. There are three rooms in the house - I sleep below stairs: there is a lodger in the first floor. The street door opens into a passage, not into the lower room; my son might have come down stairs, passed my room door, and gone out, but when I called him in the morning he was in bed.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How old is he? A. Seventeen; his father got up first the next morning, to take up his trousers, which I had mended the night before, for he had nothing to put on. I know it was on the 5th of February, because he was taken up the next day.</p>

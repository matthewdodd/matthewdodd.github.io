I was asked again, and gave the same answer. When I came nearly opposite Wellington-street the officer produced a handkerchief, and begged I would look at it in a shop - it was mine, and was in my pocket when I left home. I found the prisoners in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Sepulchre. On the 25th of November I was in the Strand, about six o'clock in the evening, and saw the two prisoners, in company with another, at the end of a court in the narrow part of the Strand; I went into a passage opposite to watch them, Mr. Harrison came in a direction towards the City, and passed the court where they stood, immediately all three came out, and followed him closely. I saw Goldie put his hand into Mr. Harrison's pocket, the other two covering him - he took a hankerchief out, and gave it to Oram. I immediately seized them. Read, who was with me, took Oram, and charged him with having the handkerchief; he said he had just picked it up - at first he denied having it. Read took the other. I sent a watchman after Mr. Harrison. I then went up to him myself, and he claimed the handkerchief.</p>

            . I was with Thompson, and saw the prisoners, with a third person, in the court, they followed Mr. Harrison. I saw Goldie go between them - the others covered him - Thompson was nearer than me; I could not see what they did. I laid hold of Oram, the other two ran away. I seized Goldie about fifty yards off - I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>GOLDIE'S Defence. I saw a mob, ran across the road; they collared me, and took me into a shop. The gentleman cannot say whether he dropped it or not. The officer said there were four of us in company.</p>
               <p>ORAM'S Defence. I was coming along the Strand, in the scuffle I picked up a handkerchief, and put into my my pocket. I stood still to see who had lost it.</p>

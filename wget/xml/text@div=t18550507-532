                  </hi>. I am assistant to James Wood, a woollen draper, of No. 79, Bishopsgate-street. On 25th April, about a quarter to 8 o'clock at night, some person came into the shop, and said something to me—I ran down Skinner-street, and saw two men running from Bishopsgate-street, towards Long-alley, which leads into Bloomfield-street and Worship-street—the prisoner is one of them—he had a piece of cloth under his arm—I was not near enough to see whether he had all of it, but it was dark, and they were some distance off, running—they turned down Angel-alley, which leads into another alley, which leads into Long-alley—they were out of my sight not two seconds, but during that time they must have chanced it from one to the other—when I saw them again they were in the alley leading from Angel-alley into Long-alley, and were still running—directly they got into Long-alley they separated, and one went one way, and one the other—the other man got away—the prisoner stopped suddenly—I found him stopped when I got into Long-alley—he appeared out of breath when I came up to him.</p>

               <p>said, "I am not going any further with you now"—he got away from the posts, and struck me on the head—I caught hold of his hand, and he tried to strike me again—I threw him down, and kept him till a policeman came—I afterwards missed four lengths of woollen cloth, of two yards and a half each, from inside my master's door—I had seen them safe five or ten minutes before I received the information.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 25, Tenter-street, Spitalfields, and am a cigar maker. On 25th April, at a little before 8 o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another go into the prosecutor's shop—I am sure the prisoner is one—they stood by the shop—one of them went in, took a piece of cloth, and ran away; and then the prisoner went in, took a piece of cloth, came out, and they went up Acorn-street—the prisoner then passed the cloth that he had to the other one—I went into the shop, and said something, and Walker came out and ran after them—I followed, but went up another street, and then found the prisoner stopping by a post—Mr. Walker said, "Come along with me"—he said, "I will not," and he struck Mr. Walker over the head—I was there when Mr. Walker got up to him, and saw him seize him, and bring him to where the posts were, and then he would go no further.</p>

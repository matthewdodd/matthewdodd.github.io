On the 5th of October I came to Smithfield and brought a brown gelding my own property, for sale; I came on Thursday night to market I was at market on Friday between two and three, as I walked the horse up and down <placeName id="t17930529-100-crimeloc559">Smithfield market</placeName>

I saw his horse, but I refused it, I told him I did not want to rap, I came to sell; I left him then; as I rode the horse up and down the market there were several people asked me the price; I told them it was six guineas, I would not take no less, unless it was one shilling to drink, whether I sold him or not; then in a little time after, Sanders said, if I would rap my horse for that grey horse that was in Laugher's possession, he would give me the six guineas; I thought that was the same as if I sold my own; he pulled the money out of his pocket, some money, I cannot say how much, in gold and silver, and shewed me, I made him some answer and held my hand out for the money; I think he said, do your business first; I accordingly asked Laugher whether he would warrant his horse found or not? Fife was not there then; he said he would warrant it found; I agreed to the exchange, and exchanged with him; I told him before I took him into my possession I would have a man to give judgement of the horse; accordingly we went and tolled the horses where the horses are tolled, Sanders went with us, and in a short time after we were there Sanders quitted the room again; I don't recollect what passed while we were there, he then left another man to vouch for him, Laugher was along with him the mean time, we were all three together; when I came out again my brown horse was gone, it was tied up at the rails within three or four yards of the grey horse; when I came out I asked where my horse was? Sanders said he was safe enough; I then asked him to give me the money which he proposed for the grey<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290177"></xptr>one? he wanted me to untie this horse from the rails.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you? - No, Laugher untied the horse from the rails he took him from the Toll house, he took him on the left hand from the Toll house, he went to the bottom of the market, and turned up on the right hand; Sanders then took the horse into his possession, and told me to take my horse; I told him it was no horse of mine; then he wanted to shove the halter into my coat at my breast; then he let the halter go, and went off. The horse was there a little space of time, and I asked a man, who I saw there, to take hold of the horse, and I took it up to the Toll house, to take the horse to where he said he lived, and where he brought it from; I got the directions, and when I came out there was a man came up to me and said, farmer, you have been taken in here by a snitch. I went with that man to a public house in Long-lane, where I saw Mr. Fife and three or four or five more, I cannot say exactly, I saw Mr. Fife when I got to the door, and he acknowledged the horse was his, and said it was his servant that had transacted this piece of business with me; he was very sorry that it had happened into a poor man's hands like mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you the six guineas? - No. Then I wanted the money, he said I should not be the loser of the horse, he said he had not got the money about him then. I was very much vexed to think of the loss of my horse; I told him I would behave like a man to him, if he would give me five guineas ready money I would take it; he had offered me a note of six guineas for the money of the horse, he told me he would give me a note of hand where to find him to-morrow morning, and then he would pay it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you mean a note of hand? - A direction in writing Accordingly I refused taking it, several times I refused the note of hand which he wanted me to take.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he offer to give you? - He told me he put down in it five pounds five shillings, for the horse; I took that note; I brought the note away with me down to Fleet-market, to Mr. Clipson's in Fleet-market, the Bull and Garter, next door to the prison gates. I cannot read any writing; I am sure that is the paper he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he gave you that note what did you understand that note to be? - He read it me, and told me where to call on him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say this was? - He said it was a note of hand for five pounds five shillings, and told me where to call on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he tell you to call on him? - No. 6, Harp-court, Fleet market.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note ever paid? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any of the parties after that? - I saw Sanders as that happened on Friday, on the next Friday following, at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see him at Guildhall? - I had taken Laugher at Black Heath Fair, on Thursday after the Friday, I went and fetched a constable, and took him up, and brought him to Guildhall, Sanders came to Guildhall to bail the other out, Mr. Alderman Clarke was the magistrate, then Sanders was apprehended, and he was taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards before you saw Fife? - I attended here four sessions, and I had attended here two sessions before I saw him first.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man? - I believe he is the man, but I cannot positively swear, but to Sanders I will swear to</p>
               <p>Q. When was Fife apprehended? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Who apprehended Fife? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about the man? - have none in the least, but I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290178"></xptr>swear positively he is the man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gardiner. How long was it you first saw Mr. Fife afterwards? - Five or six or seven months, when I first saw him after this transaction.</p>

               <p>- CLIPSON sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Fife? - I cannot say I do; he came to me five or six times along with Mr. Mincher.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note. Have you ever seen that note before? - Yes, I have.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever go to Fife the defendant with that note? - I was with him about the note; I did not see him at the time; I had a writ against him some time afterwards and then I mentioned it to him; he said he had given such a note. The first night Reeves had been to sell the horse in Smithfield he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to Fife about the transaction? - The day after the note was taken I went to demand the money; I told them if the note was not paid they must abide the consequences; I told that to Mr. Mineher; I saw Fife about ten days after, and arrested him; he wanted me to let him go; I told him there was a note also of a poor countryman's at my house; after that he sent the money for the note, and I went down to Mr. Reeve's one Sunday with the money, and he said he would not take it, he was advised to trouble him for horse stealing.</p>
               <p>Q When you saw him ten days after this transaction, you told him you had a note against him, due at your house to one Reeves, what did he say to that? - He said he would pay it as soon as possible with some other little matters, and also the writ I had against him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gardiner. Mr. Reeves himself sent you to demand the money for him? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. First of all he accepts the note, and the note not being paid he charges him with a felony? - I believe it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. You did receive the money to pay this note some little time after of

What was it that Mr. Fife said, as exactly as you can recollect on this occasion, when you mentioned what he said about his servant? - He said it was his servant transacted this business with me, and he was very sorry that it had happened into such a poor man's hands like me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know he was a serjeant of mace for the City of London? - I knew he was an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to him in hopes he would get the money for you? - I told him the story, and he offered his services first.</p>

               <p>Q. You know if you had convicted them at that time, you would have been entitled to a certificate? - What do you mean; I don't know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. Then attend to me. Supposing you had convicted them, do you know that you would have had an exemption from parish officers? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Fife he gave you the note, and he said that the other person was his servant, Laugher was his servant? - Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. There was nothing said about Sanders at that time? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You applied to Clipson as your friend? - I did.</p>

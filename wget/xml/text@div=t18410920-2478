                  </hi>. I live in Eaton-court, Regent-street. The prisoner lived in the same house—I lost my quilt out of a drawer in the back-parlour—the prisoner had no right in my room—the quilt was found out in the court—I went to bed at twelve o'clock—I was awoke at half-past two by my lodger coming in—he said, "You have got a woman in the room"—I said, "I don't know that I have"—he said, "You have a drawer open"—I got up, and missed this quilt—I keep matches in my room, which the prisoner knew.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a groom. I came home at two o'clock on Sunday morning, found the prisoner in the prosecutor's room, and door open—I struck a light, and found her concealed under the table—I got hold of her, and said, what took her there—she said she came for a few</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went out to provide for Sunday. My husband was not at home when I came back; I knocked at the door, and said, "Mr. Southam, will you he so kind as to give me a lucifer match?" he never spoke. I had some things in my apron, and Gibbons gave me five lucifers. Mr. Southam sat up in his bed, and said, "What woman have you got here?" Gibbons put his arm round my neck, and tried to kiss me. I went up stairs, and Mr. Southam hallooed out, "Here is the quilt." I had taken off my apron and laid it down, with the beans and bacon and bread in it that I had bought My window does not open, it slides.</p>

The prisoner stated to me that she went for the purpose of asking for some lucifers—I went into her room, and found a box in her table-drawer, with some matches in it—both the witnesses were sober that night—when the prisoner went to the station she had four or five matches in her hand.</p>

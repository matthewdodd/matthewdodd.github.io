As I put up my arm for the gentlewoman to lay hold of it to get out, I perceived the slap of the boot go up. As soon as the lady let go my arm, I went to the side of the boot and saw the prisoner, he had got the trunk from the bottom of the boot to the top of it. The prisoner was not the person I had observed before.</p>

               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Not before that night.</p>

            ? - Yes. He had hold of the box and got it from the bottom to the top of the boot; I cried out stop thief! he immediately let it fall, it fell edgeways in the boot.</p>
               <p>Had he got it out of the boot? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he meddle with it again? - No. I ran round the horses after him.</p>
               <p>He was taken up afterwards? - Yes. I lost a box that cost me 20 l. before. I received this box from Mrs. Irwin.</p>
               <p>(It appearing in evidence to be only an attempt, and not an actual robbery, the prisoner was not put upon his defence.)</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, Mary Mead? - A. Only from her coming to buy half a pound of candles, on the 5th of February, about nine o'clock in the evening; when she came in, she said she wanted half a pound of eights candles; I handed her the candles, and she gave me a seven-shilling piece; I carried the seven-shilling piece to my mistress, and I said to her, that woman is a strange customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the seven-shilling piece? - A. I did not take particular notice of it; my mistress gave me four shillings, and five sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing remarkable about the shillings or sixpences? - A. One of the shillings was bent one way only, the others were flat, and the sixpences likewise; I gave the silver and a halfpenny to the prisoner, and half a pound of candles, which made up the seven-shilling piece; when she had got the candles, she said she never gave more than ninepence a pound for the candles; I said I could not sell them for less than elevenpence a pound; she took up one shilling and laid it down again; I took up the money, the four shillings and the five sixpences back again; upon her saying that, I supposed it to be the same; I did not look at it; I took it to my mistress; my mistress found the bad shilling; then I took the bad shilling back to her; I said she had changed one of my mistress's shillings; she began to stutter, and could not give me a plain answer; she was like as though she had an impediment in her speech.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that shilling you brought from your mistress? - A. I laid it on the counter, and was sent out for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know enough of that shilling, which you brought from your mistress the first time, bent as you described, and the shilling that your mistress complained of, how was that bent? - A. The shilling that I first gave her was bent one way only, whereas this was bent two ways; the officer has that shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. You fetched the constable did you? - A. Yes, his name is Kinnersley; he took her into the private room to search her; the constable called me, he thought he heard something fall from her; I looked, and I found a shilling by the right-hand corner of the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a shilling was it? - A. The same shilling that was passed on me, and was changed for my good one.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was the good shilling found on this woman afterwards? - A. No, it was found in her mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the four shillings here? - A. I have got none of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you know whether the four shillings are good or not? - A. My mistress looked at them particularly; I did not; I took them from her as good ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether good or bad you do not know? - A. They were all good to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of them at all particularly? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any marks about any of your shillings? - A. Yes; one was a bent shilling, bent all one way.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the four shillings all good ones? - A. Yes, I am quite sure they were; and so were the sixpences; I saw Clayton take the change to her; the partition between the back room and shop is glass; he came back almost immediately to me, with four shillings and five sixpences.</p>

While he was gone, she told me she did not think it was a bad shilling; I told her it was, and that it was not the shilling that I gave her; she asked me to let her look at it, and I gave it to her, and she put it into her mouth, I observed two shillings in her mouth; and after she had put this shilling into her mouth she laid me down my own shilling again, and said, I do not think it is a bad one; I told her, no, that was not, for that was the shilling that I had given to her; then the officer came, and he saw it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the shilling that was produced by the officer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the shilling, that you saw afterwards by the officer, the shilling that was brought back to you from the prisoner? - A. It was; it was bent both ways.</p>

               <p>- KINNERSLY sworn. - Q. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable: I was sent for on the 5th of February, I went, and saw the prisoner in the shop, I was informed that she was a woman that passed bad money; I took her into a back room, I told her I must search her, I searched both her pockets; she stood with her left side towards the fire, and she put her left hand up to her mouth and chucked something into the fire, upon which, I heard the found of money; I immediately called for assistance, and Clayton came in, as there was no other person in the room but myself, I was positive there was money of some sort, either in the ashes or in the fire; Clayton looked in the ashes under the fire-place and could not peceive any thing; I said look in the fire, he found this shilling in it, and he took it out with the fire-tongs, and delivered it to me, I have had it in my custody ever since; I searched her every where but found no bad money: she had half-a-guinea, a seven-shilling-piece, and three-pence, and some soap, the money was good, and marked with a Y; she was very insolent and saucy at first, afterwards she behaved very well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Have you searched a great many for uttering bad money? - A. Yes, three before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find half-a-guinea, and a good many seven-shilling-pieces on their persons? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor will you ever in your life again. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Clayton.) Q. Is that the shilling that you took out of the fire? - A. It is; and it is the shilling that I took to my mistress the second time with the change.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutrix.) Q. Look at that shilling; Is that the shilling that was brought to you by the last witness? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Clayton.) Q. You know it by its colour, do not you? - A. I know it by taking it out of the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is whether this is the shilling that you took to your mistress from the prisoner, and you know it by its colour? - A. I know it by its being bent.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it by the colour? - A. It was not of this colour at first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. If this had been burnt for seven years it could not have been a worse colour.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Kinnersly.) Q. Have you not got another shilling? - A. Yes; I should have produced it, but it was not called for; I received this from Clayton. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To Clayton.) Is that the shilling that you received from your mistress, being one of the four shillings? - A. That is the self-same shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutrix.) Look at that shilling, and tell me whether that is one of the four shillings that you gave to Clayton? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Mr. Franklin.) Q. Is that a good shilling? - A. That is doubtful.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. One is a bad shilling, and the other is doubtful.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. (Read in Court.) My Lord, and gentlemen of the Jury. Unfortunately situated as I am, in such a perilous situation, I have not the least fear or doubt of hearing the voice of the Jury say not guilty, instead of the contrary; you are, gentlemen of the Jury, to decide in my case, and that which I am charged with in my indictment you will see cannot be supported; namely, that I came into the prosecutrix's shop, to utter a bad shilling, knowing it to be so, when the contrary is the case, as hereafter I shall prove, by a fair representation of simple facts. On the evening stated in the indictment I went into the prosecutrix's shop to purchase some candles, for which I tendered a seven-shilling piece; the boy took it into the parlour; when the change was produced by the boy, I found that I was charged more for the candles than I could purchase them for elsewhere, the difference being only one penny, and the boy would not take any less than he asked for them by the pound. It is here to be observed, that I never refused any part of the change, nor, to the best of my recollection, had I any reason to do so; the prosecutrix came out of the parlour, and she said that I returned to her a shilling that she did not send out from the parlour to me, and she added that I was in the habit of so doing; I said, I would be very happy to have the charge investigated; upon which the prosecutrix sent for the constable; he declared it was all good; she ordered the constable to take and search me, and I, conscious of my innocence of the charge, readily submitted, the result of which was, that I had no bad money about me, nor any less money than the seven-shilling piece for the purchase of the candles,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200057"></xptr>but there was a half-guinea and a seven-shilling piece found on me, which I had when I went into the prosecutor's shop, and which was returned to me as being good and lawful coin. Now, gentlemen, what case they could find to ground my indictment upon, I declare to God I know not. They should have had the whole of the change brought into Court, and you would have heard the result of its examination, to see whether any part of such change was bad; this is a material part of my defence. On my examination at the Mansion-House, I understood they intended to support the charge against me, though I am ignorant upon what ground. The constable said, that, during the time he was searching me, he heard something that jingled, or made a noise like money, in the fireplace, and he called the prosecutrix's boy to search for it; and between the constable and the boy they found or produced a piece of burnt metal of some sort, which they said was the same that I uttered to the prosecutrix, which was impossible, and which the following facts will contradict: for the change which I received from the prosecutrix she had returned to her, though she said it was not the same she sent out; but the transaction proved it otherwise, as she had the change examined by the constable, the consequence of which was, he said it was all good; and she had the full change previous to the finding of this piece of metal, that she, the prosecutrix, nor any one else could identify, and for which I am at present indicted for my life; my prosecutrix was satisfied that I had returned to her all the change, and it was good. Upon these facts, I rest assured you will find me not guilty, which an English Jury, I trust, will; and I, as in duty bound, shall ever pray.</p>

I was in Mint Street on the morning of 22nd December, where I saw the prosecutor walking with two women—I saw the prisoner take his cap off his head—he stood a few minutes, and as I neared him he ran away—I was about 15 yards off—I afterwards apprehended him, and charged him with assaulting the prosecutor, and robbing him of his cap—he said that he was taking a walk—it was about 1 o'clock a. m.—there was a lamp near—I had seen the prisoner before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Norwich Court. Smithfield, and was in Mint Street, and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner standing with him—I was on the kerb, and they were in the road, and I see the prisoner take the cap off the sailor's head and strike him on the face and run away—I am perfectly sure the prisoner is the man—he called my companion a so-and-so mare because she told him not to hit the man.</p>

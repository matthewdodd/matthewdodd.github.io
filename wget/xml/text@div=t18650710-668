I am servant at the London College of Divinity, St. John's-wood—on 24th of last month, I went to bed about 12—I sleep in the college—I and my wife occupy the kitchen of one of the houses—there are two houses—all the doors of my house were fastened—the clothes I took off I put on a chair by the bedside—the next morning I mussed them—the matron called me between 6 and 7 in the morning—I went out after finding my clothes had gone, and I saw the window of the larder open, and saw an old pair of shoes inside on a hamper—on going back to the kitchen I missed my college-coat, and another coat of my own—I also missed five little fancy boxes, which were about the kitchen—these boots and braces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—they were safe on the 24th—I don't know whether this larder window was open or shut the night before—it was not under my charge.</p>

On the 24th of January I sent him to Friar-street, Blackfriars-road, with 14 lbs. of tea - he never returned; I received this letter on Monday, which I believe to be his hand-writing - (read).</p>
               <p>"DEAR SIRS, Monday Morning.</p>
               <p>"I have this moment taken up my pen to write these few lines to know what your pleasure is concerning me; for my conduct deserves great punishment; but the dread of leaving my poor mother, when she gets past labouring for her bread, and it being my duty to assist her in her distress, and last hours compels me to make this supplication to pray of you, if I confess to you where I took the tea, on Thursday, that you will have compassion on me this time; for I do not ask you to employ me again, for if I am at liberty, and please God to raise me up a friend, I should, to the atmost of my power, try to make you amends as soon as I possibly could; for the dread also of being confined in a place where the worst characters are, might soon be the cause of my death; for I am sure to be made the sport of those who could hear. I am afflicted it is true; but I am sure I could never be sent out of the country, for my hearing is gone, and I could not hear any evidence against me; so I beg of you, that if you have any compassion left for me, you will never hear the like of me again. I pray your forgiveness for the sake of my dear father, whose awful death you are well acquainted with. Pray forgive me! for God's sake, do - for the sake of my being the only friend that my dear mother and sister have to reside with them; and I pray God blessing on your heads, and may you live to see me yet become a useful member of society: for I promise this time, once for all, by God's blessing I will never enter the cursed ale-house again; and will ever pray for you, is the penitent and humble prayer of the unfortunate, disobedient and unfaithful servant,</p>
               <p>"J. H. RAVER."</p>
               <p>"I would beg of you not to name my conduct to nobody no more, as you will yet see me be a honest man. Pray take my word for it. Amen."J. RAVEN."</p>

            . I took the prisoner in charge - he told me he had sold the tea to a Jew for 32s., and he was sure his master could not punish him, for no Jury would punish him, as he was deaf; he said he would point the Jew out to me - I went to a house he described, but found no Jew there.</p>
               <p>The prisoner being deaf, had the evidence communicated to him in writing.</p>

My husband keeps a confectioner's shop at Hammer<lb></lb>smith—on 4th February, about 8 o'clock, I served a person named Pitts (<hi rend="italic">See next case</hi>) with two Banbury cakes, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he put down a florin very quietly, and held two fingers up, saying "Two"—I tried it with my teeth and found it soft and gritty—I laid it down and said "This is a bad one"—he took it up and gave me a half-crown, saying "It is good"—I do not know which he meant—I gave him the change, four coppers and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he left with the cakes—just before he left, my husband came in—he followed Pitts.</p>

Mr. Woolmore called me and I followed Pitts, who he pointed out, and saw the prisoner join him about a quarter of a mile from the shop—they walked in company about 80 yards, saw me behind them, and went down a turning together and took different directions—I got assistance and took the prisoner—I told him I should charge him with being concerned in passing counterfeit coin—he said "No me"—I took him to the station and found on him a bad florin and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good silver, 13 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and eighteen postage stamps.</p>

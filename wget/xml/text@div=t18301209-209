            . I am a police-constable. On the 4th of December, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was in Tottenham-court-road - I saw the prisoner walking at a moderate pace; I saw she had a bundle, and I saw the ticket of the price of these boots outside - I asked what they were; she said a pair of shoes she had taken from a shop merely to have a lark - I asked where she had them from; she said she would show me - we went to several shops, but could not find which it was till we came to Mr. Wilcoxon's, who owned them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far was she from the prosecutor's shop? A. About three hundred yards - she was not in liquor; I cannot swear she had not been drinking - she gave me her right name and address at the watch-house.</p>

            . These are his boots, and were safe in his shop at half-past eleven o'clock, on the 4th of December-I did not see the prisoner till she was brought back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she not appear as if she had been drinking? A. I did not notice her particularly - she gave her address, and that of two women who had gone away.</p>

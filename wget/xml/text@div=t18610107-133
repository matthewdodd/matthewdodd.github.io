On the afternoon of 29th Decem<lb></lb>ber I went to the prisoner's premises, 66, Milton-street, where he carries on the business of a marine-store dealer—I said, "Do you know anything about receiving any flour lately?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Where is it?" or, "From whom did you receive it?"—he said, "From a man I do not know; a man was coming up here on Thursday evening; it was very slippery, and he was loaded very heavily; his</p>

The Prisoner fir'd twice at the Servant, who had it in his Power (his Gun being loaded with small Shot) to have made a Cullinder of his Scull; but not knowing the Law, he miss'd him, and kept a little out of his Way; whereupon he heard the Prisoner say to the other, D - n is, we'll kill or be kill'd; we won't be taken alive: Let's turn upon them and fire; our Lives are as good as theirs; which made him charge his Gun again, and put some Pebble Stones into it, with which he hit the Prisoner behind the Head, who immediately fell down and was taken. The other Highway-man was also taken by another Mr.White, no Relation to the former, who was accidentally upon the Road, and being appris'd of the Matter, leap'd over the Ditch and pursued him, with his Hanger drawn: Stephens seeing himself hard put to it, presented two Pistols to him, who thereupon bid him fire, but told him, if he miss'd, he'd cleave his Scull; whereupon, seeing his Companion already taken, he surrendred, and dropt his Pistols. They had two Musquetoons and a Screw Pistol, of a particular Make, and very unfair, one of them being loaded with 3 Bullets, and the others with 2 each. The Prisoner in his Defence said, the Horse was lent him, and to prove it call'd two Persons, one of which swore, Four Men came in November last to his Inn, where they put up their Horses, and one of them (which was that mention'd in the Indictment) being lame with a Cut on the Knee, one Smith came to him, and desir'd that a Farrier might be sent for to cure him; and then they all went away, and left him for that Purpose; and being cur'd, Smith's Brother came and paid for it, and had an Order to deliver the same to the Prisoner; which was confirm'd afterwards by the Farrier, who receiv'd the Money for his Cure. But this making nothing for him, the Court being of the Opinion they were all Accomplices, which the Jury considering, brought him in <rs id="t17160113-40-verdict211" type="verdictDescription">

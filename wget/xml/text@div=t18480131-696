                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman, and live in wellingtos<lb></lb>terrace, Waterloo-road. On the morning of 1st Feb. I met the prisoner near the Lyceum Theatre—I had never seen him before—he invited me to accom<lb></lb>pany him to a house—we went to the Brunswick Hotel, Bow-street, Covent<lb></lb>garden—we went into a bed-room—two pints of wine were brought in at dif<lb></lb>ferent times—while we were drinking the first pint, and while the servant was gone for the second, the prisoner put a ring on my finger—I afterwards saw the top of something in his left breast—I asked what it was—he took it out—it was a pistol—I asked why he carried it—he said, for protection; that he had heard of a gentleman some time ago who went with a lady who robbed him—we went to bed—I got out again at the bottom of the bed—as I was getting out, he said if I got out of bed he would <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for me—I thought he was only joking, and got out—he got out, and took the pistol from the sofa—I said, "Oh, you do not mean it!"—he said, "Don't I?" and presented the pistol at my face—I instantly stooped down, and he fired the pistol—he got hold of me by my left arm to pull me back, and said he could fire once more, and then he would <hi rend="italic">make a do</hi> for me—I escaped out of the room—he was afterwards taken, and I saw the place where the ball ad gone through the wall—it was about the height of my shoulder from the ground.</p>

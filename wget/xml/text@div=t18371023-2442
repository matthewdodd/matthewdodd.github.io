                  </hi>. I live at Camberwell. The prisoner was about a month in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> service—we keep two servants—I spent the evening out on the 6th of October, leaving Miss Smith at home—I returned about twelve o'clock, and Miss Smith gave me information—I was retiring to bed, and observing the prisoner's bed-room door open, I requested Miss Smith to go into her room—she found her up, though she had been sent to bed a very long time, and I requested to know what she had done with the two hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs that were missing—she said she had put them under the bed in Miss Smith's room—when she went to Miss Smith's room, they were not there—I insisted upon having the handkerchiefs found—she said she supposed they were in the kitchen—I followed her there—she looked about—they were not found there—I followed her into her bed-room</p>

               <p>—she took her keys from the basket, and unlocked the box, and took out the handkerchiefs—she turned some more of her clothes out—there was nothing more found belonging to me—she said, "There are your handkerchiefs, God knows I have no need of gentlemen's handkerchiefs"—I desired her to walk into the parlour—she said she hoped I would not notice so trivial an affair—I then called for the officer, who went with me into her bed-room—I was there—I requested Miss Smith to look over her things, and the officer found a pair of socks, which are my property—both these handkerchiefs were found in the box—they are both mine.</p>

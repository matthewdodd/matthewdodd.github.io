On the night of 30th July I fastened the premises in the usual way; I saw the doors all secure, and I took the keys—I sleep in a small room—in the course of the night I heard a noise, and got out of bed, but, as I had heard noises before, I went to bed again—I then heard a louder noise, and I got up, and alarmed the young man up stairs; he went down with me, and I found the front door open, and lots of matches about; on the table there was a dark lantern; in the counting house there were chisels, a crow bar, a knife, and a pair of goloshes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Rees. On 31st July I got there in the morning, at half past 5o'clock—I do not sleep on the premises—I went there, and found the house broken open; about 1000 yards of silk were missing, 300 or 400 handkerchiefs, and three table covers—this piece of silk (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in the stock on the day before; here are 26 1/2 yards of it—this is a quantity we never sell—I know the pattern of it—here is where the ticket was, which corresponds with the place where we always put it, and we always use a particular gum mark—the ticket is never taken off when we sell the silk—it is here partly taken off; from what remains I am able to say that it is our mark—the usual way is to pin the mark on; we always gum them.</p>

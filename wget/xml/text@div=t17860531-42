               <p>Prisoner Shemmell. The words were that I was not to be taken from my family.</p>

I never said any such words, Umpage and Nunn were present and heard me; Shemmell said, if I would go with him to his house, he would shew me, and he took me to his house in Gresse-street, and there I saw the things in the indictment; I knew the planks. (Deposed to.) He confessed taking one of the planks, and that the others were mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner Shemmell's counsel.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the prisoner, that if he made a confession, the clearer it was, the more lenity he should have? - I said the more free he was in making his discovery, the more lenity he should expect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat, prisoner Grist's counsel. How do you know that mahogany from a great quantity that is in this town? - Because that board has been through my hands several times; it was cut in my shop; I had the whole tree.</p>

Bamber said yes; then I met Andrews with two pieces of beech on his shoulder; I went directly to the prosecutor, and told his servant, and the servant called him up, and I went and shewed him the house where the boards were put, and we went away; I saw the prosecutor the next morning, and we went to this house and searched it; I went the next morning after Bamber was taken, Shemmell was in the yard of the house.</p>
               <p>What did the prosecutor say to Shemmel? - He asked him if he had not got some mahogany; he told Mr. Campbell where it was; Campbell said to him, he should be glad if he could find the wood, and Shemmell said, if he would go along with him, he would shew him the wood; Campbell said to him, he had better be free and open, and he should have all the mercy the law would allow him; we did not find these planks in the house where they went the morning before, but we went with Shemmell to his house, the prosecutor and me, and

It is to be observed, that the foreman Andrews had the whole and sole care of the job, buying the stuff, cutting and converting it as he thought proper; and likewise paid me on a Saturday night; and upon my refusal of his orders, I must have lost the job.

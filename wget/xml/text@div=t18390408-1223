                  </hi>. I am the wife of last witness. The prisoner took our lodg<lb></lb>ing in the name of Stirling—Hughes came late in the evening—they lived there five or six weeks—I know Mr. Theleur quite well—I have seen him at our house several times—in consequence of some communication one day, I went up stairs, and found the prisoner, Mr. Theleur, and another gentleman there—Mr. Theleur had sent for my husband up stairs, but he was lot in the way, and I went up—Mr. Theleur said, "I wish to see Mr. Davis, to state to him that Mr. Hughes is the lawful husband of Mrs. Hughes, and Mr. Davis must look to Mr. Hughes for his rent"—I, of course, was much surprised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why, they had been living in your house as man and wife, had they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They had been in the house together, certainly, as man and wife, but I was surprised at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she say any thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said, "Tell Mrs. Davis, Mr. Theleur, did you not give me away?"—he said, "I did," that he spent the day with them, and they were married at Marylebone church—they both said so—Mr. Theleur remained there till after their dinner was over, if he did not dine with them—he returned again about ten o'clock that night, and all three left together, about twelve o'clock, in a coach—Hughes had left a day or two previously, which he did, occasionally—they did not leave for good then—their conduct that night was so very out<lb></lb>rageous, I said to her, it was an unseasonable time to be leaving the house, and I should fasten the door—she said, "No, you shall not; I shall come in when I like, and go out when I like, and have as many visitors as I like"—she returned at three o'clock in the morning, in company with Mr. Theleur and the other gentleman—this was in the early part of December—I do not think they stopped a fortnight after that—we gave her notice the next day to quit, in consequence of her conduct—Hannah Jordan is my servant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you at the police-office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not—I knew my husband was going there to give evidence—I knew then what I have stated to-day—I knew it previous to the prisoner leaving my house—I did not tell Mr. Hughes about it—I told my husband long before he went to Bow-street—the prisoner took the lodging in the name of Stirling—Hughes came the same night with her—he went by the name of Hughes, and she by the name of Stirling—mine is a respectable house—it struck me as odd that they should have different names—I did not ask for any explanation on the subject, as I did not know what Mrs. Stirling had told my husband after she came to the house—she had not exactly taken the lodging of me, she had seen my husband when I was away—I knew she took it in the name of Stirling—we did not know Hughes's name for a day or two after he came to the house—it was named to the prisoner—when she took the apartment she said she was separated from her husband, and, as such, she could not marry again, I did not know Hughes was coming when she took the lodging—they lived together as man and wife five weeks in my house,</p>

               <p>and were a great nuisance all the time—she told me Hughes was her hus<lb></lb>band, but I did not believe it till Theleur said he gave her away—she told me so after she said she was separated from her husband and could not marry again—I asked her to explain that, and she said, "I am married to both"—she said so repeatedly while she was in our house—she told me so about three weeks before Theleur told me he had given her away—we did not believe her—she continued to go by the name of Stirling—she occa<lb></lb>sionally went by both names—both Mrs. Hughes and Mr. Theleur told me they were married at Marylebone church—I never heard Hughes say so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of the prisoner's father. I am not related to the witnesses—a day or two before the prisoner's apprehensions she called on me—I had before that been to Doctors' Commons—I told her I understood she was married to Hughes—she at first denied it, but after-Stewards admitted it, and said, "Well, but if I am married to him, what can phen do? he can only imprison me for a short time, then I shall come out as much his wife as ever, and then the suit can go on in the Ecclesiastical Court the same as ever."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you go before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I informed Mr. Humphreys, the solicitor, about this a few days ago—he sent for me—I do not think I had mentioned it to any body before, but I will not say I had not.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you make a representation to her, that if she could get two re<lb></lb>spectable persons to sign a bond that she would not'pursue Mr. Stephen in the Ecclesiastical Court, he would not follow up this prosecution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nothing of the kind—she said she would do any thing he would require of her to let her out—I said, "You know he would not take your word for a straw"—she said she would do any thing—I said, "If you got any body to go to him to offer to be bondsman for you not to trouble him, perhaps he might do so."</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the gaolers of the office at Bow-street. After the prisoner was examined the first time, she was put in the lock-up place adjoining the office—she asked me if I would let <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> in, (meaning Hughes)—I told her she must make application to the Magistrate—she said, "I wish you would let <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> in, for he is the only man I ever loved"—the prisoner was present when Hughes was examined; and after taking her back to the lock-up place, she said he had better have admitted it, and the hoped he would not make such a fool of himself next time—that was in allusion to his examination.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">A long letter from the prisoner to Mr. Stephen was here read, entreating his forgiveness, and promising never to trouble him if he would cause her to be liberated. There was nothing in it admitting a second marriage.</hi>)</p>

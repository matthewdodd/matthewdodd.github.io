               <p>with regard to the missing packet, addressed to Mr. Davis—I went to the inspector's room with the comptroller, and the prisoner was asked to turn out the contents of his pockets—he turned out several articles, money, a little pocket book, and several other things, and Mr. Tull asked him if he had anything more—I cannot say whether he said "Yes "or "No"—to the best of my knowledge I then placed my hand upon his coat, and then he searched his pocket, and from the left hand pocket, which was nearest to me, he took out a packet, and said, "Here is something here, but for the life of me I cannot tell how it came there"—I had felt something at the corner of his pocket—I was not before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any boys near you - A. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to you as you were walking - A. As I got up to Pear Tree court I had a blow on this side of my head.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a blow on the side of your head - did you see where the blow came from - A. I did not; it was from a person behind me; it was not a violent one, it stunned my ear; immediately after that my hat and my veil went right off my head.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a hat was it - A. A round hat, made of straw.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you call it a hat - A. Yes, it was a turban hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a different thing from a bonnet - A. Oh, yes, sir, it is; it was not a bonnet, it was a hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the veil over this hat, as you call it - A. No, it was pinned inside; I had pinned the veil to my hair and the hat was over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not have gone off with the blow - A. No, it was pulled off.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the veil was pinned to your hair and not to the hat - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe next - A. I directly turned round and saw the person run up the court that took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean, you saw a person run up the court with a hat in his hand - A. Yes, and the veil.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see him take it off - A. No; he ran up Pear Tree court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of his person so as to know him again - A. No further than by his dress; he had on the same kind of a jacket as he had on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then after he ran up the court - A. I lost sight of him; this was on the Sunday; I did not see him after till on the Tuesday when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether at all the same person that you saw on the Tuesday was the same person that you saw running - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. You only saw the back of him did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Walford. You say this was in the month of December, and in the evening - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You received a blow on the side of your head - should you suppose it a blow, or occasioned by some person snatching your hat - A. I had a little baby in my arms, just five months old; it was not a violent blow; my hat went off immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a person that made a blow at you, the sensation of that would be very different from a person taking your hat - A. I believe it was both.</p>
               <p>Q. The veil was under your hat, could a person see that - A. Yes, they could.</p>
               <p>Q. Must the person behind have seen the veil, or not - A. Yes, they must.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in Turnmill street, that is a street very much frequented - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any persons passing and repassing at the time - A. I saw no person; I hooted out stop thief; no person came to assist me; the hat was put on without any fastenings, but the veil was pinned.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you before Mrs. Fieldhouse or behind her - A. We were both together; the prisoner was behind us; he crossed over the way first and then crossed over again, and come behind her, and hit her a blow on the side of the head, I saw him do it; I saw him come behind her and hit her a blow on the side of the head.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he hit her with - A. With his fist; then he took the bonnet and veil off and ran up Pear tree court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe particularly how his hand went when he hit her - A. He clenched his hand and hit her, I saw him; I am positive sure it was him, I run up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110019"></xptr>the court along with Mrs. Fieldhouse; the court is a thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run through the court - A. There are three places where he could go through. Another man ran round with me to see whether he came out of a public house; but he did not.</p>

               <p>Q. How happened you to be watching him, and to see him cross over the street - how happened it that you did not look strait forward - A. I heard somebody behind, I just looked back and saw him, I knew him, living in Sharp's alley.</p>
               <p>Q. As it was dark how could you see him - A. I could see him; there is a shop there with a light, they call it the Flying Pleman's, he sells pudding; that was close to where it was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he doubled his fist to make this blow - A. I am quite sure that he doubled his fist; he took his fist to give the blow, and his other hand to take the bonnet off; it was both at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not draw his hand back, but put his other hand and took the bonnet off - A. Yes; that was the way it was done.</p>

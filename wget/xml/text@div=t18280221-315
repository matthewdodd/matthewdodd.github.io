            . I am the son of Richard Early, who tenanted the house of Mrs. Campbell; I and a friend let it to the prisoner, by my father's consent; a paper was drawn up; the prisoner took possession of it; I was all over the house the day before; I gave him possession; I am a plumber, and repaired the flap at the top; I was all over the roof; it was in a good state; the lead would have lasted for many years - the cistern was in a good state; it was a heavy substantial one - the lead pipe was in a good state; part of it was quite new - there was no reason to remove any part of the lead. The prisoner took possesion on the 5th of September, when he signed the agreement - I have not been there since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where is your father? A. At home; he is a carpenter and builder; he is ill; I do not know what is the matter with him; he was out yesterday; he knows nothing about Gray; he is under Dr. M'Donald's hands; I am not a carpenter - I swear all the lead was in perfect order, when the prisoner took possession; it had been repaired about two months before by myself and brother, who is twenty-six years old; he is in the same line of business; he is not here. The prisoner was to take the house as a tenant at 45l. a year, then there was a written agreement made, and I believe he was to take the rest of my father's lease - I never examined the house after he took it; I have been to the door; he took it for four years and a quarter - my father lives with me in County-terrace, New Kent-road.</p>

            . I am a labourer; I live in Essex-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner applied to me two or three weeks before Michaelmas to take the lead off the top of this house, in Devonshire-street; he came up while I was at work, and told me to cut the lead off the flat and cut it to pieces; it was the lead which goes over the roof to protect it from the wet; there was no plumber there - the prisoner went away and left me at work; the lead was put into a cart, in Devonshire-street, by the prisoner's order, about twelve o'clock in the day - the cart drove away; I was afterwards employed by the prisoner to take away the lead of the sink, which was fixed; that lead was very bad indeed - it was cut up and put down in the yard; it could not be used again; I said nothing to him about it, but did what he bid me - I took a leaden cistern away from facing the kitchen window; I chopped it up and put it into the kitchen; I said nothing to him about it; the sink and cistern were carried out in the cart; I helped to load it; the prisoner paid me for my trouble - I was there again nearly three months after, but took nothing more away; there was a leaden gutter went under the floor; I took that up by his order, and it was taken to a plumber's place, and I came away, leaving the prisoner there; nothing was said about selling it in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anything done to repair the roof from which the lead was taken? A. We pitched some part and, were going to pitch the rest, but the rain came on, and it came through the ceilings; a tarpauling was put on one night, and some boards were put on - they partly kept the rain out; Mr. Gray slept in the house; only the first floor bed-room was furnished, besides the kitchen - there was no servant there; I was there nearly every day - I do not know why the tarpauling was moved - it was only there one night; I left the premises before Christmas - they were in the same state as I put them in in September.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you white-washed and painted about the house? A. Yes; some part of the lead was very bad; I cannot say whether it was fit to remain there; the cistern was in very good order - the other things were bad: Gray remained in the house all the time - he did what he could to keep the wet out: he did not direct me to conceal anything; it was all done in open day.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was any repair done while you were there? A. A trunk was afterwards put from the top of the house, to carry the water away; the flat would not last many years. I am not a plumber; I was bred to no trade - I am no judge of the state of the lead: there was no pipe put to carry the water to the trunk. The house is two stories high - I painted and washed the kitchen, nothing else; I only painted the dresser - the trunk was put up about a month after I moved the lead - it was a wooden pipe, down from the bottom of the house to the top.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. I came to London on the 10th of September, and met the prisoner at the Poulterers' Arms, Leadenhall-market; I got into conversation with him; he said he knew my brother; I said I wanted a house, or part of one, as I was coming to town, and I and my brother were to live together; he said he had a small house, and should have part of it to let; I went there on the 15th of September - he took me into the kitchen and the first floor; I saw Walkington chopping up lead, and bending it into a small compass; the prisoner took me to the second floor, to show me the apartment, and then on the top of the house, and while I was there he ordered Walkington to rip the lead from the top; I left Walkington there, and came down with Gray; a genteel man was in the shop, whom Gray said was going to have the parlour on the first floor - we all went and had some thing to drink; a person then came for the prisoner, and we all went over to the house; there was a cart in the street; the man said, "I have come for the lead;" he asked me and the young man to help put it into the cart, which then went away; the prisoner then said he had some business to look after, and told us to go to the public-house, and he would come to us in half an hour; I did not go, but went away. On the 17th my brother came to town - we both went on the 18th, and took two rooms on the second floor; I slept there that night, and next night the rain came through so much, we were obliged to go up to the third floor, to put things to catch it; we told Gray of it next day, and he said it should be repaired. In about a fortnight I saw Walkington cutting up the gutter, which ran through the passage; Gray was about then generally; the first floor was taken up to get at it - it carried the water into the sewer: it was cut into pieces - it looked to me a good thick pipe; I staid there about eleven weeks - the house was never repaired; we repeatedly told him of the water coming through, and some boards were laid on the top,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210152"></xptr>which kept it out a little - there was a wooden cistern, and a wooden gutter; the flat on the top was never repaired. I saw Gray one Sunday morning, putting some pieces of painted paper on the top, to make the rain run into the trunk; I asked if he did not intend to put the lead on again; he said No, he should give it a good pitching.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where do you live now? A. In Swan-street, Minories; my brother is a carver and gilder - I live with him; the lead in the house looked very good lead; nobody could call it bad lead - Gray never told me to keep anything secret; every thing was done in the day time; I did not know the landlord. - The lead was taken off before we went there, but he said he was going to replace it directly; he put a new wooden spout up.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You heard him order the lead to be ripped off? A. Yes, and he said there should be new lead; it would have been better for us if the lead was left on - there was nothing in its place but paper pitched.</p>

            . I live in Somers-town-terrace. I am a house-agent and appraiser; I went to this house, and put a man in possession, by Mrs. Campbell's direction, on the 22d of January - I went on the roof, and saw all the lead taken away, and the fencing gone, so that any person might have fallen off; I then went down stairs - the water was running down the walls - the ceiling dropping down, and the whole house in such a state as would strike a person with horror - it was occasioned by the lead being removed from the top; the cistern and leaden pipe were gone; a wooden trunk was put up, but that was not to be compared to the value of the lead; Gray called on me on the Friday following - I asked why he took the lead off the house; he said there were several holes in it, and that the cistern fell down - I had put in a distress for 44l. 10s.; the effects were valued and sold for 13l. 5s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the rent due from Gray or Early? A. From both, I suppose; I did not see the lead before it was taken away, and cannot say it was lead; there were no repairs done.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you not communication with Gray? A. Yes, he spoke of it as lead; I was not there after the 29th - no repairs were done then.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a written defence, stated that he had bought the fixtures, and given his acceptance of four months to Early; that he found the premises dilapidated, and got Mr. Cole to survey them; that he had not moved the lead for his own benefit, but that it was done in the course of the repairs.</p>

            . I am a carpenter and builder. I have known the prisoner many years; I surveyed the house, No. 4, Devonshire-street, in September last, by his desire - I found the back part in a most dilapidated state - it was weather boarded, but the boards were quite rotten - the lead-flat leaked in three or four places, and had bagged the ceiling under it; there was an old lead pipe down the angle of the weather-boards - it was in a very bad state, and had rotted the weather-boards; it was necessary to have them repaired - the pipe must be taken down to repair the boards; the sink had rotted the boards underneath it, and was stinking; nobody could have lived there comfortably; the floor was not rotten, but damp through it; I have been there within this fortnight; there was a water-closet, the pipes of that were bad - I suggested what repairs I thought necessary - I certainly considered the repairs necessary, considering he had four years and a half lease to run; the prisoner has commenced the repairs, and was going on with them - he bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He did not get you to look at them before he took them? A. No; he called the day after; I sent no notice to the landlord of what was to be done; I advised him to carry the boardwork higher, and make a lean-too roof; to remove the privy, and suggested that a woodden trunk, well-pitched, would carry the water off the top; I advised the removal of the sink, and a stone one has been put up - I saw that about a fortnight ago, since he has been custody - I do not know when it was done; the cistern was in the way, and I thought a wooden one would answer the purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not in two days have had fresh lead put on? A. Yes, but I advised him to have it done different; he lived Islington before that, and at Holloway, four or five years ago - he did what I advised him; the water appeared to have come through the ceiling recently - the stains were on it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he do what he could within the time? A. Most assuredly; it would cost him a considerable sum to do all I advised - I think the lead would not have sold for what he has done.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and have been so twenty years; I was employed by the prisoner; I saw the lead-flat of the house - it was in a very bad state, cracked in ten or twelve places; I put my trowel under it, and tore it up very easy - it did not appear to me to have been repaired for eight or ten years; a crack or two might have been repaired; the ceiling was stained, bagged, and the wet had come in; the boards had given way, and the ceiling had sunk down; the lead was too heavy; I advised him to put on tiles - he ordered me to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were attacked with the gout in your stomach? A. No; the prisoner was; that prevented his attending to it for four or five weeks, and he recovered it temporily during the time - I knew he was ill; I saw the cistern that evening in a good state; he said the sink stunk; I advised him to remove it, and have a stone one; I fixed a wooden cistern over the sink - I moved the privy, and made a new cesspool; the gutter was removed, as it was then unnecessary; and I repaved the yard; he repaired the place as much as I would have done for myself; my account was 12l. or 14l. - the lead was not worth more than 6l., according to my idea of it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When was you called to view the premises? A. Two or three days after he went in; Early was not apprised of the alterations - I should think the lead weighed eight or nine cwt. I advised that the gutter should be taken up; the wooden cistern was to be leaded - the stone sink was put up the latter end of September - it was in the yard, visible to all; he has paid me partly for what I did - I should think him 20l. out of pocket.</p>

            , I am a plumber. I saw the lead on the flat, and had orders from Gray to repair it, but it was impossible to do so, the boards under it having given way - it leaked in more than twenty places; I advised him to take it up, and send it to a lead merchant, and take new lead - it might have been done in two or three days, and I expected to hear more of it, but I heard he meant to have a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210153"></xptr>tiled roof, and that would be 5l. out of his pocket after selling the lead.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. But was it done? A. No; there was some painted paper put over; it would take eight or ten days to make the tile roof - the cistern did not stand safe; the bearers were not strong enough to support it - it must be taken down to have new ones - it leaked in half a dozen places - the pipe must be taken down to repair the weather-boards, and would not go up again; the repairs would be to his loss - a new wooden pipe was put up; the leaden one was very bad; it is worth more than the new one; but the wooden one is most useful.</p>

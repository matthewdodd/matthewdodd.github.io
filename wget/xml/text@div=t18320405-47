On the 25th of February, at a quarter before three o'clock in the afternoon, I was looking through my window, and saw the prisoner and two other persons come to my stall; I saw one of them lift up these two folios and give them to another person - I cannot say who lifted them up, but I came round my counter to pursue the one who had them; the other three met me at the door - I set off to run after Dunbar, who had the books, but I was tripped up by one, who I believe to be Marriott; I got up, and pursued Dunbar with the books - I took him about one hundred and fifty yards up Jubilee-place; the other three came up, and one of them said,"D - n your eyes, what are you going to do with my brother?" Mr. Hobbs came to my assistance; I can swear Marriott was one of the party.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Jubilee-place. I had just dined; I saw Dunbar go by with these two books, and the prosecutor following him - a man came up, and said, "What are you doing with my brother," and struck the prosecutor - I took hold of him; Marriott came up and said to me,"Don't hurt him" - I said I would not, but Marriott' got him from me, and I secured him; I had seen Dunbar before, but I believe, of late years, he has followed an honest life.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

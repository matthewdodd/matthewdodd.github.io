                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Travis, and keep a hatter's shop at 24, Greenwich-road—on Saturday right, 9th April, about 11 o'clock the prisoner came to my shop, with a young man and a woman—they came in as a party, and the prisoner asked for a felt hat—he looked at several and tried them on, and then the young man said, "That would fit your brother Harry," and the woman said, "Have a good one, and don't stand for a sixpence"? they then pointed to one in the window, and pretended they wanted that one—I came to the window to get it—it is a small glass door which opens—when I put my head and arms through to reach the hat they were all three close to my right side—I took the hat out that they selected, and when it was tried on, they did not know what excuse to make to get out of the shop—I was quite sure that something was wrong, and I directly felt in my pocket, and my purse was gone—I said, "If the hat does not suit you I will change it in the morning"?I was standing by them, and I saw they were trying to get out of the shop—I had my purse safe not two minutes before they came into the shop—there was about 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, in it, or a little more—I called to my sister, and said, "My purse is gone," and then I turned to the prisoner, and the one who was with him, and said, "You have stolen my purse, and you shall not leave this place," and I stood before the door to prevent their going out—the other man then pushed me by the shoulder, and they all three got out—a great number of people followed them from the street—I saw the pursuit, and saw the prisoner brought back to my shop—I told him he had robbed me, and he said he had not got it about him—no one had been in the shop between the time I saw my purse safe, and when these persons came in—they were all sober.</p>

I live at Camomile-street, Greenwich—on Saturday, 9th April, about 11 o'clock, I was passing Mrs. Travis's shop—after I had passed I heard some one say, "I have lost my purse; they have got my purse," and after that I saw the prisoner running away, and another man in front of him—I pursued both, and called out—two young men stopped the prisoner; I did not lose sight of him—he said when he was stopped, "What do you stop me for?"?the young men said, "What are you running for?"? he said, "I am running after the other man"?he was taken back to Mrs. Travis's shop, and given in charge.</p>

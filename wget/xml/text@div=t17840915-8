             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoners came to my house on Saturday evening, the 4th of this month, it was about eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Did they come together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What passed after they came in? - They asked to look at some ribbon, I was speaking to a Gentleman, I desired the young chap that stood near me to shew them some, which he did.</p>
               <p>What did you observe after that? - As soon as he had taken the drawer before them, I went to the opposite side of the counter to speak to some other women, I served them with something, and they went away.</p>
               <p>How many were there of them? - There were two.</p>
               <p>Were they at the same counter? - No, they were at the opposite side.</p>
               <p>Then these two women went away? - Yes, Sir, I went round to my man, and he told me the prisoner had stolen something.</p>
               <p>What did you do? - I stood and chatted a little bit, then I went and stood with them, they asked to look at something that was up stairs, and I sent a man for it, and I went to speak to the man, and I observed Williams going up to the window and extricating something from her cloak, and putting it under a hat that lay in the window, and put the hat over it again; as soon as I came up I looked about me, and I saw a piece of lace laying upon the ground, near Williams's feet, I took it up, and told her it was pretty clear to me what she had been at, and that I should send for a constable; she assumed a great deal of innocence, and told me I must be mistaken, as if I knew her or her connections, I could have no suspicion of any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Did you send for a constable? - I did.</p>
               <p>Were both or either of the prisoners searched after the constable came? - They were, and a piece of ribbon was found on Wilson, and nothing upon Williams, they were taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Council. Mr. Pearson, I believe you can explain to us a little, the history of this very extraordinary indictment, I understand it was prepared by your express desire, so as to be sure of these people? - To be sure, I wished to punish, I was to lay the indictment as strong as I could.</p>
               <p>I must have an answer; was it by your express desire, and with a view that these people might be capitally convicted? - I do not know that it was, I did not know the nature of laying an indictment.</p>

               <p>I advise you now; I know you out of this Court to be a very honest man; was it not by your express desire, for the purpose of catching these women, by hooks or by crook? - Only in general terms, I desired it to be laid as strong as it could.</p>
               <p>I ask you upon your oath, whether you did not desire this might be laid capitally, in order that there might be a capital conviction? - No, Sir, but in general terms, that the indictment might be laid strong.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to say, that you did not expressly desire it might be laid capital? - I did not; only in general terms that it might be laid as strong as it could.</p>
               <p>I believe that was an after thought, after the commitment? - No.</p>
               <p>They were not committed for a capital offence? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when you was before the Alderman, whether you did not say, that you could say nothing about the fact?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150032"></xptr> - Nothing more than what I have said at present.</p>
               <p>Whether you did not expressly say so before the Alderman? - I stated just as I have stated it at present, before the Alderman, I only said this, what I had to say would not materially affect them.</p>
               <p>I am instructed, you said before the Alderman you knew nothing of the fact, except by the information of the boy? - I said before the Alderman, I considered my evidence would not have a sufficient effect.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not, say before Alderman Hart, that you knew nothing of the fact, only by the information of the boy? - I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to say that you did not? - What I understood to be the fact, was that of seeing them absolutely stealing.</p>
               <p>Then, Mr. Pearson, will you say that you was examined to these facts, which you have now deposed to? - Exactly so, as I believe, I have no doubt at all, I believe it mounted to the same it does now.</p>
               <p>You are sure you gave the same account before the Alderman you give now? - Just so.</p>
               <p>Then this cannot be true, that upon your telling the Alderman that you knew nothing of the fact, you walked aside, and that your boy succeeded to your place, and gave an account? - I do not recollect any thing about it, it was exactly as I have stated it now, and I was examined and sworn upon it, it amounted exactly to the same thing I have said.</p>
               <p>I believe that Gentleman was present? - I believe he went away before I was examined.</p>
               <p>Then you was examined after your boy, and the constable, and every body else? - I believe I was.</p>
               <p>After the prisoners were taken from the her perhaps? - They were taken from the bar, the Alderman had left the chair, and went into another room; and the prisoners were taken from the bar.</p>
               <p>Were you twice examined? - Not upon oath.</p>
               <p>Was not you once examined before your boy? - No, I was not, something might be said.</p>
               <p>That is the something I am enquiring after? - It did not exclude my knowing any thing of the fact.</p>
               <p>Now as to the ribbon, where was that found? - I saw it taken up, whether it had ever been in the possession of Wilson or not I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>But you have proved it, and my Lord has taken it down; now finding something on the ground, is not precisely finding something on a person I should guess? - I do not mean to prove that.</p>
               <p>Now this business of extricating; I believe at that moment there was nobody in the shop; how many people might be in the shop? - I believe there might have been three besides these two women.</p>
               <p>How lately did you see that lace before the prisoners came into the shop? - Not for three or four hours.</p>
               <p>Then it might have lain on the floor, or on the window? - I am sure it did not, I am sure it was not in the window under the hats, nor on the ground.</p>
               <p>How are you sure that lace was not in the window, nor under the hats? - I do not absolutely know it.</p>
               <p>Nor could you swear but it had been under the hats before they came in; I believe you at that time got into a humour to suspect every thing; if they tied their garters you would have suspected they were stealing something, should not you? - I should.</p>
               <p>FRIAR TODD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Pearson, I saw the two prisoners come into Mr. Pearson's shop on Saturday the 4th of September, between the hours of seven and eight, I served them; they asked to see some ribbons, which I shewed them from a drawer on the counter; Wilson fixed on one, I cut her off a yard and a half of mazarine blue ribbon; she paid for it; while I was cutting it off I perceived Wilson take off a length of ribbon from the drawer, and convey it into some secret place about her person.</p>
               <p>Did you observe where she concealed it?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150033"></xptr> - Somewhere under her cloak: they then asked to see childrens caps, which I shewed them, and Williams in particular seemed to wish to engage my attention from the drawer of caps, a few of which she had misplaced on the counter.</p>
               <p>Court. What she wished you cannot tell, you only know she had misplaced them? - By her talk she wished -</p>
               <p>You cannot tell what she wished, she alone can tell that; tell us what she said or did? - They then bought a cap, they then asked to see edgings, I shewed her some, and I told her the price of them; she thought I could take less for them, and she went to the other side of the counter to Mr. Pearson with intent to cheat me.</p>
               <p>Do not speak of intent, how can you speak of intent? the Jury are to judge of that; what did she do? - As Wilson went across to Mr. Pearson, (the prisoners changed places at the bar) she acquainted me that Mr. Pearson could not take any less than I had asked her, she said I might cut her two yards and a half of the piece; I sold her two different lengths of edging after that, besides the two yards and a half, one yard and a quarter at the same price, and six yards at one shilling; then they did not want any thing else: I made them a bill for the goods they had bought, which amounted to one pound one shilling and sixpence, I then wrapped up the things, and they paid for them.</p>
               <p>Which of them did you give them to? - I believe it was to Wilson; they were all put up together, when this was done I communicated my suspicions to Mr. Pearson, I whispered to him.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing more after that? - After that they wished to see a hat, I then sent one of our young men up stairs to fetch one, and Mr. Pearson went out of the shop to call him down, and he staid longer than he might do, and Wilson and Williams would have departed from the shop, but I leaped over the compter, and told them they should not go till he came in; Wilson went to one of the hats at the window, and said it might do, and I saw Williams convey three cards of edging under a hat.</p>
               <p>Where did she convey them from? - From under her cloak or her person.</p>
               <p>Did you see that? - Yes, I saw her take the three cards of edging from under her cloak, and convey them under the hat, and which hat I took up immediately and shewed to Mr. Pearson and the prisoner, telling the prisoner at the same time that they were Mr. Pearson's property, and that they were stole from him; they seemed surprized, and wondered what I could mean by it.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take the edging from under her cloak and put it under the hat; can you swear positively you saw that? - Yes, my Lord, I did, three cards of edging.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish while they were in her hand how many there were of them? - I could not distinguish them in her hand, but there were none there before she put them there.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - The box of edgings never was removed from the place where I served them that day.</p>
               <p>How far was that from where the hats lay? - It might be a couple of yards.</p>
               <p>You say they tossed the things about a good deal, and carried some edgings to Mr. Pearson; did not they spread the other things that they looked at? - They never took out any of the rest of the cards, only those that I found they had stole.</p>
               <p>Court. Why, is it not very common to take out a number and tumble them about? - We never allow that, they would not be worth a penny.</p>
               <p>Why you cannot help it, Sir, if people like it? - We prevent them from tossing them about the counter.</p>
               <p>Aye, tossing them so as to spoil them. - We take them up again as soon as ever we can.</p>
               <p>In what manner did she put them under the hat? - She conveyed them in her hand, the hat was laying in the window.</p>
               <p>Did she lift the hat up with one hand? - I saw her take the hat up, and put the edgings under.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150034"></xptr>What did you actually see with your eyes? - I saw her take the edgings and put them under the hat, but I cannot tell with which hand.</p>
               <p>She shifted the hat to put them down? - Yes, of course.</p>
               <p>How soon did you take up the hat to look what was under it? - Immediately, I did not hardly give her time to lay down the hat; when Mr. Pearson came in they were making towards the door.</p>
               <p>How near the door did they go before you stopped them? - About a yard and a half, or two yards from the door.</p>
               <p>How far is your counter from the door? - A very little way from the door.</p>
               <p>Then they moved from one part of the counter to the other side? - Yes, and they said they did not mind particularly for that cap that present time, they would have one another time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, another of Prisoner's Council. You know when you are upon your oath you are to tell us facts, and not the mind of any man, because it is impossible for you to know the mind of any man, or to know that the intent of one was this, and another was this; first you say you saw it conveyed under her cloak, and then at another, part of the body; and then you say it was under her cloak, which do you mean to stick to? - She took the edgings from under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Now it is the cloak, what did you mean by saying from other parts of the body? - Because when she had her cloak on, she might convey it from other parts of the body, I could not see it.</p>
               <p>What kind of hat was it? - A straw hat.</p>
               <p>Could that lift up? - Yes, it could.</p>
               <p>You saw it lift up? - She lifted it up.</p>
               <p>Then you saw her lift it up with one hand and put it under the hat with the other; why do not you answer, you are not before ladies now: you said she lifted it up? - She must lift it up, the hat could not lift itself up.</p>
               <p>Thank you for that, good Mr. Friar Todd: why, to be sure you are as pretty a coxcomb as ever came into a Court; did you see her lift it up with her hand, Sir? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see her lift up the hat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You said two minutes ago she did not lift up the hat, but you supposed it, and now you swear positively that she did; what are the Jury to believe? - She did lift up the hat.</p>
               <p>How came you to say she did not just now? - I did not say so, I said she lifted it up, but with which hand I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Now the ladies never tumble these edgings about? - No.</p>
               <p>But they do not put them down exactly in the same place? - They generally put them into the box, considerate ladies always do.</p>
               <p>But if an inconsiderate gentleman now was to go to the box, perhaps he would throw it down carelessly. - Perhaps he would, and we should take it up as carelessly; but that does not relate to the subject at all.</p>
               <p>Is it not common when people come into your shop, to take up goods and put them down promiscuously; upon your oath, Sir, whether considerate or inconsiderate, upon your oath? - I wish to hear the question.</p>
               <p>O, you shall hear it again, Sir; Is it not common for people that come into your shop, whether considerate or inconsiderate, to take things up and throw them down carelessly? - Am I obliged to answer that question, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly, Sir, there is nothing improper in the question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Why, do you expect credit from the Jury; you may give yourself airs at home, but not in a Court of Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Why should you have any unwillingness to answer it? - I have no unwillingness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Well, I will give it up: had you been in your shop all that day? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150035"></xptr> No, I had been out of the shop, this was in the evening.</p>
               <p>When had you been out of the shop, how many hours? - Not many.</p>
               <p>How many? - I do not know particularly.</p>
               <p>Can you guess within an hour? - I cannot particularly remember.</p>
               <p>It might be three hours then? - I do not know that it was.</p>
               <p>Do you know you was not? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>But you could not remember just now particularly; had you been out that day? - A few times.</p>
               <p>How many times? - Perhaps twice or three times.</p>
               <p>Who remained in the shop during your absence? - Mr. Pearson to be sure.</p>
               <p>Nobody else? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How many domestics are there? - Two besides Mr. Pearson.</p>
               <p>Why Mr. Pearson is not a domestic you know, he is master? - Two servants besides myself, they were sometimes in the shop; I left them all in the shop.</p>
               <p>What the three different times? - I do not say three different times, I say twice or three times.</p>
               <p>Did not they serve as well as you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They serve edgings too, did not they? - No, Sir, we served very few customers that day, our house is a wholesale house.</p>
               <p>How do you know what was done when you was out? - I could know what money was taken when I came back again; there was no edgings sold that day, I asked them all, I knew it by what they said.</p>
               <p>Then you had some doubt in your mind about edgings being sold or disposed of, or else you would not have asked the question? - There was none sold.</p>
               <p>You did not ask about hats, cloaks, or petticoats? - No.</p>
               <p>You had a doubt in your mind, had not you? - No, Sir, but I asked them; I had no doubt, but I might ask the question.</p>
               <p>How came you to ask the question to that one article more than any one article in the shop? - ( No answer.)</p>
               <p>You ought to know that this frippery does not serve the prosecution. Stand down, Sir.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I know no more than that a piece of ribbon, which I have in my pocket, was found under that tall lady, on the stool where she sat by the counter, but not that counter where she was served.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You do not know that? - I searched her, she was standing; when I came in she got up, and when she got up I saw the ribbon, she made a snatch of her band, she was all of a flurry, and I laid hold of her hands, and there was the ribbon by the side of her on the stool. (The ribbon produced.) It was not measured.</p>
               <p>Court to Todd. Do you know this? - No, not for a certainty.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of this? - Sixpence a yard.</p>
               <p>How much may there be of it? - Sixteen or seventeen yards.</p>
               <p>Marsh. This is all lace, Todd gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Todd. I had three of the cards from under the hat, and the other was taken from the ground, I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Is there any shop mark you know the piece of ribbon by? - Yes, my Lord, I know it, it is my own, there is No. 2 in the corner of it, and there is 18, which is done by the manufacturer; I have no doubt but it is my master's; I know these cards of lace.</p>
               <p>Court to Todd. What is the value of these cards of lace? - The value of this is two shillings and eight-pence per yard, the first cost; this is two shillings and sixpence; this two shillings and nine-pence; this one and twenty-pence.</p>
               <p>You do not know the quantities of them, do you? - Here may be about thirty-eight yards of this, about twenty one yards of this -</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you measure it? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150036"></xptr> No, it was measured, I never measured ever a one of them; these are the things that were found.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Pearson. These were all the things that were found; you gave instructions for the indictment? - Yes, I called at Mr. Reynolds's office, and gave the instructions.</p>
               <p>I see there are two childrens caps in the indictment, how came them there? - They were picked up at the feet of one of these women at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you picked up every thing that was dropped in the shop?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Todd. So, young man, you know this piece of ribbon to be your master's do you? - Yes, I know it, because there is a figure of mine in the corner, No. 2.</p>
               <p>What does that figure of 2 import; what does it tend to, or note, or signify? - It signifies that Tibbets, Belchier, and Bullock we bought it of? - That is a good notification for a figure of 2; then every piece of ribbon so bought has the number of 2 upon it? - It has.</p>
               <p>That is all that you know it by; now how many pieces of grass green in the course of last week do you think you sold, or in the course of the last six weeks? - None, for any thing I know.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, will you venture to swear you have not sold a great many of them? - I will swear that I have not sold any of such a length as that.</p>
               <p>Why do you know the length of that? - I know the bulk of it.</p>
               <p>Now what is there in the bulk of that, that distinguishes it from another piece of green ribbon you have sold; are not you a wholesale dealer? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then you more frequently sell a whole piece than half a piece? - Yes, we do.</p>
               <p>Then those that are whole are larger in bulk than those that are not? - Yes, Sir, but -</p>
               <p>Well! now for a reason! you was going on. What! are you dumb founded! then I will try again: how many pieces with a figure of 2 have you sold? - None.</p>
               <p>And you will swear that neither Mr. Pearson nor you had parted with a piece of ribbon with a figure of 2 upon it? - I have not, not grass green.</p>
               <p>O, you mean to confine it to grass green, do you, young gentlemen, ha? answer me, Sir? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you affect, Sir, before a Jury of your country, to say that your recollection goes to the colour of your ribbons that you have sold in your shop? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>How many pieces have you sold in the last six weeks? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Have either of you any thing to say, in answer to the charge that is laid against you?</p>
               <p>Prisoners. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, in respect to that card of lace that was fallen upon the ground, it would be too much to convict the prisoners of that; we all know that when people look at a number of these small articles, they are frequently tossed about carelessly; and I think you should be satisfied that she put them down to avoid being detected, as well as that she took it with a felonious intent.</p>

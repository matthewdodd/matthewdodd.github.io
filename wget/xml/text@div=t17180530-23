Some Persons from General Pepper gave the Prisoner the Character of a very Honest Man, who having behav'd himself for 16 Years very well in the Army, and being grown in Years had been put into that Employment by the General, so that it was rather the Effects of Ignorance and Liquor than a Felonious intent.

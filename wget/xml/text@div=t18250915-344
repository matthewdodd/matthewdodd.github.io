On the 12th of September, about seven o'clock at night, he went out, and said he was going for a candlestick; they were kept in an another house; he came home about twenty or ten minutes before ten o'clock. I opened the door to him - he came up stairs, and sat down - he then went down - called the dog down stairs, and went out with it; he stopped out about five minutes - I opened the door to him; I did not see the dog come in with him, for the light went out. I had not seen the dog go out, but I did not see it after he called it down, till half-past eight o'clock the next morning - it then came up the court - it was outside the house. I fastened the shutters before he came in; Beechey was in master's employ, and held me a light while I fastened them. I went up stairs to bed, and fell asleep while Samuel Crook was undressing himself, and cannot say when he came to bed - but when I awoke in the morning he was in bed. It was twenty minutes before seven o'clock when I went down stairs, he was then in bed - I was the first person down stairs. I found the warehouse door wide open - it had been locked the night before, and the key left in a room under where we slept, in a table-drawer near the window. I had put both the warehouse key and the key of the door facing it there - the back door was open - but not the street door. I ran up, and called out "Samuel - all the house is wide open;" he asked if it was true? I said "It was" - and he said he should have all the blame of it. He put on his stockings and trousers, and came down with me. I found the counter-doors open, and a piece of umbrella silk laid on it; the slides of the counter had been broken open - and the desk also. I told him I thought he had taken the dog out, and if he had not taken it out, it would not have been done. The dog used to sleep by the warehouse-door, or up stairs; he said he had not taken it out; that it went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Whether the dog went out with him or not you cannot tell? A. No; we generally go to bed about ten or eleven o'clock - we both went up to bed together, and he brought the light down - one of us always bring the light down. I was undressed and in bed before he came up again - he sat on the bed, and began to pull off his clothes - we both slept in the same bed. I did not awake till morning, and then got up directly. I found him in bed when I awoke, and had not felt him get out in the night. We work in the bed-room in the day time making silk; any person belonging to the house goes in and out of the room in the day time.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did you hear him call the dog down as he went out? A. Yes; he was not in the habit of calling it down. I generally took the light down, but he said he would take it down that night. I said I would take it; he said No - he would take it. I had it in my hand to take down - he took it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you going to take it down before he was undressed? A. Yes; he was making the bed, and when the bed is made, the light is taken down. I never knew the dog absent on any other night; I saw it come in next morning at the back door, which was open an hour after I got up. I locked the warehouse door, just at dusk; the dog was in doors then - the key was up stairs.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You found the back door open; the dog might have gone out there in the night if it was open? A. Yes.</p>

            , we live at No. 22, White's-row, on the second floor. On the Friday morning before the robbery, a little after seven o'clock, I opened the street door, and saw the prisoners William and Samuel Crook - they came in and followed me up stairs; one of them knocked at Mason's door, and called Ned - he was let in, and when the door was unfastened I went up to my own apartment, and soon after heard a Christian name called, but what I do not know. I looked into the street out of the window, and saw Samuel Crook come from the step of the street door, and stand under the window. William Crook soon after came from the door, and joined him; and soon after Mason came up fastened his neck handkerchief round his neck, and all three went away together - I watched them altogether as far as I could see. On Monday night, the officers came to the house and took Mason, and part of the property. Barrs, the officer, told me to mind the door of Mason's room. I went down to the street door, then returned with a candle in my hand, and was going to close Mason's door, and saw William Crook sitting in the room. I said "Oh! there you are, are you." I then double locked the door on him, and told Barrs.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch, and live in Fashion-street, Spitalfields. On the Monday, the night of the robbery, about a quarter past twelve o'clock, I and Barrs were in White's-row; I observed two men coming down White's-row; they passed the door, talking, then returned, and went into the house - it is where Carkett lodges. I went into the house, knocked at the door, and was answered by the female prisoner; I said, there were two men come into that house; she said there was not. I said I was confident of it - that I had seen one of them come out again, and there must be one there then; I asked her for a light - she assisted me in searching the lower part of the house; I found nobody there. Barrs was stationed there - he called me, and said there was a man coming out of the first floor window. I ran to the door, and saw a man getting in at the window - I believe it to be the prisoner Mason - we ran up to the first floor room; the window of which room I had seen the person at, and Mason stood there with the female prisoner - I laid hold of Mason. Barrs found some silk on the bed, and the moment it was found the female prisoner ran down, and escaped. I followed her - she was taken, and brought back. Next morning I went to Mr. Waterlow's premises, and examined the three outer doors - none of them appeared to have any marks of outward violence, nor inside, not on the doors - two of the slides under the counter, and a writing-desk, all had marks of violence on them - there were only two slides with locks, and they had marks of violence upon them; the two locks secured the whole four slides. I questioned Mr. Waterlow, and Samuel Crook was produced to me - I thought by his appearance he was the man I had seen go out of the house, in White's-row, and who had gone in with the other - he had neither coat nor hat on - I wished him to put them on; he went up, and did so. My opinion was then stronger that he was the person I had seen; I do not swear positively to him. I went up stairs to his room, and found a piece of iron behind his bed - I applied it to the marks upon the desk and slides - they corresponded particularly on the slides. I also found a pair of dirty shoes in his room - I asked him who they belonged to; he said they were not his, and afterwards that some person had given them to him; I found the jacket produced in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you call that iron? A. I do not know what to call it - it is not a crow-bar; it is common for thieves to enter premises by false keys. I saw nobody let the men into the house in White's-row - the door was open - it was a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve o'clock at night. I was about twenty yards from them; I had never seen Samuel Crook before: there is a gas-light over the door. I am not positive of him; I am not certain whether the one who came out was the one who went in.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JOHN CHAPPELL. Q. Did you see him clean his shoes when he came in that night? A. No; I saw the shoes there in the morning, when the bed was turned up.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the watch, and was with Almond. I observed a man standing over the rail of the sewer, which was open - he went away. I was stationed at the door of this house afterwards - when Almond was going up stairs, I observed the prisoner Mason coming out of the first floor window - I had a good view of him by the gas light, and am certain he is the man - I called Almond down; Mason then went at the window again, and broke a square of glass; I ran up and collared him in the room; Almond came and laid hold of him - I turned my head aside, and under the counterpane of the bed, I found a bundle of silk - took it to the watch-house, the prosecutors have since seen it and claimed it - the female prisoner ran away, but was taken, both were taken to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150129"></xptr>watch-house - I returned to the house with a watchman, found the room door double locked - Mrs. Carkett unlocked it, and I found William Crook inside - I searched under the bed, and found seven more pieces of silk in a sheet - Crook was about three yards from me - he must have been under the bed, when we were taking Mason; there was no other hiding place. I went to the premises, no violence had been used to the outside of the doors - the desk and slides had been forced open, the iron corresponded with the marks on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you searched Mason's room, to see if any other man was concealed? A. After we took Crook, I did, but not at first; I had seen a man resembling Samuel Crook about the house by the sewer, but will not swear to him - I have had the care of the silk ever since, and have brought it here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know Mr. Waterlow's house? A. Yes, it is in the parish of Christ-church, Middlesex, commonly called Spitalfields - Christ-church, Middlesex. is the correct name - I know of no other Christ-church, in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS WATERLOW, JUN. I am in partnership with George Sawyer. We carry on business at No. 27, <placeName id="t18250915-344-crimeloc1854">Church-street</placeName>

On this Monday night I slept out of town, and I returned about half-past nine o'clock, next morning - I had left fifteen shillings in my writing desk - that was gone - I missed seven hundred and sixty-eight yards of silk altogether, worth 150 l., and found the whole of it at the watch-house; it belongs to me and my partner - in consequence of what was told me, I called Samuel Crook down, and gave him in charge - I saw his hat on the table in the room under where he sleeps, near the window - the keys are kept in that table drawer - he had no business with the keys - he takes his supper in that room, they sup about twelve o'clock - the whole of the silk is mine, every piece is worth more than 40 s. - there are fourteen pieces, seven in each parcel - I know some by my private mark, some by the border and figure - they are worth from 8 l. to 12 l. a piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your father alive? A. Yes, he has no concern in the business - Mr. Sawyer lives some where at Islington - I pay rent and taxes; we have only been in business nine months - I shall have to make a charge for the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. His hat might be in that room every night? A. He supped there - the table is not the place for his hat - the servant brought the keys to me. I have no doubt but they were found in the table drawer - I never saw his hat there before; I returned on Tuesday morning; I had left town about four o'clock on Monday afternoon.</p>

            . About twenty minutes past twelve o'clock, I found a hat in the street - Mason claimed it at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>MR. WATERLOW. This iron instrument is mine, it was used in the silk trade four years ago, but never at this house - the slides under the counter, where we kept the silk was broken open - there are bolts to the ware-house door, back and front, but no locks - they were all inside fastening - there is a lock to the street door, but not to the back door, that bolt is inside - the wash-house opens into the passage.</p>
               <p>JOHN CHAPPELL re-examined. A female servant and an old woman, also slept in the house that night.</p>
               <p>Five witnesses gave Mason a good character, and six deposed the same for Crooks.</p>

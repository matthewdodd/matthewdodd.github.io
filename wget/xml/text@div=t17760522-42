            , Mr. Whitbread's farrier, for cure; he was under his hands for a considerable time and grew worse, and Edwards said he could do no more; one Mr. Buckle then had him under his care, and the horse grew better; Buckle, however, was discharged; the horse was again put under Edwards's care, and again grew worse; he was put again under the care of Buckle, and grew better, so that he was ordered to have light shoes put on, and to be put out to grass, thinking that exercise might do him good: I saw the horse on the Saturday, he seemed better of his lameness, but I observed he looked sickly, dull, and heavy about the eyes; on Monday morning I heard the horse was dead; that he died in great agitation of body; on the death of the horse Buckle was sent for; he told me the horse was certainly poisoned; I desired some people might go with him and see the horse opened; they returned with some stuff which they took out of the body of the horse; I did not see it taken out. I made Mr. Whitbread acquainted with the whole matter, and he ordered a warrant to be got and Storer taken up; he worked in Edwards's shop, which is in Mr. Whitbread's yard; I think I saw him at work in the shop on Saturday evening, but I cannot be positive.</p>

            , a farrier, in Golden-lane; I worked at Mr. Whitbread's shop a fortnight or better, I cannot say the time: on the Friday before the horse died the prisoner and I were working together; he said to me, John, do you know what will poison a horse? I said, no, I cannot tell what will poison a horse, I had like to have poisoned myself once by taking mercury; Scott made answer, if I had taken arsenic instead of mercury it would have poisoned me or a horse either; soon after he asked Scott if he would buy him some arsenic: Scott said, if he wanted any he would. On the Saturday afternoon a horse was brought to have a shoe put on; I put it on; I had not nails enough, I went into the shop to point some nails, and saw the prisoner with a ladle before him on the forge; there was nobody at all in the shop; in the ladle there seemed to me to be a ball such as we give to horses that have colds; out of the drawer near the forge he took a paper with brown or yellow powder, and mixed it up together and made a ball, and put the ball he had been mixing in the ladle into a piece of paper, and laid it down upon the vice-bench: I went out to finish putting the shoe on; when I had finished the horse, he told me to go into the stable and put two old shoes on that horse that was lame; I went over with him; he got into the stable; I saw him go up to the horse's head, he had the ball in his hand; I do not know where he took it from, it was the very same ball he had in the ladle; he gave it to the horse; the horse made no resistance at all; then I turned him round to put the shoes on him; I went into the stable and laid hold of the ladle he had made the ball in, it was very nasty; I put it on the fire and wiped it, and put the paper in the fire; I said the ladle was nasty and smelt very strong; he said never mind it: on Monday morning when the horse was dead, he came into the shop where I was at work, and put his hands together and said, I would not have it known I gave the horse any thing for that full of gold; and held his two hands together in this manner (describing it): I never saw him give this horse any medicines in my life before.</p>

               <p>Upon the 2d of May Storer's wife came to me and desired me to go with her to receive what trifle of money was due to him; we went to his master, and she asked for the money; he gave her two half crowns which were due to him; I said to him, it was a sad thing this boy was suffering by his order; he made answer, My dear woman, and shook very much, I know nothing of the matter, I knew nothing of its being transacted; he knew it was to be done, but not the time it was to be transacted; had he known it, he would have prevented so many being by when it was done: when he spoke these words, his wife called him back and said, Mr. Edwards, come back, these women are come to take hold of your words: I said, Ma'am, we are not come here to take hold of any body's words; but you have put them in our mouths: then I said to Mrs. Edwards, is not this woman's husband as dear to her as yours is to you? Mr. Edwards said, yes, my dear, he is; he trembled very much and clapped the door against me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

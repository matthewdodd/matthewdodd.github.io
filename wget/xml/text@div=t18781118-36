                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 3, Staple Inn—I made advances to Bell from time to time on bills of sale, upon which money was due to me on 13th August, and I agreed on that day to make a new bill of sale—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it includes all former bills of sale; it amalgamates two loans in one—Frederick Boyd came with him on. 13th August—Bell said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180042"></xptr>
               <p>that he had no debts, and that his rent was paid up to 25th March—this bill of sale was to be paid off at the end of September, but it was not, and I gave instructions to put in possession at both places—the men remained in possession till October 5th, when I consented to their being withdrawn in consequence of what my solicitor said—I would not have advanced the money but for Bell's representations—I was not present at any interview with Craven.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DAY</hi>. I was served with a notice of bankruptcy on the Monday, and went to my solicitor and then to Bow Street—I took out a summons against Bell for fraud, and against Bell and Craven for conspiracy—I went to the Bankruptcy Court several days after, and filed three affidavits—I wanted to prevent Craven being made trustee—affidavits were made on the other side, I believe, and after hearing the whole matter the Court decided that Mr. Craven should remain trustee, and I believe he is trustee to this day—I opposed one or two proofs; all my objections were overruled, and I have been ordered to pay the costs—I sent in a proof in bankruptcy; I do not know whether it has been allowed or not; I think it was withdrawn—I gave a proxy to Mr. Collins, Mr. Smith's clerk, before the meeting of creditors—I did not attend myself, I placed the matter in my solicitors hands, Mr. Smith—I see him every day) he is the person I trust to—he is not my family solicitor; he has done matters for me—Mr. F. Boyd is an auctioneer in Milman Street; he Was formerly in Essex Street—I have employed him to sell people up under bills of sale—I do not always take possession and sell—he has some business for me now—I have not lost my confidence in him—I have taken measures to get him here, but have not seen him this morning—these representations were made in his presence, and I think his brother was there on one occasion; I believe he is here—I believe they are partners—the first representations which induced me to lend the money were made on 11th January and on other occasions, always in the presence of one of the Boys—August 31ST was the last time he represented that he owed nothing, and I believed him—I knew him before January, and had discounted bills of exchange for him, but not, I think, promissory notes—this promissory note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of his—I advanced money on promissory notes to him and to my friend Boyd—the first dealing was on 11th January, when I let him have 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., taking 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for interest for three months, and the bill of sale was for 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the next advance was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on February 11th, taking 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for interest—that was payable in two months, so that he got 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a liability of 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the January bill came due, I think, on 10th April—he did not pay me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for discount, nor did I get 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the next transaction—the next transaction was not in March—I have not got my books here—they were asked for at Bow Street; I do not know about over and over again—they were not produced; I have not seen a notice to produce them—I renewed the bills of sale on April 10 for a month, as far as I remember—I do not think I got 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on March 8—I believe the bills are here—I cannot state what I received at certain times—I could give an account if I had my books—I have not received altogether in costs and interest 309<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nor anything like it; I should not say it was very much over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I received; it is certainly not over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that I swear—I gave my books into Mr. Collins's hands, the proxy; I cannot say the date—he had them this morning; I thought you asked the date I gave</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180043"></xptr>
               <p>the proxy—I had not those two books under my arm in Court this morning, or within 100 yards—I gave them to Mr. Collins in my office; I simply handed them over to him—I do not know that he is keeping them out of Court—we did not come here together, he started before I did, and I suppose he took them with him—I suppose they are here—I have not got them—I can see Mr. Collins now; I do not know whether he is sitting on them—I swear that I have not received 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Bell—I cannot remember exactly what I received—I said at Bow Street "I cannot reckon it up in my head in a moment"—I believe I have not received 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think I got 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on April 10, or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on May 8, or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on June 14—I may have received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 24th June, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on July 19—I do not remember 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on July 29, or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on August 13—I nave received several ten pounds, but I do not remember 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at all—I received this I O U (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and I had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that—I have not received the whole of it; it is cancelled; the signature is torn off; I received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it and gave up the I O U for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear I did not receive 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I got 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. some time in September, I dare say it was September 9, but not 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on October 5, received for me by Collins—he has certainly not paid it over—I had received nothing like 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Bell on 13th August to my knowledge—I took several fresh bills of sale to avoid registration—Boyd assisted me in most of these transactions—Collins has not interposed—the costs that were paid went into my pocket—I went with Collins and called on Bell on 31ST August, the day that the man was put in—I mean to tell the Jury that I took possession either on 31ST August or 1ST September, I believe it was 31ST August—I do not remember Bell asking me to let it rest till September 3, to give him a day or two to turn round; that did not take place—Collins was with me and the man who was to be left there—I did not get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day or two after August 31 to induce me to take the man out—I do not remember stipulating for 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe an agree<lb></lb>ment was written for 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month to be paid to me for 12 months—I believe Mr. Smith has it—he is here—I believe the first 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid at the end of a month from September, but instead of getting 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of the first month, October, I had 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the beginning of September; but there was another arrangement that I was to receive 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the men were to be taken out of possession—I do not know what is in the agreement; Mr. Smith negotiated it, and I told him to do the best he could for me—I could have sold Bell up before if I had wished—I have taken the word of a great many clients—I do not practise upon them—I thought Bell was solvent—he told me his profits were very large, and he could not carry out his orders without money—he said so on numbers of occasions, both in Boyd's presence and to me alone—I am a solicitor, that is not a cloak for money lending—I sometimes take a statutory declaration, but, not generally—I did not take one here—I believe I have not got one word in writing about Bell's position—the bill of sale is for 327<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the agreement for 12 times 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not carried out, and the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. came out of the 327<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid off the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and then there was nothing more to pay for three months—if the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid off the man was to be withdrawn from Mr. Bell's private house; that would leave 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the agreement was not carried out, because Mr. Bell did not get the guarantee—I believe the men were in possession at Hammersmith and Margaret Street from August till 5th October—Clayton and Bell are respect<lb></lb>able</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180044"></xptr>
               <p>people—I believe my solicitor applied to them to undertake not to distrain—I do not know whether they did so—I believe I was in possession at that time—I believed Bell to be solvent with a man in possession, both at his private and his business house—I have not requested Mr. Boyd to say that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would relieve Mr. Bell from his difficulties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I won't swear I advanced Bell more than 265<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but afterwards it was taken to be 327<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was not to pay me 432<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by 12 instalments, and pay me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nothing like that—I believe an agreement was made, but it was not carried out—it was proposed that I was to have 12 monthly instalments of 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the first of which was to be paid a month afterwards; that would be September 7th—I had 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was paid to Mr. Collins about 9th September—the proposed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been, spoken of at that time—I believe that was to be paid off the debt on con<lb></lb>dition that the man at Hammersmith was withdrawn—I have heard so since—I know nothing of an arrangement that the man was to be taken out, and was not to return for a month—I cannot say whether he was out for throe or four days and put in again—early in September I heard that Bell was largely indebted to his landlords for rent; Mr. Smith said about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as far as I recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I put the whole of these matters into Mr. Smith's hands, who managed them by his managing clerk—the proposition about his having 12 months to pay it off fell through entirely, as he could not get a guarantee—he paid 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get the man out at Hammersmith—I also heard that he performed his promise by paying the additional 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that the man was put back in possession—Boyd was called as a witness for the defence at Bow Street—I sought to prove for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the bankruptcy, but I believe the proof was afterwards withdrawn—I opposed certain proofs at the Bankruptcy Court; it was decided against me, and the matter is now under appeal—the money became due on 30th August, and on the 31ST I ordered a man by this authority (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be put in possession—I received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the <hi rend="largeCaps">IOU</hi> for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was added to the security—I did not receive the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—the representation in the bill of sale is "that all sums for rent and taxes at Hammersmith and Moorgate Street up to 25th March have been fully paid and discharged;" that turns out to be untrue.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Mitre Court—I am Mr. Day's solicitor—on 31ST August he consulted me respecting a bill of sale—I advised it to be registered, and then placed it in Mr. Collins's hands to carry the matter through—he had the entire conduct of the matter so far as to putting the men in possession—I was present in my office on 4th October with Mr. Collins when Craven came—he presented this card: "Mr. Bell, introduced by Mr. Craven"—I had not known Craven before that—Craven came in, and an interview took place between him and Collins—Craven said "It is very inconvenient to have men in possession, and I have called for the purpose of seeing whether some arrangement cannot be made to withdraw them—I said "I have recently heard that rent to the tune of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is due for the premises at Margaret Street"—he said "It is so; you will get nothing, for the landlords claim their right of distress"—Mr. Collins said "Do you know that Mr. Bell is perfectly solvent?"—he said "I have acted for Bell's brother's firm for a number of years, and I have examined his (Bell's) books, and believe him to be solvent"—Mr. Collins said "Will you give me a letter, stating that in your belief he is solvent?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180045"></xptr>
               <p>—Craven said, "As a professional man I cannot give that letter, but I will supply you with a balance-sheet"—Mr. Collins then left the room, and Craven said to me, "You know you won't get anything if the landlords force their powers of distress"—I said "I am not so sure about that"—we then had some general conversation as to Bell's solvency—Mr. Collins, returned, and I said to Craven, "Is there any process of law, or any judgments and executions, or County Court proceedings, or any demands in Bankruptcy? or is there any fear of the man filing his petition for liquidation?"—he said "No, there is not"—those were each distinct questions—Mr. Collins then drafted a letter, and I went to his desk, looked over it, and suggested some alterations—the landlords had to sign that letter—Craven then left, and arranged to come back at 5 o'clock, to bring the letter and a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to cover the expenses of the men in possession, but he did not come until 11 o'clock on Saturday, when he said in Mr. Collin's presence "I have come to see you; I have not got the letter signed, as Mr. Clayton is out of town"—it was then arranged that if Mr. Bell, the brother, would sign the letter and undertake to get his partner to sign it on his return, I would take that as sufficient—Mr. Collins asked him again as to Bell's solvency—he replied that he was perfectly solvent, and if we adopted that course we could reap the benefit of our security and get our money—Craven then left—I was not present when he came back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I have been practising on my own account since July—previous to that I was managing clerk to Scott and Clarke—they were not Mr. Day's solicitors—I got Mr. Collins from Mr. Grain, a solicitor—I gave Mr. Collins no direct orders to put the men in possession—I cannot fix the date when Mr. Day first consulted me, but it was about the end of August—I could fix it by my books or diary—I first ascertained on Friday, 4th October, that Mr. Bell had not paid the rent of the house in Margaret Street—I had not known it for as much as a week—Mr. Collins informed me of it—he had not been making inquiries with reference to Mr. Bell, and I don't know from whom he obtained the informa<lb></lb>tion—he said the amount was about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know what arrears that represented—I think Craven said that he was an accountant—I do not doubt it—I made no inquiry—I do not know that he was instructed by Mr. Bell's brother, of the firm of Clayton and Bell, to attend to this matter—I was not present when the 20... was paid by a cheque from Bell's brother, but I believe it was paid on Saturday the 5th, at 2 o'clock—there were three interviews with Craven, as far as I know—I was present at two of them, but not at the third when the cheque was given—it was through the circum<lb></lb>stances brought to my knowledge on 31ST August that I gave Mr. Day the advice I did—I was not present when a proposition was made to pay 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month for 12 months—I know nothing of any conversation with Bell about the men being in possession at Hammersmith or Margaret Street</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLE</hi>. I believe Mr. Craven had made out a balance-sheet which would show Bell's affairs—he promised to send it with the cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took his word for it—I was to receive a letter, a cheque, and a balance-sheet, that was the understanding, and if he had done so the men would have been withdrawn—I have never seen the balance<lb></lb>sheet, but I withdrew the men because I believed Craven would send it—I would not have withdrawn them without getting the letter—I was negotiat<lb></lb>ing—I trusted to Craven sending the balance-sheet, and it did not matter to</p>

               <p>me whether I got it before or after the men were withdrawn—he said that he had gone through the books—I understood that he was to bring the balance-sheet with him in the afternoon, and therefore I presumed that he had prepared it—I did not take down his answers to the long string of questions—I do not keep a printed catechism of those questions—he gave a general denial to each—I did not know the extent to which he had been <hi rend="italic">sucked</hi> for so many months—I knew, as a solicitor, what was going on—I did not know that he was paying over 100 per cent.—I never calculated it—I believed him to be a solvent tradesman, but did not know about his being well-to-do—Collins did not tell me that he had been paying 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. every twenty days to renew the bill of sale—I saw a person named Broome at the police-court—he was not present at the interview with Craven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I believe Broome is Mr. Bell's clerk—he was called before the Magistrate for the defence—on 4th October the men were in possession at both places—I made no application to Bell, but Craven came introduced by Bell with a view of getting the men out of possession, and my inquiries were to know that I was safe in allowing them to go—Craven told me he had been through the books, and of course he would know from them—he never hinted that Bell was heavily in debt, or that there was the slightest danger in taking the men out of possession, quite the other way.</p>

I have been Mr. Smith's managing clerk since June—I heard of Mr. Day coming about a bill of sale; I did not see him then, but Mr. Smith put the matter into my hands—I was instructed that a man should be put into possession of both houses on 31ST August, I think, and I took possession that day, Saturday—Mr. Bell called on Monday, September 2nd, and saw me—I proposed that some arrangement should be made to prevent the constant renewals—he said that he had been paying 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. every 20 days to renew the bill of sale—I said that no man could afford that—he said it was very awkward having a man in his private house, he did not mind having one in his other place, because he could give him some work to do—I suggested that he should enter into arrangements to pay the 327<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then due at 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, in lieu of the amount to go to the extinguishing of the debt—that included the addition for interest, because the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for 20 days did not go off the amount, it left the debt still existing—he was to give me a guarantee from his brother and two responsible householders—412<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the aggregate he was to pay back, and he asked me to put the terms into writing; to write a letter to him embodying those terms—this is the draft of it (<hi rend="italic">This was dated September 2nd, offering that Mr. Day would withdraw the man in possession upon payment of all expenses incurred, two good securities being found, and an agreement made to pay</hi> 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a month for</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">months to liquidate the debt and interest</hi>.) Bell said that he could find sureties, and he wrote to me to send him a form of the guarantee I should require the sureties to sign—I sent him a copy of a draft guarantee (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said that his brother, Alfred Bell, would be one guarantee, and he could get two others—I saw him on the 4th or 5th—he said that he could not get the guarantee signed, as his friends were out of town, and he proposed to have the original agreement signed for 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—I had already prepared that; I filled in the dates and he examined it, undertaking to get the guarantee signed—I said that I would get Mr. Day to execute it and would immediately withdraw the men—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180047"></xptr>
               <p>then said "Supposing I cannot get the guarantee signed, what will yon take in money to let the man leave my private house?"—that was after September 7th—I said "From what I can see of the contents of your private house I should think 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be its value; if you will bring me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will advise Mr. Day to withdraw from your private house, execute the agreement, and give you a receipt for the first three monthly instalments"—he said that he would do it, and made an appointment to call next day and bring the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he did not come—he called one day soon afterwards, he had to pay me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for costs, and took out a large quantity of notes; I said "You are going to pay me the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Mr. Bell"—he said "No, I have other things which are pressing me which I must pay; if I give you some on account and make it up during the week, will you take the man out of possession?"—I said "Yes, if you give me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and undertake to make it 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before the week is out"—he said "I cannot part with 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., will you take 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he paid me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I gave him an order to the man in possession to withdraw from the private house, he undertaking to make it 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before the week was out—I gave him this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced, dated 9th September</hi>) for the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he called afterwards but did not pay the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said that he had not received it from the country—he repeatedly telegraphed to me—on 14th September I wrote to him: "Dear Sir,—I am sorry that you broke faith to-day, and fully expect you will be with me on Monday by 1 o'clock;" I then got this telegram: "Am detained by important business, but will'be with you on Monday by 1 o'clock"—I wrote on the 21ST: "Telegram received; unless appointment is kept on Monday I must resume possession"—he did not come and pay me the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and therefore the agreement for paying off the money by 12 monthly instalments was not executed by Bell—he did not bring the guarantee and never paid the balance of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The draft of the agreement was here put in, which stated that the debt was</hi> 327<hi rend="italic">l., which, with</hi> 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for interest, made</hi> 432<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) The guarantee was never signed, and I did not lay it before our client, but we were in possession of both places at that time—if I had taken the men out without a guarantee we should have had no security at all—the man had never been out of the business premises; but I replaced the man in the private house on, I think, 27th September; but before that I went to Bell's house and told him if he did not pay the money I must put the man in possession, because Mr. Day did not know he was out—he begged me to give him another day, and I did so; I did not care whether he brought me the guarantee or the money—I saw him at my office on, I think, 30th September, and I think, Mr. Boyd was with him—he said that has till hoped to be able to bring me the money—he said that he owed 12 months' rent at Margaret Street—I said that he had always represented that the rent was paid up in full; he said that it was his brother who was his creditor, and he would never trouble him and was coming forward to assist him to pay off the money—en 3rd October I got this letter: "Dear Sir,—Matters stand as they were till to-morrow, so it will be useless for me to trouble you with a visit to-day"—I do not think I saw him after that letter for a considerable time—on 4th October Craven called—I had never seen him before—I think Mr. Smith said, "What do you call about?" he said, "From Mr. Bell;" Mr. Smith said, "Mr. Collins will attend to it"—Craven handed in a card and said, "I want to make some arrangement with regard to your man in possession," or "bill of sale"—I think Mr. Smith said, "What arrangement do you want to make?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180048"></xptr>
               <p>Craven said, "I want you to give me an order. to remove two glass windows from Margaret Street, as the man declines to let them go without an order signed by you;" I consulted Mr. Smith by a look, and declined to allow the windows to be removed-Craven asked me why, I said that it was only on the 30th we found out that there was a large amount of rent in arrear—Craven said, "That makes little difference, as my brother is the landlord and he would never put in a distress"—I said, "Very likely not against his brother but as against an outside man he would;" he said, "You might safely withdraw from possession of the furniture and stock in trade I have been through Bell's books, I find he is perfectly solvent, he has book debts and orders in hand to the extent of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Mr. Smith said "Is there any County court judgment against Bell, writs or Bankruptcy proceed<lb></lb>ings?"—he said that there was nothing at all against him, and that Bell's brother would pay the cost of the men in possession if they would with<lb></lb>draw—I or Smith said, "Oh, we can't withdraw except we have some guarantee that the landlord does not distrain"—he said there would be no difficulty in getting a letter to that effect, and asked me to draft one; I did so and handed it to Craven—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he took it away with him to get it signed and get a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we agreed then to withdraw the men—he never brought the letter signed or the cheque, but he called next morning, Saturday, and said, "I was unable to get that letter signed by Clayton and Bell, as Mr. Clayton was out of town, consequently Mr. Bell could not bind his partner—I said that if Mr. Bell would sign it I would accept a letter from him undertaking that his partner should sign it on his return, and said, "May I rely upon your statement"—that was as to Bell's solvency—he said, "I would not have made the statement had I not made myself aware of the fact I have acted for the family a great number of years, and I have investigated Bell's books, you may take my word:" he then left-at one of the interviews he said, "I will let you have a balance-sheet"—he never gave me the slightest intimation that he was concerned in pre<lb></lb>paring for Bell's liquidation on his own petition—he returned at 2 o'clock on the Saturday, and brought me this letter written on paper from Regent Street, signed by Clayton and by Bell, in which the two last lines are differ<lb></lb>ent from the draft I supplied him with—he also brought a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>-before I took the cheque I said, "Am I to rely on Bell's solvency? You know the position my client will be in if any procedings in Bankruptcy or liquidation are taken," or words to that effect—he said, "You may rely upon it there is nothing of the kind, he cannot file a liquidation petition, he owes nothing"—upon that I signed two letters directed to Emerson and Pocock the men in possession, to give up possession—I would not have given those letters if I not received the assurance from Craven that Bell was perfectly solvent-that was Saturday, and on Monday morning Mr. Day went out of town, and did not return till 5 o'clock, and then he found at his office a notice restraining him from enforcing the bill of sale, and likewise a notice from the Bankruptcy Coupon the Tuesday morning I searched at the Bankruptcy Court and found the petition had been filed at 11 o'clock on Monday morning and that John Berkeley Craven was appointed receiver and manager, and that the debts were 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The bankrupt's petition, affldavit, and list of creditors, were here put in</hi>.) A copy of this notice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was directed to each creditor and handed to an officer of the Court, who posts them. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

               <p>ago, not later—I lost all my money at it—I was engaged in that way seven years—I should have been very sorry to be engaged with a money lender named Pickard—1 had not an office in the same building with him—I have done business with many bill discounters—I have now taken to the law—I am clerk to Mr. George Smith—his furniture is subject to a mortgage, and I am the mortgagor—the premises are taken in Mr. Smith's name—they were furnished in June, 1878—I should be a very clever man to tell you whether the furniture is paid for—it belonged to a Mr. Grain, who mortgaged it to a money lender in the City, and I borrowed the money of Messrs. Finch and Finch, of 13, Union Street, Southwark, and paid the mortgage off—Mr. Grain in consideration of that transferred the furniture to me, and Mr. Smith pays interest to me—he pays me 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year wages, and I have had some money for interest—I knew Mr. Day at the end of August, 1878, since then I have once been to Bow Street on his behalf, and it may be a dozen times in other matters affecting Craven and Bell, but not affecting Mr. Day—that once was a charge of fraud—I never received a shilling to settle it—I received instructions to ask the Magistrate to allow the prosecutor to with<lb></lb>draw—I do not know what money was given to withdraw; it might have been 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have heard that something was paid; that the father of the young man came down in a very pitiful state, saying that he might have thought he had a right to do what he did, and he took back 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bill of sale was for 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think I have been to Bow Street on my own private business—I think one fool summoned me to Bow Street—I do not know whether it was for stealing a cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know he never went on with it; he dare not—it was Mr. Kish—I paid him a lot of money—I have paid him money since, and I believe he says I owe him money now—he dare not proceed with the summons—he did not ask to be allowed to withdraw, he never went on—I did not take proceedings for malicious prosecution—you had better call him, he is in court—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go to him, and ask him to for<lb></lb>give you?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I would kick him—Mr. Day and I went out of town on Monday, 7th October—I saw Mr. Broome that day—I was at Southsea, but I called at Mr. Bell's place first—I did not see Craven that Monday morning—I went to Southsea on a client's business—I do not know whether it was a bill of sale—Day was not the client, but I went down with him—I had no notion of going into possession again when I got the cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the letter of guarantee, not if the instalments were paid—I was not likely to send Pocock again in a hurry—I was at Bow Street when Pocock was called for Day—he will be called—I did not say to Pocock that he might have to go into possession again on Wednesday, and did not hear him swear so at the police-court—I saw him that evening, and paid him his money—anything he said in cross-examination would not strike me as strange, because you so <hi rend="italic">fugged</hi> him as to dates—I heard him swear that I said "I might want you again on Wednesday," but nothing in regard to Margaret Street.</p>

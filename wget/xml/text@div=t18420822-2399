                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Ebenezer Cherry, as linen-drapers, in Goswell-road. The prisoner bad been our shopman about twelve months—he first had 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and afterwards 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and his board—on Friday evening, the 19th of August, he had permission to go out, and was to return at eleven o'clock—he did not return that night or the next—in consequence of suspicions, while he was absent I examined some clothes of his in his bed-room, and in the coat pocket I found a letter, a duplicate, and these two pairs of gloves—one pair is ours—the prisoner purchased things in the shop, and bad an account kept—I found two pairs of socks in a closet in his room, one pair of which I believe to be ours—I have the prisoner's account here—neither the gloves or socks appear in that—he came home about nine o'clock on Sun<lb></lb>day morning, but I did not see him till between twelve and one on Mon<lb></lb>day—he then presented his account—I said, "Did not you have a pair of drab silk gloves on Saturday night week?"—he said, "No, they were la<lb></lb>vender," that the drab pair he had of his friend, who was waiting outside—these are the drab pair—he went to speak to the person at the door, who afterwards came in—I do not remember that he mentioned his name—I re<lb></lb>quested him to leave the shop, which he ultimately did—I went with the prisoner to the station, and gave him in charge, and this person followed us there—he was also waiting at the police-office when we went in, but when I came out he was gone—the Magistrate inquired in the prisoner's presence who that person was—the prisoner did not say what his name was—I afterwards went with the prisoner to his father's house, in Collier-street, Pentonville, and asked the father to show us the prisoner's box, which he did, and in it we found thirteen collars, a shirt front, and a pair of trowsers—he said the collars were his before he came into our service—there is nothing in his account for collars—some of the collars had been washed, but there was one which had not been washed—it had been worn—this is it—I have not the least doubt it is my property—here is our pri<lb></lb>vate mark on it "D V" and two strokes, which signify a halfpenny—there are two other collars of the same pattern—I purchased a dozen of these collars of Brettel and Co., in Wood-street, last week—I have exa<lb></lb>mined my stock, and find three of those collars gone—the three found in the prisoner's box account for the dozen.</p>

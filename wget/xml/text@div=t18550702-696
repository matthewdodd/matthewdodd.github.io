                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Potter, who keeps the King's Arms, near Clare-market On 12th June, I saw the prisoners about 11 o'clock at night—they came together, and Groves asked for half a quartern of rum; it came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she offered me a sixpence, and I passed it to my husband.</p>

I was by when the prisoners were there—my wife passed a sixpence to me; it was bad, and I detained them for the space of ten minutes and then let them go—I set a policeman on the watch, and showed him the sixpence, but he said I had better keep it—I broke it, and put the two pieces in my pocket; I afterwards gave them to Butler—I am positive they were the pieces of the sixpence my wife gave me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Marlborough Head, Drury-lane. On 12th June, the prisoners came together about twenty-five minutes past 11 o'clock at night—Groves called for half a quartern of rum—it came to twopence; she offered me a shilling—I put it in my teeth and bent it—I found it was bad, threw it on the counter, and a policeman came in and took it up directly.</p>

On 25th April, about four o'clock in the morning, I was in Bridge-street, Mile-end, and saw Connor close under a wall of Bank's terrace—I asked what he had been doing—he said he got drunk the night before, and got locked out, and was waiting until it was time to go to work—he was quite sober—I let him pass on, and went into a corner and saw a pair of shoes and stockings close under the wall—I directly went after Connor, took him, and gave him to another constable—I then went back and found Armstrong stooping under the wall, as if he had just dropped from it, about five or six yards from where I had seen Connor—I asked what he was doing there—he said he was only taking a walk—I found a pair of boots in his hand, a pair of lady's boots in his breast, a tablecloth in his hat, and another in his trowsers—I called Mr. Pardon up, and took Armstrong to the station—I found a pair of snuffers between where I saw each prisoner—I found footmarks of people close under the wall in Mr. Pardon's garden; one without shoes or stockings—there was fresh dirt on the fence, which was eight or nine feet high—Armstrong asked me to let him put on his shoes and stockings, and he put on those which I found—the shoes did not fit him, but he claimed them—I found Mr. Pardon's window wide open; a man could get in.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the house, No. 1, Bank's Terrace, in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stebon-heath. On the night of 24th April I and my wife were last up—we examined the house—the kitchen window was fastened, but the inner shutters were not—I was called up about four o'clock, and found the kitchen in great confusion—I missed a tablecloth, two pairs of boots, and a pair of snuffers—these boots are mine, and these my wife's—the tablecloth has her initials on it—the catch of the window had been pushed back, and the lower sash lifted up.</p>

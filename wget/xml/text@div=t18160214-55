            . I am a hatter, and live on Ludgate-hill. The prisoner was my shopman. I was out on the 17th of January, when this money was received. On my return home, I examined his books, and found in one an entry pay well, for cap, that means, that ready money was paid for a fur cap, and I  und a one-pound note in the book, (witness prodces a book.) In the course of the evening, I called the prisoner up for the purpose of speaking to him; I charged him with many irregularities, and with being dishonest; he was very high at first, and denied it. I told him I had clear proof that it was so; I then told him two or three circumstances wherein he had been irregular, and he denied it, and among others, mentioned this. Immediately on my mentioning this, he stated that he had sold two fur caps to a gentleman, and sold them for thirty two shillings. I asked him how that could be, when he had only accounted to me for a pound; he stated that it must be an omission, and that the money was down stairs on the desk, or in his desk; he then was going down stairs to fetch it; but I would not suffer it. I then asked him if he felt disposed to let me see the money he had in his pocket; he said certainly he would. He then produced four three-shilling bank tokens; I believe there was more money. I furnished the money myself to Mr. Hope to purchase these things.</p>

               <p>MR. GURNEY, Objected, that this was not money received for and on account of Mr. Gould; but actually money out of Mr. Gould's own pocket, and that therefore the prisoner could not be convicted under this indictment; he refered the Court to its decision upon this subject in an exactly similar case, tried at the September Sessions, and reported in these Sessions Papers.</p>
               <p>THE COURT, was pleased to co-incide with the Learned Counsel's objection.</p>

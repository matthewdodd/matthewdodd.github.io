                  </hi>. I am assistant at the Globe coffee-house, 41, Gibson-street, Lambeth—on Friday evening, 7th June, the prisoner came in and asked for some bread and butter—he paid me with a shilling—I gave him change and put the shilling in the bowl—there were other sixpences and shillings there; the shillings were at the bottom, and the sixpences over them—I put the shilling on the top of the sixpences—Mrs. Stearne, the landlady, said to me, "You have taken another shilling;" and she took it out and live it to my sister to get some butter—I took another shilling between the time when the prisoner gave me the shilling and when Mrs. Stearne came in; but I took it down stairs for a shilling's-worth of coppers—it did not go into the bowl—the next day, Saturday, 8th June, the prisoner came in about the same time, and called for some refreshment—he gave me a bad half-crown, which I gave to Mrs. Stearne.</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday afternoon I went to the bowl and took out a shilling; it was at the top of some sixpences—I bad left for a short time and had counted the money before I went—the shillings were at the bottom—there were several sixpences—I gave the shilling to Eliza Green to go for some butter—she came back in a few minutes and gave me the shilling again—the tradesman I had sent to had bent it; it was a bad one—I put it on one side, and ultimately gave it to the police constable—on the following day Sarah Green gave me a very bad half-crown—I said to the prisoner, "How came you to offer this; have you any more about you?" he said, "Yes, I have two shillings"—I said, "Why did not you give that?" he said, "I suppose I do what you do, give the first that comes"—I said I did not do that, I always gave the smallest coin—I sent for a policeman, gave the prisoner in custody, and gave the half-crown to the constable—I had not seen the prisoner on the Friday.</p>

I am now a baker, but on 8th June last I was a police officer—the prisoner was given into my custody at Mrs. Stearne's—I asked him how he accounted for the half-crown, and he said at first that he won it at skittles at a public-house in Drury-lane, and he did not know it was bad—he was charged with passing the shilling on Friday, and he said that he was not in there at all on Friday, and afterwards he said he was and that another man gave a shilling at the same time—I took him</p>

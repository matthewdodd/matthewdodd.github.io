               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he look like a man who had 60lbs. of lead? A. He looked rather bulky in front of his stomach - I went into the cistern two or three times - I was not in it when he cut the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you were not in the cistern at all? A. No; I was not at the time he was in it - I might have said it - I was in the cistern two or three times - I did not cut the lead in the cistern - I cut the waste pipe - I have a brother-in-law, who is employed at Drury-lane theatre, and I sometimes went to assist him before I went to Mr. Soward - I did not go to any other theatre - I was in the employ of a Mr. Duncan - I have travelled to Bath - I was in the service of an umbrella-maker - I did not say any thing to the prisoner when I saw his waistcoat open - I thought it might be heat - I was not taken up myself - I told Mr. Soward the next morning when he asked me, and showed him where we had been.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever say you did not know who the man was? A. I could not describe him to Mr. Clack - the prisoner rang the bell, and I went up stairs - he was in the shop then - I was up in half a minute - I do not know whether a man could have unrolled this lead from his body before I got up, but it was on the bench when I got up - it was rolled up - my brother was taken up - I cannot tell whether I stated that the prisoner was the man before my brother was taken up - I had not known the prisoner before - I had no suspicion of any thing being wrong - the lead was taken into our vault - I parted it into two lots, and wrapped it up in some new bits of our own.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You found the lead on the bench, and the prisoner in the shop, when you went up stairs - where did he then go? A. Down stairs to our lower shop, and when he left, he went up the area steps.</p>

On the 19th of July, about twenty minutes to one o'clock in the night, I was in the City-road, going home—as I was coming by Windsor-terrace, towards the Angel, the prisoners met me—there was another in the gang—I only met two who I identify—I did not see any other person particularly—I saw nothing of them before they came up—they rushed on me momentarily, and Evans hit me a very powerful blow on my right hand, which was very bad with the gout—I had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity</p>

On the night of the 19th of July I was in the City-road, about half-past twelve or twenty minutes to one o'clock, and saw the prosecutor—I followed him nearly out of Fins<lb></lb>bury-square—when near Windsor-terrace, I saw the prisoners go up to the prosecutor—I did not see them before they got up to him—I was not above two yards from the prosecutor at the time—I saw Evans twitch the handkerchief off the prosecutor's right hand, and throw it over his shoulder—Lewis took it, and ran towards the bridge—Evans ran across the road, and went down by the side of the wharf—he was stopped by Reeve—I did not see Evans strike the prosecutor—I ran after Evans, and sang out, "Stop thief"—I followed him about a dozen yards across the road, down by the side of the wharf—Reeve brought him back, and asked if that was the man—I said, "Yes"—the prosecutor was then across the road, standing just by the end of the toll-gate—I saw both the prisoners' faces perfectly—there was a gas-lamp, and a little moon-light besides—I saw their faces before they ran away—I swear positively to them—I had never seen either of them before.</p>

               <p>he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he knew where the person lived—he said, "No"—that he was a sailor—I asked him if the young woman was much hurt—he said she was—I then went to the house and rang the bell, to in<lb></lb>quire if that was the case—the landlord came to the door, but would not allow me to go in—the prisoner continued to stand there ten or twelve mi<lb></lb>nutes—I left him about a hundred yards—he might have run away if he liked—on going back I saw him near the same place—he then told me he was the sailor who stabbed the young woman, and he wished me to take him into custody, which I did—I think he was sober—I did not notice that he was the worse for liquor—I inquired of him his reasons for stabbing her and what he did it with—he said, "With an oyster knife"—I went again to the house, but they refused admission—Serjeant Powell came up—I told him the circumstance—he questioned the prisoner, and he said he had stabbed her—after some time, they let Powell into the house—I remained outside with the prisoner.</p>

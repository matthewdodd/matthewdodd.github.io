                  </hi>. I am mate of the <hi rend="italic">Lucilla</hi> American ship. On Monday evening, the 9th of January, the prisoner quitted that ship with leave, to return next morning—I missed my coat about an hour after he was gone, and when he returned I told him of it—at nine o'clock. I got a policeman, and at ten o'clock he absconded, which made me sus<lb></lb>pect him—I did not see him again till he was taken—I found the coat in the policeman's possession.</p>

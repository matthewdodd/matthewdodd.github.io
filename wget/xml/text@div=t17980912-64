             sworn. - I am a watch-maker: I was going along Fleet-street on Tuesday in the forenoon, about twelve o'clock, or a little after; I saw Richard Clark follow the last witness, put his hand into his pocket, take something out, and give it to a person on his right-hand, there were three of them together; they then turned down Brides-passage; I immediately followed Meyrick, and tapped him on the shoulder, and enquired of him if he had lost any thing; he clapped his hands to his sides, and said, yes, he had lost his pocket-book; I then went down Bride-lane, turned up Brides-passage, and going up Brides-passage, we were met by a person who enquired of us if he was the young man that had lost the pocket-book; we went through Salisbury-court, this man, Meyrick, and me, down Primrose-hill, into Water-lane, and he was taken in Fishers-alley.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, are you sure he is the man that put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket? - A. Yes; they were all three taken before Alderman Boydell, but the other two were discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley Q. So you took three person before the Alderman, and two of them were discharged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you stop the man at first? - A. As soon as ever the prisoner had picked his pocket, they turned down Brides-passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, before the Magistrate, you were not sure, and you only thought he was one of the men? - A. I did not say any such thing, I was positive he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. There was abundance of opportunity for him to have escaped while you were talking to the prosecutor? - A. We pursued them closely.</p>

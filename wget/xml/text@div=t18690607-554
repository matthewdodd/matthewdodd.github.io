                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Wells, of 19, Lisle Street, Leicester Square—on the morning of the 4th May, I was awoke by a light outside my bedroom door—someone had lighted my lamp—I saw Wythe in the room taking my husband's coat from a peg on the door—I sat up in bed and looked at him, and then I jumped out and got the life preserver—he shut the door and went out, leaving me inside—he ran down stain, and I ran after him—he took the lamp with him to the bottom of the stairs, and I followed—he went out at the front door—I came back again and went into the sitting-room, and missed a table cover—I went into the parlour, and found a desk had been opened and the letters scattered all about—I also missed thirteen knives, four forks, a spoon, and a shawl—the value of the things I lost was about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am quite sure Wythe is the man.</p>

Q.</hi> When was it you saw the man again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At Vine Street Station, in custody, perhaps a fortnight after—I was told that the man was in custody—the sergeant came and said he thought they had got the prisoner, and he wanted me to go and see if he was the man—I went there and saw the prisoner, and said he was the man—I gave a description of the man before that—the sergeant did not point out Wythe and say, "Is not that the man?"—when I went to the station they shut the door and said, "Wait a few minutes"—they then let me into a room with some persons in it, and Gould said, "Now you can pick the person out if he is there"—I went up to Wythe immediately—I can't say how many men there were—Sergeant Gould opened the station door—the policemen were coming out to go on duty, and he sent me back again till they put the prisoner with a few more, and then they let me in—he said, "If the prisoner is there, you can pick him out"—there were from six to eight men, I should think—I never saw the prisoner before I saw him in my bedroom—he had a hat on when he came into my room—his face was towards me—I could see it as plainly as I can see yours—I never saw his face after he left the room till I saw him at the station—I am quite certain he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker of Powis-street, Woolwich—on Wednesday afternoon, the 22d of June, about 2 o'clock, the prisoners came to my shop—Fermain said, "Have you any cheap watches, for" sale?"—I said, "Yes," and pulled one down from the glass case at 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and handed it to Fermain—they looked at it it, and Bucklow said, "You had better have something better, about 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I took one from the window at 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and while bargaining for it, Bucklow sent his arm through my glass case on the counter, and broke it, which took my attention from my watches—Fermain agreed to take the watch at 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Bucklow asked the price of the glass; he said that he had not got the money, but would go and fetch it—he went out and did not return—in about 5 or 10 minutes Fermain said, "I will go and seek him, and went out—I missed the silver watch at 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which was on the glass case—I went out to seek him and could not find him—I returned, saw a policeman, and gave information—I have never seen the watch since—the prisoners are the men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bucklow. Q.</hi> Was I intoxicated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A little—my wife was referred to as to whether the glass cost 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but she could not remember—when I charged you with not coming back, you did not say "I have not got the money yet."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three quarters of an hour after he left—I said, "Why did not you come back"—he seemed surprised, said that he had not been out of the house for 3 days, and pretended to know nothing at all about it—I went out and told a constable who went in, but he was not there, he had hid himself—I went in again, and there he was—the police went in, and we followed him into a closet, and I said that is the man—he still denied being out of the house for 3 days, but afterwards assigned as a reason for not coming that he had not got the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at North Woolwich—on 22d June I saw the prisoners at the Shakespeare public-house at the corner of Beresford-street together—Fermain had a silver watch—it was about eight or nine minutes after the Arsenal bell had rung 2 o'clock—they offered it for sale for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there were five civilians there, and an offer was made directly—a sovereign was mentioned by one man, who wanted to hold the watch—Bucklow said, "Are you a buyer; if so, say so; if not, we are going to shut the watch up?" and disappeared behind the bar—they went away after stopping there a minute or two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bucklow. Q.</hi> You swore at Woolwich that you saw me at 3 o'clock, whereas I was locked up before half-past 2. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I said between 2 and 3</p>

               <p>o'clock—on further recollection I remembered that the bell rang 2, and I knew it to be shortly after that—you were intoxicated.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Fermain. Q.</hi> Was I offering the watch for sale? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, you stood up—I am quite sure you are the two men—it is not a minute's walk from the prosecutor's shop to the Shakespeare.</p>

I received Buck low in custody at Uncle Tom's Cabin—the prosecutor pointed him out to me in a water-closet at the further end of the tap-room—I said that he was charged with another named Fermain for stealing a watch from the prosecutor's shop—he said, "I have been in the shop, but I know nothing of the watch—I am innocent of the case"—I took him to the station and found on him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, a knife, two straps, and a tobacco-pipe—about two hours after<lb></lb>wards I went in pursuit of Fermain, with two brother constables, and took him in Rodney-street—I told him he was charged with stealing a watch—he said that he knew nothing about it.</p>

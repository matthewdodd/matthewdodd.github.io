On 13th December, about half-past 2 in the afternoon I was on duty in Cannon-street, and saw Daniels standing there—I watched him, and then saw Bollen, then carman, go and speak to him; they conversed together two or three minutes—Bollen then returned to his van, which was standing at the prosecutor's door in Nicholas-lane—he then drew the van into the street, where he met Walklin and Bollen, and Walklin went into the Boar's Head public-house, Cannon-street—they came out—Bollen got on the front of his van and drove away—I lost sight of Walklin—I followed the van through Islington, Holloway, up to a coffee-shop in Camden-town, where Bollen got out and was joined by Daniels—I looked over the blind and saw Daniels—they came out together and Daniels and the boy Brooks, who was with him, got into the van and drove away—two got in, and one was in front—I followed the van to the corner of Mornington-road, Camden-town, where Daniels got down, and a bag which he had previously had on his arm, was handed to him by Bollen while the boy was sent into a shop to deliver some goods—I followed Daniels to Camden-road station—he was about to enter the station yard, and turned round and observed me behind him—we had a long conversation respecting what he had got in the bag—we got into a cab together, and while on our way to the City I suggested that we should go to the station and he could give an explanation to the inspector how he came by it—I took him in custody—I had been watching the prosecutor's premises nearly two months—on Wednesday, 5th December, I was watching and saw Daniels and Bollen together come out of the Boar's Head about 1 o'clock in the day—Walklin came from the warehouse and passed within a few yards of them—Daniels then left Bollen and followed Walklin over London-bridge, about ten yards behind him, and joined him after turning the corner of York-street—they then talked together for about a quarter of an hour—I had also seen them together on several occasions, and had seen them drinking together in the Boar's Head public-house—it was in consequence of that that I communi<lb></lb>cated with the firm—next morning, the 14th, I took Bollen in custody, and about half an hour afterwards I took Walklin—I told him that he was charged with stealing from his employers 16 lbs. of pepper and 7 lbs. of almonds—he said, "Let me get my coat, and I will go with you"—he gave a false address at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Petty, Wood, and Co. wholesale grocers, in Nicholas-lane, and retail, in King William-street—Bollen was our carman, and had been so about eight years—Walklin had been our porter about ten years—he was in the wholesale department, Nicholas-lane, and had the charge of making up parcels, assisted by West—he went to the stock for the contents of the parcels—he did not require any<lb></lb>body to deliver them—the warehouseman, White, each day enters in a book the articles required for him to put up; if there are half-a-dozen for one man, the name and address of that man is put opposite to them—it was his duty to make up the parcels as they are entered in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); the book being signed at the time the parcels are made up, the parcels are then called over by a warehouseman, he checks them from the bills of parcels and they are put into the van—he does not call them over from the book, but from the delivery notes—the parcels are in the department when Mr. White calls them over—they are called over immediately before they are put into the van—Walklin is present when they are called over—he takes part in it—they are called over by marks—there is a description on each parcel for them to deliver them by—it is a direction which the carman understands, but it is not the man's name—these are the goods (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we had similar goods in our warehouse—Walklin had no right to send out this parcel that day without any direction—this book is in the writing of several persons—it is simply copied from our day-book—Walklin had no right to make up this parcel in addition to the entries in the day-book—he was not directed to send any goods to Daniels that day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am warehouseman to Petty, Wood, and Co.—Walklin was their porter, and it was his duty to make up parcels for delivery—he had this book for his guidance—it was his duty to endorse upon the parcels the names and address, or certain marks to indicate them, and also the weights—it was my duty to call over the parcels after they were made up, to see that they corresponded with the invoices—I did so on</p>

               <p>13th November, and there was no parcel that was not endorsed—I do not know this parcel—there was no parcel to spare beyond those which tallied with the invoices—Walklin had no right to make up any extra parcel after he had called them over—if he had been directed to make up any parcel by any person in the establishment, I should have been told of it—I found a parcel for Robson, of Camden-town, of 141bs. of pepper, and 71bs. of Jordan almonds, and called it over among the others—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) are the covers of that parcel—these hieroglyphics on it are in Walklin's writing—it is: "14 white pepper R.C.T".—that means, "Robson, Camden Town"—this wrapper taken from Daniels, has on it "14 white pepper," in Walklin's writing, but has no initials—the parcel of almonds, is marked "7 of Jordan C."—C. is the quality; there is nothing to indicate the address—that also is in Walklin's writing—he had no authority to send those out that day.</p>

Jordan C.; Robson, Camden-town," and received an answer from Walklin in the other room—I could not see whether he answered from the parcels or from the book, or from his memory—there were fifty or sixty parcels on that day—I did not know when I had called over all, that there were any left—West assists Walklin to pack up the parcels; they are made up openly in the warehouse—I have sometimes checked them with West when Walklin was not there at all, and I believe the boy West sometimes packed up parcels when Walklin was not there—I do not recollect articles being brought back by the man, saying that two parcels had been made up for one customer—I was engaged in the business on the day before this, but do not recollect that I was engaged in packing up parcels when Walklin was not there.</p>

               <p>Daniels there before—he has frequently bought things at our warehouses—old fruit, and paper, and several things, and I have seen him about when he has not bought things—I have seen him frequently with Walklin, and with other people in the place too—I have received money from Walklin at times—I did not see Walklin that day after I got back from the van—I did not see him again at all before I was taken in custody—money has passed between him and me; I cannot call to mind the date, but about two or three weeks before 13th September: on several occasions; I cannot tell the exact amount—I think in one instance 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and on another occasion I think 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have seen Daniels upon one of those occasions—I think the money from Walklin was given me for goods of this description; something similar to this. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Dervey, a boot maker, of 39, Poultry—I know Daniels and Walklin, I have seen them together—my attention was called to them by Smart the officer—on 5th December last, I went into the Boar's Head public-house, Cannon-street, at Smart's request—I had a glass of ale, and while I was waiting there, Daniels came in—he looked the side of the window as if he were waiting for some one—Bollen came in and they had a very deep conversation for some three or four minutes—I went out and told Smart what I had seen—he asked me to go back again—I did so, and they were still talking—I went out—Daniels went out just before me, and he was joined by the porter—Daniels went over the bridge, and I and Smart went together and watched them over the bridge—Walklin was before Daniels, and when Walklin had gone round the corner he stopped for a moment and was joined by Daniels, and they stopped and talked together for some time, at a grocer's shop at the corner of York-street, over the bridge—the next day, the 6th, I went up to see whether I could see Smart at the same place where I went the day before—he was not there, but I saw Daniels—I watched him some minutes—he went into the Boar's Head public-house, and was there joined by Walklin, and they had a pint of ale together—they stayed there about six or eight minutes—I was there all the while—I left them there and went to look for Smart—I saw them come out together—they went over the bridge together.</p>

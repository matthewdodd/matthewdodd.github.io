I had lost small sums of money at different times; to endeavour to discover the thief I marked a quantity and put it in the place from which I had lost it before.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you marked it - A. I marked it a fortnight before I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that is the 22nd of January - A. Then that is the day I marked it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you placed it - A. In a drawer in the iron book case, in my accompting house, it was in a bag; it was there safe a fortnight; I counted it every morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she access to your accompting house - A. No. On Sunday the 15th of February I missed thirteen shillings out of two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your money been changed in the course of that fortnight - A. No; it had never been out of the bag only on the place where I counted it; I sent for an officer on the Monday and called the servants together, and told them what was the officer's business; the money was found in this prisoner's box; her box was unlocked. I have another maid servant and an apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she get at this chest of your's - A. That I can only speak to from conjecture. I had one key in my pocket, and the other in the drawer in the accompting house.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any body get at it - A. By taking it out of my pocket in my bed chamber while I was asleep when the children were taking away between seven and eight o'clock. Sunday morning I lay late; I laid my clothes in the chair, I suppose she took it out of my pocket and returned it again; but that is all supposition. There was no violence in the least upon the lock. It is a good lock, I do not think it could easily be picked.</p>
               <p>Q. When you charged her with it what did she say - A. She said she had put a few shillings in her box, part of the last quarter's wages, and begged to be forgiven after it was found.</p>

            . I am a constable. Mr. Figgins sent for me on Monday morning; I went to the house; the prisoner said Mr. Figgins was very welcome to look at what money she had in her box; a man brought the box down stairs; I asked the young woman if she had any money in her box; she said half a guinea and some silver; she put her hand into the box and took out a morocco purse; I emptied it on the table; there was half a guinea and some shillings; Mr. Figgins looked at the shillings and said they were the shillings he had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shillings - A. Thirteen shillings; she seemed confused at the time; she said she hoped her master would forgive her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Figgins. The man that brought the box down happened to be a jobbing carpenter, that happened to be in the house at the time; my wife and he went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the carpenter been in the house - A. He had not been in the house half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had all gone up together it would have been much better - here is a box found open, and that man comes down with it, whether he put it there or any body else, we do not know - the other maid went to your room, did not she - A. The coat laid in a chair near the door, and the door was not fastened.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing at all about it; my box was open, any body might put them there. My father is a soldier in the Isle of Wight; my mother is just returned from him. I have no friend in the world.</p>

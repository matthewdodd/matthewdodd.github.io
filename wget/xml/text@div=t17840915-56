I got up about one o'clock to go to the fields to milking, and when I got up I found my chest broke open, and my money all gone, the boy was in bed at the same time; I said I have lot all my money and shall be ruined, then the lad said I cannot lay here; then I got up and went down stairs, and when I came home again he was fast asleep on the bed.</p>
               <p>He did not get up? - No, not that time, I was in the field about three hours, or three hours and a half; when I came home I found him in bed, fast asleep; I called him and he got up; then said I, I thought you was to get up earlier than usual; then says he, I am ruined for ever, I should have got up a great deal sooner than I did, and immediately he got up, that was a quarter before seven; he did not use to get up till ten in the day, because he went to bed late at night.</p>
               <p>What business did he follow? - He was the pot-boy; then he got up directly and made off, he was pursued and taken in half an hour; he was gone longer than usual for his pots, and then the master of the house said, this lad has surely got the money, he used to come in with half a dozen pots at a time; I have never had my purse or money again.</p>

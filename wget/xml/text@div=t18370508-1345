                  </hi>. I am a constable of St. Ann's, Westminster. On the 24th of April I went to No. 34, St. Ann-street, Westminster, a little after twelve o'clock—Hall, Duke, and Ashton were with me—the street<lb></lb>door being open, I proceeded up stairs to the first floor, followed by Ash<lb></lb>ton and Hall—I found the room door fastened, and I tried to open it, but could not—Ashton broke the pannel of the door; and, with the assistance of Hall, we broke the door open—I found the bedstead placed against the door, and I saw Oliver shoving against the bedstead—I saw Birch run from a table to the fire-place, and with his left hand he put something into a pipkin on the fire, there being a brisk fire at the time; he had in his right hand this hammer, which he put into the pot, and it has now some white metal on it—at that instant I secured Birch, and put him into one corner of the room—after the other officers had secured the other pri<lb></lb>soners, I and Ashton began searching the premises—I took off the fire a pipkin nearly full of metal, in a fluid state—that was the pipkin that I saw Birch put something into a cupboard by the side of the fire—I found part of a mould, the impression being scraped off—I took a knife off the table which I have left at home—the prisoners were taken to the office in a coach—Ashton was inside the coach with me—Birch began a conversation with me, he said "Mr. Powell knows us very well, but he never had us</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183705080142"></xptr>
               <p>for smashing," meaning passing counterfeit coin—I said, "You are en<lb></lb>gaged in a very bad business"—his answer to that was "Yes, it is no use our denying it to you, it is our living. I had rather such men as you came, than the Broadway people, for we shall have the truth from you"—while we were in the room, 1 saw Ashton turn some dirty water out of a pail, and in the pail he found three crown-pieces, with some small pieces of plaster of Paris mould—they were put on the hob to dry, being in a wet state—on one of the pieces I saw the date of 1818.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant G</hi> 11.) I accompanied Reynolds, and followed him up stairs—we attempted the door several times, and found we could not get in—I burst one of the pannels in, and got my head and arm in—I saw the bedstead against the door—Oliver had got his back against the bedstead, and his feet against the table, which was against the wall on the other side, pushing against it. I saw the prisoner Wood in a stooping position before the fire, trampling hard on something—I saw Birch take a quantity of crown-pieces and smaller coin from the table, and put it into a pipkin on the fire—I Found we could not get in,—I asked Reynolds to lend me his pistol, Which he did, and 1 said to the person inside, "I see what you are doing; if you do not desist this instant, I will blow your brains out"—the woman said, "It is too late, you are too late"—and Birch said, "Now let the b——s in, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, it is all right"—the door and frame and all then gave way, and we all got in headlong—the prisoners were secured—on a chest of drawers in the corner of the room, I found these four metal spoons, and on the hob these two small files, apparently with white metal in the teeth of them—there was a pail containing dirty water, tea leaves, and other filth, which I poured into a tub, and found in the pail these three crown-pieces in an unfinished state, and these three pieces of mould in a very wet state—I saw some letters on them, the letter G in particular—I placed them on the hob to dry, and while so engaged, with my back to the prisoners, Birch made a rush, though he was handcuffed, and, got the three pieces of mould and put them in his mouth—as soon as he had spat some of it out, he said, "It is all right, that has saved the <hi rend="italic">bellowsing</hi>, "meaning transportation for life—when we were in the coach, a person in the street called out "What have they got you for?"—Oliver answered, "Only for four <hi rend="italic">bulls;</hi> it is that b——y old Ross put them upon us—I had an order for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go into the country."</p>

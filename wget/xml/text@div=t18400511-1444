                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, in partnership with two others, in Chiswell-street. The prisoner was our shopman—he had 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—on the 5th of May, in consequence of suspicion, I marked three half-crowns, a shilling, and a sixpence—I gave them to Mr. Rule, to send some one to the shop to make purchases—on that night I put 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper in the till, which was then empty—on the following morning I went into the shop soon after seven o'clock—the prisoner and one or two others were there, who were porters—business begins at six o'clock—I went, looked into the till, and saw two half-crowns, and some smaller pieces of silver, I think a shilling and a sixpence—I did not interfere with the money—after that I sold something in the shop for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for which I took a shilling, and gave 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper change—I put that shilling in the till—soon after I went to the till, and took out the money that was in it, consisting of all the sums I have mentioned, two half-crowns, two shillings, and one sixpence—I ex<lb></lb>amined them—they were all marked, with the exception of one shilling—they were what I gave to Rule—I called the prisoner into the counting-house,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a china-dealer. There were some premises at 5, Church-lane, Chelsea, on which I saw a bill—I afterwards saw the prisoner at Mr. Mitchell's, a broker, on 9tb July; I said to him, "I understand there is a house to let, and you are referred to; is it your house?"—he said, "Yes, it is"—I said, "What is the rent of the house?"—he said he had much rather let it on a lease as he had other business to attend to, and conse<lb></lb>quently he could not pay attention to it—I asked him what lease he intended to let it upon—he said twenty years, or any term I thought proper—I asked him what he would require for a lease of twenty years—he said 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. premium, at a rent of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—I said I had not examined the internal parts of the house, but if they were in tenantable order I would see, and would ray probably agree with him for the house—that was for the purpose of my own business—I am a jobber, and deal in china and glass—I paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as a deposit, which he requested—he afterwards drew up this memorandum—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—" <hi rend="italic">By this Philip Fischell agreed to let his house</hi>, 5, <hi rend="italic">Church-lane, to Benjamin Evans at the yearly rental of</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">on condition that Benjamin Evans should pay the sum of</hi> 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for a lease of twenty years</hi>")—I saw the prisoner again on 11th July, and, in consequence of something I had heard, I told him I had heard that the house did not belong to him, that there was a landlord living—he said, "No,"the property was his own, the landlord was deceased, being a very old gentleman; he had lately died, and the property had become his—through the ill-usage of the son to the father, he had left it to him—he had a solicitor with him—I told him I had not the money to spare—I said if I paid him 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should have no money left, the house would be no use to me—he said, as to money it was no object, he was a merchant in the City, and a ship-owner, and he wanted to get rid of the house as he expected every hour to be called to Liverpool—he said the house was his own freehold <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> property—I believed that the house was his freehold, and paid him thirty sovereigns and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he had had as a deposit—he said money was no object to him, he wanted to go to Liverpool to his ships, and if I wanted money he would lend me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. directly I paid the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on a future day I could have a hundred or two on a per centage, but after had paid him the money I could scarcely get a receipt—instead of handind me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he packed up his papers and went into Mr. Mitchell's—I fol<lb></lb>llowed</p>

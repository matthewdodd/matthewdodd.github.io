               <p>Q. On Wednesday the 25th of April were the prisoners employed in any part of the Tower - A. They were employed in Mr. Wellbanck's house; he is the first clerk in the delivery office, belonging to the board of ordnance; the prisoners were employed in that house that day; they are <rs id="t18090517-16-deflabel96" type="occupation">plaisterers</rs>

The day after I saw the prisoners going out of the Tower between six and seven o'clock in the evening. I followed them and stopped them just by the governor's grape trees in the Tower; I told them they must go back with me to the clerk of the work's office; they went back with me; I then said go along with me and bring the remainder of the lead that you have been stealing.</p>
               <p>COURT. You had lost more, had you - A. Yes. This piece Brown had tied up in an old nail bag; he was going along with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you fitted it - A. No. I know it by giving it to the plumbers to affix it, and boring these holes with my own hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Is this place from where this was taken part of the building - A. Yes; it is on a summer-house; it is on the top of the house. The other part of the lead is here.</p>

            . I belong to the Thames Police, and apprehended the prisoner; she said she did not steal the money, but if she had it she had as good a right to it as Nicholls herself, because she had cohabited with her father many years - I found only 4 1/2d. on her, but this was between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; I searched her house - she said, "You need not search there - I will tell you the truth; I will tell you where it is;" but she said nothing more - I found no money in the house, but her husband was there; he had none - I afterwards saw him quite drunk; the prosecutrix was sober.</p>

               <p>Court. What business had you there? - I had been to carry some goods, I am sure the prisoner took my cloak and the tobacco between him and the other, I never saw any of these people before; the prisoner told Justice Staples, that he took the cloak but not the parcel.</p>
               <p>Was the examination taken in writing? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was there a good many people about you in this narrow street? - There was a great deal of Jews and other men, I saw all the action and transaction, there are a parcel of dirty boys, there was nobody spoke to me, but the other man and him.</p>
               <p>How come you to recollect him? - Because I do, if I could not swear to him, I would not.</p>
               <p>Why do you swear to him? - I can swear to him in any place in England, that he is the man that took my cloak, he is the man I met and chucked them down.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time during the course of this day, say you could not tell whether the prisoner or any other man took your cloak? - I did not, they are false people that say so.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. Did they say any thing in your presence about her stealing the property from another person? - They never said a word of that sort in their life to my knowledge.</p>

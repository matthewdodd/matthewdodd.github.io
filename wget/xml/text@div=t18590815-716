                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, S</hi> 241). On Saturday morning, 30th July, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was on duty at Uxbridge, opposite the General Elliott public house, and saw Crockett about six yards from the house going away from it—I went towards him, turned my light on him, and then went to the door and saw Hemmings scramble out of the cellar—I took him in custody; he kicked me, struck me several times in the face, and I was laid up for nine nights and could not do duty—while I was struggling with him Crockett came up, seized me by both arms behind, and they both escaped—I called the landlord down, and then went and told Taylor, my sergeant, about it; we went into the cellar and found 3 1/2 lbs. of tobacco and a bottle of wine at the bottom of the cellar flap where Hemmings came out—I went with Sergeant Neave and another officer, found Crockett in bed, and took him in custody.</p>

               <p>upstairs—there are two stories to the house—I heard the other officer call out "Tom" to somebody, but did not hear him speak to them—I have known the prisoners 12 months; one lives on Uxbridge Moor, and the other in Checkley-yard, about a mile apart—it was a very wet night—the General Elliott was shut up. I did not recognise Crockett till I turned my light on him and then I knew him, and I had a better chance of seeing who he was when he came and caught hold of me—I was 3 yards from the cellar when I saw Hemmings come out of it—he could not spring out, it was too deep—when I first saw him he had his head and shoulders above the level of the flap—one side of the flap was wrenched open—there are no steps—I was never asked before about seeing his head and shoulders out, but I said that I saw him come out and I tore his jacket here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I said to the landlord that I did not know their names, but could give a full description of them—I told him how they were dressed, and he said "Oh, that is Thomas Hemmings and Crockett"—I had heard their names before, about the market-place, but could not think of them—I do not know that one has been in the service of the postmaster—I have heard that Hemmings was in the service of Page, the builder, and have heard that he was convicted 5 times in 5 months—I went to another place before I went to his mother's—I have never expressed the slightest doubt about the prisoners, not even to the landlord.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist Mrs. Mac Donald, the landlady of the General Elliott, at Uxbridge—I fastened the house up on this Friday night at half-past 10 or 11 o'clock—there is a cellar door in the street with 2 flaps which fasten with 2 bolts inside—the cellar is under the parlour, and you can get out there up some steps and through a door—I was awoke by the police, and accompanied Finlayson into the cellar through the door—he was bleeding from the nose, and complained of being knocked about—we examined the cellar; one of the hasps was gone and the other was broken and torn nearly off—the flap was open—under the flap I found a bottle of sherry laid upon 3 1/2 lbs. of tobacco which had been on the corner of the lowest stair when I went to bed, and the wine was on a shelf over the tobacco—I have seen the prisoners together before.</p>

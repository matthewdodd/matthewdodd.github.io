             of Woodford in the County of Middlesex, was pursued by some persons into the Field behind Montague House, in order to apprehend him, crying out a Highway-man. When he was in the Field, a great Rabble was running after him, throwing Brick-Batts at him; upon which, Mr. Smith the Constable coming along the Field, met the Prisoner, telling him that he was a Constable; and if he would surrender himself to him, he would preserve him from the Insolencies of the Mobb: But he refused it, and drew his Sword, swearing he would kill any man that should come near him, bidding Mr. Smith keep off, or else (he swore) God Damn him <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16940524004"></xptr> he would shoot him, and made a Pass at <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note>put by with his Staff. Upon which Mr. Smith, being a    man. Closed in with hi, and clasped him about; and having his Constables Staff in his Left Hand, and a Pistol in the Right, he immediately discharged his Pistol upon the ground, directing it from the Prisoner, that it might not hurt him. After which, Mr. W. shot Mr. Smith into the Thigh, who fell back and Cry'd out, the Rogue has kill'd me. It was   proved that Mr. Smith shewed the Prisoner his Authority as a Constable, by producing his Staff, and very mildly desired him, in the King's Name, to yield and surrender himself quietly to his power, he would protect him; but he would not yield, swearing he would shoot him, as aforesaid. And if the Constable had not put the said W's Pistol downwards towards the earth, he had shot him in the Belly. There were several Witnesses for the King, who all agreed in the matter of Fact, as aforesaid, &amp;c. Mr. W. declared in his Behalf, That he was afraid of Bayliffs arresting him, and therefore made that defence for himself; and that Mr. Smith came without a Staff or Warrant to seize him, therefore he thought him not to be a Constable, and that he never told him he was one. He called some Witnesses that were in the Field at the same time the Murder was done, who could not confirm what he asserted, but only declared in the general, That they saw the Prisoner and Mr. Smith struggling together; that there were two Pistols shot off, that Mr. W. went off last. The first Witness against him further declared, That the Prisoner desired him not to inform the Court at the Trial, that he had any Society with Bernard, and the rest that Robbed Sir Richard Pigget's House, for that might be a prejudice to him, &amp;c. The Prisoner urged further, That what he did, was in his own defence: But was told that could not be for all the Evidence agreed viva voce, that he killed him maliciously and basely, being unwilling to be taken, lest he should be prosecuted for the Burglary at Sir Richard Piggets. The Evidence being full, he was found <rs id="t16940524-26-verdict106" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Court.

               <p>Do you know any thing of the other? - I went to the Rotation-office, the prisoner Brewster was sitting on a box, I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100037"></xptr> there and perfectly challenged him in my mind, to be one of the three, but cannot so positively swear to him, I believe him to be one; none of the property was found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of Irongate Wharf, Paddington—On Saturday night, 10th June, at 11 o'clock I was in bed on the ground floor, and was awakened and saw the prisoner pass my coat out at the window—he was three parts in the room, but standing outside—I asked him what he was doing, and he ran away—I went after him, and never lost sight of him—he got behind a cart—I called for help, and Sergeant Tompkins came up he laid hold of him behind the cart—I charged him with stealing a coat and waistcoat—I picked up the waistcoat myself—I have not recovered the coat—the prisoner said he was sleeping on the timber—on the road he said "I had got the wrong shop" and that he had some beer.</p>

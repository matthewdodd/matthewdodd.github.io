                  </hi>. I am a widow, in partnership with my mother. We keep a bookseller's shop in Covent-garden—a little before nine o'clock on the 10th of Oct., I left the shop in care of my mother, while I went into another room—I was away about two minutes—when I came back, my mother told me something, and I looked at the board outside—I missed "Josephus," in one volume, complete—I had seen it safe not two minutes before—we have not got it back.</p>

                  </hi>. On the night of the 10th of Oct. I was walking in King-street, Covent-garden—I saw the prisoner next the board of the prosecutor's shop—I saw him take the book off the board, open it for half a minute, and then put it under his jacket, and run away—I ran after him into Bedford-court—he asked me the reason why I ran after him—I said for taking the book off the board—he opened his jacket, and said he had not got the book—a policeman came up, and I gave the prisoner in charge—when he took the book there was another young man near him, and as they were crossing the road, the book dropped—the other took it up, and ran away with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I had been rather behind my time, and he came up and said I had a book under my arm; I walked with him till I got to New-street, there he saw a policeman and gave me in custody; I never had the book; if I had been guilty I could have run away.</p>

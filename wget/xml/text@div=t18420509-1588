                  </hi>. I live with my father, Louis Banfield, a shoe<lb></lb>maker, in Norfolk-place, Bethnal-green-road; the prisoner was our jour<lb></lb>neyman. On the afternoon of the 29th of April, he came to the shop to change two pieces of leather—I took them from him and left the shop, leaving him there in a sort of entry or passage adjoining the shop, divided from it by a wicket door—he could see all round the shop—I came back and gave him three pieces of leather in change for the two pieces he had brought—he then went away—after he was gone I missed this pair of boots from a bar under the counter, within reach of where he had been standing—I went after the prisoner—he had got about half a dozen yards from the door—I stopped him and told him my father wanted him—he said did he, and came back with me—I told him he had taken a pair of boots off the bar—he said he had—he took off his hat and gave them to me—these are them—they are my father's—the prisoner had nothing to do with them.</p>

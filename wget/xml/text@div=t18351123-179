I am in partnership with my brother, Christopher Malthy—we are merchants and manufacturers—I found a quantity of brass missing from a warehouse in our manufactory in Bevedere-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth—I have known the prisoner many years—he is the son of our foreman—I am informed that lately he worked on our premises, but not with my knowledge—I heard of this robery from the foreman, who pointed out the part broken into—I found a door in a closet in the warehouse, with marks of violence on it—the brass was part it, taken from inside that closet, and part without—the force used at the door must have been very great—the wood work against the lock was</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Thames Police. I was sent for to the prosecutor's premises on Monday, the 9th of November—I examined the door, and found the door-post cut away, a portion of the door cut where the bolt of the lock shot, and some marks on the door-post—It had required considearble force to open the door—on the door-post and door there were marks of a round instrument having been introduced to force it open—I afterwards fitted this bullet-mould to it—It fitted exactly—I afterwards made inqury, and found at Messrs. Everett's, in the New Cut, nine pieces of brass weighing 9 cwt.—William Nicholson showed them to me on the 12th of November—In consequence of information I got there, my brother officer apprehended the prisoner that day—he was brought on board the police-ship that night—I told him that what he said in answer to any questions put to him might be used against him; and next day going down to the office I asked him how he got into the premises—he said he went into Perchey's yard, got up where the old iron was kept, and on the roof into a window in the tower of Mr. Maltby's shop, down there into the shot-house—that he took a ladder, got into the loft, cut the door and door-post with the knife, and forced it open with a bullet-mould and that he carried the brass out the same way he got in—I said it was impossible if they were that weight—he could not have done it by himself—he said, "I had no accomplice with me"—some of the pieces weighed three quarters of a hundred weight—at the time I went to Everett's they gave me this bills of parcels—I showed it to the prisoner, and he said he had written it—I asked him who Johnson was—he said he was asked a name, but he did not know who Johnson was—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "Mr. Edward Lambert, bought of W.

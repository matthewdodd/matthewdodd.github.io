            . On Thursday I was sent for to take this woman in custody; I went to a room where she lived in Peter's court, Rosemary lane. I found nothing in the room, but I took her in custody, and as I was bringing her to the office, between seven and eight in the evening, as we went along Rosemary lane I saw her throw something from her in a dark passage that appeared white like linen; I went up the passage and picked it up just as it was throwed down, this habit shirt and three caps. I brought her to the office, and the prosecutrix said it was part of her property that was stolen out of her room.</p>

Going along I met a woman in a dark brown coat, she was in liquor, she said she knew my husband, she was his countryman; she said will you go along with me, she asked me to pledge some handkerchiefs; I said, I will go and pledge these handkerchiefs at the Fourteen Stars; I went backwards, I shewed them the handkerchiefs, they would not take them in, this woman gave me the handkerchiefs, she staid in the street. I went with her to three pawnbrokers, there was never a one would take it in, they were so old; she gave me these things to take care of till Friday, I did not know that she had stole them, and Mr. Griffith's coming up and taking me, I was frightened; I threw them out of my pocket. I am very innocent, I know nothing of it; if I was to drop down dead I do not know where that woman lives.</p>

A little before three o'clock this woman was brought up with these handkerchiefs, she was discharged, we did not know who they belonged to; I went round to the pawnbroker's, they told me that this woman had been to pledge these handkerchiefs and they would not take them in.</p>

On the 13th of October, a little after nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came into the shop with a female, and requested to see a pair of stockings - I showed him a pair of black worsted stockings; he was a considerable time looking at them, and objected to them as being dear - I had seen these stockings safe in the centre of the counter, half a minute before; he and the female went out together, without buying any thing - I followed, and laid hold of him, about a yard and a half from the door, and took these pair of stockings from him; the female accompanied him to the watch-house, and then went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had the female some things in her apron? A. Yes; he did not say he thought they were things which she had dropped out of her apron; she opened it at the watch-house, for the officer to see - I saw a shirt and a counterpane there, and inquired at a pawnbroker's, and found he had been, and taken some things out of pawn.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I was sitting at the top of the shop, and saw the prisoner come in with a woman; he asked to see a pair of black stockings, for his sister; they bought nothing, and as he went out, I saw him put his right hand on four or five pairs of stockings; he took the top pair, and immediately went out - I told my husband, who went out, and took them from under his arm - I followed, and  caught him myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many pairs were on the counter? A. Five pairs.</p>

            . I am a constable, and took charge of the prisoner.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop with my sister, who had just come from the country; she wanted a pair of black stockings, but would not give the price he asked - I said, "Have them, and I will pay for them" - she said they were not worth the money; we were turning out of the shop - there was a board with stockings on it, and as I was going out I saw a pair of stockings under my feet - I thought she had dropped them, as she had redeemed some at Mr. Layburn's; they went to the pawnbroker's, and found the other things were redeemed - I refused to let the prosecutor have the stockings, till he saw whether my sister had lost them.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOWELL. He did not refuse to let me have the stockings, nor did he say he thought his sister had dropped them - I went to the pawnbroker's, as I knew the prisoner before, and if I could serve him, I should have been glad; he was once a temporary watchman in our district - I knew him by seeing him pass the door - I went to inquire if he had redeemed a sheet and quilt, as I did not wish to injure him - I have no shop mark on them; but they were in the paper; they are not black stockings.</p>
               <p>SARAH HOWELL re-examined. Two persons came into the shop as he was going out.</p>

               <p>I am a servant of Mr. Newman's, in cutting rods for him; I know his ozier grounds at Battersea very well; I cut for him last year, I began a little before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Should you know these rods again, if you was to see them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you dispose of any of these rods by order of Mr. Newman, or on your own account? - No, never; I saw Green before the Justice; I was present at the examination; I cannot say whether it was taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you been an ozier-cutter? - I worked for Mr. Newman about two years; I served my time to the trade of basket-making.</p>
               <p>These were the rods, were they? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If I was to shew you a bundle of Oxfordshire rods, should you know them? - I never was there.</p>
               <p>Suppose I talk of my own country, Hertfordshire?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240066"></xptr>- If I was used to the ground I could soon tell them.</p>
               <p>Tell us your reason for knowing these rods from any other you have never seen? - I would not.</p>
               <p>You would not be able to distinguish them from the others? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you distinguish them from the Battersea rods? - Yes; some rods grow very rough, and some not quite so rough.</p>
               <p>You cut them down with the bark upon them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see these with the bark upon them? - Yes, most undoubtedly, it gets browner.</p>
               <p>The quality of the rods depends in some sort upon the moisture or drains of the ground upon which they grow? - The more moist the better for the roots.</p>
               <p>Therefore any grounds of equal moisture, would produce the same sort of rods? - I look upon it to be so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Newman has grounds at Chiswick? - Yes, all in one line by the water-side.</p>
               <p>There is very little difference between them? - There is enough difference to distinguish between them, though you might not, one runs knobbly, and the other runs smooth.</p>
               <p>Does the river Lee oziers run knobbly? - I never saw any of them.</p>

               <p>Was you employed by Mr. Newman? Yes, I sold some after these were lost, but not before; it was my business to sell; I sold them after the month of February; I never sold any before.</p>
               <p>How many ozier twigs have you sold for your master? - Many hundreds of bundles; I have sold for very near a year before that, but none of the produce of that ground, nor none of that year's growth; I have been with my master eighteen or twenty months.</p>
               <p>Have not you sold during that eighteen or twenty months, any other twigs off the Battersea grounds of that year's growth? - I am convinced of it; I am clear of it.</p>

               <p>What day in March? - I cannot say, I sold them when they were enquired for.</p>

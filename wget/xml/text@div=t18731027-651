I am an engraver at 13, Leicester Street, Regent Street—I remember the prisoner calling on me—he was with me four times, and during those four times he brought me different portions of an Austrian bank-note—the first time he came he said "I want you to do some work for me"—he produced a half-sheet of foolscap paper, on which was fastened three pieces of paper separately, a square piece in the centre, and two small ovals on each side—he said it was for his brother in Hungaria, who had coal mines, and they were what his brother had sent over to him to be engraved—he wanted it done exactly as he had got them on the paper—I said "Then you want a <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi>"—he did not seem to understand the term, and I said "You want it engraved exactly as it is here"—he said "Yes"—he laid down before me this little piece with the figure ten on it, and this small piece with the letter X on it—I saw at once they were cut from a bank-note.

I am not so deaf as my master—I heard what passed between him and the prisoner—when I went in I saw the prisoner there with Mr. Murray, and he was giving Mr. Murray an order to engrave these three portions of a note—they were to be engraved on one plate, and they were pasted in the way he told us we were to put them on the plate and do them exactly as they were there, not alter them in the least respect—Mr. Murray asked him who he was doing it for, and he said he was doing it for his brother in Hungaria, who had a great deal to do in that way, and if we did that nicely and gave him satisfaction he would bring us some more work to do—he left, promising to come next morning—he came again next day about 5 o'clock—I was there, and Mr. Murray also—the prisoner brought some more pieces of paper and said he wished to have them engraved—Mr. Murray said he would do it for him—the prisoner then asked him what would be the cost of it—Mr. Murray said he could not tell him exactly, he thought it would be about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said he thought that was a great deal, but Mr. Murray told him he</p>

               <p>could not do it for less, and the prisoner agreed to give him that price for it—this is the plate he brought on that occasion, also this piece of paper with the number "10" and the Roman figure "X"—Mr. Murray asked him what they belonged to, and he said he would give further directions, he would let that be for the present—he stayed about two hours on that occasion—it was some time before we could understand him—Mr. Murray said he would go on with the first part and let the other bide for the present—he left, promising to call the next evening—he came again the next day and brought this steel-plate and this piece of paper with the Arms of Austria on it—he asked Mr. Murray whether he would be able to engrave that—Mr. Murray said he would, and the prisoner told him to do so—Mr. Murray asked him what it belonged to, whether it belonged to the first part—the prisoner said "No "at first, but Mr. Murray asked him again and he said "Yes "it did—Mr. Murray took up the pieces and put them together and asked whether they all belonged to one note, and the prisoner said it did—Mr. Murray said "Am I to engrave it altogether? and the prisoner said he was to do so—he took this plate out of his pocket in the course of the conversation—he said he had had it engraved, but it would not do; it was not like the pieces he gave us—he pointed out that the—scroll work was not carved in a proper manner quite as it was on the piece he gave us to copy from—and he asked us whether we could alter" the plate—Mr. Murray told him he could not do that, and then he asked Mr. Murray to engrave a new plate and he agreed to do so, and the prisoner pointed out very particularly that Mr. Murray was not to make the same blunders in the new plate as there were in that—he went away then—this is the plate that Mr. Murrav began upon—there is no engraving on it, but there is some drawing which was to be engraved—the prisoner asked Mr. Murray on the Wednesday after he had given the further instructions for the engraving of the plate, whether he could print ten or twenty thousand impressions from the plate—Mr. Murray remarked that that was a very large number, and what was he going to do with them—he said he should be able to make one or two thousand pounds by the transaction, and if we executed plates as he wished it to be done, we should have half of what he made.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not say that; on the contrary, on the Wednesday I told him to return my things because it was troubling my mind so much I would not have anything to do with it.

                  </hi>. I live at Barnes, in Surrey, and am a plumber. I employed the prisoner to work for me at Putney, as a bricklayer, to make good the tiling of a building there—I missed some lead from there—I have compared the lead produced with that on the house there—I find it corresponds exactly with my lead, and with the measure—I will swear this is part of the lead that came from that house.</p>

On the 3d of September I saw the prisoner and another person standing at the top of our street, conversing together, about three o'clock; the prisoner came into the shop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230031"></xptr>with a pattern of brown cloth, and wanted twist to match it; I took the twist drawer out, and put it before him, on the counter - while doing that, the other man came in, and said he wanted some black ferrit; I was the only person in the shop; my suspicions were raised; I said I had none - he went out, leaving the prisoner in the shop- the prisoner chose a ball of twist, and said he would have a yard of it; I had to go to the other end of the shop for the scissors: I kept a sharp eye on him, and just as I turned round I saw him take a ball of twist out of the drawer, and put it into his pocket; there being nobody near, and knowing he had an accomplice outside, I looked at him, but said nothing: and let him go out, as nobody was there to take care of the shop, which is open back and front; I did not tell master of it till the 17th, when the man who had asked for the ferrit came again, and asked for a yard of black twist - I did not exactly know him, but I knew the twist by the pattern he brought; I supposed another man would come, and in came the prisoner - he said, "Have you got any books and eyes?" I said, "No, but stop;" master just happened to come into the shop, and I said, "This is the man who a fortnight ago stole a ball of twist;" they were both secured, the other man was discharged at Guildhall: I am sure I saw the prisoner take a ball of twist on the 3d of September.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was your master at home? A. No - I saw him every day for a fortnight after; I do not know why I did not tell him of it - he might have been cross with me for not securing him, and I thought it best to say nothing about - it was very improper, I own; nobody was passing in the street - it is an out of the way place: I do not know whether the female servant was at home. I gave the prisoner a look to make him think I saw him; he went straight out to Ludgate-hill - if he thought I had seen him, of course, he would not come again; there were rolls of cloth on the counter, and it would not be right for me to follow him: the other man produced the same pattern as the prisoner brought before - when they were secured a ball of twist was found between two cloths, they must have been placed there while I was gone for a constable; a silk handkerchief was found on him, which he said belonged to his companion.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and took charge of the prisoner; I found nothing on either of them - the prisoner had a watch and about 7s. 6d., also a handkerchief, which he said was his companion's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He accused me of having been there a fortnight before, and taking the twist - his master was at the door; I was out in the street - he said, "My young man says you have robbed me," and I came back - at the second examination the young man said he found a hall of twist in the window.</p>

            . I found a ball in the window, about an hour after they were taken; it was not the stolen ball, but a different colour - it was between two cloths in the window.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not come back to the shop of his own accord, and ask you to send for a constable, if you had any charge? A. Not to my recollection - he had the handle of the door in his hand, when master told me to go for a constable; I said, "Stop," and he came back.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH POTTER. I produced the twist which I found between the cloths, at his first examination - the first time he was at Guildhall was not an examination.</p>

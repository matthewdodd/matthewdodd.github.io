            . I am a porter. I saw Harris on the steps, and asked if he should want a porter; he said he thought he should - he went into this vessel, stopped there eight or ten minutes, and then put his hand forwards, 
down towards the prosecutor - it went close to his jacket, but whether it went into his pocket I do not know; the prosecutor turned round and took Bryant - I said, "I think this is the man, for I saw him at your pocket;" I do not think Harris was near enough for Bryant to hand the money over to him - when it was found on Harris, he said it was his own, and that he had changed a sovereign the night before; Bryant said he had come there to buy mackarel - I have seen them in the market with fish before.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was at Billingsgate, and was called into Mr. Gouldham's office, and found the prisoners, there charged with robbing the prosecutor of 13s. - Dagley gave the account he has now; I found on Bryant five shillings and six sixpences: and on Harris two good half-crowns, eight shillings, eight sixpences, and a bad half-crown - the prosecutor said he had two half-crowns, several shillings and sixpences, and that I should find a stain of blood on some of it; I found on one shilling, what I thought a stain of the blood of fish.</p>
               <p>Bryant' Defence. I went to buy mackarel; I just asked the price, and the man charged me with taking his money - I said he might search me; the money found on me was my own.</p>
               <p>Harris's Defence. I had changed a sovereign that morning, I went on board the boat, where there were two or three hundred people, to buy mackarel; that man was taken about ten yards from me - the witness said, "Take this man too;" for he was by him - there might be the mark of fish blood on my money.</p>

             came by and called me by my name and asked Bell how he did. She said she wanted to speak with him, but must go to her father first. When she returned. she asked him for a Dram, he said he had no money, she said will that young woman lend you some ? I said I had none. She lent him three halfpence. She put it into my hand to fetch a dram. I left them at the door. When I came with it I found them both where I left them. I was gone about 3 minutes. She drank first, Bell second, and I third. Her mother coming she whipped into the house and ran up one pair of stairs. she bolted herself in. The bolt is within-side. Her mother was making a noise. Then Mr. Gyles came back, he said if her daughter was there she should have her. Her mother and he went up, and asked her to open the door, she would not. Then Mr. Gyles broke the door open.</p>

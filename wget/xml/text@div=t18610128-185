I am a market-gardener of White Hart-lane, Battersea, and am accustomed to go to Covent-garden Market—on 12th December, about half-past seven, the prisoner came there to me, and bought a bushel of onions—he tendered a half-crown and a sixpence—that would be paying a shilling for the use of the basket, which would be returned if brought back—I put the money into my pocket—there was no other half-crown there—as soon as he saw me put it into my pocket, he said, "I will have another bushel of onions"—I sold him another bushel—he tendered me another half-crown—I tried it between my teeth, and found it bad—I said, "What do you call this, my man I—he said, "Oh, is it a bad one I if it is, I will give you another"—I said, "No, this game will not do; I will keep it, and give you in charge"—he turned round and ran away while I was looking after the beadle—I ran after him, caught him as he was going out of the market, and gave him in charge—I kept the last half-crown in my hand all the time—I gave it to the officer when he came up, and said, "I have got another in my pocket like it"—the other one was bad and exactly like it.</p>

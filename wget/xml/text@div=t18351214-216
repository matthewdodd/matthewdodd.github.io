               <p>evening, the 26th of November, I went to Stoney-school, and returned home at a little eight o'clock (perhaps ten minutes or a quarter of an hour)—It rained very much indeed—the prisoner opened the door—she took my um<lb></lb>brlla from me at the door, and gave me a candle to go up stairs to take my bonnet and cloak off—when I came down I asked her where my um<lb></lb>brella was put—she told me, in the coal-hole to drain—I came into the kitchen, and asked if she had finished a cap, and she showed me a cap she was working—I said, "Have you done any more?"—she held her work up, and there was a small bit done—I said, "Well, now I will sit down, and do a little work too before my supper"—I sat down, and worked for about ten minutes—not exceeding that—she sat facing me by the kitchen-table—she then went round the table to the back of me, by the dresser—when she got to the dresser, she immediately laid hold of the back of my head, and came round my shoulder, and put the carving knife into my mouth—she had got the knife out of the wash-house—I did not see her get it—must have been before I came home—she must have taken it from the dresser—she could not have taken it from any other place—I did not see where she got it form, before she put it into my mouth—I cannot tell any thing further, till I was on the ground, crying, "Murder"—I cried "Murder" very loud, and the neighbours heard, me on each side—the carving-knife cut me very much indeed in the mouth, at the side of my lip inside the cheek—I dare say in extended as long as an inch and a half, from the commencement—It appeared to me a deep cut, but the doctor can tell better than I can—I was on the floor, perhaps, two minutes, or more; but I remember scream<lb></lb>ing loud, "Murder"—how I came on the floor, it is not in my power to tell—I can only remember crying "Murder," and scuffling till I got to the street door, and her pulling me back; but I had suficient presence of mind. both to unbolt the door, and unlock it—the prisoner was pulling me back by the hair of my head, as I went to the passage to open the street door—she pulld me back—I opened the street door myself—she was pulling my hair at the time—the neighbours on each side were at the door—she tried to push the door too, and some man passing by put his knee in, and opened it—the prisoner tried to shut it—when I opened it, I unbolted it and unlocked it—my next door neighbour, Mrs. pulling, was standing there; and I said, "Mrs. Pulling, my servant has murdered me"—I had observed that the prisoner had brought the carving-knife in at tea time, with two of my best knives; and I said; "There is two of my best knives out of the case, Susan"—this was in the parlour—she said they had been in a very bad condition, and she had cleaned them all—I said, "Oh, very well;" but I knew they had not been cleaned—she brought them to me to show me that they were cleaned; and I said, "What does the carver do here?"—the carving-knife was in the kitchen at that time—she made no answer, but wiped it through her apron, and took it immediately into the wash-house—this conversation was between five and six o'clock—I never heard her say any thing about any will I had made—I never knew she knew of it—I never she her look at any paper, not ever heard her name it—she has lived with me and my mother upwards of twelve years—for the last two years, I have observed a good deal of bad conduct about her—I consider her mind had been very different from what it used to be—If I may judge by her actions, I consider she has not been right in her mind for the last two years.</p>

This will prove that I am in very deed the same person whom my lord hath, with the joint consent of his lady, Mrs. Georgiana Gagen, been graciously pleased to give his power, first to put into his lady's hands her own private property, and the remainder for my own use. I have therefore presented my own person as a witness to my lord's will.</p>

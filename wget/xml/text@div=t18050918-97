               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. I was sober; I had a friend with me; he was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went to take care of him; you fell asleep? - A. Yes; I slept till a man came to me; I felt him take my watch out of my pocket; he ran away, and I ran after him, calling out stop thief; he was stopped by a constable a little way further off, in the same street; I was not far behind him when he was taken; the witness that took him was shutting up his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your watch? - A. The witness had it afterwards; he found it on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all you know is, that you fell fast asleep; you felt a man take your watch out of your pocket; you ran after him, and cried out stop thief? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. I am a baker.</p>
               <p>Q. You were quite drunk? - A. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. I should think no sober man would fall fast asleep in the street - what time of the night was it? - A. Half past twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - A. I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have got a lodging, I suppose? - A. I live with my master; I sat down with my friend.</p>
               <p>Q. He was drunk, and you were not sober? - A. I had been drinking with him, but I was not drunk.</p>
               <p>- CAPFORD sworn. - I keep a soup-shop; I live in Little Chapel-street; I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the cry of stop thief? - A. Yes. I immediately pursued him; there was no one running in the street but him; I caught him just by his own door where he lives.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - A. A hackney-coachman; he drives for a master; when I took hold of him, he immediately said, I live here, let me lay my key down; there was a place withinside the palisades, where he pretended to lay the key down, and it fell out to be the watch; I desired the watchman to pick it up while I held him; he did, and gave it to me when we got to the watch-house. I produce the watch. (The watch identified by the prosecutor.).</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Capford. Q. You were the officer of the night? - A. I was parish constable.</p>
               <p>Q. You had got a companion with you; you did not see the man till the dog caught hold of him? - A. I did not know that the dog laid hold of him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I was told that there were two or three other men running at the same time? - A. There was no one running at the same time but the watchman and me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not pick up the watch; you took him to the watch-house first, before you saw the watch? - A. No; I saw him lay it down, and here is the watchman that picked it up; he broke the glass of the watch in laying it down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I left my yard a quarter before eleven, and I went home a quarter before twelve o'clock; I was at my own door by twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

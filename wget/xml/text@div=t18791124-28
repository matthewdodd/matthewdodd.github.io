                  </hi> I am secretary to the Persian Ambassador, Prince Malcolm Kahn—I remember seeing the prisoner in the hall at the Embassy con<lb></lb>versing with the servants, but they did not understand him—I can't say the exact date; it is nearly 40 days ago, and a week before the letter was received—I asked what he wanted, who he wad, and where he had come from—he said he was a Persian subject and an Armenian—I asked from what part—he said from Ispahan—I asked if he knew the Persian language—he said "No"—I said "How is it you have come from Persia and yet not know the Persian language?"—he said he was five years old when he left Ispahan, and then he was in Russia and was educated in Russia—I then said "What do you want?"—he said "I came here to be helped; I am a poor man; I don't know what I shall do"—I said "Why do you come here? what is your business here?"—he said "I came here to learn some profession"—I said "How came you here without money?"—he said "I had 600 roubles" (nearly 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)," but I have lost them"—I said "Where have you lost them?"—he said "In France"—I said "Were you robbed or did you drop it somewhere?"—he said "I do not know; I don't remember in which country it happened"—I then told the servants to give him something to eat, which they did—he said "I wish to see the Princess," the Ambassador's wife—I said "You can't see her; if you want to say something put it on paper; she understands Armenian"—on Sunday, the 26th October, I saw this letter in the Ambassador's hand, at his residence, Holland Park, which is also the Embassy—I afterwards saw the envelope; the butler showed it to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an interpreter, and lire at 8, Booklet Road, West Kensington Park—I have made a translation of this letter, addressed to His Excellency the Persian Minister—it is perfectly correct—the original is in Armenian—it is the letter of a man of a certain education—this letter was shown to the prisoner before the Magistrate, and he made this state<lb></lb>ment, which I interpreted to the Magistrate: "Really and truly I am the writer of the letter to M. the Minister, because he has no care for me. I have inadvertently fallen into trouble to the extent of 600 roubles. I am without bread, and am without means to earn my daily bread. Why?"</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The translation of the letter being read stated that he went to the embossy to ask for advice and assistance, and was unable torn the Ambassador. It contained the following sentence;</hi> "Do you think think I am an ignorant man, and know nothing and have seen nothing? Ton are mistaken, consider it superfluous to Bay more. Should you not by some means succour me your soul will not have any significance in my sight, as my soul has not had in yours. Therefore I shall be obliged first to kill you and then kill myself. I assure you I will certainly and surely do so."</p>

I don't recollect writing it I have a trouble which from time to time upsets my mind, and I wish for doctors to examine me."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner in his defence stated that he had no intention to do anything of the sort contained in the letter; that he had no cause of complaint against the Ambassador, he having been treated with kindess by the Princess, and that he had no recollection of what he wrote.</hi>

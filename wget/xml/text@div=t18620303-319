                  </hi>. I live at 5, Bouverie-street, and am shopman in the employ of Mr. William Reeve, of 30, Fetter-lane, oilman—on Saturday night, 25th January, from what he told me, I went into the street and found the prisoner standing by a barrow with a can of varnish on it—I asked him where he got it—he said, "What's that to do with you, is it yours?"—I said, "Well, I think it is; we will see whose it is"—he seemed rather spite<lb></lb>ful at first; but afterwards he said, "I know nothing about it; a man gave me a job to wheel it"—before the policeman came up, he said, "Very well, if it is your varnish take it; I don't want it;" and he was going away—the policeman then came up, and took him in custody—the varnish was ours, taken from just inside the shop door—it had no business out there—it was worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>man asked me where I was going; I said, "Straight down;" and he asked me if I would give him a lift with the can. I said, "Yes." He put it on the barrow; I wheeled it about forty or fifty yards from him, when Hench tapped me on the right shoulder. I asked him what he wanted. He asked me where I got the can from. I told him the man asked me to wheel it for him. He told me to wait a moment. He looked at the can, and I said, "Does it belong to you?" He said, "Yes." I took it off the barrow, and placed it on the pavement. If I had stolen the can, or known that it was stolen, why did I not place it inside the barrow? it would have been concealed there. Instead of which, I placed it on the top of the barrow board, and it could be seen from the top of Fetter-lane to the bottom. I did not know what it contained. I never used any of it in my life. Mr. Hench saw the other man who was with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master lumper. The prisoner was employed by me, on the 12th of November, to get this copper into the ship—he continued to work there till the Saturday—this copper was tne property of Mr. Christopher Biden—I swear there was copper in the ship with the same mark as this—here is "P G." and "S" on the copper—there were four hundred and forty-three tiles of copper.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police-constable, No</hi> 29.) On the 23rd June last, about three o'clock in the morning, I was on duty with inspector Maddox, in a police galley on the Thames, near Deptford-creek—there is slip there to go up to the wharf of the General Steam Navigation Company which is some distance up the creek—I saw a steamer, called the <hi rend="italic">Venezuela</hi>, lying alongside the wharf, high</p>

               <p>and dry, aground, as it was low water—I observed a small boat lying under<lb></lb>neath her starboard quarter, between the wharf and the vessel and saw the three prisoners underneath the paddle-wheel of the steamer—in consequence of that, I and my companions went on board a vessel there, called the <hi rend="italic">Little Western</hi>—Mr. Maddox went with me, but he returned—I remained on board the <hi rend="italic">Little Western</hi>, which gave me a view right up the creek—I saw the three prisoners come away from under the paddle-wheel, walk through the mud up the slip till they got to high water; and I then lost sight of them, as there is a turn in the slip—I saw them again within five minutes—they then returned, each with property in their arms—(they had nothing when they went up)—it appeared to be very heavy—I cannot tell what is was—they proceeded directly to the boat I had observed laying there, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the property into—after that Johnson handed a kettle out of the boat to Tullet who got into the mud alongside, and <hi rend="italic">kettled</hi>fifteen or sixteen kettles of mud into the boat; and after that they <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the kettle into the mud, where they had put then property, they stopped till the tide made in so as to float their boat, they then came and rowed out of the creek—we then went alongside of them—Maddox asked what they had in the boat—they said, "Iron"—I said, "Have you no copper?"—Johnson said, "None at all"—I put my arm in down to my elbow, and pulled up a bar of copper out of the boat—they were all three in the boat—I asked them what it was—Morris said it was iron—I said, "How do you know that?"—he said, "I know it is iron"—I said, "It is copper"—he made use of a very bad word, and said, "Who would have thought it was copper?"—I scraped the mud off to show that it was copper—they said they had picked it up—I put my arm down again, and fetched up a copper clamp—I took possession of the boat, and took the prisoners into custody—I produce the property—there is about 2 cwt altogether—this is the copper bolt that came out first—two of the wedges out of the eight have the navigation mark.</p>

                  </hi> I am managing-engineer to the General Steam Navi<lb></lb>gation Company. The slip leading to Deptford-creek, goes up to the wharf belonging to the Company, and is the Company's property—on the morning in question, there was property of this description belonging to the Company on the wharf—I have examined this—it is of the kind and description that was on the wharf at the time—here are some pieces that bear the marks of the Company—the Company make their screws and nuts themselves, and they are not the subjects of sale—I recognize these as screws and nuts made by the Company, on their premises—they are not taken away, except for the purposes of repair, on board ships—I know the three prisoners very well—they have been in the habit of coming alongside, and about the wharf, for three years—Johnson was once in the Company's employment for about eighteen months, and knows the place very well.</p>

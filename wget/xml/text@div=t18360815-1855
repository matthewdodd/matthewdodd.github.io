                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Robert Scargill, and keep his house for him at Somers-town-terrace. The prisoner was an occasional servant—she did not sleep in the house—on the 15th of July, the policeman came and desired me to look over the tea-spoons—the prisoner was then in custody—the policeman produced some spoons, a small silver box, and a table-cloth—the spoons and table-cloth were my father's, and the box was my own—my father had given it to me—I recognised a pair of gloves at the station-house.</p>

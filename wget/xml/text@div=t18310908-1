               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You keep a pastry-cook's shop, at the corner of Canon-alley, St. Paul's church-yard? A. Yes - Woodhill has a shopman and porter living on the premises; I have one female and two male servants - they are not here; a person could not get from the cellar to the upper part of the house without unfastening the cellar inner door - that door was not broken; the cellar is part of the house - I had seen the grating fast at five o'clock the evening before, when I was in Canon-alley; the chain was attached to the staple in the usual manner, and if it had not been fast the chain must have given way, as it was attached at one end to the grating, and at the other by a staple to the wall - it is never opened; it had been made for a coal-shoot, but the house having been broken open about two months ago I did away with the padlock, and had it fastened by a staple, not intending to open it again - I went to bed a little before eleven o'clock; my servants usually go to bed before me - Mr. Woodhill's people are generally up after me - after the alarm I found the grating of the cellar separated from the chain, but the grating was down, as it lifts on a swivel; the chain was broken, and down in the cellar - a link of it was broken by violence, and the curb of the grating much pressed, apparently by a crow-bar; Mr. Woodhill keeps the first and second floors, and has a shop frontage round St. Paul's Church-yard - he has no occupation of the cellar: I have a lease of the house distinct from him.</p>

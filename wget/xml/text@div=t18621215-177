               <p>about midnight, I went with Erickson to a coffee-shop in Rotherhithe, and also a friend who was in our company—I did not go inside; I waited at the door, and saw the prisoner Leverentz struggling in the shop with an old lady—I did not take notice of the others—the door was open, and Leverentz pointed with his finger towards me, over the back of the old lady, saying, "That in the man who struck me"—I do not know whether he did it to me or anybody else—he used several expressions in German with reference to me, as to whether I wanted to insult him—a little while afterwards, my friend and I walked outside the door, and stopped talking there five minutes, and then we walked away towards London—when we had walked about twenty yards, we were surrounded by three of the prisoners; Leverentz, Sgereen, and Winter—my hat was knocked off, and I saw what they intended to do, so I turned round and faced them, and as I stood defending myself, Leverentz and Sgereen were in front of me, and Winter on my left-side—I struggled with them two or three minutes—I <hi rend="italic">sang</hi> out for my friend, and as I turned my back to escape, I received five stabs in my back, and one in my chest, and one by my neck—the knife was then put into my mouth, and I was cut from my mouth to my ear, and my finger was nearly cut off—I cannot tell who cut me, because I fell down on my knees, and after that, as I tried to get up, I received the cut on the mouth, and the blood flowed so much that I fell down, and knew no more—I cannot tell whether more than one knife was used—the three were close to me when I received the cut on my mouth—I could see them distinctly—it must have been one of them—they talked in German while they were stabbing me, but I did not understand it—I was in the hospital not quite three weeks, and my wounds are not healed yet.</p>

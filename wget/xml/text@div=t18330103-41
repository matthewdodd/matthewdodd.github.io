             (Police-serjeant 18 D). I was in Great James-street, Lisson-grove, on the 8th of December, about eleven o'clock at night; I saw a donkey-cart coming towards me - Harding was in the cart, beating the donkey, and two others were walking by the side of it, in fustian jackets, one of whom I believe was Lenerman, but I did not see his face; I followed the cart to Lisson-grove, when Harding jumped out of it, and they all three ran off - I took hold of the donkey, and a man named Page came up; I said to him, "What have you got in the cart?" he said a copper - I took it to the station, and found two coppers in it; I went in search, and in about two hours I saw the two prisoners in Bell-street, in company - I said to Lenerman, "You are the man I want for a felony, about a copper;" "Aye, aye," he said - I then turned to Harding, and said, "You are the other man I want;" he said, "Don't handle me, and I will go with you;" I took them into a shop, and handcuffed them - I found on Harding a latch-key and a shilling, and on Lenerman a handle of a door; on the left shoulder of Harding's coat I saw some soot and dirty mortar - I asked him how he came by it, and he said in the public-house where he had been sitting; I found a copper had been stolen from No. 7, Charles-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. FRENCH. Q. When you saw the cart was Lenerman with it? A. He was walking by the side of it; I knew him before, but I did not see his face - I knew him by his dress - I followed them, and did not lose sight of them; they were not driving furiously -I came up with them in about five minutes; it wanted five minutes to eleven o'clock - when they saw me they ran off; there was plenty of light to see them - when I took them before Mr. Rawlings, on Monday morning, he asked if I saw Lenerman's face - I said I did not, but I was positive it was him, at least I verily believed it was him; I did not see him have any thing to do with the copper.</p>

             (Police-constable D 6). On the Friday, I had some suspicion of three men, and about nine o'clock that night, I saw Lenerman and Groom come down William-street - they then parted; I followed Lenerman, and when I got to another street, I saw them together again - on the Saturday, at a quarter-past six o'clock, I saw Harding and Lenerman in the street, they stood five minutes and Groom joined them; I went and visited some of my men, and when I returned I saw Lenerman and Harding in Great James-street - I went away, and left them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know when the coppers were stolen? A. Yes, on Saturday, from No. 5, and No. 7, Charles-street; Mr. Windsor's house is No. 7.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Groom hired the cart? A. Yes; Harding had nothing to do with hiring it, but he was in the cart when Groom and Lenerman brought the coppers out; it was out of No. 31, but I cannot say whose house it was; it is a private house, and I have heard that Lenerman lodged there - I saw nothing brought from Windsor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. FRENCH. Q. Will you swear that Lenerman lodged there? A. No, it is only what I have heard; I had never seen him before, but I can swear to him - I was in bed when Groom called me.</p>

             - we live at No. 7, Charles-street. This is our copper- I had seen it safe at one o'clock on the Saturday, and put a pail of water in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. FRENCH. Q. Was it fixed firmly in the brick work? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How far is your house from No. 31? A. It is quite the other end of the street - I know the copper by a nail in the bottom of it, which I drove in myself, when some person made a hole in it; I have seen it fitted to the brick-work.</p>

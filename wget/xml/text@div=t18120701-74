The prisoner, when he came from the East Indies, he was too proud to come in company of us. He had plenty of money. After his money was gone he was glad to come and be with us. I received my pay at the India House. I bought this watch. After the prisoner had been in the house eight days, I put my watch over my cot, to see the hour. The prisoner got up in the morning before any of us got up. He took the key, and took the handkerchiefs out, and then went out of the Company's house. When I got up I looked for my watch; it was gone, and the key was not there. We searched, and could not find Antony. We looked for Antony in every public-house, and every woman's house. We could not find him. One of my comrades took him in Ratcliffe Highway, and brought him to the Company's house. He there said, he had no watch. He would not tell the truth. Then we took him to Shadwell office, and gave him in charge of the constable. The Justice sent an officer to the lodgings of the prisoner. He had lodged there eight days. They said, he had nothing there belonging to him. I said, to the mistress, the young man gave you a watch. She said, he gave me the watch to pawn. I pawned it for a pound note. I said, that is what we are looking for. I went to the pawnbrokers, and saw it. I said, that is my watch. It was taken from over my cot.</p>

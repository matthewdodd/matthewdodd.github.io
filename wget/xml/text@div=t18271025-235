(I did not see him with any bundle;) he then asked for a bundle; inquiry was made whether he had left one there, and nobody knew any thing of it; he wanted to go into the parlour; I stopped him, and twice put him out of the street door; a gentleman who lives on Ludgate-hill, came in presently; he went into the parlour, and called for a pint of beer; the landlady went in with it, and on coming out, she looked round the parlour, near the door where the prisoner had sat, and saw something lay; she took it up, and put it into my hand; it was a blue handkerchief, twisted up; I took it to the bar, untwisted it, and saw it was money. I went and asked the prisoner what he had lost; he said a blue handkerchief - I asked what was in it; he said he did not like to say; I said, "You ought to tell;" he said he would not tell me. I went and pushed him into the parlour, and said again, "What have you lost?" he said, "I don't like to tell you." I asked what was the value of it; he said there was 3l. in it - I said (in the presence of two or three persons, who had followed me into the parlour), "Is this yours?" he said Yes; I said, "Is what is in it yours?" he said Yes - I then said, "It is counterfeit coin, and I shall detain you;" he then tried to escape, but was detained till the officer came; there were seventy-nine counterfeit shillings in the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHER. Q. Do you carry on business on your own account? A. Yes; I am often at the bell; I was not in the parlour when the prisoner went out; he asked the landlady for his bundle; he was partly drunk, but capable of knowing what he was about, and walking about. I saw the landlady pick the bundle off the seat where he had sat, and feeling something in it, she put it into my hand; the money was so bad, every body could tell immediately that it was counterfeit; I would not have taken it; I should have refused it at first sight.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Were you present at the different times he asked for the bundle? A. Yes; he asked the landlady, the servant, and myself.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live at the Bell. On the night of the 1st of October I came home at a quarter to ten o'clock, and went into the parlour; the prisoner was there, crying; he said he had lost his property; Nicholls was standing at his side, with this handkerchief in his hand - the prisoner said it was a blue handkerchief - I said to Nicholls, "Give the poor fellow his handkerchief;" he said, "It is this coin;" I then said,"I must fetch an officer" - I went to the door - an offices was coming by - I called him in - the prisoner had before that said he would not go without his handkerchief, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250095"></xptr>that it contained about 3l. - he was given in charge - the officer found, I think, 1s. 6d. in good money on him - he said, "I am done."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was crying? A. Yes; he seemed anxious to recover the parcel - he heard me say I must fetch an officer.</p>

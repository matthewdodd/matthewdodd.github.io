               <p>Q. What time of the day was it. - A. About half after six o'clock in the evening. I was by myself in a chaise cart.</p>
               <p>Q. How was you stopped. - A. I was met by four men. One man ran up to the horse's head and cut the reins; then that same man that cut the reins came up to the right hand of me, to the step of the chaise cart; the prisoner at the bar came to the left side of me. One man was at the horse's head, and the other stood at the right hand of the shafts on the ground. The prisoner at the bar then unbuttoned my left hand breeches pocket, and the other my right hand breeches pocket; the right hand man took forty shillings from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say to you. - A. They told me to stop, they must have my money; I do not know which of them it was; they surrounded me so momently, I could not distinguish who told me to stop. The man on the right hand took out of my breeches pocket, forty shillings in silver, besides a dollar, one of the old dollars, with this king's head upon it; he took every thing out of my right waistcoat pocket; a pencil case, and a few halfpence that were in it. I had two great coats over this; they unbuttoned all my coats, then they saw my watch-chain; the prisoner at the bar says what have you got here, I must have it in a moment; he took hold of the chain, snatched it out; it was a silver watch, there was a chain, seal, and key to it; the seal had my initials on it; from this coat pocket the prisoner took a handkerchief, the fellow to this, and a snuff box; then he asked me what I had got there. I had a silk handkerchief round my neck, I wear it when I am about home, he took it off my neck; one of them said we must have your coat, they pulled my great coat off. Then the prisoner says if he has money it is in the seat, they desired him to search the seat; there was a bundle of empty sacks on the left hand of me, the prisoner says d - n them, let us have them out, he pulled them out on the ground; then he said sir, you must come out. I said be easy I will get out; so I jumped out; the man on the right hand opened the lid of the seat and took a hand basket up, wherein there was a pound of sausages, and half a pound of tea; they took all the things contained in the basket; the same right hand man searched about the straw, he found no money, then he said I am satisfied, and away they went.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of these men any arms. - A. The one on the right hand side of the cart he had a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw any more of them. - A. No, when I was down I asked them if they would help me with the sacks up, they said I might put them up myself. I went to the horse's head, I found the bearing reins, and the long reins all four cut in two. I fastened them up and got on as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing again. - A. Yes, there was something found but not immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. You said one man stood on your right hand and the prisoner stood on your left hand; what makes you say it was the prisoner. - A. I could see him while he was robbing of me; I looked under his hat two or three times, he lived with me about eight year and a half ago; he told me he had lived with me at Bow street. I have got a name of Shepherd in my book, I did not know that he had lived with me then.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you take such observations of him as to know the man. - A. I did. I was as recollected as I am now, I never was more recollected.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive clear in your own mind. - A. Yes, I am that he is the man, as I am of my own existence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is not from any circumstance that has happened since, that you believe he is the man. - A. No, when I came down Harlington, I said three of the men I should know again if I saw them, I took such observation of them so as to know three out of the four.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after was it that you saw this man. - A. About a fortnight afterwards I was sent for by Mr. Read, the chief magistrate of Bow street, to see if I knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he was the man. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sure he was the man when you saw him about a fortnight afterwards. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That gentleman said that he did not know that I lived with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Where. - A. At the Vine inn in Hillingdon, near Uxbridge; they came in the Vine and called for a pot of beer, and Hooper and this prisoner went to Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Shepherd is one of them. - A. Yes, and they stopped there about a couple of hours and a half, and the other men stopped there during the day, while they were gone to Uxbridge, except a few minutes that they went to a gentleman's house in Hillingdon; they told me if I saw any one come after them, I was to say they were to come back in about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes to the farthest; Hooper and Shepherd came back, and went out again; I asked them if they wanted them gentlemen that were with them, they said yes; I said they would be back almost directly; they all four came back, and went away about five o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is one of those four. - A. Yes; that is the same man that went to Uxbridge.</p>

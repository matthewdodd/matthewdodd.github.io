                  </hi>. On 13th September, I handed the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he asked me for, to pay for a New Plymouth parcel, which was to be sent through Messrs.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>cash—I entered this 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6d at the same time—to the best of my memory, I left between 3 and 4 o'clock on the 18th, but I paid him this about mid day—I have never asked him to make up my accounts for me; I am always capable of doing it myself—nothing else was paid to the prisoner that day—I gave the prisoner any sum he asked me for, without making inquiries, because I had the best opinion of him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many clerks have Messrs. Shaw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten—if I do not receive the money for parcels, other clerks do, and it goes through my hands; I am the cashier—I know this parcel Was shipped; it was sent to the docks—I cannot say that I have ever seen the prisoner before—if I was out, one of the other clerks would receive the money, and it would be handed to me on my return—the book is not here; it is in use.</p>

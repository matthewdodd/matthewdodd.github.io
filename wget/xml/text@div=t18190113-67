The landlord does not live in the house - there are other lodgers - the shop door opens into the passage. On the 24th of January, about eight o'clock at night, I saw a man break a whole square of glass in the window, put his hand in, and take a watch out at the same instant, all at one blow. I saw his face by the light of a lamp which I had burning, and took particular notice of him. I am sure the prisoner is the man. He took a watch which hung in the window; I immediately seized my pen-knife, and attempted to cut his hand, to prevent his taking it - I do not know whether I cut it or not; I got hold of the chain, as he held the watch - the chain broke, and he got the watch. I have never seen it since. My wife tried to open the door and go out, but somebody held it with a string. The daylight was quite gone.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR STEVENS. I am near eleven years old, and live in Gardiner's-lane, York-street. Last Thursday night, about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner running as hard as he could, in a direction from Jacobs's shop; I did not see him at the shop; Jacobs was running after him - he was about twenty yards from the shop; I am certain it was the prisoner. I saw his face by the light from a woman's stall. He was about two yards from me. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I was going past Mr. Jacob's window, about ten minutes before eight o'clock, and looked if I could see Mrs. Jacobs through the window. I saw the prisoner looking through the window - he appeared to be looking at Mr. Jacobs, who was at work. The lamp in the window threw a great light on his face, and there was another light from the shop opposite - I am certain he is the man. I saw his face distinctly. I did not stop two minutes, and left him there.</p>

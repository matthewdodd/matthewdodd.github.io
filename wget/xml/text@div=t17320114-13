On Sunday the 14th of February last, about 10 in the Morning, as I was going from my House to the Church, in a publick Way, about a Quarter of a Mile from the Church, and a 100 Yards from the Houses, I was stopp'd by the Prisoner, who came out of a Lane Parallel with the Road. He presented a Pistol, and said, If I spoke a Word he would shoot me dead. He took half a Crown from me, and other lose Money, besides a GEOGIUS Half-penny, (an R being wanting in the Name) which were all in a Silk-Purse, and from the little Finger of my Left Hand, he took a Gold Ring with a Cornelian Stone, impress'd with a Mole, which was my Grandmother's Coat of Arms, and then he return'd to the Lane he came out of; I would have gone back into the Road, but with his Pistol he oblig'd me to go to Church. Since which, he was committed by Justice Bobun of Enfield , for an Assault, with Intent to commit a Robbery. I saw him last Sunday in Newgate. The Keeper refus'd to let me see him alone, but call'd all the Prisoners and made them pass by me. I pick'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140024"></xptr> him out from the others. The Keeper said that Man's Name was West; but, says I, let his Newgate Name be what it will, I know him perfectly well, for he was not disguis'd when he robb'd me.</p>

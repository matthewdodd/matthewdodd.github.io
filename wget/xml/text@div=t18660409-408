                  </hi>. I am a commission-agent and merchant, of 38, Basinghall-street—on 18th January, the prisoner came, and said, "I have sold twenty-four pounds of cigars, the same as I had a sample of; will you let me take them with me?"—I said, "No, not unless you pay for them at the time you take them away"—my father was present—the conversation was with him, but we both said that—the prisoner then asked to have a 6-lb. box to take with him—we said, "No, we will not trust you on any account whatever"—he then asked to have them sent down to his house at Deptford, which we agreed to do, on condition that he paid the money for them, or returned the goods by the boy—he left, and twenty-four pounds of cigars were sent by the boy about 5 o'clock to the prisoner's house, Douglas-street, Deptford—the boy came to the office at 9 the next morning without the cigars or the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you in business for yourself at this time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I cannot remember whether my name was up at that time—my father's name was up—he has been in business some time—he has had several transactions with him, I believe—I know a gentleman named Miller—he did not come to our office from the prisoner the next day—I have never seen him with regard to the prisoner; not as to this transaction; only at Greenwich Court, when he came to hear the case—the prisoner has once taken cigars from our place, and gone round with our boy from public-house to public-house to sell them, but I refused to let him do it again—I did not refer Mr. Miller to Mr. Davis, the solicitor for the prosecution.</p>

                  </hi>. I have retired from business, and live at 43, Marlborough-road, Dalston—in November or December, I transferred my business to my son, but remained there to assist him—I was at the office on 18th January with him—when the prisoner came and said that he had sold</p>

               <p>twenty-four boxes of cigars, the same as he had had before, and wished to take a portion of them with him, I distinctly said we could not part with the goods without the money, and that we never did so without cash—he asked if we doubted him—I told him I did doubt him—he then requested to have six pounds only to take with him—I said, "No, I will not do anything of the kind"—I said, I would send them according to his request; but it must be perfectly understood between us that the goods must come back, or the money—he agreed that the goods should come down—we did so—we had had two previous transactions with him, but never parted with the goods without the money—these cigars were given to Gregory, with instructions not to part with them without the money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever said before to-day that you made answer, "I do doubt you?"<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never was asked the question before—he did not pay for the cigars on this occasion—when he took them from the shop, they told me that the prisoner took them from public-house to public-house selling cigars—I sent the boy home with him two or three times—on one occasion, when he did not pay for the cigars across the counter, he came and said he could sell a lot of cigars, and would we let the boy go with him to Deptford—having my doubts, I would not allow the boy to go, but I went myself—I sent the boy the next time, because I was engaged, but gave him strict instructions not to part with the goods without the money—I have known the prisoner some years—I know Miller; he keeps some refreshment-rooms—I have not dined with him there—I went there to serve a writ on him—the next time I saw the prisoner after 28th January was when I was dining at the Gresham tavern, and, to my great astonishment, he came in and sat right before me—there was a warrant out against him at that time—it was not in my pocket—I cannot say when I applied for the warrant—it was not the day after the robbery—my son went down to Deptford on that day, and I believe he saw the prisoner—I had nothing to do with the warrant—my son took it in hand—I do not know what day it was applied for—I did not have a cigar with the prisoner when he sat down with me at the Gresham dining-rooms, but I went into a cigar-shop next door to get out of his way, as I did not want to be seen with him—he followed me—I certainly lit a cigar—I could not go into the shop without—I stopped there a long time, and begged him to go away, as I did not want to be seen with him in the streets, knowing there was a warrant out against him—Mr. Miller came to me and had some conversation with me about this matter—I do not know whether it was the next day; he came many times—I did not refer the prisoner to my solicitor, but I would not have anything to do with it without my solicitor—I have been importuned by the prisoner's wife and brothers and a great many people to settle the matter.</p>

I was in Mr. Layland's service in January—I received twenty-four pounds of cigars from him on 18th January—he told me to take them to the prisoner's, at Deptford, and not to leave them without the money—I had seen the prisoner at the shop—I took him four boxes of 6lbs. each—I did not go down with him—I got to Deptford about half-past</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140059"></xptr>Q. Did the mail from Stamford, on the 21st of July, arrive in due course on the morning of the 22d? - It did, I opened the Stamford bag.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of the morning did it arrive? - Between the hours of six and nine, the usual time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear regularly sealed as it came from Stamford? - It was as it usually comes</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that letter, and see if it appears to have the post mark of the arrival on the 22d? - Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Looking at that with that mark, which is a Post office mark of the 22d of July, have you any doubt that it was transmitted from Stamford by the post which set off from Stamford on the 21st? - I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That is a mark on that letter of a stamper belonging to the Post office; Farmer, who was tried here last session, was a stamper in the Post office, was not he? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. He was tried for a capital offence, and convicted last session? - I believe he was, I was not concerned in that.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you mean to say is, that it has the appearance of a letter that comes from Stamford, with that mark on it? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have come into the possession of a stamper to be stamped? - Certainly so.</p>
               <p>Court. Does the stamper receive it before or after the forter? - Before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. By that stamp you have no doubt it was transmitted regularly to London? - I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Who stamps it I don't care any thing about.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You are deputy inspector of the letter carriers in the Post office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 22d of July last was the prisoner employed there as a sorter of letters? - He was employed as a letter carrier and resorter of letters; he resorted them after they came to the letter carrier's office, in the division he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. When the mails are opened, what is the first thing done with the letters? - They are carried to be faced and then stamped.</p>
               <p>Q. The letters brought by the mails are stamped with the day of the month? - They are.</p>
               <p>Q. And then they are distributed into twelve divisions and sorted? - Yes, in the letter carriers office.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140060"></xptr>Q. In which division did the prisoner at the bar act as a sorter on the 22d of July? - In the eighth.</p>
               <p>Q. He was likewise a letter carrier on that day? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q.Was Mansion House-street, within the district of which he was a carrier on that day? - No, it is not, nor in the division.</p>
               <p>Q. In the regular course and without the intervention of some mistake a letter to Mansion House-street would not have gone to the eighth division? - No, it would not.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a previous sorting before they come to the twelve different divisions? - There are, into the twelve divisions in the inland office.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right, the division No. 1, is intended to take in a certain number of districts in this street and this street? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. And No. 2, a certain number of other streets, and after that they are delivered to the letter carriers to sort for the conveniency of their delivery? - Yes, and therefore I call it resorting.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it sometimes happen that the first sorting in the inland office is not correct, so that a letter that belongs to division 12 finds it way to division 8, and so on? - It happens every day repeatedly so.</p>
               <p>Q. In that case is it the duty of the letter carrier who finds one that does not belong to him to throw it to the division to which it does belong? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after they have gone through the resorting, each of the letter carriers takes his letters of his own division to deliver them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you look at this letter? does this letter appear to be brought to London on the 22d of July? - It has the post mark of that day and should have been delivered that day, I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a new stamp for every day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that a stamp that is used for a letter that comes to day cannot be used for a letter that comes to-morrow? - It cannot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner at the bar was a person in the office known by the name of a letter carrier? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a description known by the title of sorters? - Sub-sorters we call them; they are employed in the inland office, for the letter carriers office.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there it is that all the letters are sorted as you call it? - Yes, and they are resorted again by the carriers in each division among themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner is not at all employed in the inland office? - I rather apprehend the prisoner at the bar could not be employed in the inland office, because he was taking charge of his own division that day.</p>
               <p>Q. On that day, the 22d of July, was not the prisoner employed as a charger of letters? - He was employed as charge-taker in the division where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the business of the charge-taker? - To take the amount of the letters to each of his partners.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was busy in resettling the different charges with his partners, and not in resorting letters? - If there was a letter that did not belong to him, either he or his partners should throw it over to where it did belong.</p>
               <p>Q. The charge-taker is so far occupied with taking the charges that he has no time to sort them at all? - If there are any missorted he has to give them round to where they do belong. It is very seldom they have time to resort themselves, only those that come wrong to throw round where they ought to be.</p>
               <p>Q. In general, the charge-taker is more occupied in settling the charge than to find time in sorting the letters themselves. How many charge-takers are there? - One in each division.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140061"></xptr>Q. If the letters are sorted correctly it could not be in that division? - It could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they get to the sorting there is an operation which they call stamping? - There is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Farmer? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. He was tried here last session for secreting letters? - I understand so, I was not on his trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he a person employed in stamping letters? - I cannot take on myself to say whether he was employed on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a stamper of letters? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. The letters first of all come to the hands of the stampers, and may, if they are dishonestly disposed, be conveyed away by them? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The person who is employed as charge-taker is not likely to be much employed in sorting letters for the particular division, but if any letters are sent from the inland office into his division through mistake, it would come through his hands? - Most likely.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a sorter in the inland office had sent a letter into the eighth division, directed to Mansion house-street, would it have been likely to have fallen into his hands as charge-taker? - It would so.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a thing that happens every day you say? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. If there is an enquiry about a letter that is not delivered, who is questioned about it? - We make a general enquiry. When a letter is missing we are in the habit to make a public enquiry among all the letter carriers when they are there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner, in point of fact, a person employed in sorting letters and packets in the General

             office? - So far as this, if any were misplaced he had to throw them to the proper box where they ought to be.</p>

               <p>Court. On July the 22d, was the prisoner so employed as a sorter of letters? - In resorting those that were missorted to him.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right, this man was employed in the eighth division? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business in the eighth division? - As charging the letters, making up the charge with his partner in that division, and resorting any letters that were wrong in that division.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then supposing it to have happened in the course of that day that twenty letters were missorted to the eighth division, was it his duty to have sorted them right? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. And in point of fact, hardly a day passes without such missorting? - Hardly a day passes without.</p>
               <p>Court. In the first place, there is the business of a sorter in the office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This man was not engaged on that day as a sorter of letters? - He was not employed that day in that, to that eighth division that man was what we call a charge-taker.</p>
               <p>Q. It is his business to sort the letters? - No, it is not, by reason he is occupied in making his charges.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you have other men that sort the letters while he is making up the charges? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any different description of people in your office, the letter carriers and sorters, or do the letter carriers sort? - They resort among themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when they come to the resorter of letters, how many are appointed charge-takers? - One man in each division.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right, the man that is charge-taker of that day, is employed in taking the charges, and other peo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140062"></xptr>ple are employed in sorting the letters, but if it happens that in any other division any letter is missorted, does it come to his hands or to the sorters? - It comes to his hands by the sorters in the division to which it belongs.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that a letter that belongs to another division, and comes to the right division, goes through the hands of the charge-taker? - It most likely comes to the sorters first. If the letter happens not to be in its place and missorted, and happens to be in the division where it ought not, that sorter would give it to the charge-taker to take it to its proper place.</p>
               <p>Q.What does the charge-taker do with them? - He has an alphabet of all the other divisions in the office, and he sends it down to the proper division.</p>
               <p>Q. But what does he do with it? - He carries it to the proper division.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there are alphabets, and the letters that are missorted are put under those alphabets; are those that are missorted applied to the general mass of letters, or separated and kept by themselves? - They are thrown into the proper boxes where they belong to.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are these letters carried by the charge-taker? - They are thrown into the boxes, and the people who are there take them to where they belong. There are boxes numbered with all the other eleven divisions, over the charge-taker's seat, where they throw the missorted letters, and the charge taker or some of his partners take them round.</p>

               <p>On the 29th of October I was fetched from the Bank by the comotroller of the Post office, to take Pepperdy in custody, and after we brought him before the comptroller, I thought it right to search Pepperdy and Farmer. Pepperdy gave up the keys to Ferguson and me; Ferguson and myself went to his lodgings, No. 5, Leonard-street, Holywell street, and we opened the bureau where there was a large quantity of letters together, with some bills of exchange, which I put my hand upon first, six, I believe, and brought them away. (The bill of exchange shewn him.) This is one, and there were many more letters, a great number indeed. I did not find any in letters, I put my hand on these six, and I said to Mr. Ferguson, here appears to be a good group. (Five others shewn him.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the other five? - Yes, they are all marked with the initials of my name, and the day of the month; I marked them at the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You did not mark them the moment you took them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you mark them before you parted with them? - As a matter of course.</p>

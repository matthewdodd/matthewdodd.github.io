             was with me, I felt a sudden jirk at my pocket, and found my handkerchief was taken out; turning about I observed the prisoner at my right-hand, I secured him, and said he had picked my pocket; he past my handkerchief from his right-hand to his left, and dropt it behind a post; I had hold of him with my right-hand, and took it up with my left; then he struck me in my mouth, and knocked me down on my knees; I still kept hold of him; he dragged me into the middle of the road; I tripp'd up his heels, and got upon him; he got from me, and got up; I went then to look for my hat and cloth, and they were gone, I believe his accomplice carried them off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner have your hat or cloth in his hand?</p>
               <p>Dod. No, I did not; I seized him a second time, he was not far from me; Mrs. Brooks had hold of him, so he could not get away; I threw him down upon the stones, he cried murder, the watch came and secured him, and we took him to St. Martin's Round-house.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Brooks confirmed the evidence he had given.</p>

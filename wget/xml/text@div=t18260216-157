               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ROBERTS. Q. Was the girl who got over the wall taken? A. I do not know; a man was standing at the end of the court, not far from her, but no other woman - she had a light gown on; the goods were taken in a moment - I had seen her face for some distance before I came to her - she was marked with the small pox; I swear she is the person.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with the prosecutor to No. 39, Payne's-buildings; I knocked at the door - I thought they were keeping me a long time, and I looked through the key-hole; I saw some persons assisting a female over the wall to another person's premises - I then knocked again, and the person who had helped the woman over, ran up stairs, and asked who was there; I got in, but could not find the property; I sent for the prosecutor on the Thursday, and took him to the house - where we found the prisoner, two other women, and two men; I asked him which it was, and he pointed out the prisoner immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw him in my life, and the officer said, by the description the man gave him, he thought it was the other girl - and he asked me what the other girl got over the wall for.</p>

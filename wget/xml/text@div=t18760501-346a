                  </hi>. I live at 99, Manor Street, Bromley—I am a labourer—on the 18th April about 12 o'clock at night I was in the Whitechapel Road—it was near the East London Railway Station—somebody there knocked me down and took my watch away—I believe there were three or four people there, I cannot say whether men or women, I believe one woman—it was in the gaslight—they dragged me along the pavement—I was not drunk—I know the prisoners—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the prisoners in the evening at a public-house—I stood two pots of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale with them—I stayed there after that and had a glass of stout and mild; the prisoners left first—the blow that I received stunned me and my eye was swollen as big as half an egg.</p>

I remember you leaving the public-house—I do not remember parting—I believe I did not say "Come on, old girl, let us go across the road and have a quartern of gin"—I did not ask you to pawn my watch for me—I did not find your pocket handkerchief in my pocket the next morning.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer K</hi>). On the 21st April I went to 68, North Street, where the prisoners reside—I saw the male prisoner and asked him if his name was Horsnail and he said it was—I said "You pledged a watch at Mr. Childers, at High Street, Stepney," He said "Yes, it is my watch, I have had it some time"—I told him to be careful, and the female prisoner then said "An old man gave me the watch last night to go home with me, I gave it to my husband and he pledged it"—I took the male prisoner into custody and told the female to come to the station—she followed behind—they were charged and the male prisoner said "All I know about it is I pawned the watch"—the female prisoner said to the prosecutor "Let it stop until to-morrow and I will get it out then."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The female Prisoner's Statement was read as follows:</hi> "The prosecutor gave it to me to pledge, and I said it was too late, and we went from Commercial Road to Whitechapel Road and could not pledge it; he said we could pledge it in the morning. The prosecutor got so drunk be fell against the wall and hurt his face and I gave him my pocket handkerchief; if I have any guilt let it stand feasible and I will stand by it."</p>

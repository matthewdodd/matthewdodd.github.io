On the night of the 18th of November, a little after twelve, I went about Mr. How's grounds, to see if there were any poachers. I found a net at a gate on the Wednesday night before; I saw Wicks on the Saturday night, the night in question; I saw Wicks on the 18th in Mr. How's park; Lee was in company with me; I had left him at a certain place while I went to the gate; I had a dog with me. I saw Wicks get up out of a bush, and go towards the gate; it was a bright moon light night. I did not know Wicks then; I saw a man get over the gate; I ran up to the gate and holloed to him to stop. I called to my dog, hold him; my dog was a little way behind; he did not come up instantly. I ran after Wicks holloing to him to stop, or I would shoot him; he was running; he turned round instantly and fired at me; I instantly fired at him. We were about the distance of thirty yards; he stopped till I came up to him; then, and turned round the butt end of the gun to me. I asked him who he was; he would not speak. I told him I had another charge, having a double barrelled gun; my dog came up and seized him by the smock frock. I turned the butt end of my gun at him, to avoid discharging it at him; we fought some time with the guns; the dog kept hold of him all the time; and when he spoke, he said, pray do not take my life away. I never stuck him afterwards; I took the gun out of his hands and put it in the hedge; the dog still holding him, I collared him and got the dog off. Lee came up, I told him to take hold of the man; the prisoner said to Lee, you are a d - nd tight fellow, ant you.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Wicks turn round for the purpose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060006"></xptr>of firing, were you near enough to see which way he pointed the gun - A. I did not know he had a gun at the time I saw him turn round and front me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether Wicks knowed your voice - A. He knew me before, he had seen me often enough; he knew I was game keeper to Mr. How. I was in my shooting dress that night. This is the gun that Wicks had, it is cracked in the stock just by the lock; I thought it was broken by my fighting;. Wicks said it would kill at seventy yards it is longer in the barrel than most guns. I got the prisoner into Mr. How's out-house and searched him; I found powder and number one shot on him, and a knife.</p>
               <p>Court. Young man you told us you did not know he had a gun in his hand, of course you could not see till he fired, were you sensible of any motion of any wind at the time the gun went off. - A. No; I thought I heard a shot in the hedge at the time when the gun went off, I could not take my oath of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the dog up to you when the prisoner let his gun off. - A. No; the dog was between the gate and me, he had not passed me.</p>

Yes; about twelve we proceeded along the edge; I heard the report of two guns, I immediately went towards the place from whence the report came; I saw Johnston and the prisoner, they were about five or six yards apart when I went up to the prisoner, Johnston told me to lay hold of him, I laid hold of his collar; he said, you are a d - nd tight fellow, Johnston had Wicks's gun in his hand, the dog was standing by Wicks, holding Wicks's knee of his breeches.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in July last. - A. I saw him in July, the time of our hay harvest, we was having a merry making, and Johnston was among them, Wicks and Johnston were talking about shooting, Wicks was boasting of shooting with Johnston for a guinea. I said to Wicks, mind what you are about or else Johnston will catch you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Johnston hear this. - A. No; Johnston was a little way behind, I was thinking that if Wicks went out a poaching, Johnston would catch him, he said, if I was in an hedge and I thought he saw me, I would be d - nd if I would not blow his brains out. I said to Johnston, when he and I went round the ground, mind what you are after, Wicks says he will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When he first saw me at the gate they were both together. I did not know who they were, I tried to make my escape, to run away if I could, he holloed, hoy, stop, if you do not stop I will shoot you, I went to turn round to stop, my gun went off, I could not help it, I had been trying to shoot a rabbit; he set the dog on me, I held my gun up that he might not beat my brains out; the dog pulled me down. I got up, and the dog got me down again: he beat me so, I have no use of my arms, and one of my fingers is beaten all to pieces.</p>

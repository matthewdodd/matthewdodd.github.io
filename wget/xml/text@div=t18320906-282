            . I live with Mr. Wilson. I was passing at the time; I saw the prosecutrix go to the prisoner's basket about half-past nine o'clock: she asked how he sold his cherries - he said a half-penny a bunch; she took one bunch, and when she opened her hand, the prisoner snatched the half-crown out of her hand, put it into his trousers pocket and went to the public-house; she followed him, and said, "If you please, that is my money" - the prisoner said if she did not go away he would knock her down.</p>

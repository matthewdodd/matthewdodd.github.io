I was in the country; I returned, in consequence of a letter from my wife - I found my house stripped, the children laying on a mattress, and all the furniture gone; it was represented by my wife that it was by a distress warrant; she gave me this paper - I went to the landlord, and have no reason to believe there was any authority for what was done; the prisoner called on the Tuesday morning following, and appointed to meet me at the landlord's house at eleven o'clock, previous to the goods being condemned - he failed in his appointment; there was no address on the inventory which he had left, and the landlord could not tell me where to go to him; I found him on the following morning at the sale-room - I had made an arrangement with the landlord on the Wednesday morning, and procured from him a written order for the delivery of my goods; I tendered it to the prisoner who refused, to give them up and said he should sell them - I attended the sale, and took an account of what each lot sold for - they fetched 5l. 6s.; the goods I charge him with taking, were not included in the inventory he left, but some of them I believe were sold; my rent was 2l. 8s, and was two or three days over due.</p>
               <p>DAVID EDWARDS. I am landlord of the premises. Parker owed me 2l. 8s., for rent, which ought to have been paid on the 1st of April; I authorized the prisoner to put a distress into the premises on the 5th of April, and signed his warrant, which is here.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PARKER. I know the articles I charge the prisoner with taking were in his possession; I saw them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170117"></xptr>at the sale-room; they were lotted - some of them were sold but others were not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q.Were you residing in the house? A.I was in the country; I saw the goods at Mr. Bird's sale-room, in Whitechapel-road; when I presented the order to the prisoner, he refused to deliver them, and said they had been condemned the day before, for 2l. 7s. 6d.; there were all my goods there except a watercock and another article; he offered me the goods back for the 2l. 7s. 6d. on the Wednesday morning - I said Mr. Edwards had agreed with me to compromise the matter and showed him Mr. Edwards' order, but what he offered me were the goods in the inventory only.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did he say to that? A. He said he did not know what I meant by three half-blankets; he said there was an old flannel-gown - I then mentioned the chaise-cushion - he said he had done perfectly right, and it was of no use my bouncing him; he turned his back to me; I mentioned the whole of the articles which are in the indictment, and he gave me no further information -I then asked him for a copy of the condemned inventory; he pulled out a book, from which he ran over some items so quick I could not detect the articles I was in want of; I said I should expect an account of them; he said he should not give it me then, but would in proper time - he passed me in the street two or three days afterwards, and sent a man across the street with an account to me, but the articles I was in want of are not in it; it does not agree with the inventory, as it gives no enumeration of the goods at all - I do not think I could re-place all my property for less than 10l.; it sold for 5l. 6s., among brokers at the sale-room - I took down what the lots sold for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take it down? A. Yes, on this catalogue; I bought one or two lots, as we were in immediate want of them - the prisoner offered me the goods in the inventory if I would bring him 2l. 7s. 6d.; but the others he said he knew nothing about - I afterwards went to the office, and the Magistrate granted me a summons on a charge of taking away goods and not giving me an account, and likewise of not paying me over the surplus.</p>
               <p>LYDIA ELIZABETH PARKER. I am the prosecutor's wife. The prisoner took away besides what are put down in the inventory, two quilts, a blanket, three half-blankets, a flannel dressing-gown, a chaise-cushion, a brass water-cock, and about three yards of carpet.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PARKER. I saw the chaise-cushion at the saleroom; it was not sold; I saw it there a week afterwards - the goods were openly displayed in the auction-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Who sold the goods? A.Mr. Bird; I did not see any money given to the prisoner; I did not apply to the auctioneer for the goods; I saw them at the time of the sale - but they were not in the sale-room this morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. As there is no address on the inventory he left at your house, how did you know where to look for your goods? A. He has written on the bottom of it that the goods were impounded at Mr. Bird's - I had known the prisoner by sight before; this inventory does not mention the things stated in the indictment, but I believe they were all at the sale-room - I am not aware that any were omitted though they were not all sold: I believe it is regular for the auctioneer to receive the money, and hand it to the broker, who pays the landlord.</p>

               <p>DAVID EDWARDS re-examined. Q. What sum of money did you receive of the prisoner? A.This is the account he gave me (read) - "Goods condemned, 2l. 7s. 6d.; expences, 17s. 8d. - balance, 1l. 9s. 10d.;" this was before the sale - he gave me to understand that Mr. Wilmot took the goods at the condemned price; he did not render me an accountv of the proceeds of the sale; I was not at the sale - the prosecutor had the offer of the goods at the condemned price; I did not know that any goods were taken which were not in the inventory - I offered that if he brought me a sovereign and left me a few things, he might have the remainder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the inventory? A. Yes, and it was with reference to that that I offered him to restore his goods.</p>
               <p>MR. DONNE to JOSEPH PARKER. Q. Was Mr. Wilmot present when you were offered the goods back? A. I believe he was, but he was not close - the rooms are large; Mr. Wilmot denied that he had purchased the goods, but not in the prisoner's presence - the prisoner had admitted to me that he did not buy them, and at the sale he offered me part of the things back for what money I had in my pocket, at a price he chose to put upon them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then he assumed to sell to you? A. Yes, my Lord, and he said that he had sold some of them, but I was at the sale to prove he had not sold them.</p>
               <p>MRS. PARKER re-examined. Q. How long before the prisoner came and made this inventory had you seen your things all safe? A. On the same day - I am sure I saw all the things named in the indictment; I told the prisoner my husband was out of town, and begged him to wait - he came in on the Thursday morning, and took the goods about tea time on Saturday; I went to the landlord - he said he could have nothing to do with it; it was in his broker's hand - I could not look at the inventory when he left, as my children were screaming - he left nothing but a mattress and a blanket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There might be an article or two which were omitted to be put down, but every article was placed at Mr. Bird's - I never went near them, nor touched them, till I went with Mr. Wilmot, and he condemned them- if you look at the inventory the prosecutor produces, you will see every article inserted - the cushion he speaks of, is regularly lotted as sundries, and sold with some other articles; I never received a single farthing, but the 2l. 7s. 6d. of Mr. Wilmot, from which I deducted the expences - I was taken to Lambeth-street, and the Magistrate dismissed the case; I then heard that there was a bill found against me, and I gave myself up.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DUFFIELD. I am a broker's porter, and live in North-street, Whitechapel-road. I was employed by the prisoner to remove the goods from Mr. Parker's, about the 6th or 7th of April - I took them in a cart to Mr. Bird's sale-room; Anderson and I took the articles, which the prisoner told us to take - I did not see the prisoner take any thing himself; I had been in possession of the goods.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you or the other man move any thing, but what the prisoner told you? A. No; we left behind a mattress, a blanket, and several small articles of sundries<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170118"></xptr>- I received a chaise-cushion from Anderson, and gave it to a man named Pole, who was loading the cart.</p>

            . I assisted Duffield in removing the goods from Parker's premises - there might be some persons about, but not many.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you remember giving a chaise-cushion to Duffield? A. I do not recollect seeing it - I delivered nothing but what the prisoner told me.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BOONE. I am warehouseman at Bird's auction-room. I received the goods from these witnesses - I kept them till the day of condemnation; I was present when they were condemned by Mr. Wilmot, a broker - I saw an inventory in their hands; there were several people present, but I cannot say who - it took place in the second room; I looked out the lots, and Mr. Wilmot went round and put his price upon them; they then said they would go and look for Mr. Parker - I think this was on a Monday or Tuesday early in April; I saw Parker at the room the next day, with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Upon your oath, on whose account were the goods sold? A. That I cannot tell - I attended the sale, but did not look at the book; I do not know who had the money - I swear I never heard from the prisoner; there was a constable, but he did not come into the room - Mr. Wilmot's goods have been sold, and I believe he is gone to America.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no other appraiser but Mr. Wilmot - we went to some constable in Mile-end; I do not know his name.</p>

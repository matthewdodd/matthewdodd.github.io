               <p>I am servant to the widow lady Mrs. Gray; I had orders the Thursday before Good Friday, to go along with the prisoner at the bar, I took a mat with me and a large hair broom, that was all I took, the prisoner took the rest, the basket and the whitening brush; I took fifteen shillings with me which my mistress gave me; I went with her till she came to Mr. Smith's in Smithfield an oil shop, she said, she wanted something there that was wanting in the house, and if I would let her have the money I should save her the trouble of coming out again, and she would take the things she wanted in with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she live at that oil shop? - No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290168"></xptr>Q. Did you give her the money? - I did, and she went in and came out again, and I went with her to Charter-house-square under the arch way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she lay out any of this money in the oil shop? - Yes, she did, I think it was two pence half-penny, and then she said in Charter-house-square that she had forgot to get a lump of fresh butter, and she said she would go back and get it if I would stop there, and she would not be above five minutes gone; I stopped there above an hour till my mistress fetched me home with the goods, and I did not see no more of her till yesterday week; this happened about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her when you see her last Monday week? - I did not, she was serving a lad in the same manner, and I asked him if the woman had his money from him? he said, yes; I was in Charter-house-square, I watched her then where she went to, she went into the corner of barbican a public house, and when she came out from there, the people of the oil shop to whom the boy belonged came to her and had the money back again; and then she went to an old iron shop and from there to several other places, I pursued her about an hour and a half before I could get any body to get a constable; I took her at last in Cloth Fair, and the constable took her into the public house, the sign of the Punch Bowl in Long lane, where she had served them in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of the fifteen shillings marked at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the money taken on her? - Yes, the constable has got what was found on her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you part with the other things? - My mistress has got them again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know whether ever she saw me before she saw me at Guildhall? - After she had first got the money from me I saw her at Charter-house-square, and then afterwards at Guildhall.</p>

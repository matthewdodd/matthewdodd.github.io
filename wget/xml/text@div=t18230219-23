I had some money and other things in my care belonging to my fellow servant, Robert Beeson, who was in the hospital. There were four 10 l. notes and a 5 l., and twenty four sovereigns, a gold seal, and a thimble of my own - I kept it in a box, which was not locked, in an upper bed room - I did not sleep in that room as it was not finished. The prisoner was backwards and forwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190014"></xptr>fetching water for the men. I saw him in the morning of the 28th of January, between eleven and twelve o'clock, near some of the other bed room doors - I saw my box safe about half-past ten o'clock that morning; I opened it and every thing was safe. Some of the sovereigns were in one part of the box, and some in another, loose in a little box. I missed the property about half-past six o'clock in the evening - there had been but one workmen employed in that room, and he was a carpenter - he only put a lock on the door; that was before one o'clock. I think the door was not locked at all. I missed all the property together. I went to the box for the thimble, and missed all this property. I went and told my master of it - he had not slept there at all. I and the housemaid first slept there on Monday the 27th. We expected our master would come to sleep there in a day or two - there was but one bed in the house, and that was on the first floor. The prisoner was apprehended next morning, and my thimble produced. I got back nine sovereigns, eight shillings, and a gold seal a few days afterwards.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 28th, about eight o'clock at night, I was informed of this robbery. I went to the house at nine o'clock next morning, and examined a side drawer in the box, and there found four 10 l. notes, a 5 l., and six sovereigns. The prisoner's father was at work there at the time - the father said he lodged in Queen-street, Seven-dials. I went there, and found a box locked; I asked the father if he had the key, his wife said the prisoner had it - the father forced it open, and I found in it a brace of pistols and a bullet mould. At that moment the prisoner came into the room - I asked how he came by them; he said he found them. I searched him, and found a silver watch in his pocket; he said he found that also. I asked what he had done with the remainder of the money, and said I could hold out no hopes to him - he said,</p>
               <p>"If you won't hurt me, I will take you round the corner and tell you where the money is;" I told him not to say anything - he seemed alarmed; he went round into Great St. Andrew-street, and into a Jew's clothes shop, and said to the Jew,</p>
               <p>"Give me the money I gave you last night" - the Jew said he gave him no money, but paid him 12 s. for a jacket - the prisoner said he had left between seven and eight sovereigns with him; the Jew denied it. I then asked the prisoner what he had done with the rest, he said he had bought a brace of pistols, and gave three sovereigns to another boy, whom he met in the street - I asked what he had done with the seal and thimble; he said he had pawned his coat, and if I would go to a pawnbroker's, which he directed me to, I should find the seal in the jacket, which I did, and have kept it ever since. He directed me to where the watch was bought; I went and returned it, and got back 5 l. 2 s. from the watchmaker, and the money for the pistols from Jones. I got back 9 l. 10 s. in all. I produce the seal and thimble.</p>

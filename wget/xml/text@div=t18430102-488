                  </hi>. I am a coachmaker, and live in Gloucester-place, Portman-square. The prisoner lived with me as coachman—I had a gig which I had not seen for six or seven months prior to the 12th of Dec.—I wanted to sell it, and mentioned to the prisoner that I intended to sell it—he said a party offered 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I said, I should not take any such money, for the axletree alone was worth that—the last time I saw the gig, I should have said it was worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sent a person to fetch it away, and then the prisoner said he had lent it to a friend—I never authorized him to sell it either directly nor indirectly without communicating with me.</p>

               <p>think very rarely—I identified it by a variety of parts—the apron was not me—I said, by putting up the apron I should be able to judge of it better—the lace on the apron I believed to be the same that was on mine—I said, I should know it by the lace of the apron—I am quite satisfied it is not a new apron—it may be a different apron—I will not swear to that—I mean to say, that the last time I saw the gig it was worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the body was in a very good state—it was not in tatters—the cushions were not torn that I know of—I consider they were not—there were three or four small moth boles in the lining of the cushions—one in particular on the back part, two feet from the front on the off-side—I do not consider there were ten moth holes in it, and if it is examined now it will be found that there are not ten—I do not know that it has undergone an entire repair—I believe the same lining is in it that was then in it—I know that it has undergone some slight alteration and repair.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Montague-mews, and am coachman to Mr. Mills, of Bryanstone-square. I met the prisoner about the 7th or Sth of Dec, in Circuit-street, New-road—he said he had a gig for sale, and wished me to call and look at it—I thought no more of it till the 12th of Dec, when Harris called on me and said he knew of a gig for sale—I went with him to the stables, and the gig was pulled out for me to look at—I examined it—the prisoner said he wanted 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I said it was more than I would give—I offered 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he refused it, and said I should have it for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I offered him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and was coming out of the mews—he called me back and said I should have it—I went to the Cleveland Arms, and bought it for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have laid out 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—the lining is the same, but the apron is different.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gentleman's coachman, and live in Great Barlow-street. On the 22nd of Dec. I went to Mr. Warren to ask for the prisoner's clothes—he told me he certainly had authorized the prisoner to sell the gig, but he did not mean to give it him—he said he was very glad to get it out of his warehouse, for fear of the moths getting to his new carriages, and he had sent it to his coach-house.</p>

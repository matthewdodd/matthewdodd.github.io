About 10 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, on 25th April, I saw the prisoner turn out of Cheapside into Lawrence-lane—he was carrying this bale of goods in an awkward manner—I followed him to Basinghall-street, and he put the bale down in a doorway—I went to him, and said, "Where did you get that bale from?" he said, "From Cheapside"—I said, "From what house there?" he said, "From no house; I saw a man in the street with a velvet coat on, he asked me to take it to London-wall, to the Grand Junction booking office, he said he would give me a pot of beer to carry it"—he said he knew the man by sight, but he did not know his name.</p>

               <p>Messrs. Grant, and this was one of them—there is a delivery book, but I did not bring it—the mark on this bale is the same as the mark on the other packages—I saw this safe in St. Martin's-le-Grand when I went into Hanson Smith's for a few minutes—I delivered goods there, and at several other places—I was there between 9 and 10 o'clock—I went into those places to get my book signed—when I got to Messrs. Grant's, I counted the goods, and missed one bale—as far as I know, this is the bale, by the mark, and size, and everything—I cannot say that I saw the prisoner at all.</p>

I was with the prisoner Gibson while the officer was searching Lyon; she went down on her knees, and begged for mercy, and said she would pay for the lace, or any expence, if I would but let her go; she was taken to the Justice, and was committed.

               <p>I belong to Mr. Walker's office; I searched the prisoners; I found this lace in the right-hand pocket-hole of Lyon, half in and half out, when he pulled off her apron, and began unpinning her gown, then I saw it; she opened her cloak, I told her to undo her apron; it has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Did it come there by accident, or was it put there by design? - She had no pocket, it was in the pocket-hole, it was half in and half out; it was when she was stripping herself, I perceived the lace, and she said, Oh, Lord! how came it here, I cannot think how it came here; I searched Gibson, and found nothing upon her; the money for the tape and things was furnished by Gibson.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Lyon. I came into this gentleman's shop to buy a bit of edging for a child's cap, I bought the lace for my own cap; he shewed me some, I said I did not want to go to above four shillings and sixpence; the child sat on the middle of the counter, the child got hold of the lace in the box, and pulled two or three pieces out of the box; I desired him to take care of the lace; I bought some ribbon, and went out of the shop, and they came after me; they kept me an hour and a half in his parlour, while he sent for a constable; the constable came in, and searched me, and this piece of lace hung at the bottom of my petticoat.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did the child meddle with the lace in the box, and pull them about? - The child did not touch a piece of lace.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am sure of that; it touched the box, and I moved the box a little further; I took great care the child should not touch the lace.</p>

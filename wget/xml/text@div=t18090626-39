               <p>Q. When was it you lost this saddle of mutton - A. On the 9th of this month, about three o'clock in the morning. The prisoner came and looked in Mr. Rutter's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Rutter - A. He is a wholesale butcher in <placeName id="t18090626-39-crimeloc230">Newgate-market</placeName>

He walked about a yard from the door; he turned round and went into the shop; he went of the other side of the shop, to where I was, there were three saddles of mutton hung up, he took one of the three, brought it to the window with him; and was coming out of the window the same way he went in, and as he was coming out of the window he hit his head against the rails, where the lambs hung, and dropped the saddle of mutton on the window. When he got out of the shop he made a stagger and walked away round the corner; I called him, he would not come.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he done with the saddle of mutton - A. The mutton laid on the window. I called him again; I said, George, if you go to Hell I will have you: I collared him; he said let us make it up; he offered me a seven shilling piece; I said I would not take it. I knew him before, he had worked for Cornick, in Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when he came in at the window - A. I was watching the shop; I stood behind the shop; he could not see me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if he could not see you how came he to leave the saddle of mutton on the window - A. When he hit himself against the rail, he espied me then.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to watch him - A. I had reason to watch him; he came in so soon in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no quarrel with him - A. No; none at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you not remember that Mr. Wright used to say that you lost things, and that this man was wicked enough to surmise that you had taken them - A. He has said, Sam, I have lost such things out of the shop; I said I know nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took him to the watchhouse did you charge him with stealing a saddle of mutton - A. I gave charge of him for getting into Mr. Rutter's shop; I did not say a word about the saddle of mutton at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take the mutton down - A. I did; I saw him take it off the hook.</p>

On the 31st of August I missed this watch - I might not have seen it for perhaps six months; I thought it was kept in the first floor, but cannot swear that it was in my house while she was in my service. On the 1st of September I was present when she, herself, took it from her box - she said she found it among some rubbish.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was it a watch or a case? A. A watch - it had neither hands nor glass.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150064"></xptr>sent for, and saw the watch found. The prisoner said it was her brother's, and next morning said she found it among the rubbish.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was she not going away from her place? A. Yes. When the watch was found she said, "You had better say that is your's" - Mrs. Mansell said it was not, and I returned it. The prisoner told us where she was going - I found her there. Next morning I was sent for, and Mr. Mansell claimed it.</p>

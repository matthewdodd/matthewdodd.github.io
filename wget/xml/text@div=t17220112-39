She cry'd out, and her Friend (who just parted from her, hearing a Noise) came back, and the Mob began to gather about them, the prisoner said D - the Bitch, she was a going to pick my Snuff Box out of my Pocket; and then drag'd her along the Ground 9 or 10 Yards, without once letting her Hand go till he had got her Rings off, tho' the People were then come to her assistance. Botfield depos'd, that having just parted from the Prosecutor, he heard her cry out, and looking back by the light of the Lamp saw the prisoner kneeling upon her, afterwards rise from her and run away, being about 20 Yards from the Woman; the Lamp dazling his Eyes, he run full against this Evidence who stopt him, and then another Man in a black Wig, came up to this Evidence and struck him. But that notwithstanding he held the prisoner till more came to his Assistance.

             depos'd, that hearing the Woman crying, he went to see what was the matter, and coming toward the Croud saw the prisoner run, Botfield stopt him, and a 3d person endeavour'd to rescue him, but that Botfield brought him back to the Woman, and then, and not before he heard the Woman cry out, He has got my Rings off at last. The prisoner in his defence said, that coming along in hast he out walk'd his Friend, and turning back to look for him, (the Lamp dazling his Eyes) he ran accidentally against the Prosecutor, upon which Botfield came up to him, Collard him, and pickt his Handkerchief out of his Pocket, and as he struggled to get his Handkerchief again, another came up and struck him, upon which a Mob was soon gather'd, and they accused him (the prisoner) with robbing the Prosecutor, and so charg'd a Constable with him. The prisoners Friend deposed, that being behind the prisoner, he saw 2 or 3 Men take hold of him, but did not see him meddle with any Woman, and that coming up to them, one of them pick'd his Hankerchief out of his Pocket. Two others depos'd, that they went next Day to the Prosecutors house, and askt her if she was sure the Prisoner took her Rings, she said, no, he never had them, but 2 Boys found them as they were at play in St. Pauls Church, and brought them to her, that <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172201120007"></xptr> she gave them 6 pence. They then askt her how the Boys knew the Rings were hers, and where to bring them to her, and if her Name and place of abode were wrote in the Rings for Posies, that then the Prosecutor flew in a Passion and said, if the prisoner would but have given her the value of the Rings, she'd never have prosecuted. So many palpable Contradictions appearing in the Evidence given on the behalf of the Prosecutor, and a great Number of Gentlemen appearing to the Reputation of the prisoner, who all gave him an Extraordinary good Character.

             sworn. I am a waterman. On the 12th of June about three o'clock in the morning, I was going home after I had been watching the craft, and coming across the Dock Road that leads to New Gravel lane, I saw this man come from the back of the premises with a white bag on his shoulder, he went about forty yards from Leggett's shop, I told the watchman that I had suspicion that it was linen; the watchman called to Jones, another watchman, the first watchman and me went and overhauled the bag, and we found it was iron, we brought him back to Mr. Leggett's place, the prisoner said he found the door open and he went in; we took him to the watchhouse, the officer had the charge of the prisoner and the iron.</p>

            . On Tuesday the 24th of September, between two and three o'clock, I took a trunk and band box to the <placeName id="t18221023-60-crimeloc329">Spread Eagle inn, Piccadilly</placeName>

I saw the prisoner about there. I saw Fearns put the trunk into the front boot, and the bandbox into the coach; the prisoner was sitting in the coach at the time. I went towards home to meet my wife, and returned with her to the coach; and on the door being opened for her to get in, I saw the string of the bandbox off, and the handkerchief partly untied. I said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"You are the only person in the coach, and was here when the box was put in; I must know who took the string off?" he said, he knew nothing about it. My wife opened the box and missed the caps. He attempted to get out at the other door, but the porter prevented him, and in the scuffle his hat fell off, and I picked it up; it contained four caps and a handkerchief, which were taken out of the band box. My wife claimed them. I asked him for the string of the box, and he pulled it out of his pocket - he was dressed in livery. There was no time to secure him, as the coach would not wait. I went as far as the Elephant and Castle, inn. I saw the prisoner again on the 9th of October, and am certain of him - he was not in livery then.</p>

            . I am a porter at the Spread Eagle. I received the band box, and put it inside the coach, on the front seat - the prisoner was the only person in the coach; I am certain of him. After he was charged with taking the caps, he tried to get out at the other door, but I prevented him. Mr. Fisher agreed to go on in the coach, and he went on to Brighton, to his master, Mr. Barber Beaumont. I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to Brighton to the family I lived with. I was certainly much in liquor, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230049"></xptr>hardly knew what I was about. He says I wanted to make my escape; of course I should not escape after paying 10 s. for the fare, for the value of 4 s., which they say is the value of the caps. I was at Brighton a fortnight - my master came to town, and I understand the prosecutor went and reported this to him - but my master kept me in his service a week after, which I should think he would not have done if I was dishonest.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of light was it? - A.Quite daylight; we took the basket in the waggon to Newgate-market, and there the rabbits were sold, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040018"></xptr>the watchman has had the care of the basket ever since.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: After I had called four o'clock, turning out of Holborn into King's gate-street, Bloomsbury, I heard an alarm; I saw the prisoner come out of Holborn with a basket in his arms, I am sure the prisoner is the man, then he pitched it down; two men stood in Holborn, one of them, with a handkerchief in his hand, called out and said, it was all safe, and then he took up the basket and put it on his shoulder; I sprung my rattle, and followed him; he then pitched the basket by Southampton-street, and he was stopped by another watchman, who is here; I took him to the watch-house, the waggoner went with us.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: A little after four in the morning of Thursday the 31st of May, I heard the rattles spring, and a cry of stop thief; I looked down the street, and saw the prisoner with a basket upon his shoulder, then I saw him throw it down, I kept my eye upon him; there was another man with the prisoner, and they were both running together; I took the prisoner by the collar, and took him to the watch-house; the waggoner said it was his basket, and that there were a dozen and a half of rabbits in it.(Lyons produced the basket, which was deposed to by Power).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. It being holiday-time I had been at Wandsworth-fair, and being rather in liquor I staid later than ordinary; I met a man in Holborn with a hamper upon his shoulder, I heard the cry of stop thief, the man threw down the hamper, and the watchman immediately laid hold of me, and said I was the man; I did not make any resistance.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Bundy.) Are you perfectly sure this is the man that had the basket? - A. I am perfectly sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t17980704-24-verdict110" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I have the certificates of the first and second marriages - this is the certificate of the first marriage. I compared it with the original register, which was produced at our office by the Reverend Mr. Mathias, the rector of Whitechapel; I received this copy from Jane Ireland, and was desired to keep it.</p>

            . I gave these two copies of marriage registers to the witness. I got this first from St. Alphage, London-wall, from the Reverend Mr. Watts, and the second at Shoreditch; I examined them both with the original books.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did anybody go with you? A. Yes, my mother; I saw the book, and heard it read - I saw Mr. Watts sign this, and so did my mother.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you look at the original book at all? A. Yes, and this is a copy of it; I read the book - it appeared to me a true copy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you do when you got to St. Alphage? A. I asked Mr. Watts if there had been such a marriage; he searched the book, and found it. I asked him to let me have the certificate - he said not under a five shilling stamp; I then asked him for a copy of it, and he gave it me, and told my mother to step up, and he witness to his hand-writing; I then went to Lambeth-street, and the book was taken there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you read the book? A. Yes, and saw the minister sign the certificate - it agreed with the book. I was married to the prisoner on the <rs id="t18280529-141-cd781" type="crimeDate">27th of February, 1825</rs>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What were you? A. Housemaid at Mr. Sharp's, where I had lived for two years. I had no property; I never left him - he deserted me; I was obliged to pawn the linen to live upon.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you not, in the first year, dispose of everything but the bedstead, bureau, and two blankets? A. I did not. He gave his mother two room's-full of furniture; he allowed me one pound a week for about nine months, and I had him, his niece, daughter, and mother to keep out of that. I knew his mother before; he had a child by his first wife, and one by me, which is seven months old.</p>

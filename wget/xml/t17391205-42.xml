I desired to see it, and I went to his Shop, and saw it, and knew it to be my Masters. I saw 54 lb. and he told me, he had several Hundreds of it, which he had bought in small Parcels. This Brass is my Master's, and he must give 15 d. a Pound for it, if he was to buy it himself.</p>

I did not pay for the last Parcel, but went to look for the Thief, and thought I should find him out, by going among the Trade, and describing the Patterns. My Son bought the last Parcel, and told Mr. Rawson's Servant of it. <rs id="t17391205-42-verdict196" type="verdictDescription">

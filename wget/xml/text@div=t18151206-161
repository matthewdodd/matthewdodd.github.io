In my hurry to take off my pattens, I took off one of my shoes; I went on, following the man, until he came to Whitecross-street, where he was taken; I lost sight of him. I got the watch afterwards from Mr. Flanders.</p>

            . I am a fishmonger, and live in Fore-street, Cripplegate. All I know is, that whilst I was standing at my shop, a boy was looking into one of the water tubs at my door, and whilst so doing, he repeated the words half past nine o'clock; in consequence of that, I went to the tub of water, and there I saw the watch at the bottom of it; I gave it to Mrs. Davis, who said it was her's.</p>

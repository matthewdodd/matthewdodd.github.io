                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Lovegrove, a publican at Greenwich. On Monday, 4th Sept., I was in the house—the prisoner came through the front door—he wanted to go to the back premises to fetch some<lb></lb>thing—I told him he could not go—he said the beehive belonged to him, and he had an umbrella and stick—they were tied together; here it is—he said if any one hindered him he would take their life—he drew this sword from the stick—he aimed at me; it wounded me but slightly—I had given him no provocation.</p>

When he drew the sword, the stick and umbrella were tied together—he had the umbrella under his arm—he only used the sword—he dropped the rest of the things—I never saw him at the beehives, nor knew that they were his—the policeman we met in the Trafalgar-road—we both had the stick when the policeman came up—I did not let go of the sword till the policeman took him—on the road to the station, and in the house, he said he would take some one's life—I was standing so as to prevent him going into the back premises; to prevent him by force, if necessary, for I was told not to let any one go—I do not think he touched the door—I never touched him—I would not swear that I did not knock his hand off the door, in the struggle—I swear I did not before the scuffle—no one saw what we were doing—I had seen him before—he was sober.</p>

I received the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody from Brown in Trafalgar-road—the prisoner had the sword in his hand—I told him the charge—he said he would kill every body—the prosecutor had not got it in his hand at all; he did not touch it—he had got hold of the prisoner by the right arm; the ostler had got the other arm—the prosecutor was marked on the nose near the forehead—there was a bruise on his forehead.</p>

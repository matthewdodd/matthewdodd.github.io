I am the wife of Thomas Courtnay, who keeps the Three Doves—on 29th March, after the prisoner was served, I cleared the till; there were ten or fourteen coins there and some sixpences, one of which was bad, and I cautioned the barmaid—the prisoner had then gone but he came back in three or four minutes—I did not see her serve him, but I wont to the till and found one 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and two threepenny pieces—I broke the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into three pieces and afterwards gave them to Skill—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on 5th April, about 10 p.m., the prisoner came again, the bar<lb></lb>maid spoke to me, and I served him with threepennyworth of port wine—a woman came with him each time—he gave me a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I broke it in two and said, "This is a bad 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said, "I am very sorry"—I said, "It is too late for sorrow, you were here yesterday?" and called my husband—the</p>

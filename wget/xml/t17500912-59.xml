            . I live in Blackmore-street, in Southwark. The prisoner brought the harness into my house about 5 o'clock in the morning of the 28th, and wanted to sell them. I mistrusted they were stolen. I went out at my back door, and call'd one Williams to aid and assist me. The prisoner damn'd his eyes and limbs, and said, he wou'd do for us. I sent for the coachmaker who lives near me to hear his opinion about it. He happen'd to be the man that made them for Mr. Chapman; so he sent him word, and he came and owned them.</p>

            . I live at the Swan and Crown in Blackmore-street. The prisoner had a little before been at my house with a great coat on his back, and hardly any shoes to his feet ; he ask'd if any body would buy the coat, saying, he was going to Portsmouth, and he could better travel without a coat, than without shoes; that he would buy a pair of shoes with the money. He ask'd 15 s. then he came to 12 s. After questioning him, I agreed with him for 7 s. 6 s. About an hour and a half after, I saw him carried by to go before the justice. Then I took the coat on my arm and followed after. There was the prosecutor, who owned it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lock-keeper of the City Road Basin, in the service of the Regent's Canal Company—on 28th October I was on duty at 10.45 when the prisoner's barge <hi rend="italic">Oose</hi> came down the basin—a lot more barges were waiting to go through the lock—it was too dark for me to see whether the prisoner was in charge, and it was on the low level, but who<lb></lb>ever was on board was trying to force it forward out of its turn—I ordered it back, and it stopped till between 12 and 1 o'clock—I was the only person on duty—when I ordered it back the person I addressed used very bad hnguage to me—the prisoner and a woman then came down the towing path and crossed by the gates; the prisoner then hallooed out to the man at the cabin end of his boat "Won't the b----let you through?"—the answer was "No"—he then said to the woman "Mary, open the gate, and I will pull in"—that was the lock gate—I asked him if he had got any order to pull in—he said "I will pull in for either you or your b----master"—I went up to him with my lantern, and held it up to his face to see who he was, and saw it was the prisoner—he threw the <hi rend="italic">bite</hi> of his rope round me, that is the centre of it, and dropped it just at the calves of my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187512130006"></xptr>
               <p>legs, hit me on the back of ray neck with his fist, and knocked me into the lock, calling me a b----s----; I fell 10 feet before I got to the water, which was 7 feet deep—I went to the bottom, but rose to the surface, and his boat was alongside of me—I caught hold of a cord that hung from the boat, and called for help, when the prisoner said "You old b----if you don't make less noise I will come and shake you off"—he was then on the lock side 10 feet up—Edwards and Bird came to my assistance—they filled the lock, which raised the boat and me together, and brought me up to the level—I was then in a very weak state—I had been there a very long time, and I pulled this finger out of joint by hanging to the rope—I was taken into the office, and kept in bed for a week—I have been very ill ever since, and have not been able to resume my duties yet—I had not touched him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Two boats can go into the lock at one time, but not two barges—the prisoner's was a fly boat, a long, narrow boat—each boat that comes through has to pay my charge, and present a declaration—the prisoner had not given in his declaration, but some one else had for him—I ordered his barge back till between 12 and 1 o'clock, because other barges were in turn before it—I did not put him out of his turn—a great many barges went through that night—at the time I came up and saw his barge in the lock no other barge was there—he was in his proper turn when the gate was opened by the woman—I did not <hi rend="italic">poke</hi> my lantern in his face, I only held it up to look who he was; it was not a large one, not a bull's eye—we were then about half a yard from the edge of the lock, on the stone work—I did not hear a woman on his barge scream out "Help! help!"—I cannot say who got me out, I was assisted before the water was raised—the boat was laden—when I fell into the lock I did not observe what became of the rope which had been at the back of the calves of my legs—the pri<lb></lb>soner as on the lock side when he said "If you don't make less noise I will shake you off," and the barge was still down in the lock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lock-keeper at the Regent's Canal—between 12 and 1 o'clock on the morning of 29th October I was in bed—I live in a cottage by the side of the lock—I heard a noise, put on my clothes, went to the lock as quick as I could, and saw Hibbert in the lock—a man much resembling the prisoner ran over the lock to the centre of the brickwork and got on the boat—Bird and I filled the lock so as to get the man up to the lock side, and I believe the prisoner assisted us—I got the man into the office—I heard the prisoner say "Yes, I did push the old b----in; he struck me first, and I will do it again if ever he attempts to stop me or my boat"—Hibbert said "I will give him in charge"—I then searched all the locks, but could not find him in any of the boats.</p>

I was awoke by a noise, jumped up, opened the window, and heard a woman say "Get hold of him, or he will be drowned"—I went to the lock—and saw two men on the prisoner's boat and Hibbert alongside it, partly in the water—I ordered the lock to be filled up, got the boat to the side of the lock, and Hibbert stepped off—I said to the prisoner "You have made a pretty mess of this," or "You have done a pretty job"—he</p>

I live at Brompton, in Northampton shire—I drive the horses for the barges—I was by the lock when the prisoner's boat was close to a Northampton boat, which went in—there was room in the lock for the prisoner's boat as well, but the door was slammed by the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> along with the Northampton boat—Hibbert then came out, and the order was for the prisoner's boat to shove back and Allen Hall did so—he went back, I dare say 10 yards, and lay alongside the ice wharf—two barges then came up and were let in before the prisoner's barge, and he came with his wife and complained, and he threw me off the tack steering—his wife opened the outside gate and he pulled the boat into the lock, and Hibbert ran up to him and struck at, him with his bull's-eye lautern—I was not 10 yards away—he did not strike him, but the prisoner shoved him back, and his heel caught a stump which they tie barges to, and he fell into the lock—I know what a bull's-eye is—it was a bull's-eye lautern—he catched his heel against the strapping stump, which is a piece of wood in the ground with iron round it to which barges are tied—when Hibbert fell into the lock, Jones put the rope round him, and under the boat cloths, and pull him into the boat—Scott then called out "Shut the gate"—the wife shut the gate, and they called out "Draw up"—he said "I shall not draw up until I know how the man's legs are"—the lock-keeper ran round and drew the paddles up and let the water in, and another <hi rend="italic">chap drawed</hi> it up—Jones did not use no bad lauguage.</p>

On the 5th of June, about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the pantry, and asked him what he was doing there? he made no answer, but jumped out of the window. I went round to the area, and saw him coming up the steps with a basket in his hand - I followed, and saw him throw the basket over into the square. He was stopped, and the handkerchief found in his pocket - the trowsers were found in the basket.</p>

            . On the 5th of June I was sitting on Mr. Broadwood's steps, and saw the prisoner going down the area; he came up again, and said to two men who were waiting for him, that the lady would not give so much for the things. The two men sat on the steps, and held me, to prevent my giving any alarm, and told me not to ring the bell. The prisoner went down, lifted up the sash a little, and then flew back to the area steps; he then went into the pantry, put the trowsers into his basket, which had shavings in it, and put the handkerchief into his pocket. He lifted the window up higher, jumped out, ran up, and threw the basket over the rails of the square. The cook and I followed the prisoner, the others ran down Cadogan-place. The prisoner was stopped, and the cook took the handkerchief out of his pocket. I got the basket over the rails.</p>

I told him I had no money, he put a razor to my throat, and said, he must have my money or my life; I told him I had no money, he might search me if he pleased; he did not search me, then he said, he must have my bundle, then he took my bundle, and he dropped the bundle after he took it away from me, and dropped some of the things out, and in dropping the bundle, and picking some of the things up, he dropped the razor, which he held up to my throat, I am sure it was the prisoner, I saw nobody else nigh at that time, I saw him when the patrols took him, and carried him to the George, at Pancrass.</p>

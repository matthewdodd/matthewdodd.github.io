               <p>Mr. Couse. I have the care of Somerset-house, under the board of works. On the 11th of Oct. Mr. Latimore informed me there was lead stolen from Lady Beauclerc's house: I ordered it to be replaced; there was an attempt again, on the 27th of Nov. then I ordered watchmen to be set, but there was a fire there, which alarmed the whole yard, so nothing was done. About the 3d or 4th of Dec. part of that lead was taken again, and on the 7th, there was more taken from a place belonging to his majesty there.</p>

I was told by one of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130005"></xptr> servants, that they had got some lead in a bag, in my wash-house: I went and pulled it from under the place it was put, and found there was sheet lead; while I was gone into the cellar, they and the lead were gone; I did intend to have stopped it. My wife lost her cardinal, either that morning, or the evening before.</p>
               <p>Sarah Lane. I live with Mr. Powell. Lee and Boswell came and called for some beer, about 2 months ago; I saw some lead, it seemed to be sheet lead, in our wash-house when they were there. I do not know who brought it; it was in a dirty sack, and put into a place where I put my grease. Mistress lost her cloak much about that time, I believe it was that day.</p>

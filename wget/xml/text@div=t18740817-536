I live at 8, William Street, New Road, White<lb></lb>chapel—on Saturday, 4th July, about 9 o'clock in the evening, I went home and asked the landlady for a dress—the prisoner was there in the room at the time—the landlady said she would not give it to me and we quarreled about it, and she struck me in the eye—she shut the door in my face and I pushed it open three times, and her sister took hold of me and dragged me to the parlour door, when the prisoner took a knife out of his pocket and struck me on the head three times with it—I was sober—I could not swear to the knife; I only saw something shining past my eye—I was taken to the hospital and was there ten days—I had had one glass of stout and mild with the prisoner that night—I had had no quarrel with him when he struck me.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—on 4th July, Avey was brought there—he had three lacerated wounds on his scalp, one was a serious wound, and penetrated deeply—there was a little hemorrhage, not much—it could have been caused by such an instrument as this knife—if he could have fallen on three sharp things at the same time, it might have been caused by a fell.</p>

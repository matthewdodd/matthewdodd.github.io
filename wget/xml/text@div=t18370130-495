                  </hi>. I was cook in the service of Mrs. Booth. On the 9th of December I got up from seven o'clock to twenty minutes after—I went down into the kitchen, and opened the kitchen window next to the cup<lb></lb>board—I had seen that cupboard safe the night before, and had the key in my pocket—I found the cupboard broken open, and my bonnet-box, which had been in it, broken open and drawn out, and the things in great disorder—it is a box which locks—I missed out of the cupboard a gown and three collars—the kitchen drawers were pulled out, and the kitchen is great disorder—the window-shutters were fastened, I think, as I had left them overnight—I cannot swear to that, but they were fastened in the morning—the area door door stuck so fast that I could not open it—I was obliged to get out of the kitchen window to force it in—we could not pall it in from the inside—it is the kitchen door, leading to the area—I do not know what made it stick so fast—I went up stairs immediately to call the house-maid, who was in the act of dressing—I called up the footman, who slept in the next room to us at the top of the house—nobody slept down stairs—the footman and I went down stairs first, and went into the dining room—I do not think it was above twenty minutes after seven o'clock when I called him—he got up, and merely put on some of his things—he was not quite dressed when he came down—I found him fast asleep when I went into his room—his door does not lock—his time of rising was ge<lb></lb>nerally later than that—I was generally the first down—on going into the dining-room with him, we could observe a silver cover, which laid on the carpet, shine from the reflection of the gas over the fan-light as the dining<lb></lb>room door was open—we went down into the kitchen—the house maid by that time met us, and we returned to the dining-room with a light—we saw the things were gone out of the dining-room, as we saw the drawers forced open—the cupboard door was open where the plate was kept, and the side-board drawer, where the silver knives and forks were kept, was open—the cupboard is in part of the side-board—the plate is kept in a different cupboard—there is a side-board besides—plate was kept both in the cupboard and side-board, and they were both broken open—the lock of a tea-caddy was broken open which stood alongside the side-board on legs—I had nothing to do with the plate in the dining-room, and cannot say what was missed—I sent the house-maid up for my mistress immedi<lb></lb>ately, while we were in the dining-room—I found the street door on the spring-lock—I believe the footman fastened it the night before—there are two bolts, a chain, and lock and key to it—I never saw either of the pri<lb></lb>sonors till I saw them at Bow-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. On the 9th of December, a little after six o'clock in the evening, I went to No. 18, Vere-street, Clare<lb></lb>market—I went into the front-room first floor and found Ligo there alone—on going in she said, "You have made a mistake, and come into the wrong room"—I said, "Oh no, I have not"—she said, "Yes, you have; there is nothing here"—I had not intimated that there was any thing there—I looked about the room and saw this hamper—it was tied together, and a smaller sized hamper stood by the side of it, which had nothing in it—two bundles were standing on the chair by the side of the hamper, and in them I found property which Mrs. Booth has identified—I found these two black bags by the side of the chair, and in a drawer 1 found a blue bag—I asked Ligo who lived there with her, and what bis name was—she said she did not know—I asked her how he got his living; she said she did not know what his name was, nor what he did for a living; she had been there but a short time, and could give no account of him at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701300021"></xptr>
               <p>all—I cut the hamper open and found four plated dish-heaters, which Mrs. Booth has identified, three plated dishes, and two ice-pails—the insides are not in them—I have seen them since at Mrs. Booth's—Ligo was present when I took the things from the hamper—I do not remember asking her any questions about them—she said she did not know how they came there, for she had been out—she was not speaking of those particular dishes—she said she had been out—that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had made her go out, taking the poker and threatening to knock her down, or kill her with the poker, if she did not go out—she said she had been out the whole of the day—I am tore of that—I searched the drawers—they were all unlocked—I found a dark lantern, wrapped up, and a handkerchief containing a lamp, these two life-preservers (they are loaded with lead, the handle is of whalebone, and is flexible) a centre bit, a quantity of skeleton keys, some lucifer matches, and a piece of sand-paper, which will ignite them—(<hi rend="italic">the witness here drew the match through the sand-paper, and it ignited</hi>)—I also found two pairs of scales, and three Sets of plate weights, which are used to weigh gold and silver metal—I saw Fletcher take down a tea-cup containing aquafortis—that is not here—I found those articles of jewellery which have been produced to Mrs. Booth—here is a metal bell, the top of box, gold, an enamelled case, a gold figure seal, a small crucifix, another mull gold seal, with an owl on it, a gold frame of a box, a wine label, and a swivel seal, broken—three drinking glasses were on the table, with a decanter empty by the side of them, and some pipes, three of which had been used—here is a piece of green baize, which was found in the bottom of one of the wine-coolers—it is the bottom of a candlestick—there is resin on it, and it is also burnt by fire—aquafortis is used for the purpose of trying gold, by dipping things in it and applying it to the gold, if it is good gold it has no effect, but if base metal it immediately turns green—I took Ligo into custody—I was with my brother officer when Jones was apprehended in Zoar-street, Gravel-lane, Lambeth—I know he carried on business in Drury-lane—I had been to look after him there before that, but could not find him—I did not ask for him—I had been looking out for him for more than a week—I cannot exactly say how long—he is a van-man, as I understood—his brother and he have a van and a cart between them for the purpose of moving goods—when we apprehended him, Keys said, "Oh Jones, we want you"—I believe he asked what it was for—Keys and I were together—he went in rather before me at the door—I did not hear the whole of the conversation—I know that Keys said something about the robbery to him, and Jones said he knew nothing about it—I heard him say so—he was taken into custody—Livingston was afterwards taken, I saw him in custody at Bow-street, and asked him who he would wish to have the things that were in his room—he said his brother—his brother was present at the time—he was called up, and I called Fletcher up to give him the key—he had not got it then, but he had it afterwards—I asked him at another time respecting two boxes, containing some women's wearing apparel, and said Ligo's sister had claimed them, and asked him whether I should let her have them—he said yes, they were hers, she might as well have them—there was a new shawl found in the drawer—I said Ligo's sister claimed that, and he said she might have it—went to Mrs. Booth's house, and examined the kitchen window—the fastening was out of order, and a person from the outside could throw the window either up or down—there were shutters—by pushing one shutter, and drawing the other towards you, you might introduce a thing of this</p>

             in Tothill-street, and went home with her; I saw her fasten the door - I staid all night with her; I awoke about half-past five o'clock, and missed my things - she was in bed.</p>

I took this man home, and locked the door - I only occupy one room; the landlady does not live in the house- I was awoke in the morning by Bills, and missed my shift and petticoat; I found the door open - Bills was making a noise about his things; Wilkins, the Policeman, came up to know if we had lost any thing - the staple of the lock was not forced; I do not know how it was opened.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give me that bundle? A. No, on my oath I did not; you had not taken me home drunk on the Wednesday.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. About half-past five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner cross Orchard-street with a bundle, and stopped her; she said they were her own things, and finding they were men's clothes I took her to the watch-house; I found the witnesses, who owned them - I lent the prosecutor a coat; he went to the watch-house, and claimed them in the prisoner's presence.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met that woman at the end of the court, as I was going home; she asked me to be so kind as to take these things to my lodging, saying a man had left them with her, as he had no money - I had taken her home drunk a few days before, and she burst her door open.</p>

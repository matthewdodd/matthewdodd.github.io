                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Way, and live at Kennington. I wash for the last witness. On the 11th of February I received a bundle of linen from him, but I never saw it opened—I do not know what was in it—my son, John Way, the prisoner, went with me, and I gave him the bundle to carry for me, to assist me—we got as far as St. Bride's Church, and I desired him to wait there, or to follow me—I was going to Fairing-don-street for his father's linen—I went on, and he seemed to be following ine—I went on to Farringdon-street, and when I returned to where I had left him, he was gone—I could see him on Blackfriars'-bridge, which was in my way home—I went on, and inquired of the policemen at the corner of Stamford-street, if they had seen a youth of his description—they said he was gone straight on, but I saw him no more.</p>

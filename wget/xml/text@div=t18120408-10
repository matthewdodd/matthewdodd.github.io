            . I am shopman to Mr. Willis, grocer in Aldersgate-street, opposite of Mr. Galley's, within five doors; I was going by the shop at the time that the prisoner was coming out with the goods under his arm, and by the manner of his coming out, I thought he did not come by them honestly; I watched his transactions, and he immediate set off running as hard as he could run; I followed him and halloaed out stop thief, he ran some distance before I could catch him; he went under the chains of some waggon horses that were going along; I went through after him, and then he dropped the cloth, and directly he dropped it I picked it up and followed him; I soon after caught him and brought him back to Mr. Galley's, I asked Mr. Galley if he could swear to the property; he said, yes. I told him I saw him come out of the shop with it, I thought he did not come by it honestly. Mr. Galley immediately sent for a constable to take him to the compter. I never lost sight of him after I first saw him come out of the shop until I caught him.</p>

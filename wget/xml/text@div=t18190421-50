On the 31st of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, I was going out of the kitchen and observed the door open. I went up stairs, and saw some drawers open in a spare room. I came down and told the cook there was somebody in the house; I went a second time to the top of the house, heard some drawers opening, ran down, and gave the alarm. I got Cuthbert, then went up stairs, and found the prisoner under

I found the prisoner in the garret, under Handcock's bed, lying on his side, with his shoes in his hand. I asked him what brought him there, he said, to lay down. I brought him down, the constable searched him, and found a 10 l. note in his right-hand waistcoat pocket. I went up to the room again, and found four 1 l. notes under the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210026"></xptr>bed. Handcock claimed all five notes. The top drawer was open in that room.</p>

I locked him up, and in consequence of information I searched him again at the watch-house, and found a gold brooch, rolled up in the flap of his shirt. The prosecutor claimed the brooch and notes, the prisoner made no answer.

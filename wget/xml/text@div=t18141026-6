               <p>Q. Were you at home on the 19th of July last - A. Yes. I lodge in William Green's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at your house on that day - A. I did not see him. I was down stairs mangling some things; I saw a man come in about ten o'clock in the morning; I did not see him; I heard somebody come in; I came up. I had locked my door before I went out, but I had not taken the key out, and when I came up, I found my door open; there was nobody in my room at all. William Green occupies the house; he sleeps there, and I have one room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in what state the outer door was in - A. The outer door was open, and my room robbed. When I got into my room, I looked at my linen; it was all right. I went out of doors, I saw the glimpse of somebody go out; I could not tell whom. When I came out of the room first, I saw somebody going out, and I saw my door open; I went out of doors, I asked if any body had gone in; a little boy, his name is Foster, gave me some information. I returned to my room; I missed live silver tea spoons, a table-spoon, a desert-spoon, and a silver watch. I did not get a view of his person so as to be able to say who he was.</p>

            . I am thirteen years old; I live with my father, No. 19, Castle-street. On the morning of the 19th of July, my mother was washing for Mr. Mayton, and about ten o'clock, I was looking out of Mrs. Mayton's window; I saw the prisoner go out of Mrs. Mayton's house. I knew his person before. I saw him go into the house, and I saw him come out of the house; he was about three minutes in the house. He went round the corner when he came out. I knew the prisoner's face; he had on a velveteen jacket, and pearl buttons on it. I had seen him a great many times before.</p>

             lodges - A. I do not know the name of the place; I know the house when I see it. I saw the prisoner go into the house; I think it was on a Monday; it was in the middle of the day. I saw him take a watch, a salt-seller, and some spoons, seven articles altogether; he took the watch from the nail or a peg, and the spoons from a shelf in the cupboard. I could perfectly distinguish the articles he took. I saw him bring the articles out of the house; I saw him put some into his pocket immediately upon getting to the door, and the others he carried in his hand, and put his handkerchief round them. The prisoner when he came out, took down a turning, and then went another way. I then walked about to amuse myself until my meals was ready, and then I went home to my meals. I gave information of what I had seen some time afterwards; I cannot say how long it was afterwards.</p>

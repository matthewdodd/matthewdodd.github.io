On the 7th of June, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing behind the shop door, I saw the prisoner looking at some handkerchiefs at the door; in about five minutes a little girl came in the shop and told me a man had taken a piece of print. In consequence of what she said I immediately went out; she pointed out the prisoner; I went to him and collared him, and asked him what he had there; he immediately turned round; I saw a piece of gingham concealed under his coat; I desired him to walk back to the shop; he came back, and in the act of bringing him back he let the gingam fall.</p>

            . I am a servant to the East India company. On the 7th of June I was coming along Sun-street, I stopped to look at some second hand books; there was an elderly woman on my right hand; she was muttering he will have something soon; when I lifted up my head she spoke in a louder voice, and pointed the prisoner out to me; I kept my eye upon him till he went into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the man come from - A. He was loitering about the window when she first saw him; after a little time he began to go slowly from the window; he was looking in the window; he went away as if nothing was the matter; I saw him take nothing, it appears he must have took it before. The young man came out of the shop and laid hold of him; he was willing to get back as soon as he could, as the shop was exposed to every body. I saw the prisoner drop it in the street. The prisoner went down upon his knees in the shop and prayed to God to strike him dead if he knew any thing of it.</p>

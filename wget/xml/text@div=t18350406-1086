                  </hi>. I am single, and lodge at No. 11, Union-buildings, in the house of William Pickering, who lives in the house—it is in the parish of Woolwich, in Kent. On Saturday, the 28th of March, I left my room about half-past eleven o'clock at night—I shut the door too, and latched it, but did not lock it—I am sure the latch caught—I heard it—I was gone about half an hour—I left the street door shut—there are other lodgers in the house—when I returned I found the street door shut—I found my own door wide open, and the prisoner in the room—it was dark—there was no light there—she did not lodge in the house—it was dark; but I knew her by her short sleeve frock—I asked her three times what she did in my room—she made me no answer—I am sure it was her—the ran out of the room, and went to her mother's door, which is a back door adjoining mine—I saw her go there, and went into her mother's room after her—I got a light, and saw her there—her mother was in bed—I asked her if she would give me a light—she said, "Yes"—I went into my room with a light, and missed these things off the mantel-piece—I went to her, and accused her of the robbery—she used very infamous words, and said she was not guilty—I said to her, "Sarah Gardener, you are the girl who has got these things"—she said she was not the girl—I went straight to the watch-house—Alsford, the constable, came with me—the prisoner was in her mother's room when the constable came—the constable searched her, and took her to the watch-house—before the constable came, she ran from her mother's door out into the street—I ran after her, and saw her fling all the articles away except a half-crown—she threw them against the palings, and I found them there directly—Harvey was picking them up as the constable and I were coming along—while we were at supper, Alsford brought in a little jug, and I said, "It belongs to me"—I do not know what she threw down at the time—I heard them fall—Harvey took them up.</p>

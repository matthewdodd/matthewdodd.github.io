               <p>about twenty minutes past seven, I was in Kensington, and saw the two prisoners with Shirley in a cart—they were all sitting on a seat—there was hardly room on the seat for them to sit—Sheen was driving—they were within about 150 or 200 yards of Kensington Palace Gardens—I proceeded along Kensington Palace Gardens a few minutes after, about a quarter to eight, and outside the gateway of 15A I found the cart standing—Sheen was in it—he looked at me very hard, and turned the horse across the road—I said to him, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "Why?"—I said, "We are police officers (I was not in uniform); I saw you not long since with two other men I know in this cart"—(I am read<lb></lb>ing from a paper that I wrote at the time, or soon after—next day, when I gave my first evidence—I generally make a memorandum in a case like this)—I did not mention the names of the two others—he said, "You make a mistake, sir"—I said, "No; who are you waiting for here?"—he said, "If you want to know I will tell you; I am waiting for my master, Mr. Green"—I said, "Who is Mr. Green?"—he said, "a butterman near Ebury Bridge, Pimlico"—I sent a young man who was with me to inquire at the different houses, and from what he told me I told Sheen I did not believe him, and should take him to the station—he said, "I can prove I am a respectable man, and live in Lupus Street, Pimlico; I am a stranger in the butter trade business; this horse and cart belongs to my brother-in-law; we have just left a lot of poultry down the road"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "I shan't give you no further satisfaction"—I directed Webb to get up into the cart and keep observation, and I walked by the side of the wheel—I went to 15<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, Palace Gardens—after remaining outside the house about forty minutes an alarm was given, and from what the servant told me I examined the premises—I found that an entry had been made by a person climbing up the portico and getting in at the first floor front window, which I found open, and the catch forced back—there were marks on the window-frame, the woodwork—I found the places in the room broken open—I saw marks of an instrument upon them all—some had been broken open and some had been attempted—the things were strewn over the bed and about the room—on Thursday, 7th February, about noon, I went to No. 1, Plough Court, Fetter Lane, Holborn, and found the prisoner Dundas at breakfast, in the front parlour—I said, "George, I want you for being concerned with Sheen and Harry Shirley in breaking into a house in Kensington Palace Gardens; I saw you and the other two in a horse and cart"—he made no answer for some time—after a time he said, "Who are you?"—I said, "My name is Cole, of the C Division; you know me very well"—I then gave him into the custody of Webb, who was with me—I asked him if that was his room where he was—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he had any other room—he said, "No"—I then searched the room, and in a drawer close to where he was I found the instruments I have produced—after conveying him to the station I went to Mr. Carthew's, and in his presence and Webb's I com<lb></lb>pared this knife with the marks on the window, and they exactly corre<lb></lb>sponded—it is a very fine instrument, it goes between the sashes and opens the catch, and exactly fits the mark—this jemmy also exactly corresponded with the marks on the drawers that were broken open and attempted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose any instrument of the same size would do that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, this jemmy exactly covered all the marks—I never saw a knife like this before, and I have seen a great many—this was not made at a toolmaker's—I wrote this memorandum either the same night</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186704080012"></xptr>
               <p>or next day, after I give my evidence—this is not the first time by a great many that I have done so—you have objected to it before, years back when I have given it in evidence that way—I wrote it down that I might make no mistake—I think I shall continue to do so—it was about twenty minutes past seven that I first saw the cart; I always carry a watch, I looked at it, I had to see a gentlemen at a quarter-past seven by order of the commissioner, and that was my reason for knowing the time, it was dark—it was just by Young Street that I saw the cart first, on the opposite side of the way to Palace Gardens—there were then three men in the cart; they drove past me, and I lost sight of them for some time; the next time I saw it there was only one man in it—I know that was Sheen—I did not see either of the other two then; I saw no more of them that night—I did not see Dundas again till I apprehended him, I was looking for him—there was another man in the room with him—I don't know whether it was a lodging-house—he said it was his mother-in-law's—he did not say the things did not belong to him—none of the missing property has been found—it was nearly a month after the robbery that I took Dundas—Sheen was in custody all that time.</p>

On 11th January I was with Sergeant Cole—I saw the two prisoners and another man in a cart coming in a direction from Hammersmith towards Kensington Palace Gardens—I afterwards saw Sheen in the same cart opposite the gate of 15A—I was present when Cole put certain questions to him—after that I got into the cart with him and rode with him to the station—he was very shifty, he moved the board at the bottom of the cart that formed a second seat, and when within about a yard and a half of the station door he dropped some<lb></lb>thing over the back of the cart—a lad picked it up—it was this life pre<lb></lb>server—the prisoner saw him give it to me, and said, "Well, you just have been very clever to let me drop that and you not see it"—on 7th February I went with Cole and took Dundas into custody—I saw him search the room and find these things—I have been to Ebury Street since this—there is no butterman of the name of Green there or in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood.</p>

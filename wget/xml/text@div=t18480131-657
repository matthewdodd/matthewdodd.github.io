The pri<lb></lb>soner was at work in his shop, about three months ago—he used to ask me questions about my master stopping my wages—he said he had known per<lb></lb>sons who worked for him before, and he used to stop their wages—I said he stopped my wages sometimes, and he said, I was a fool not to have it out of him; why did not I take some quicksilver, and he would take it of me—I took him eighteen or twenty pounds altogether—I took it to his house, 24, Little Marylebone-street—I delivered it sometimes to him, and sometimes to his wife—I got 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am father of last witness, and am a carver an gilder. I went to the prisoner's lodging on 26th Jan., and saw him there—Mr. Cook said he had come to see what quicksilver he had got there of his—he said he had not got 1lb. of quicksilver in the place—Mr. Cook put the question more closely to him, and we made known what we came about—I told him that that boy was my son, and I was determined to have justice done—I asked if he had received silver from that boy—he sad, "No"—Mr. Cook then sent for the policeman—the prisoner then acknowledged receiving one bottle of quicksilver, and said, "Mr. Cook, do forgive me, I will pay it you back again"—I asked what business he had to make a meeting with my son—he said he had borrowed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of him.</p>

I was called to the prisoner's on 26th Jan.,—Mr. Cook, Evans, and his son, were present—I was told to take the prisoner, for exciting the son to steal the quicksilver, and that he received it from the son—he asked Mr. Cook's forgiveness, and said he had never received but one lot, and he would make it up—he again repeated he had only had only lot in a bottle, about a pound and a half, and gave 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi>. When did you take him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Directly I entered the house—I believe Evans said the prisoner had incited him—I believe that was the word that was made use of on the charge-sheet—Evans was not charged with stealing—I did not know he had committed the theft till after I was is the house—the boy told me I was to take the man for receiving stolen pro<lb></lb>perty, he said nothing about his stealing the property—I knew nothing of that till I met Mr. Cook and his father at the door—I looked round the prisoner's house to see if there was any quicksilver—I did not search it thoroughly, as I had no search-warrant—I did not open any cupboards or drawers.</p>

                  </hi> I keep the Duke of Wellington public-house, Hackney Road—on 14th June, at eleven at night, my back window up stairs was shut—I went up stairs and found one of the back bedrooms was looked inside—I directed one of my servants to get in at the window; he did so, and I went into the room and found the drawers ransacked, the bed rolled over, and the pillows rolled to the feet—I missed a pair of trousers, two waistcoats, some shirts, my wife's diamond ring, and other things—this bundle was brought to me by the constable—it contains the articles I missed—I went into the room about 8.30; the window was open then, but I shut it and let the blinds down; the key was then outside the door, which was not locked—when I got into the room the window was wide open and the blinds pulled up—my servant did not open the window; I went with him outside and saw that it was open.</p>

                  </hi> I am a traveller, and live next door to the prose<lb></lb>cutor—about a quarter to eleven on the night of 14th June I had occasion to go outside my house into the back garden, and saw a man get off the leads of the watercloset on to the wall which divides my yard from the prosecutor's—I asked him what he wanted, and he jumped down and ran away—it was not the prisoner—I followed him, and then saw the prisoner running—he is not the man who got off the leads; I lost sight of him—I got over Mr. King's wall, and saw the prisoner running down a passage at the side of the house, which leads to the street—I caught him, and he stopped to pick up a bundle which was lying under the shade of the wall; I took it from him, and he ran away—I ran after him; caught him 150 or 200 yards of£ and gave him in custody with the bundle.</p>

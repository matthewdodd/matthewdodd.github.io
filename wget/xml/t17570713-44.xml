I took it out, and paid a half-penny for interest, and took it home; she followed me, and I gave her the remainder of the money for it, which I thought the full value for me to get a profit by it. I hung it out at the door to be sold, and had seven or eight customers after it; the same day a woman and I agreed for it, she gave three pence earnest, and was to fetch it, but before she did Mr. Stanley came with the prosecutrix, and she described it. I said if you will give me any proof that this is yours between this and Saturday, you shall have it. She call'd on the Friday, and wanted to have it. I said I could not let her have it, for the person that bought it was to come, which she did, and fetch'd it away that night; then the prosecutrix came with a search warrant, I told the constable it was gone, and they took me before Sir

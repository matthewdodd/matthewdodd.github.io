                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the employ of Mr. Walker, a horse-dealer at Birmingham. On Sunday, November 24th, I was at the Roebuck public-house at Lewisham—I had been taking some horses for my master—I saw the prisoner there—we were in the tap-room together for about half or three-quarters of an hour—he asked if I was not the young man that went up with the young man named Bromney with some colts—I said I was, and asked him if I was likely to get a bed at that house to-night—he went and inquired, and said it was full—I said, "Then I must go on to Hampstead, I have to be at the fair on Monday"—he said he was going that way, and would show me the way—I set out with him, in company with three women and another man, about nine o'clock—as we went along, instead of taking me the direct road, he brought me along the canal side—the man and women went with me, and when we got about twenty yards along the canal side, I said he was taking me the wrong way, and turned to go back, but he flung his left arm round my waist, pressed his right hand on my right arm, put his hand in my left breeches-pocket, and took out one shilling and two-pence—I caught hold of his hand, and told him he had robbed me—he said, "Robbed you! I have done no such thing," and he rushed his hand towards the woman's hand—I said, "I will go and fetch a policeman"—the woman said imme<lb></lb>diately, "What does he say you have done?"—he said, "He says, I have robbed him" he said, "If you say that again, I will throw you into the river," and the woman said, "Throw him in"—I said no more, but bade him good night, went along the railing, and turned to the left—I walked fast, and then ran—they did not follow me—I overtook three men, and asked if there was a policeman about—they said there was none in the parish, but I turned back and met Lonergan right opposite the road that leads to the canal, and about a hundred yards from where I was robbed—I pointed out the spot where I was robbed to him—he got assist-ance from the station-house, and we went to several houses, but could not find the prisoner, but as we came back we met him and one of the women coming round the paling—I pointed him out, and he caught hold of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman of Lewisham. On Sunday night last I was on duty near the Plough public-house—the prosecutor came and gave me information—we went to different public-houses, and met the prisoner with a woman—I took him into custody—the woman ran away directly—I found a key and one shilling oh him—he gave me the shilling.</p>

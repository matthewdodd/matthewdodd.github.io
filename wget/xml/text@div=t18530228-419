                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Brunswick-parade, Islington, I carry on the business of a dyer—I have also a shop in Clarence-street, Greenwich, where I carry on part of the same business—the prisoner was in my service, as manager of that shop; she had the entire charge of it—she came into my service in 1851, and remained till 29th last Jan.—her wages were 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and five per cent, on the work that was booked—she had her lodging, and coals and candles, not her board—it was her duty to take in work across the counter, to get the articles ready for the man to dye, and to return them; also to enter the goods in the day-book when she took them in, and to enter the sums that they came to on the side—she had also a cashbook—it was my habit to go to Greenwich every Tuesday, and she and I used to compare the books—I took the cashbook, and she had the daybook—if Mrs. Nixon had been entered, I should have called out the number and the name, and she would produce it to me in the day-book, and I should put "Paid, E. L." to it—in the day-book, in July, here is "Mrs. Nixon, No. 16, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—in the cash-book of the corresponding date, here is not Mrs. Nixon's name, nor is there a similar number—on taking this cashbook, and not seeing the name or number, I should not call out that name or number—I have never received any money from Mrs. Nixon—in the daybook here is "Mr. Hurley, Upper Park-street," in the prisoner's handwriting—it is No. 93, a velvet dress, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was originally marked 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the alteration was made because when I went down, the prisoner said Mrs. Hurley's husband was a tailor, and he could not afford to give so much—I said we always allowed tailors a discount of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and I took my pencil, and altered it to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she told me it was finished, but not fetched, and I said, "I will alter it now, that there may be no mistake"—I have never received any money for that—there is none in the cash-book, nor any corresponding name or number—Mrs. Houghton is entered in the day-book, No. 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is no entry corresponding with that in the cash-book, and I have not received any money for it—I gave her 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week wages; and when I went down, I looked how much she had booked in the day-book; and if it were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I gave her a half-crown—I did that by the day-book, not the cashbook—I always regularly paid her in that way, whether the debts turned out good or bad; she always received her per centage; she had no risk; I did that to encourage her to do her business well.</p>

Q.</hi> She had 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and this per centage; what did it come to on an average? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I entered it in this book—it generally amounted to about 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—she had to keep herself; there was no one but herself—I used to allow her a girl, to do dirty work in a morning—the prisoner only had the shop, the parlour, and bedroom—the man who does the dyeing always swept the shop—there was no servant but the prisoner, the man, and the errand-boy, who was a schoolboy, and not there all day—when she left, she had, contrary to my desire, paid herself the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I liked to pay it myself, not for her to deduct it—I was angry—I sent for a policeman, to make her give up the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she went away.</p>

               <p>she asked if she could go; I said, "As soon as we have settled the cash"—she gave it me, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short—I said, "I do not think you are at liberty so to do," and I sent for a policeman.</p>

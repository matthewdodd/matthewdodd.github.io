            How long did you stay there? - About two hours; she asked me to send for some liquor; I gave her five shillings to go and fetch some liquor; she came in with it; after that I gave her a guinea to go out and get change; she came in as before, and put the change on the table, after that she took it all in her own hand, then I said, you must keep that; after that I was going to sleep there, in the time I was sitting undressing myself she came and sat along side of me, and while she was sitting there she put her hand in my pocket, and took a guinea and a half out in gold, and five shillings in silver; I saw it, and I asked her what she was going to do with it? she gave me no answer; I went to go out at the time, and I saw that she had my handkerchief, and she asked me to come and get it again; I said no, and then I went out and called the watchman, in time he came, and I went and knocked at the door, and she said, who is there? I said, it is me; I thought she would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110045"></xptr>know me, then I asked her if she would give me that again that she took away from me? and she says, you shall not have it; I said, will you open the door? she said, yes, I will open the door; and when the door was opened the watchman went in and took hold of her.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you get your money and handkerchief again? - When we came in I asked if I could have my money again, and handkerchief? and she took and throwed the handkerchief on the floor, and said, there you have got your handkerchief; I would not take the handkerchief; the watchman has got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your money? - No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I would ask him if he did not give me the handkerchief to hem and to mark, against the next day? he was a gentleman that I lived with about four months, almost five, before he went to sea.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Have you lived with that woman before you went to sea? - Not more than one night, and that is a year ago.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. You was called into this house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the house? - In Hermitage-yard, close by the Hermitage, the prosecutor came to me about ten minutes past one, and says, watchman, I have been robbed of gold and silver, and a handkerchief; I asked him where? he pointed to the place (here) I went along with him to the house, he knocked at the door some time; she refused to let him in, at last she opened the door, and I went in, and he gave me charge of her, for robbing him of gold and silver, and a handkerchief, and she threw the handkerchief at him, but he did not take it; so I took it, and took her and the handkerchief to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was it? - A house of bad same, for girls of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her? - No, it was too late to search her.</p>
               <p>Q. You a watchman, and took this woman on this charge, and not search her? - No, we do not like to search them, the officer of the night searches them.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was she searched at the watch-house? - No, the officer of the night locked her up immediately as the prosecutor gave the charge.</p>
               <p>Court to Pearson. Is that your handkerchief? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Hedge. She told me that she took the handkerchief of this man for to hem and to mark.</p>
               <p>Jury. Pray was the handkerchief hemed? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had it in your possession ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober or in liquor? - He was not in liquor, he was very sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk? - No, he was not drunk, he was sober; but in these houses if a man sends for five shillings worth of liquor, there is not above one shilling's worth comes in, that is generally the rule.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This gentleman was an old acquaintance of mine, before he went to sea last; and when he came home from sea this time, it was about twelve o'clock in the day, and I was going to dine, I asked him to dine with me, and he did; I asked him to pay me the fourteen shillings and six-pence that he owed me; he said he would when he got money; after dinner he went on board the ship, and came on shore about tea time, and said that he had borrowed a guinea of the captain, and he paid me the fourteen shillings and six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110046"></xptr>pence, and gave me the remainder of the change, and said, when he was paid the next day, he would make me a better compliment; with that he went and came again in the evening, and he brought two or three shipmates with him, and they sat smoaking their pipes; and then he asked me if he could lay there? I told him there was no room; one of the shipmates was in a bed along with me, and another with my servant; and he asked me for six-pence, to take him on board the ship; and then he went out and brought the watchman, and he said to the watchman, say any thing against her, for I have owed her a spite this five or six months. My friends are gone down into the country, and I did not expect my trial would be this month; the prosecutor sent up to the prison a good many times, and said, if I would find him a guinea and half, a and five shillings, he would not find a bill against me; I told him I had not got so much money, and my clothes would not fetch it; as I had begun the law, I would go through with it.</p>

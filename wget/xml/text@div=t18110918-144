            . I am a pawnbroker, Broad-street, Ratcliff-cross. On the 10th of September, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in and offered this tablecloth to pawn; on looking at it I saw Mr. Hanson's name; I asked her how she came by it; she said she washed for Mr. Hanson, she hoped I would let her have the tablecloth she meaned to return it. I took the tablecloth to Mr. Hanson, she followed me, begging me to give her the tablecloth back again. I went into Mr. Hanson's and asked him if it was his tablecloth, he said it was, and that he lost it about a week; he begged me to call again in about five minutes, she was out; I called again, the prisoner was called into the bar; I immediately knew that she was the same woman that offered me the tablecloth. The prisoner said she never saw me before, nor had she been out of the house. The beadle was sent for, he has had the tablecloth ever since.</p>

            . I am a beadle. The prisoner was given into my charge, she denied stealing the tablecloth; I searched every thing where she had things, I could not find any thing except these keys, one of them will open a good many drawers. This is the tablecloth.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. it is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lived servant with the prosecutor, and in consequence of his losing a tablecloth some day before I left, he said the house maid must be accountable she having them in her charge; unfortunately me and the house maid having words, she swore she would have revenge, and on my coming into the bar to take instruction for the supper, a person came into the house and called for a pint beer and asked me if I had not been into his shop to pawn a tablecloth; I said I had not; he insisted I had, and wished my master to take me in custody; my master said he would consider of it. After he was gone I became passionate, and the next morning the father of the house maid come and abused me very much, he told me he would not mind giving ten pound to make me suffer for the injury I had done to his daughter. Had I been disposed to rob my master there was always plenty of plate about.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. At the time that this tablecloth was brought to your house did you inquire whether the prisoner was at home - A. I did, she was out of the house, I saw her come in and then I sent for the pawnbroker.</p>

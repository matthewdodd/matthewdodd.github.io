                  </hi>. I am a printer and publisher, at 128, Aldersgate Street—the prisoner was in my employment as town traveller for about a fortnight—it was his duty to collect orders, and to write them in a book kept by him—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week salary, and made arrangements with him that he was to receive a commission of half the clear profits when the work was completed and paid for—I have the agreement here—it was written by me, and signed by the prisoner—I have an order-book in the prisoner's handwriting, kept by himself-on the 10th September there is an entry purporting to be an order from Messrs. White &amp; Mann, of Holborn Bars, for 5000 circulars of velocipedes, oh tinted paper, and other circulars, amounting to 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as estimated by himself—on the same date there is an entry purporting to be an order from Messrs.

               <p>10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I put all those orders into execution—I did not exactly estimate the profit—I could not tell that until the orders were completed—I paid the prisoner money on account of those orders—on the 10th I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a shilling for the week—that was only a nominal sum to make him a weekly servant—on the 18th I paid him a shilling and also thirty shillings commission upon the work in progress—at the time I paid him I believed that the orders in the books were genuine—after the second sum was paid I found that all the orders were fictitious—I paid the money on account of those orders generally.</p>

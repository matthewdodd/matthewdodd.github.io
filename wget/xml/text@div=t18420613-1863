                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Clover Tayers, a draper, in High-street, Bromley. At half-past five o'clock, on the 19th of May, I was called by Dykes, and missed this cotton—I saw Brooks about three yards from my shop—I caught her, and asked if she had come into my shop, and taken a gown-piece—she said she did not—I gave her in charge, and went after Ellis, who had got about twelve yards—I took her back—I found Dykes had taken it back—it is mine—Brooks said, "I did not take it"—these stockings were taken from the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's servant. I went into the shop, and missed the cotton—I had not seen any one in the shop—Brooks was brought back by my mistress—before she returned I found this cotton just outside the door—I had seen it safe about ten minutes before—I had seen the two prisoners and another together, a little while before, sitting on the steps next door.</p>

             on the Thursday after her death; she had died on the Monday night - I opened her scull; decomposition was going on very rapidly on the brain - the vessels were very full; none of them appeared to have been ruptured - there was no appearance of concussion, but the science does not enable us to discover appearances of concussion; we cannot decide that in any case if it is simple concussion - there was nothing to lead me to suspect it; I found the left lobe of the lungs perfectly healthy, but the right lobe was very extensively diseased - adhesion was passing from the lung; the pericardium contained much more water than is usually met with, and so much as to occasion the disease called hydxocardia - there was a bruise on the back of the right hand; I observed no other marks, but decomposition might obliterate them, for the body was in a very small room with a fire in it - I afterwards had the body disinterred, in consequence of something which had been said, and on examining the windpipe I discovered one of the rings had become ossified, which was most likely caused by some violence having been done at a distant period - that could not affect her life, but would very much affect her comfort, and undersome circumstances render her ability to sustain life less probable; upon the whole examination I certainly could not attribute her death to violence - if I separated my professional knowledge from what I heard, I should say there was nothing to enable me to say of what she died, although there was a mark of disease - it had not arrived at that state likely to destroy life, unless under peculiar circumstances - hastily altering her position; I mean the upper part of her body being brought much lower than its usual position by stooping suddenly - I cannot think of any thing else which would cause it, but altering the position of the heart, which was impeded by the presence of water.</p>
               <p>Q. Would going hastily up stairs produce that effect? A. That would cause syncope - she would be obliged to stop.</p>

             WHITTELL. I am a surgeon, and have been in practice between three and four years. I examined the body of the deceased, in company with Mr. Whitmore, and agree in the account he has given as to the appearance of the body - there was a slight contusion on the back of the hand, and also on the external part of the scull, but there was no internal mark corresponding with it; the upper part of the heart was much affected by the disease- the appearances were not sufficient to induce me to conclude she died by violence, nor were they sufficient to prove she died from natural causes - there were no marks to bring me to conclude that violence had been given; as such the conclusion I should come to was that she died from natural causes - I observed the water about the heart, and the auricle was thin and softened; a sudden change of position might cause her death - any violent shock or agitation of mind would have considerable influence, but would not alone cause death; sudden passion certainly would accelerate the action of the heart considerably, and in that way more or less cause this complaint, but it must be carried to a very great extent to cause death.</p>

            , JUN. I am Mr. Whitmore's son, and am twenty-one years old. I have just finished my hospital studies - I have been brought up under my father- I examined the body with my father and Mr. Whittell; I think great excitement, attended with a sudden alteration of position, might cause death; I could from no opinion as to the cause of her death from a view of the body.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BLANCH. I live in Glass-court, Brook-hill, Clerkenwell. The prisoner lived at No. 6 in the court, with Mary Bunyon; two woman lived in the same house -I am a bedstead-maker. On Monday evening, the 18th of September, about seven o'clock, I was at work in the court, taking a bedstead down, before the prisoner's window - I was at the top of the court, when the prisoner came to me and said, "Have you seen my old b-h?" I said I had seen her a quarter of an hour before, and I had scarcely spoken to him before she came down Mutton-hill with something in her apron; he said, "Where have you been?" she said, "I have been to fetch you something for your supper, my dear;" he asked if she had a halfpenny- she said she had; they went away together, returned in about five minutes, and went into their apartment, which is on the ground floor - they shut the shutters, and directly they went in the door was locked; the door was bolted inside - which of them shut the shutters I do not know; I heard the door locked and the shutters bolted - I then heard them beginning to quarrel, and there was a violent commotion; I heard a table thrown down with crockery on it; I heard her say to him twice, "For God's sake, Jem don't murder me;" I heard the sound of blows, and she screamed out dreadfully - I was nearly half an hour there at work; her cries at last got so low I could scarcely hear them - they had unbolted the shutters and thrown them open; one of the shutters struck me as it opened - I cannot say which of them opened them; the window was opened to unbolt them - the prisoner came, and shut it down directly; my back was towards them - I could not see who put the sash down; I saw nothing more that evening - I saw the prisoner next morning, about eight o'clock, and he said, "My Poll is dead;" that she died about ten; I saw him go into a broker's shop at the corner of the court- he came out, and told me Mrs. Bowden, the broker, had told him he had been killing his wife; he said he had not struck her, that he only gave her a violent slmking - he laid hold of a person who stood by me, and shook him by the collar to show me how he shook her; he said he had not struck her at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was he always in the habit of calling her his wife? A. Yes - whether they were married I do not know; I have heard him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200029"></xptr>say they had lived together seventeen years - there was no quarrelling till they got into the room, and how it began I do not know; she had been very ill for a long time, and could not drink - I believe she had been in the habit of drinking; I have seen her a little intoxicated, but not very often.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she appear in liquor that evening? A. No great deal - I do not know that she was so at all; she could walk and talk well.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Glass-court. The prisoner came to my house on this Monday evening, about six o'clock, or a little after - he went to the top of the house, and searched the rooms; when he came down I asked if he was looking for his wife - he muttered something, and as he stepped out of the door, he said if he could get hold of her he would break her bl-y neck -I saw him and her come down the court together in about half an hour; they appeared very agreeable - I heard him ask her for the key of the door, which she gave him, and they both went in together; she had something in her apron - I was at my door about half an hour; Blanch was at work in the court - I heard a violent blow given, and heard her say, "Pray, Jem, don't hit me;" I knew her voice - a few minutes after that he shut the window down, and locked his door; I heard another blow given, and heard her beg of him not to bit her - I saw nothing more, for I walked away; I heard of her death next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you live next door to her? A. Yes - I was outside the door; the deceased used to say she was poorly sometimes.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live at the corner of this court. On Monday evening, about nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner and deceased go out together; they went towards their own door - I think it was near nine; it was not quite dark - she looked at a book-case at my door, and said, "I wish I had money to buy it;" she seemed sober, and I thought the prisoner was rather in liquor - the deceased said at that time that her health had been better than for a long time; I saw the prisoner about seven o'clock next morning - he said, "My old Poll is gone;" I asked what he meant - he said, "She is gone dead, she died last night exactly at ten;" he said nothing about any body picking her off the floor.</p>
               <p>ANN DAY. I live in the same house as the prisoner. I never heard whether the woman was his wife or not; I saw the prisoner and her on Monday evening, about half-past six o'clock, coming home comfortably - they came into their room; I heard no disturbance - I live up one pair of stairs, but am very deaf; the prisoner called to me about eight o'clock for a light - I took him one down, but could not get into his room door; he unbolted the shutter, and took the light in at the window - he said, "Mother Day, my cream has fell down, do come and help me up with her;" he got the poker, wrenched the door open, and I found her on the floor - she did not speak; I took her by the heels, he took hold of her shoulders, and we laid her on the bed - she moved her legs to ease herself up in the bed: I did not see her move before she was put on the bed - she had been ill for eight months before, and I expected every night would be her last; I have been called up two or three night in a week to assist her, and found her very had - she would spit pint pots full at a time, and I expected she would be choked with it; the prisoner called me again about a quarter-past ten o'clock - I went down, and found her dead, laying on the bed, covered over: there was some raw liver and bacon in the room - the table was not upset when I went in, but the crockery was broken when I first went in: she was not the prisoner's wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How do you know that? A. I have heard them both say so - they had lived there nine or ten months; she has been eight months of that time ill - I have seen her intoxicated; she never took more than 1d. worth at a time, but she would often have it, and could stand a good deal - she appeared intoxicated when I helped her on the bed, and smelt of liquor; the prisoner was also intoxicated.</p>

            , come down, for I am afraid my Mary is dead;" we both entered the room together, and found her dead, laying on the bed covered over - she had her clothes on, and her stays, but there were no bones in them; her clothes did not appear torn at all - about a quarter to eight o'clock that night, I heard something fall down like crockery, and I found some crockery broken in the room; the prisoner was undressed, sitting on the bed, with a tinder-box in his lap - I saw no blood about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the woman given to drink? A. Yes - when the prisoner was sober he was very kind to her.</p>
               <p>MARY BLENCOW. I live in this court. I saw the deceased on Monday evening, about six o'clock; she appeared sober, and as well as ever she was, except having a bad cough - I was talking to her about her brother's funeral; I was in the habit of seeing her often - she had been in a very bad state of health for a long time, through a cough; I never saw her intoxicated.</p>
               <p>MR. WHITMORE, SEN. re-examined. Q.Would shaking or striking the woman in the state she was in, be likely to cause her death? A. Certainly a violent shaking would, and if a blow knocked her down or altered her position it might.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the appearances indicate a disposition to drink, or did the water in the pericardium account for drinking? A. I have had well-known cases of dropsy of the pericardium, when I have known the persons were not given to drink; I believe drinking is one of the causes of such appearances, but I certainly should not look at the pericardium for appearances of a person's drinking - I should rather look at the liver; her falling when intoxicated might cause her death, but under the stimulus of drink, she was more capable of bearing up with what might happen - a fall when intoxicated might be more violent, and from her inability to raise herself, her altered position might continue longer; there are certain sorts of violence which might produce death, and leave no trace - if she died from blows there would be marks.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Would lifting her on the bed injure her? A. If the feet were more elevated than the head it might.</p>
               <p>MR. WHITTELL. In my opinion a violent shaking, or knocking down, or blows might cause her death without leaving external marks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If she had fallen, and laid on the ground some time, would that be sufficient to account for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200030"></xptr>her death? A. If she was in an horizontal position some time it might.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never touched a hair of her head when she fell, and have not hit her for some years.</p>

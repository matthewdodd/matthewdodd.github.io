I lost these things on Wednesday night, the 23d of March; they were in my breeches pocket.

I gave the alarm to the watchman. She went away. I did not know that I had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you find it out - A. In about five minutes after. When I came to my lodging I put my hand into my pocket to look for my money; it was gone. I put the candle down, and went out. I was all night looking after her. I saw her in Drury-lane the next morning. I am sure she is the woman. I had been with no other woman. This is the woman that laid hold of me. When I found her in Drury-lane I tapped her on the shoulder; I said, I have been looking for you all night; she said, you b - r, I never saw you.</p>
               <p>WILSON. I am an officer. On the morning of the 24th, I took the prisoner in custody; she was very much in liquor. I took her to St. Giles's watchhouse. I told her to turn out what she had got in her pocket; she pulled out some shillings and halfpence. I put my hand in her pocket, and took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200065"></xptr>out this comb. I asked her how she came by the comb; she told me that a woman gave her the comb for her boy, who was in the Philanthrople society.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor never said a word about the comb used the constable told him if he could swear to the comb; he would get the rest of the property.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my comb. I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He never said it was his comb until he came before the magistrate. I am innocent.</p>

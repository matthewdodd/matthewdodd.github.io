            ; we told him we had got a load for him to take up at Chelsea; accordingly he went with us about five o'clock in the morning, with a cart, to Ranelagh-walk, Chelsea; when we came there, the cart went down the yard and was loaded, Ridley and Avery lent a hand to load it; we directed the man to drive to Worcester-place, Thames-street; when we came there, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, Mr. Smith's man, and his boy, were waiting, there is a warehouse there; the man's name is Meares, and the boy's name is Jem.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose servants they were? - A. Mr. Smith's, I believe, I have seen them at Mr. Smith's house a long while before, at Mount's Gateway, East Smithfield; I was present when they were examined before the Magistrate; it was weighed at the warehouse in Worcester-place, and there was about eighteen or nineteen hundred weight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that warehouse situated? - A. Up about three stories, or there away, it was the third tier to the best of my knowledge; it was craned up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who assisted to get it into the warehouse? - A. Brandall, Allen, and myself, and Mr. Smith's man and boy.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Brandall? - A. A shoe-maker, and Allen is a waterman; after it was weighed, we came away; about a week afterwards Brandall received the money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any conversation with Mr. Smith respecting the money? - A. Never but once, I received eighteen shillings from him; I told him there was more money that that to come; and he told me Brandall had had a bottle or two of wine, and a ham of him, and he could not think of paying any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that eighteen shillings the balance of an account? - A. Yes; there were two pounds altogether left him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this hemp transaction? - A. Yes; and he gave me half-a-guinea, a seven-shilling-piece, and a sixpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You are a block-maker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Allen was a waterman, and Brandall a shoemaker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it that applied to you to go and rob upon the Thames? - A. Allen was the first.</p>
               <p>Q. That must have surprized you a good deal, a man of character, working at his business as a block maker; it must have been matter of great surprize to you? - A. He asked me if I was agreeable to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which, of course, you knocked him down for proposing such a thing to you, a man of character? - A. No, I went with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You hesitated, of course, and remonstrated with him, for proposing such a thing to a man of character? - (The witness hesitates).</p>
               <p>Q. You knocked him down, did not you? - A. It was not the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been once or twice before, by way of practice? - A. I have been here once before.</p>
               <p>Q. That may happen to any of us? - A. I was honourably acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, having been here once before, and honourably acquitted, you were particularly cautious of your character in future? - A. I was till within very lately.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately is it since you were honourably acquitted? - A. About eight years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a long spell of honesty indeed; how long did the sit of honesty last? - A. Till within these nine or ten months, when I got acquainted with Brandall.</p>

               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you only did this that you might be able to detect thieves and villains? - A. Not at all; I never meant to be a thief again, please God.</p>
               <p>Q. But the sit came on again, there was no resisting it, and being in the act of stealing upon the Thames, Brandall and Allen had the luck to get away, and you were lest, and they took you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many months had you been at your old courses, new revived, when that happened to you? - A. About nine or ten months.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know how that trade is carried on, do you make Saint Mondays, or every other night, or what? - A. I have been in the impress service.</p>
               <p>Q. But I am speaking of this voluntary service? - A. I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. So they took you in the very act of thieving? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080101"></xptr>I was taken by a Marine Police-office boat, with some stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. With some stuff; that, in your language, means stolen goods, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They took you to the office, and there was no chance of your having the same luck again of being honourably acquitted? - A. I voluntarily acknowledged having been guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. Being taken in the boat with the stuff upon you, you voluntarily acknowledged your guilt, that was a great concession certainly; pray how many persons did you accuse, I will not quarrel with you for half a dozen, but how many persons before the Magistrate did you accase? - A. Five of six.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it you were honourable acquitted here for? - A. Robbing on the water.</p>
               <p>Q. You never practised in any other line? - A. Only my own trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Any thing is a man's trade that he takes to; I want to know whether you confined your practice to robberies upon the river? - A. No; I did not make a practice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You only made an amusement of it for nine months, three times a week? - A. Sometimes once a week.</p>
               <p>Q. According to the catch, I suppose; but you never practised in any other line of roguery? - A. What I was here for was, for robbing a gentleman in a boat.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a highway robbery upon the water, you never practised in any other way; is your name Robert? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never practised in any other line; you understand my question? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were never accused of any other offences but offences upon the water? - A. I do not remember any other.</p>
               <p>Q. An innocent man may be accused; but recollect if some person did not accuse you of going out of your regular beat of business upon the water, and breaking in upon other men's province? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a large acquaintance, a man may forget some of them; do you remember a gentleman of the name of Germaine? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. An acquaintance of your's? - A. They were here with me.</p>
               <p>Q. He was tried for that robbery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person robbed? - A. I do not know the name now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what he was? - A. No; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he an Excise officer? - A. He might be, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never charged with a footpad robbery upon the land? - A. I never was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that positively? - A. Yes; I never was charged with one in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were taken up upon that occasion, you were honourably acquitted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not offer to turn evidence for the Crown, and was refused? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never applied to be a witness for the Crown? - A. This here, do you mean?</p>
               <p>Q. No, no; when you were tried in company with your friends, Germaine and Perry, for robbing the Excise officer? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the articles of which that man was robbed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a pocket handkerchief one? - A. I remember there was something about a pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. You were honourably acquitted, and therefore I may ask you, whether you ever offered to any body a silk pocket handkerchief, which you described as being round the neck of the person when he was robbed? - A. No; I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know M'Call? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is an acquaintance of your's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him about the Excise officer? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How long were you detained in custody at the Police office? - A. I have been there ten or eleven weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. And of course must remain in custody till these persons, who are to be tried, are disposed of, and you then expect to be discharged? - A. I cannot say; I do not expect any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you to be detained for afterwards? - A. I do not know, I am sure, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that ten or eleven weeks, how many times have you been examined? - A. I believe, four of five times.</p>
               <p>Q. How often has your examination been read over to you? - A. Not very often, about three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not very long? - A. Yes; there is a good deal of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it read over to you last? - A. I read it over myself about a week or two back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the last time? - A. I had it in my hand last night, just to look at it, but I had it not five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave it you last night? - A. Nobody; I took it as it lay on the dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. And knowing this cause was to be tried, you very naturally took it up to look it over? - A. I just looked at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your original examination, singed by the Magistrate, or a copy of it? - A. A copy.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made that copy? - A. I do not know; it was made and given to me.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom? - A. I fancy it was the housekeeper that gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it given to you? - A. Six or seven weeks back, I dare say it is.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, by the housekeeper, you mean somebody that has the custody of you? - A. Nobody in particular; when the officer was gone out, I used to go up and stay with the housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Q. I will thank you to see it? - A. I never carry it about me.</p>
               <p>Q. So of this examination, a copy was made and given to you six of seven weeks ago? - A. Thereabouts.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080102"></xptr>Q. Which of the Magistrates was it that had signed it? - A. I do not think it was signed? - A. It was only a copy of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask for it, or was it given you as a proper thing to have? - A. It was given to me.</p>
               <p>Q. With what directions was it given you, as a proper thing to have? - A. It was given to me.</p>
               <p>Q. With what directions was it given you - what were you to do with it? - A. To look it over.</p>
               <p>Q. It was given you six or seven weeks ago to refresh your memory? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And has never , since it was taken before the Magistrate, been read over by any body to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it when you went before the Grand Jury? - A. No; not particularly then.</p>

               <p>Q. How often has that accident occurred? - A. When he first gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Laing was the person that first gave it you? - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Laing the housekeeper? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. These gentlemen in that box have good memories - do you remember telling me over and over again, that the housekeeper had given it you with a direction to read it over? - A. The housekeeper had given it me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mr. Laing read it over to you? - A. Five or six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it Mr. Laing read it over to you? - A. In the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the additions, that were made to your examination, added to your copy, and delivered to you? - A. I heard it in the office two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present when Mr. Laing read it over to you? - A. I do not remember seeing any body but Mr. Laing there.</p>

               <p>Q. Then I hope he will be called to contradict you - when did that gentleman read it over to you? - A. A good bit ago.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the sessions, did you bring your examination with you? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not read over to you? - A. Some of the Grand Jury asked me something about it, and I told them.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Laing was attending the Grand Jury? - A. He was outside at the door.</p>

               <p>Q. When were you in it last? - A. I was in it, I believe, about a fortnight back last Sunday was a week, I went down along with one of the officers on board a collier.</p>
               <p>Q. Your's is a pleasant imprisonment enough, you could take your pleasure upon the water; but I asked whether you had proposed to any body that you would do something with yourself by the assistance of the boat last night, upon certain terms, and have a care? - A. I told my wife, last night, to go to an acquaintance of mice, who I knew was acquainted with Mr. Smith, to see if she could learn what Mr. Smith said about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that is all? - A. Yes; that is all</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that? - A. I did add, that if I was a mind, I could make my escape; but it was not my inclination for to go, or I might have gone many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your object last night in sending a message by your wife to an acquaintance of Mr. Smith's? - A. I did not send any message to Mr. Smith at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor by your wife to any acquaintance of your's? - A. I do not know what my wife might say, I did not desire her to go to Mr. Smith, nor to any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. You said just now, I desired her to go to an acquaintance of mine, that I know was an acquaintance of Mr. Smith to see if she could learn what he said about it; I did add, that I could make my escape if I would - now do you mean to repeat that you did not desire your wife so to do? - A. I told my wife not to let Mr. Smith know any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those gentlemen and tell me what your wife was to communicate to your friend, that you could escape if you would? - A. I had no inclination for going.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not direct that a message should be conveyed to Mr. Smith to send money to you, and that you would make use of the office-boat, and make yourself scarce today, that he might be acquitted; for that you were sorry you had accused an innocent man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no proposal at all about money? - A. No; my wife might say so; but I did not; I told my wife I did not mean to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you chance to say any thing to your wife about some money of Mr. Smith's? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your friend's name that you sent her to? - A.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a catman on my own account; I was employed to fetch a load of hemp from Ranelagh, Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it? - A. I cannot say; Thompson and two other men, whom I do not know, came to employ me; I went to Ranelagh at near six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you keep your cart? - A. My cart stands in Bermondsey-street.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you get to this place in Chelsea? - A. Between six and seven o'clock; one of them went with me, a tallish man, I did not know his name, it was not Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go for this hemp? - A. Past a dead wall, and into a field; the hemp was in a place covered over like a pig-sty; it was most of it in mats; they ordered me to Queenhithe; they met me just by Queenhithe; they told me, when they employed me, that it was to go in a west-country barge; they told me I must drive to Worcester-place with it.</p>
               <p>Q. About what quantity of it was there? - A. I suppose about sixteen or seventeen hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Worcester place, as they desired you? - A. Yes; I went down there, and drew under a gateway, and the hemp was craned up into the warehouses.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was that warehouse? - A. I cannot be certain whether it was two stories or three stories.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then I cannot go any further with this prosecution.</p>

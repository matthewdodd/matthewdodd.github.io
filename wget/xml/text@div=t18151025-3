The prisoners at the bar came into my shop at about eleven o'clock on the night of the 29th of September, for two plates of beef for supper. I had shut up my shop; but on their knocking, I let them in; I was just going to put a note for which I had given change into my pocketbook. I let them in. There were four one-pound notes in my pocket-book. The watchman came in for a light just then; and the two prisoners came in whilst he was there; he went out on his duty. I then served them with what they wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the pocket-book - A. In the till. There were four notes in it; and the one I was going to put in, was in the till. When I had given them the beef, they wanted some pickles. I went down to the cellar, and I heard a foot go from the place where the prisoners sat over to where the till was; and I returned directly; I immediately suspected; I returned directly, with only a few pickles; I was not gone above half a minute. He asked me was my stock of pickles almost out; I told him, no, but my time was almost out. I went to the till, and found my pocket-book gone. The prisoner wanted to go out to make water; he said, he could not get out without my assistance; I opened the door for him. No one can get either in or out without my help. Then being in fear, I went to look for the pocket-book in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not look for the pocket-book until the prisoner was gone out - A. No. He then knocked at the door, and I let him in again, and he finished his supper. I did not say any thing, nor make it known that I had lost any thing, at that time. I left the door open for a minute, and ran to the watch-box at the corner; I told the watchman I had been robbed, and he came back after me; he did not say any thing to the prisoners then; but he saw the patrole passing by the door, and called him. They then paid for their supper, and wanted to go; I said, they would not go yet, for I had been robbed since they were in the place, and it must be they who had done it. I told the watchman to search in the street, to see if they had thrown down a pocket-book, while we were away; but nothing could be found. We then took them to the watchhouse; they were searched there, but nothing found on them. When we came back again, I said to the watchman and the patrole, I wish you would assist me to look. We must have a good look, and I dare say we shall find it some where about. We then searched all along St. Giles's Church railings, and Little Denmark-street, and through Dudley-court, and then came back into High-street, out of Dudley-court; they shewed a light with the lanthorn into all the corners. Just there, there is a spout comes down by a doctor's shop; and there, by their shewing me a light, I spied the old pocket-book stuck behind the spout; the doctor's shop is two doors from my house, and Roberts's, the tobacconists, is next door. We took the pocket-book down to the watchhouse, and then brought it home again; the notes were in it, and three of them had my name on the back. When we came back to the shop, the woman was sitting where we left her; she was there when I heard a foot go towards the till; so it was between them.</p>

            . I am a watchman, and was on duty at the end of the street. On the 29th of September last, I went to get a light at the shop of the prosecutor; and while I was there, the prisoners came in. I then went to my box; and I had not been there ten minutes, when the prosecutor came, and said, Hogan, Hogan, I am robbed; he said he believed he was robbed of five pounds. He went into the shop, and I followed him. The prosecutor whispered across the counter into my ear, and told me to look about the door, to see if they had thrown it into the street. I could not find it; and as the patrole was coming by, I called him to assist us. We went into the house, and took the prisoners into custody. They were searched at the watchhouse, but nothing found upon them. Coming back from the watchhouse, the prosecutor, Mr. Walton said, we will have a general search, with your assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you assisted in that search, when the pocket-book was found - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did he walk away? - A. Yes, he walked away; I saw him brought back in about a quarter of an hour; I am sure the person that was brought back was the same man that dropped the spoons.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM TURNER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a plasterer: On Friday the 1st of May, I was in York-place, Portman-square; I heard an alarm, and pursued the prisoner, Goodman was with me; he was thrown down by a labouring man a few yards before we came up to him; when we came up, the prisoner put his hand to his right-hand pocket, I seized his hand in his pocket, and pulled his hand out with one of these spoons in it; I put my hand into his pocket and found another; upon which, Goodman searched his left-hand pocket, and found another tea-spoon, and a salt-spoon; we took him back to Mr. Solly's house, and searched him again, but found no more; then Lord Portsmouth sent for a coach, and he was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at all appear to be out of his senses? - A. No. (The spoons produced).</p>

               <p>Q. Have you found, that the general state of his mind was that of an insane man? - A. Yes; it is often the case, that persons in that situation have more scheme and artfulness than others.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. And, perhaps, you have known them sometimes pretend to be mad when they are not so? - A. I did not know him before these four or five months; I attended him between three and four months.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. At Bevis-Marks, St. Mary-Axe.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you are what is called a mad doctor? - A. It is not my particular profession to attend persons under that complaint; I have attended them; we call it the mania.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recommend his relations to call in some person whose particular profession it was? - A. I cannot say that I did; I recommended them to send him to St. Luke's, or some private place.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200008"></xptr>Mr. Bevil. Q. A man who is deranged will sometimes act like a man in his senses? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Has it often happened to you to hear of a madman stealing spoons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is more likely for a man to do it in a lucid interval than in a moment of insanity? - A. He could do it in the paroxysms of the mania.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever given evidence here before? - A. I believe I have; is that any matter of consequence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bevil. Q. I believe you are a physician to a jew charity? - A. Yes; and the Societies at large.</p>
               <p>HENRY MARKS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Bevil. I am a silversmith, in Hyde-street, Bloomsbury: I have known the prisoner a year and a half; about four or five months ago he came to my shop, and wanted to give me an order for some goods; he wanted so many dozen table-spoons and tea-spoons, and different articles; I asked him who he wanted them for; he said he wanted them to go abroad; I asked him how he came by these orders; and he made different excuses; I looked upon him to be out of his mind; then he wanted some embroidered clothes, which was out of my line of business, and I took no manner of notice of what he said; about three weeks, or a fortnight after, he came again; I asked him what his pleasure was; he said, be so good as lend me a shilling; I was quite surprized when he asked for a shilling, I gave him a shilling, and I waited in my shop I dare say four or five minutes before he took the shilling; he spoke several things, but I did not take any notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then his behaviour was evidently the behaviour of a man deranged? - A. Yes.</p>

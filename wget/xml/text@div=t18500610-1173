On 1st June, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in Church-street, Chelsea, and two men came up behind me—the prisoner is one—they threw me down on a bank, held me by the throat so that I could not halloo, and rifled my pockets of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a gold ring, a silver ring, a knife with my name on it, a comb, and a card-case—I then cried out.</p>

On 1st June, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in my house, and heard a cry of "Police" three times—I ran down Church-street, and saw the prisoner on the top of Nicholls—I was within ten or twelve yards of him—he saw me, and ran away—I ran after him forty or fifty yards, and caught him—he said, "Never mind, it is all right, it is a friend of mine; it is only a <hi rend="italic">lark!"</hi>—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him a ring, a comb, and a knife with a name on it—he dropped these two rings in paper—Nicholls was sober enough to identify his property.</p>

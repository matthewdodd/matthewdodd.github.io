                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live in Artillery-place, Wool-wich—the prisoner lodged in my house about two months. On 19th Sep<lb></lb>tember I was standing at my door, and saw her passing by in the street—I saw the top of this tap projecting out of her apron—I went and said, "You have my tap"—she said, "No, no"—I went and took the tap away from her, and said it was all nonsense—this is the tap—I afterwards took this pipe away from her—she told me, if I let her go in the house she would hand it to me, she did not want the mob to see her outside—I took her in, but when she was in she refused to do so, I had to force it from her—this is the tap and pipe—I had seen them safe on the Monday afternoon, about 20 minutes before 4 o'clock, and I saw her with them about a quarter past 4—the tap was fixed in the water-butt in the yard, which is on a stand—this pipe was fixed to the wall—the prisoner had no authority to take them away.</p>

On Monday afternoon, 19th Sep<lb></lb>tember, I took the prisoner in custody at the prosecutor's house—I told her he had given her in custody for stealing a brass tap and some pipe—she said she did not steal it, but had it given her by a person—I asked her what person—she said she could not tell me who it was, it was a stranger—she afterwards said she did not wish to get any one in trouble besides herself.</p>

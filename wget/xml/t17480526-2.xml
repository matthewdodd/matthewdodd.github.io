               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. The 6th of May, I stopped him and asked him, what he had got there? He said, he had some old iron and old lead. I examined what they were, and thought they must belong either to Mr. Meadows or Mr. Brotherton, because it was about the spot where their houses stood.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the plates you found in the possession of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. I have had them all this while in my possession, and they are what I found upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>Reynolds . He said he bought them for six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he bought the bag, and all the things in it, for six-pence?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. He said he bought the bag, and all that was in it, for six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Meadows . Was there any direction given to any body, when any of these things were found, to carry them to any particular place?</p>
               <p>Meadows. I ordered a man to be there, to take care of every thing that was taken out of the ruins .</p>

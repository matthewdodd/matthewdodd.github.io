                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker of 3. Barrow-field-land—on Saturday night, 25th January, it was nearly one o'clock when I got home—Georgiana Homewood was in the room, very drunk—the prisoner knocked at the door, and wanted to come in to light a candle—I shut the door while I got a light, but he forced his way in, and went up to the prosecutrix, and spoke to her—I tried to put him out, and succeeded—he came in a second time, and I heard him say, "Are you coming?"—she said, "No"—he then struck her, as I thought with his fist, but when I lifted her up, I found she was bleed<lb></lb>ing—I did not see any knife until the policeman showed me one—I had pre<lb></lb>viously called in an officer and told him to put Norriss out, because he made a disturbance—the officer afterwards sent for a doctor.</p>

               <p>the house, and found him standing at the door of No. 3—he said, "Norriss has forced his way into my house, and I want him turned out—I saw the prosecutrix sitting on a chair at the right-hand side of the fire-place, and the prisoner in a stooping position, speaking to her—the front door opened into the room, there being no passage—I heard the prisoner ask her whether she was coming along with him—she made some reply which I did not hear—she was very drunk—he then struck her—I went in with the intention of putting him out, and as I was coming up to him he struck her—she fell on the floor, and I saw blood issuing from her throat—I did not at that time see any knife in the prisoner's hand, but when I took hold of him, I saw he had a knife—it was open, and he shut it and put it in his pocket—I took him out of the house, and he dropped the knife out of his pocket—I picked it up, and he said, "I hope I have done for her; if she won't live with me, she shan't live with anybody else."—he said, "Take me, hang me, do what you like with me"—he had been drinking, but was not drunk—he was very violent in going to the station, and laid down on the ground—there was blood on the small blade when I saw it.</p>

I live at Edmonton—on Sunday, 29th January, at 1 o'clock in the morning, I went to see the prosecutrix—she was lying on the floor drunk, with a slight wound in her neck—it was of a very trifling character, only it was in a most dangerous position—if it had been a little deeper, it would have opened into the wind-pipe, and if it had been on either side, it would have cut into the main artery—she was under my care for a few days—when I first went in, I asked if there was any knife, and, when I saw it I remarked to the constable that there was a little blood on it—it is my opinion that that was the knife with which the wound was inflicted.</p>

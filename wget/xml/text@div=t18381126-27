                  </hi>. I am a house-agent and appraiser, and live at Hamp<lb></lb>stead. I have two houses, Nos. 23 and 24, Charles-street, Holborn, where I deposit goods-Graham was in my service in September last—he has been so for little more than a year and a half—it was his business to look after the furniture there, and also to collect rents—Tetsall was employed occasionally, and Thumwood is the daughter or daughter-in-law of Gra<lb></lb>ham—I went there about the 20th of September, and missed some articles -Graham and Tetsall were both there on that occasion—I complained of some things being missed, and took an inventory of them-neither of them gave me any explanation of those things—there was a chest of drawers, a copper, a table, and some bedding in the warehouse where Graham was—there was an old coat and trousers of mine which were usually kept in the drawers of that chest, but I am not quite sure they were there then—I went there again on the 6th of October, and missed the chest of drawers, the copper, the bedding, the coat and trousers, and some other: things-Graham was gone—I found Thumwood there in the evening just as it was dark—she was in the yard near my back ware-room—I said, "Where is your father?" and I told her the things were missed—she gave me no account of them—she slipped away—I saw her again in King-street, and gave her in charge—she had a bundle with her which contained the coat—after I took her to the station-house, she said <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> had been in it, and if I would not hurt her, she would go and show me where the rest of the goods were—she did so—I did not promise not to hurt her—I asked her for the looking-glasses—she said they were pledged, and the duplicates were at Mrs. Hawkey's—that <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> had sold the copper for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in Eagle-street, and she had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he had himself, and the rest Graham had—I saw Tetsall on the Monday following at the Fleet Prison—I brought him out and said, "I give you in charge for taking a copper away belonging to me and selling it"—he said, "I know I took the copper and sold it, but Gra<lb></lb>ham hired me to do so"—I asked him where it was sold—he said that was best known to himself—on the Monday morning I went to Mrs. Hawkey's, in King-street—I found there a quantity of bedding, and the duplicates had been there, but she said they had been taken away—I found there an old bed and mattrass, and old sheets and blankets, and a bolster-neither Graham nor Tetsall had authority from me to remove these things.</p>

No, I did not-you did not sell a clock to Mrs. Brown—the money was left with you, but I sold the clock—the woman living on the premises said, "Leave the money below," and she did.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I live in Charles-street. I know where the prosecutor keeps furniture—on the 4th of October, at three or four o'clock in the af<lb></lb>ternoon, I saw Graham removing a chest of drawers, and two men, who are not here, were helping him—after that I saw two women go out with the bundles-Graham was in the parlour very much intoxicated—that was the place where they removed them from—he must have seen them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Clement's-lane. A bed and some bedding were found in my lodgings—Thumwood brought them there, I believe, but I was not at home-neither of the prisoners came to me after that before the officers did, but I met Thumwood in Drury-lane, and desired her to take her father's property away which was in my place, that was, the bed and bedding, and then Mr. James came and took the things, and asked if any duplicates were there, and he had some from a jug which were Mrs. Graham's, and I showed him some of my own.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Graham's Defence</hi>. I entered his house on the 1st of July, and was to have two rooms for taking care of the house, and by so doing these things came to my house—he used to bring things to me, and brought the copper for one—I said I did not much fancy it—I continued there—my door was broken open, and my things taken away, and it was thought I had bad a hand in selling these things—I know no more of them than the man in the moon—my own mattrass and <hi rend="italic">kit</hi>, and leather, were taken by two men whom I have never seen since—I did not see the copper go away—I mended a pair of shoes, and made a pair of boots for the pro<lb></lb>secutor, which came to 18*.—I said I should take the drawers for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Tetsall Defence</hi>. On the 30th of September I went to the prosecutor's to get a balance he owed me, part of which he paid me, and I told him I was going to the Fleet prison as messenger—I was so employed on the 4th and the 6th, and it is not likely I should go and tell him where to find me if I had committed a felony—he came on the 8th and gave me into custody—on the 24th of September I was in possession of a house of some ladies at Hampstead—the money was paid, and as he got an entry by foul means, the ladies asked me if I would give my residence—I said yes, I would—that is the only reason I can give for his conduct on this occasion—I have been well known in the Fleet, and have been there six<lb></lb>teen months.</p>

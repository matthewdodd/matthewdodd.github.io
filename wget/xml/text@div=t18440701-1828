                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Kate-street, Spitalfields. I have known the prisoner about two years by meeting him at different public-houses—he is thirteen years old—on the 7th of June I was at Wyatt's public-house, in Brick-lane, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—we were all drinking there with Stevens, Everett, Collins, and Norris—Reeves was <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> with King, and the prisoner began to <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> with her, pulling her about—I told them to leave off—he said what was it to me—we sat down, and began to drink—I said to King, "Give him a good <hi rend="italic">spank</hi> "—Reeves said, "I will give you a <hi rend="italic">spank</hi> "—the prisoner said nothing, and it was all over—I got angry—we went out—I followed the prisoner, and overtook him, and I agreed to fight—I threw off my bonnet and shawl, and struck the prisoner—I was drunk, and do not know what I fought about—I am seventeen years old—I met Bircham the policeman—I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Mike</hi> has got a knife," (meaning the prisoner)—I said so because Reeves threatened to stab me with a knife, and the prisoner had his hands in his pockets—the prisoner said, "No, I have not," and showed his hands—he said, "Come and search me"—we fought after that, and fell, the prisoner undermost—he called out, "She is biting me"—I had got hold of his neck with my hands, and had my teeth on his face; I will not say whether it was to bite him or not—I got up and said, "Oh, I am stabbed"—I found I was stabbed on my neck, and had a wound on my hip and head—I bled—all the parties were as close to me as the prisoner at the time I was stabbed—I said Reeves had done it, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280103"></xptr>Q. Are there any partnership servants sleep there? - There are. On Friday the 2d of October, in consequence of some particular application for some muslin from a neighbour, I desired one of our servants to bring down a piece of a particular mark; he went to look for the particular piece and could not find it; we made a very particular search, and could not find it; we concluded taking our stock, apprehensive that this piece might not be gone alone, I went and looked over the wrappers, to see if any other piece might be gone, in looking them over I found that another piece was gone out of the very same lot; who had taken them at that time we could not tell, but from some particular circumstances our suspicion fell on the prisoner at the bar; he had left our service that very morning, the 2d of October; we then took some pains to find out where he was; we found out that he was at a very reputable house in Bond-street, I called there, but did not find him at home; after that one of the partners in the house called on me, in consequence of that I went after him on Tuesday to Bond-street, with an intention of charging the prisoner with the fact; I went there, and he was then at dinner in the house, I called him out, at least desired a servant to do it; when he came to the door, I told him that having missed several articles, our suspicions fell on him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When you told him this did not you tell him it would be better for him to tell the truth of the business? -At that time I said nothing at all about it. I did afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Then nothing that he has said after this can be evidence with regard to the discovery he made? - I went up stairs with the prisoner to the place where the boxes were, and there I found two pieces of Irish linen laying in a corner of the room, in a hat box. They are in the indictment. We had afterwards the box opened, in that box we found a great quantity of muslins, huckaback, and Irish linens, and cambricks. After that, Taylor, from Bow-street, was called up, who examined his pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you by at the time? - I was. In his pockets he found twenty guineas, and among his papers taken out of his pocket was found a catalogue, together with an account annexed to that catalogue. It was a catalogue of goods to be sold at Fellows and Myers's, Aldersgate street. We went to Bow-street, and got a summons from Mr. Bond to Mr. Fellows and Myers's, in order to come and produce the goods the next morning. I went with the summons in my pocket to Messrs Fellows and Myers, but previous to the delivery of the summons, I went into the warehouse to inspect the goods that were marked in the catalogue as delivered to them by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Fellows and Myers? -Brokers and auctioners, in Aldersgate-street. I have the catalogue here now, marked in his own hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What are these goods in the catalogue? - Four dozen of napkins, four eight-quarters of diaper cloths, nine diaper table-cloths, eighty our linen napkins, five table cloths to match these napkins, two pieces of muslin, also one of which pieces of muslin was the very one that I originally missed, which led to the discovery. I afterwards went to his taylor's, benjamin Caddington, in Brewer-street. The taylor shewed me some callicoes, which he had bought of the prisoner; this was I think a day or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all this pass on the second? - No. it was on the sixth that I went to Bond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to the taylor's? - That was on the eight I believe, where I found some callicoes. I opened on of the pieces out, and I mentioned before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280104"></xptr>hand to the taylor some defects that were in it. The property is all in court now. All the property that was taken from his room was delivered up to me at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept it ever since? - I have. The rest of the property is in the hand of the auctioner, and the callico is in the possession of the taylor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Your name is Christopher Crook? - It is.</p>

               <p>Q. Nobody has any interest in the trade? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. These things must be taken at different times? - No doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. The particular day in which any of them were taken you don't know? - Except, I am pretty confident that the two pieces of muslin were taken away on the first of October. I see it myself on the thirtieth of September, the day before. The muslin cost us six pounds ten shillings. I will swear that I believe it went on that day. but I cannot swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. These pieces of muslin you see at Fellows and Myers's that was in consequence of a catalogue to be sold there? - Yes. and also an amount of it in the prisoner's own writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Fellows and Myers are brokers and auctioneers, of course they sell every thing that they do sell openly? - They do.</p>
               <p>Q. So public and open that it was expressed in the catalogue when it was to be sold? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore all the world might have known as well as you what it was to be sold? - Yes, they might.</p>
               <p>Q. Now these two pieces of muslin, how long might you have had them in your shop before? - Perhaps a couple of months.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of muslin is it? - Plain India muslin, marked in my own hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say there was some Irish linen found in a box up stairs, in Bond-street, I believe the prisoner at the bar did not go up stairs with you? - Yes, he did, he shewed us the boxes, and denied there was any thing in them.</p>
               <p>Q. But he shewed you the boxes? -He did.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he was the very means of detecting himself.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you? - A broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - In Aldersgate-street. On the first of October the prisoner came to our house, I was at home, he enquired when we should have a sale of linen goods, that he had been in trade in the country, he had kept a shop, that he had left off business with an intent to go to America, he had brought the stock in trade to town, or a part, I am not sure which, and it was at Mr. Dudding and Richardson's, in Oxford-street, at whose house he resided till the ship should fail; he then said he had been recommended by his friends to sell part of his stock in trade, and he was recommended to our house to dispose of it; he had brought two pieces of muslin with him, and he would send the remainder in the evening, or in the following morning, and he said he should have occasion for some money, and asked me if I would let him have ten guineas, five I gave him that evening, and five on the following day; he sent the remainder of the goods that evening, and called the next<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280105"></xptr>day about noon, he enquired whether it would be best to sell them privately or publicly, I told him, that from the nature of the goods, they would go to more advantage in a public sale; he agreed that it should be so, the only objection he had to it, he was fearful the ship would fail before the goods would be sold, and he should not have time to receive the balance, I told him, that I did not think it would make any odds, as he had friends in town, we would pay the balance to them; we put them in a public sale, and had the catalogue printed. He told us he should be every day on the change to see the captain to know when the ship would fail, and that if we wanted him we might see him at the New York coffee-house, or at No. 24, Bond-street. On Tuesday after, we sent him a catalogue at the New York coffee-house, marked in the margin against such lots as were his property. He called on that day at our counting house, and asked me whether I thought the goods were likely to sell well, I told him there was no doubt of it, as there had been catalogues distributed all over the town, the goods had been advertised, and many had been to view them. He then asked me if I would let him have twenty pounds, as a further advance, he said he had occasion to buy some necessaries for his voyage.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you advance him more? - Nineteen guineas. When he wrote the receipt, he went away, and I see no more of him till he was in custody at Bow-street. The following morning, Wednesday, Mr. Crook came to my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say that this man consented, since it was more to his advantage that these things should be sold by public sale? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in a very extensive way I believe? - We do a deal of business.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you his fair directions either at Bond-street, or at the New York coffee-house? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding these catalogues and advertisements, which go to this man's master among the rest, he came to you afterwards? - Yes, he did. When he signed the receipt, he did not sign it in the name of Stevenson, but in the name of

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a taylor, No. 29, Brewer-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever bring any thing to you? - Yes, in the months of August and September, several pieces of callico at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces might he bring you in all, did he bring you five? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy it of him? - Yes. I gave him a fair price, I gave him altogether six or seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whereabouts you gave him for each piece? - About four or five and twenty shillings, and some two and twenty shillings and a guinea, I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept the callico ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I take it for granted he brought them at separate times? - He did.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Produce the property taken at his lodgings? - Eighteen pieces of muslin, worth sixty pounds, in some my marks are totally cut off, and he has put another mark on them, but I can trace my hand writing on some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What would you give for the lowest piece of muslin there? - About five and forty shillings. Twenty-eight muslin handkerchiefs, with my own marks on it, my own hand writing on it, though he has endeavoured to erase it; three pieces of cambrick, I would give ten pounds for them; I would give four pounds a piece for the Irish linen; and here is some huckaback besides, I believe them all to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Myers. Have you got all the things described in this paper? - Yes, I have, two pieces of muslin.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is the very piece I originally missed, with my own land writing on it, they are worth more than ten pounds together.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the other things at Mr. Myers's? - I have, I am perfectly convinced they are all mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the callico produced by the taylor? - It was a lot that was damaged, and they are marked half a yard over, it is the custom of our house to mark them so, I don't know that it is the custom of other houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that such property was missing from your house? - No, I could not, we have such a quantity of callico; I believe it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor, at the time that he took me, told me that he would not prosecutor me if I would confess.</p>
               <p>Court. Every part of this case is a case of facts, I have stopped every word of confession.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an established labourer in Saint Katha<lb></lb>rine's Dock, in the tea warehouse, letter C. On the 10th of October I was on the fourth floor—I saw the prisoner on the floor, and, believe that he had no business there, I watched him, and saw him go round some chests that were lying on the floor, for people to examine—I saw him sit down, take off his hat, and put tea into a yellow silk handkerchief in his hat, three several times—I waited till he returned to the staircase, and then rushed out from where I had concealed myself, and seized him—we struggled—I called for assistance, and the prisoner with his left hand, took his hat of, and scattered the tea on the floor—I was thrown against a pile of goods but I never lost hold of him till the arrival of the superintendent, into whose hands I gave him—it is a customary things for people who are entitled to it, to take a little tea for a sample, but they must have an order—he was not entitled to do it without an order.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a nurse in the service of Mr. Joseph Oliver, of Wilton-house, Greenwich—on Saturday, 7th February, about a quarter after 3 in the afternoon, I came down stairs with a little child and saw the street-door open—on going out I saw the prisoner leaning in at the dining-room window, as if in the act of reaching something—the window was wide open; it had previously been closed—I asked her if she had spoken to any one—we said, "Yes, she had seen a young person"—she looked very confused, and then addressed the little boy I had with me, and told him that he knew her—I said, "I don't think you know her"—she said, "Oh yes, he knosubpœnaed</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Mr. Oliver—I went into the dining-room on this Saturday afternoon, about 3 o'clock, and opened the window about three inches at the top, leaving it closed at the bottom—I saw the prisoner then outside the gate, looking over it—I left the room; the street-door was then shut—about three minutes afterwards I heard the bell ring, and found the nurse at the street-door with the prisoner—the nurse called to the cook that the window was open at the bottom; I ran and found it open, and the street-door also—I found two linen tablecloths and one table-cover gone—the prisoner must have got in at the window and gone out at the door—there was a basket in the hall, just home from the laundry, and the linen table cloths were taken from the top of it; the table cover was taken from a chair in the dining-room where it had been folded up—a plated spirit-stand had been removed from the end of the sideboard to the centre—behind the curtains I found a bag of scent on the Sunday morning; that had been in Mrs. Oliver's desk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> At first you said the cloths were taken out of the side<lb></lb>board? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I thought they were at first—I saw some footmarks of gravel all along to where the table cloths had been folded up.</p>

The prisoner was given into my charge—I compared the prisoner's shoes with the footmarks on the carpet, and they exactly corresponded—the marks were on the carpet from the side-board to the window, and also coming out of the hall-door—the prisoner was carrying an empty basket.</p>

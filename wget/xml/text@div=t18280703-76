On the 15th of June, at five o'clock in the morning, I put my watch on the shelf, between two large pickling jars; I went out to work, and when I returned at night it was gone - there was not a soul in the house all day; I went to my son, and told him I had lost it - the prisoner's sister, Ann, came the next morning, and I accused her of stealing it; she put her hands together, and fell a crying, and said she was innocent; I said, "Who was here yesterday" - she said, "My sister Jane." On the 15th, (which was Sunday,) the prisoner was there and breakfasted; I got an officer, and went to the prisoner's father, and she was taken - she said, "It was my sister, Ann, stole the watch, or else how could she buy those clothes on Sunday morning;" I said, "You impudent hussey, how could she take it when I had it on Monday?" she then told me where it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He lives with my sister, and she goes out every night to help to support him; she told me to take watch to Mr. Newman's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does her sister live in the house with you? A. No - she comes to make my bed, and to wash up; I never slept with her in my life - she is nothing but a bad girl; they are a bad breed; I have only been there about a year and a half - I might perhaps get an honest woman to make my bed, but I seldom see the girl; she goes out on the town, but the bed is generally made when I go home - if not, I make it myself. I was robbed of some fowls once, and was here once - I never was at Clerkenwell, nor any where else for thieving; I am surprised you should ask me such a thing - I am quite angry that you should think I had been there, Do you think I look like a thief? I have never seen any of my family there - none of them have ever gone abroad.</p>

            . In November, 1820, I lived servant to Mr. Williams, Edmund-place, Aldersgate-street; he was a baker. I employed the prisoner to make my dresses, as I knew her sister. On the 11th of November, 1820, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, she came to me, and said a man had followed her from my master's house, saying, that he would be a bankrupt in two days, and that my clothes were not safe in the house, and if I would give them to her she would take care of them. I gave her the articles stated in the indictment; - she said she was going to take them to No. 2, Lower Coleman-street, Bunhill-row - I knew she lived there. I went after them two days after, and she had absconded. I never saw them or her till the 19th of this month - I lived at my place seven months - she never came to me - I believe my master was a bankrupt about August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. She brought you home five dresses the day before - A. One; she had made me five. Her father offered to do all he could to settle it, this was before she was in custody.</p>

            , my husband's Christian name is James, I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment, which were worth more than they are there valued; they were taken out of the house on the 21st of February, between seven and eight in the morning, I had some of them the night before, and the prisoner folded them up, and the rest were all in the back parlour: I am sure the striped petticoat was there the night before, and the spoons and my cloak, I missed nothing else at that time, the prisoner left me to fetch some wood to light the fire, and did not return; she was a nurse to me; after she had been gone half an hour my husband got up, and the first things we missed, were the spoons, and then we saw one drawer open, and nothing in it, and we looked further, and found all the things gone that are specified.</p>

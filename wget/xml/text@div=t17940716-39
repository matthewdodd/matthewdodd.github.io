               <p>On the 5th of last July, I was coming to town from Pinner, a little before nine o'clock, just as I entered <placeName id="t17940716-39-crimeloc199">Harrow Hill-common</placeName>

There was a lady in the chaise along with me; I gave him about ten shillings; give me your watch, he says; I told him I had never a watch; he says, d-mn you, I know you have a watch, or some thing to that purpose, make haste and give it me, or else I will blow your brains out. I pulled my watch out and gave it, it was a silver watch with a steel chain, two gold seals, one with the impression of a head, and the other my own name in a cypher. After I had given my watch they turned up the hill, and went back again the way they came; they had both dark handkerchiefs over their faces, and both dressed in dark clothes, both in black, I took them to be. I see my watch again at Bow-street, on the Thursday after I was robbed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Albion-place, St. John's-lane, Clerkenwell; I am a carpenter. On the morning of the 6th of Jan., about four o'clock, I went to a house in Field-lane to inquire for something which I had lost—I saw the prisoner there—I had never seen him before—we smoked together, and I gave him something to drink—I had some other dealings with him about a handkerchief—I afterwards went with him to another house in Hol<lb></lb>boun, and had some rum, which I paid for—I then went to another house, and I had a cup of tea, but he had not—I was going to stop there, but he was not—he called me to the door—I went to the door to him—he got hold of me by the collar, and another man came up and struck me—the prisoner then struck me down, put his hand into my left trowsers' pocket, and took out a sovereign and a half-sovereign—he cursed me, and said, if I did not give him the shilling that I had taken from him, he would break my d—d neck—(I had had no shilling of him)—he kicked me, and hit me in the face—he gave me two black eyes, and cut my face—I got from him as soon as I could, and ran down Holborn—I told the officer—I had done nothing to the prisoner—I thought he was a decent sort of a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>—I did not think he was what he is—I am quite certain that when I went into that house I had my sovereign and half-sovereign safe.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 233.) I received information of this robbery about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th of Jan.—I went down Field-lane with the prosecutor—he described the house and the party to me—I did not find the prisoner then—I took him about six o'clock in the evening—I found nothing on him but a latch-key—I saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor's face was covered with blood—he had got one black eye, and his face was swollen a little—in taking the prisoner to the station he said he was an unlucky b----, that he only came out on Saturday.</p>

Last Monday was a fortnight, as I was going across a field that leads up to my house, by myself, at about nine at night at the upper end of the field, about two or three hundred yards from my own house, I was stopped by two men, one of them was the prisoner; the other man had a pistol; the prisoner had something like a hanger. They demanded my money; I told them, I had none; they made answer, I had; the prisoner said, you have a watch then, and clapped his hand to my pocket, and took out my watch; then the other said, you have got some money somewhere, and began searching me; he searched my breeches and waistcoat, and coat pockets, and took out a linen handkerchief, and then they bid me go home, and say nothing, and they would see me in. I went home as fast as I could: I alarmed the house, and pursued them that night, but could not take them. The prisoner was taken by Justice Fielding's man a week after; I knew him by sight before, there was a moon a quarter old, it was light enough to know any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to distinguish a face?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. O yes, I could know any body</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. No, nor handkerchief. I am very confident in my own mind he is the man; if I had any matter of doubt I would not say so. I had seen him many times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. Yes, as sober as I am now.</p>

            . I am a journeyman weaver, I live at Bethnal-green; the prisoner worked with me in the picking and quilting in our way; he worked very regularly; he had worked with me a fortnight when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make no holidays in that time?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. No, not one.</p>
               <p>Q. Not of a Monday?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. No. On Monday the 2d of October, the day he is charged with committing the robbery on, he was with me from between two and three in the afternoon till eight o'clock at night, in Wentworth-street, at the end of Rose-lane; he went out with me and another man who works with me, in the afternoon between two and three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Instead of working you went out together?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. We had a little business out, we went to the other man's mother-in-law in Wentworth-street, and there we had a pot of beer; from thence we went with that man to Rag-fair to buy some things for his eldest boy, he was going to britch him; it was after seven o'clock when we came from Rag-fair; and when we came home where I parted from him, it was after eight o'clock. He lodges in Wentworth street, the corner of George-yard, at one Mr. Maynard's. We parted at the end of Rose-lane. I got home about the hour of nine. I believe my house is a mile from Rose lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it full nine when you got home?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. Yes, rather after nine. This gentleman swore before the justice that he was robbed at half after eight, and it is above a mile and a half from Rose-lane to Bishop Bonner's. This young man had no money when he came to work next morning, and had no money all the week, but what he had of me, nor hardly a shoe to his foot; I should suppose if he had stole a watch he would have made money of it.</p>

            . The prisoner worked with me at Godfrey's; he picked for us both. Upon the second of October he was with me and Godfrey, and my wife, at my wife's mother's all the afternoon. We went with my mother-in-law to see after some money that was owing to her by a person; I don't know his name; It is in an alley in Wellclose-square, facing the Black Horse; my mother went in, and we waited at the Black Horse for her; we drank a couple of pots of beer, and staid there till after six; then we all went back to my mother-in-law's, in Wentworth-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180015"></xptr> the prisoner and Godfrey then went away; I don't know where they parted.</p>

About half an hour after we had parted at my mother-in-law's I met the prisoner in Rose-lane going home to his lodgings; I bid him good night, and saw no more of him till he came to work next morning.</p>

            , the wife of the last witness, who was with the prisoner and her husband at Wellclose Square and Rosemary lane, confirmed her husband's evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. You told me on your evidence that you was robbed about nine o'clock. Did you always say it was about nine?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. A witness here says, that you said before the justice it was half after eight?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you could swear to the person of the other man?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I don't think I could. I took most notice of this man; his face struck me; it was not many minutes over or under nine o'clock; I had been with some friends upon the green; I pulled out my watch there, and it wanted a quarter of nine: I then said it was time for me to be at home, and went away. Just as I got in the fields, the church clocks began to began to strike nine: I heard several of them strike.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any clock in your house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes. I did not look at it but rung the bell, and called my men out immediately to pursue them.</p>

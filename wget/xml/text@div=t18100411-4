             was found guilty of stealing - A. On the 14th of October last we got a search warrant and went to the prisoner's husband's house in Stepney Green; the prisoner lived in it; the house is in Stepney Green, we found her there. On searching her house we found a coat and some flannel, and a duplicate of the shirts; the coat and the flannel were in a box in the bed-room, and the duplicate was in a small tin box, in a larger one, in the cupboard, in the bed room. She denied that the things were my father's, (his name is James Jackson) she said her husband bought them at Liverpool, and from there brought them to London. We took her with us to Mr. Dexters in Whitechapel-road, the pawnbrokers, we found the shirts marked James Jackson.</p>

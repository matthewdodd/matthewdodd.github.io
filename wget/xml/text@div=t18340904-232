The prisoners used to clean my room, but they had no regular occupation - I admitted them to my room from kindness - I am not in any business - they were out of situations - while they were there, I missed all this property from the back room second floor - some was in boxes, some in drawers - on the 29th of June, during their absence, I discovered some boxes opened, and on their return, I named several articles that were taken, but I had not examined the boxes from the time I came there, which was the 29th of April - (Ellen helped me to move) - they were in my room during my absence - the property was found in their apartment - Ellen went to a situation, I understand, on the Tuesday preceding - they had left my place without notice - when I came home on Sunday, the 29th of June, Margaret was gone - I had been out to dinner, and left her there, and came back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did not you desire Ellen to seek for another place? A. She was seeking for a situation all the time she was with me - I have a sister named Mrs. Hance, whom I lived with before I came to where I am now - she did not come backwards and forwards to my lodging, to my knowledge, nor any of her family - I left my sister because she left her house - I never charged my sister with any thing in particular - I may have missed thing during the time I was there - I do not think I charged her with robbing me - I swear to the best of my knowledge I did not - I lost things - I did not charge her with breaking open my boxes - Hance was not at my apartments, to my knowledge - the apartments were in the care of the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On Friday, the 4th of July, I went to Great Charlton-street, Somers'-town - I found the two prisoners lodging there - they came home about ten o'clock - Ellen opened the street door - I crossed the road, and said to Margaret, "I want you: where is Ellen?" - she turned round; I said, "Ellen, I want to speak to you also; it is very particular what I wish to tell you, will you walk a few yards with me? I want you about the Edgeware-road business" - they looked at each other, and said nothing - I said to Margaret, "You have no shawl on, would you wish to go home for one?" she said not - I said, I must take them to the station-house - I said,"Mrs. Wyatt says she saw you come out on Sunday night with a bundle each" - Ellen said, "It is false, we had no bundle, it was only this small basket, I had nothing else"- I said, "You went home in a cab" - they said, "Yes, we saw an empty cab in the New-road, and called it" - on getting to the station-house, I searched her basket, and found a piece of ribbon, two watch-hooks, and one custard cup - I found two keys, one of the street door, and one of their room - I went next morning to their room with the prosecutrix, and, on opening a box, I found all this property, which Mrs. Archer identifies - I found twenty-one duplicates in their boxes not relating to the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Ellen say the box you found the property in, was intrusted to her by Mrs. Archer? A. No; she was not present - she said nothing of the sort at the office.</p>

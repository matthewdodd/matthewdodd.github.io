               <p>Street, Lambeth—about 1 o'clock the two prisoners came in—after a few minutes, I and Davey opened the folding-doors and went into the back parlour—Montague was standing close by the mantel piece with a quantity of loose florins and shillings; some were loose and some wrapped up in paper—as we went in he dropped two on the floor—I picked them up and asked how he accounted for these—he said "I know nothing about them"—I asked Amies the same question! he also said "I know nothing about them"—I then took possession of the coins—on the mantel piece there were 86 florins, 31 shillings, and 10 half-crowns, some loose and others wrapped in paper, with paper between each coin—I had been there previously, about 11.30, and examined the room very minutely, and, there was no bad money about then—I found on Montague 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. good money; 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of that was in sixpences.</p>

I was with Micklejohn when the prisoners came in—after listening two minutes I heard the unwrapping of the paper, and the sound of money, and talking—we then opened the folding doors and went in—I saw Montague drop two florins from his hands—I took Amies, and told him he was charged with having a quantity of counterfeit coin for the purpose of concealing the same—he said "I know nothing about it"—I found on the hob of the fire-place this bag, containing 28 crown pieces wrapped in paper, in three packets, and 11 half-crowns in another packet, with paper between each coin—I found on Amies 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Chapman, of 11, Royal Street, Lambeth—on Tuesday, 16th January, the two prisoners came there; Montague asked to look at a bed room that I had to let—I showed it him—he said it was not for him, it was for his brother-in-law, and he thought it would do very nicely—the rent was to be 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and he was to pay the rent in advance—Amies paid the rent for the first week—he said he should require a key, for he was engaged at theatres in the evening, and he should not be home till late—he came again about 6 o'clock for the key—I asked his name; he said "Joe Amies"—I said "Where do you work?"—he said "At the South London"—he slept there that night—next morning he went out about 9 o'clock—about 10 o'clock I went into his room to do it up—I left the bed all right—Amies came in about 1 o'clock, and between 1 and 4 o'clock—he was in and out three times—he left the bed-room door open—about 4 o'clock I went in to tidy the room, I saw the pillows had been re<lb></lb>moved and the bed disturbed—I went and removed the things, and between the matrass and palliasse I saw two little black bags, I felt them, there was money in them—one bag was open, so I took out a package, and it con<lb></lb>tained four florins—I put everything back as I had found it, and left it there till my husband came home about 6 o'clock—I then shewed him the money, and left it there again all right, Amies came in between 3 and 8 o'clock, and went out again very soon after—my husband went out to give information—when he came back we went into the room, and the black bags were then gone—Amies came home about 1.30 in the morning, and went out about 10 o'clock—I again cleared up his room—I looked round and found nothing then—about 1 o'clock in the day, the two prisoners came in together—at that time the officers were waiting in the front parlour,</p>

               <p>and after a short time they went into the other room—no one but myself had gone into that room while the prisoner was out—I thought the money was bad when I looked at it.</p>

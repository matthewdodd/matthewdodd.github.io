                  </hi>. My husband's name is William; we live at Stratford. On 20th Jan., I went to Mr. Scott's shop, and made some purchases—I had a half sovereign, which I laid on the counter while I went and held a piece of bacon to be cut—I put the half sovereign on the counter towards Jane Scott, who was serving me—the prisoner was in the shop very near to me, and no one else but Miss Scott and myself—when the bacon had been cut I turned round to pay for it, and the half sovereign was gone—I spoke to Miss Scott about it; I thought she must have taken it up, and put it in the till—she said she had not taken it; she had no gold at all—the prisoner had bought a piece of pork, and was trying to get out of the shop as soon as she could, but she first turned her pocket out, and said all she had was 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was before she was accused of taking the half sovereign—she said she must go home to prepare her husband's dinner, and left.</p>

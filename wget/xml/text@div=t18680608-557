                  </hi>. I live at 2, Carr Street, Millwall—I am foreman to Mr. William McArthur &amp; Co., ship breakers, of Clyde Wharf, Millwall—we have lost several pintles similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I missed some at 6 o'clock on the morning of 23rd April—I had seen them safe the night before, at 6 o'clock, attached to the rudder of a schooner—the rudder was unshipped, and made fast to the wharf by a chain—I recognize these pintles as ours—they fit into the rudder; the holes correspond—they are worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., old metal—I gave information to the police.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames Police Inspector</hi>). On Friday, 24th April, about 11.30, I went to the prisoner's premises with another constable—he keeps a marine store dealer's shop, at East Greenwich—I saw him in the shop, and said, "Are you Mr. Robinson, the master of this shop?"—he said, "I am"—I said, "I am an inspector of police, and I wish to know what metal you have bought within the last two days"—he said, "That is all the metal I have bought," showing me some pieces of old metal—I said, "Are you quite sure that is all you have bought?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Then will you allow me to look over your premises?"—he said, "Yes, but before I allow you to look, how am I to know that you are what you say you are?"—I showed him my warrant-card—I was in plain clothes at the time—he said, "Very well, now you can look"—I went into a room at the back of the shop, and in a bag, amongst other metal, I found six</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186806080087"></xptr>
               <p>metal bolts, which I produce—I said, "How long have you had these bolts?"—he said, "I have had them some time, I bought them with other old metal"—I then went into a shed in the back yard, and underneath several bundles of rags in one corner, I found these metal pintles—I said, "These are what I am looking for; how do you account for having these? they have been stolen"—he began crying, and said, "I wish I had told you the truth at first; I bought them of a man, I do not know his name, but I believe he is a dredgerman"—I said, "What did you give for them?"—he said, "3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "Have you got anymore, because I intend making further search"—he said, "Yes, but do forgive me"—I then went into the back of the shop, and from the middle of a large heap of rags, the prisoner pulled out a metal bearing, weighing nearly three-quarters of a hundredweight—he said, "There, that is all I hare got, so help me God! now you can search the house freely"—I asked him where he got it from; he said "Of the same man"—I then went upstairs, and found a bag of new nails—I asked him how much he gave for the metal—he said, "I gave 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the pintles, and nearly 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the bearing; I can't say to a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I asked him if he had made any entry in his books of having bought such things—he said, "No"—he showed me his books, and there was no entry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not he tell you that he bought them of a man named Blackmore? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; his wife said so, and she gave his address—that was after the prisoner was in custody—I do not think he was present—he might have told me the man's name after his wife had given it to me—I went to the address she gave me, and found a man named Blackmore had been living there, and had absconded—I know that the prisoner has issued handbills offering a reward for the apprehension of Blackmore—before I took him to the station he offered to take me to the man's house, although he could not recollect the address—I did not go with him, because he was then in my custody, and I thought it proper to take him to the station—Blackmore is a dredgerman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 56, Drary-lane, and am a traveller. I went to bed about 11 o'clock on the night of 15th November, at my own residence—between 1 and 2 o'clock next morning, I saw the prisoner on the first floor landing—there were two females with him—they were coming up-strairs making a noise—I got out of my bed and looked at them—they were making a great disturbance, and the female who has the shop below got up and told them to be quiet—the prisoner rushed towards her—I got out and took hold of the prisoner on the landing—he was ill-treating the woman—he assaulted her, and I took hold of him to prevent him-with that he kicked me all about my body and my legs—I let him go—I then laid hold of him again, and put him on his back—he then took something out of his pocket, and stabbed me in my hand—he made my hand bleed—he also cut me on my nose and made a gash—I let him go, and he ran up-stairs to the back room on the third floor, and locked himself in—a policeman came, and I and the policeman went up-stairs after him—we had to open the two back room doors on the third floor to get him—I went to the hospital, and had my wounds dressed—they bled very much—the cut on my hand is not well—it waa a very bad cut.</p>

I took the prisoners, and on the top of Turner's house I found this lead against the trap-door; I matched it with what remained in the gutter, it corresponds exactly; there was some other lead cut and rolled, but not quite separated; I found a knife on Blackbeard, the edge of which was very bright; they said they were employed by Mr. Johnson; I asked if they meant Johnson the builder; they said, No.</p>

The prisoner came to my shop, and bought a leg of mutton, which came to 5s. 6d.; he tendered a 1l. note, which my housekeeper took from him in my presence. I asked him for his address - He said his name was Brown, and that he lived at No.6, Green's-court, which is about two hundred yards from my house. I wrote it on the note immediately (looking at it)-this is it. On Tuesday morning I found it was a bad one. I went to No.6, Green's-court-there was no person of that name there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. On the Sunday following he came about the same time, bought a leg of lamb, and tendered me another 1l. note. I knew him again immediately, and asked his address. He said his name was Childs, and he lived at No. 6, Green's-Court. I said, "How is that? why, you have changed your name since last Sunday!" he said he had not; I told him he had, for he bought a leg of mutton of me last Sunday, and paid me with a bad note, He at first denied it, but afterwards said he did. I told him I thought the second note was also bad. He asked to look at it - I returned it to him, and he paid me for the lamb. He asked me to let him see the first note, which I gave him - He then had both notes, and held them in his hand. I 
               <persName id="t18180909-57-person523">drew</persName>
             the first note out of his hand, and said I must have it. He said he would give me the money for it if I would go with him. I refused to let him have the lamb, as he seemed confused. I went to Green's-court with him. As we went along, he offered to go into a public-house and treat me - I refused. When we got to Green's-court, he at first looked on one side and then on the other. I asked him what he was looking for? he said he did not exactly know where No. 6 was. We got almost to the end of the court. I said I thought it very strange that he should give his address at No. 6, and not know where it was. He then said that his brother once lived there, and that if I would go home with him he would give me the money for the note. I asked him where? he said he lived in Crown-street. We turned to go there, but I took him to Crown-court, as I knew a butcher who lived there. I told him I should go no farthnr, took him into custody, and sent for a constable, who searched him. The note which he offered me for the lamb was not found on him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing said to him about the note not being found - A. He said I had not returned it to him - I am certain that I did, and he did not give it back to me. He was stripped at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not return silver for one of them - A. He had but 18d. in his pocket, which he took out of the note, and said he had no more silver. He gave me none.</p>

            , ESQ. I live in Bloomsbury-square. On the evening of the 1st of June, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was returning home, and as I entered <placeName id="t18200628-42-crimeloc235">Hyde-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18200628-42-crimeloc235" type="placeName" value="Hyde-street"></interp>

I continued to pass on, and as I approached, the prisoner, who was nearest to the houses, got on the step between me and the houses, which placed him rather above me. This circumstance drew my attention towards him, and enables me to recollect his person. There was sufficient light from the lamps, I could distinctly see his person and dress. I put my hand on my seals to conceal them, and at that moment he made a rush at me, caught hold of my watch-chain, which was between my watch and my hand, and with great force tore my chain from my watch - at that instant I was violently pushed or knocked down by his companions behind. The the force that was used threw me on the pavement. I let go my seals and fell on the pavement with great force. The seals and chain had been separated from my watch just before, and on my letting go they fell on the pavement. My small-clothes were torn from my fob about six or eight inches down with the violence, and my watch lifted about four inches from my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the chain was separated from your watch, had you the seals in your hand - A. I had. As I fell I drew part of the chain out of the prisoner's hand, and let go myself at the same time - I instantly got up and picked them up. I saw one of his companions, and immediately called Watch! they came round me and threatened me, but I continued to call. The watchman came up, and I told him to take the man I first saw on rising. I turned round to the others, recognized the prisoner, and charged him with being the person who seized my chain - he immediately ran away, but was stopped.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is no proof that the prisoner ever had complete possession of the chain or seals. It is only an attempt to rob, though it is very near being a highway robbery.</p>

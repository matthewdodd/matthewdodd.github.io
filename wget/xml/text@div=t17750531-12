I believe, Whittle was the man who pulled the pistol out of his breast; and I believe Barker was the man who received the money: as to Higgs, I have no remembrance: of his person at all; but one of the four, I remember very well, had a striped waistcoat, which Higgs had on when he was carried to the justice's. Upon my giving them the silver that I had in my pocket, they d - d me, and asked me, what I meant by giving them a few shillings, and swore that I had more money, and more they would have; upon which I gave them two guineas; still they wanted more: I said, I had no more, upon which they said, they must have my watch. I said, it was but a metal watch, and would be of very little value and of no use to them: but they insisted upon having it, and they took it from me: they then bid me go on and not look back; if I did, they would blow my brains out. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310032"></xptr> next day, which was Sunday, I gave a description of them at justice Wilmot's office. The woman I had passed by, was close to me when they were robbing me; they took no notice of her at all. The man with the striped waistcoat on, was the outside of the four, and the woman passed close to me.</p>


               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it?</p>
               <p>Watlington. The moon was hardly up, and it was still daylight; it was a public path that I was walking along, and you may see a good way along it, there were passengers both before and behind, and some of them were in that very field; but I believe they were not near enough to see. The next day, at justice Wilmot's, I swore to Whittle and Barker. Whittle said, at the justice's, that he was not guilty, but he knew who was, and told me what I was robbed of within a shilling, and that the watch was sold for half a guinea; that he had the information from one Mich and three others, that came to the sign of the Dog, in Shoreditch; who said, they had robbed a gentleman in Hackney Fields. This was on the Monday, the day but one after the robbery. I verify believe the prisoners to be the men.</p>

            . I live at Hackney, I take in washing. On the 6th of May, I saw four young men in a field beyond the Goldsmith's Alms houses; one had a striped waistcoat, who I believe, to be the prisoner Higgs: but as to Barker, I am not positive; as to Whittle, I am very positive he was one, and I was positive to him when I first saw him. Mr. Watlington was coming along the field. I heard them say to him, he must deliver his money, or he was a dead man. I saw Whittle pull out a pistol, and when I saw this, I was as near as I am to your lordship. Being frightened, I walked off directly, as soon as I saw the pistol. I saw nobody else till I got to the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton, two fields off, this field was a large field, and day light was not shut in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Charles Samuels, a tailor, of No. 29, Ludgate-hill. On 16th July, about half past 8 o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came in—Sullivan asked to look at a coat—I called Lewis, a shopman, who showed him several—I watched them, and saw Carroll stoop down, they then picked out a coat, left a shilling deposit, and were about to depart when I saw a coat hanging from under Carroll's dress—that was not the coat on which the deposit had been paid—it dragged on the floor after her as she moved—the greater part of it was hidden—the part which was visible had these two tickets on it, which are ours—the shilling deposit was handed from the female to the male prisoner—I gave them both in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salesman to Mr. Samuels. I saw the prisoners come in together, and was called to attend to them—I showed them several coats, Sullivan selected one, and paid a shilling deposit on it, making the excuse that it required a slight alteration—as they left, and I saw the ticket of a coat hanging from under Carroll's dress, I called Mr. Seacombe's attention to it, followed them, and stopped Carroll just as she was getting to the door—she said that she had nothing belonging to us, but after some struggling I got this coat from her; it was under her frock, but I cannot say how it was fastened up—I drew it from under her dress—it appeared to be between her dress and petticoat—it is not the coat on which the shilling deposit was paid.</p>

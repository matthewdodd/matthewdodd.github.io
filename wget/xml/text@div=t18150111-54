            . I am a constable. On the 22nd of December, I was in Rosemary-lane, I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner running: he turned up Haye's-court, where there was no thoroughfare, there I took him. I searched him; he had these three pistols under his coat, which I now produce. I asked the prisoner where he got the pistols; he said from the Tower. I took him to the watchhouse. I produce the pistols; I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>MR. BELLIS. I am a master furbisher of the Tower. I have the care of the Amoury in the Tower. When I came to look at the Amoury I found four pistols gone. This is one of the pistols belonging to the Amoury in the Tower. I believe they are the property of the King; it has the King's mark on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am guilty, therefore I leave it to the mercy of the court.</p>

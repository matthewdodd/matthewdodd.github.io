On the 7th of September, between one and two o'clock in the day time, I heard a strange step in the house on the stairs - we have a side-door and a front-door; the stairs are enclosed by a door which comes into the shop - I ran to the front-door to see who was coming out; I pretty well know the steps of the inmates of the house, and I saw the prisoner come out of the side-door opening into the court, with a bag on his shoulder - that door is kept on the latch; I cannot positively say it was not open when he came in; it might have been left unlatched by accident - he had a blue bag on his shoulder; I called to my mother - there is a house exactly facing the end of the court - I followed the prisoner up the lane, and when I got to the end of the lane he turned round to look, and then turned towards Cripplegate-buildings - I spoke to a gentleman to stop him; he then threw the bag down at a public-house door, and ran away; I pursued him closely, crying,"Stop thief" - he was stopped once or twice, but resisted; he was stopped at the bottom of Hart-street; I never lost sight of him - I had seen the blue bag safe in the house about two hours before, it was in the two-pair back-room; I did not know the contents of it, but I know it was full of things - the door of the room it was kept in, was locked and padlocked; I kept the key and had it then - I found the door of that room ajar on going up, the hasp of the padlock was drawn out, and I suppose the lock must have been picked by a false key; the lock was not at all injured, we can lock it still - I had both the keys in my possession - my mother is a widow, and keeps the house.</p>

On the night of the 21st of April my house was broken into - I had examined all the doors and windows before I went to bed, and they were secure - I was the last person up; I was alarmed about two o'clock in the morning - I got up, and found the trunks in my daughter's bed-room rummaged, and all the things out of their places; the greater part of the things were scattered about, and some were taken away - my daughter had alarmed me; there was a watch missing from her bedroom - I gave an alarm; two officers got over into my yard, and after that I went down stairs and found the pannel of my back door had been removed by a centre-bit; it was quite safe the night before - the hole was sufficiently large for a man to come through, but the door was open when I got down; I missed a hat, which I had worn the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160048"></xptr>day before - I had had it in common wear for about three months, and bought it at Kirkness; it hung up in my passage the night before: I had come home about nine o'clock, and hung it up - I am not positive as to the exact time. I went with the officers in two or three days, and saw a hat in the George, George-yard, Whitechapel, on the prisoner's head - he was in a back room of the house, playing at cards; when I saw him there, I said to the officer, "That is my hat," but not loud enough to be heard by the prisoner - I looked at it while it was on his head, and as soon as I looked at it I made that observation; the hat was then moved from his head - I looked inside it, and perceived the lining had been changed, and that it had a different lining in it when it was stolen; I looked at it, but did not take it into my hands - it was returned to the prisoner: from what I observed of it I felt convinced it was mine, as I do now - he was not apprehended then; I did not let him know that I believed it to be mine - an old hat, a fur cap, a stick, and a small crow-bar were left on my premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do I understand you did not wish to excite the prisoner's suspicion? A. Yes; the officer taking his hat off might have done so. but I understand something passed after, which lulled his suspicion; he was not then asked how he came by it - I did not say it was mine loud enough for him to hear; I did not see him again till he was apprehended, which was four, five, or six weeks after the robbery. I know Morgan - the hat has not been traced to his possession; he is a hatter - I have seen him on the subject of this hat: he swore the lining now in it was once his.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you see the hat after he was apprehended? A. It was brought to my house by the officer the day he was apprehended.</p>

On the night of the robbery I was alarmed by two persons in my room; that was not the thieves - the thieves were not in my room, they were just outside the door; I did not hear any thing, but the boxes and trunks, which stood just outside the door, were all turned out - by that I say the thieves were just outside the room; I heard a noise about two o'clock - I did not awake my father: I had a sister in the house - I was in the habit of brushing my father's hat; he had had it about three months: I should know it again; I used to brush it every morning.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. Three or four evenings after this robbery I went with Mr. Newton to the the George, George-yard, Whitechapel, with Shellswell - the prisoner was in a room, playing at cards; Mr. Newton went into the room, and directly he saw the prisoner I heard him say, "That is my hat that is on his head;" he said so to us - the prisoner could not hear it; Shellswell took it off the prisoner's head - Newton looked at it, and said he had no doubt of it, but it had got a fresh lining; that was not loud enough for the prisoner to hear - the bat was returned to him. I apprehended him on the 27th of May, in a room in George-street, not fifty yards from this public-house - he was sitting by the fire, nearly undressed - he dressed himself, and put on a hat, which was on the table; I told him I took him on a charge of robbery - I did not mention this particular charge: here is the hat which he put on - when we got to the office, but not before the Magistrate, I asked him where he got that hat; I had not then informed him of this particular charge - he said,"I don't know where I got it - it has been looked at before;" when he came up on the second examination, (he had been examined on this charge then) I told him Mr. Newton claimed the hat which he had on his head; I asked him where he got it - he said he bought it of a hawker at Crawley, near Brighton, Sussex.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear he said he did not know where he got the hat? A. He said in a careless sort of way, "I don't know where I got it;" those were his words; after his examination I interrogated him again - that was not for the purpose of making a case out against him particularly; it was not to extort a contradiction - I did not caution him, or tell him what he said would be stated in Court; he was taken about a month after he was at the George - the hat was returned to him at the George; I did not intend him to know I had any charge against him when I was at the George; we whispered together, out of his hearing - one Morgan was examined before the Magistrate; I told him to come there by the Magistrate's order - what he said was not taken down; he was examined in the prisoner's presence, and identified the hat lining.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I accompanied Lea to the George at eight or nine o'clock in the evening, a few days after Mr. Newton's robbery - I found the prisoner sitting in a room; after looking at him for a minute or two. Newton said, "That is my hat; I think that is my hat;" he said it to me, not loud - he spoke to me first, Lea was standing at the door, I was inside the parlour - I then took the hat off the prisoner's head; Newton looked at it, and said, "It looks like my hat, I think it is my hat, but if it is there is a different lining in it;" we came out of the room, consulted together, and did not take Brown that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what Newton said about the lining said in the prisoner's hearing? A. I do not think the prisoner did hear it - I returned the hat to the prisoner; I do not recollect saying any thing to him - he said to me, "Well, are you satisfied;" I said, "For the present;" that was all I said - I was present on the 27th of May when he was apprehended - he had a hat on when he came away; Lea took it from him at the lock-up house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had a consultation about the hat outside the door? A. Yes; Newton said that it was his hat; my reason for not taking him then was, because I have a hat and cap in my possession which was left on the premises, and the moment I saw the cap, and the description of the party who had been seen about the premises the evening before, I said I knew the cap to belong to

            , and believe the hat to be Brown's, having seen him wear a similar one; I thought it best to let him be till we could get them both at once - we have taken Latham, he is committed for trial at Surrey; Morgan came voluntarily before the Magistrate, having been desired to come by me or Lea - I might have told him myself; we certainly went to his house, for Latham's sister lived there; he was brought to the office, and gave an account how the lining went out of the house - I believe he was sworn, but cannot say whether; what he said was taken down - the clerk was there; I might be four or five yards from him, or only a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160049"></xptr>few inches, as we shift about - he did not, to my knowledge, state that another person brought him the hat; the prosecutor had sworn he positively believes the hat to be his; he did say if it was his it was a different lining.</p>

            . I am a hatter. I supply Newton with hats; I sold him one the beginning of this year of this description, texture, and size; I purchase my hats, I do not manufacture them - I have been twenty-seven years in the business, and this hat has been shown to the manufacturer; I only have this particular sort of hats from one manufacturer - I can only swear I sold the prosecutor one of this description, and that this is the manufacture of the person of whom I purchase, and I am satisfied this is not the original lining of this hat; here is some paper put in to prevent the colour of the hat coming through the lining, and in re-lining they have taken part of it out but not the whole - it was fastened with a little bit of paste; the lining is not mine - it is inferior to the lining I put into such hats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to state this part of the lining was not there originally? A. I speak generally of the lining - this under the leather is the lining; it is a fine hat 6 1/2 diameter - when it was finished the size was chalked in it; I do not mark the size in ink; it is a common size, but not so common as seven inches - I cannot tell how many hundreds of this description I have had - I have not bought thousands; I believe the maker supplies most of the respectable houses in the City - he would be as likely to know it as me; the texture, size, and description are all common.</p>
               <p>MR. NEWTON. This is my hat; there are two or three circumstances connected with it which induces me to say so - in consequence of my head not being very well I ordered a light one, and the general shape of the hat was neither liked by myself or family; in the next place, I observed that the beaver was worn off it just here near the leather, and it fits me - and from these circumstances I conclude it is mine; I have tried it on several times - it is the hat I saw on the prisoner's head three or four days after the robbery; I looked then at the mark, near the piece of leather - I did not hold it in my hand to feel the weight of it, I only looked at this mark; except when I saw it on his head, from the general appearance of it, I was convinced it was mine - the leather lining is not the same I had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Put it on; I suppose you are not acquainted with the hat trade? A. No; it is a light hat, my family did not like the shape - it may be as common a shape as is worn.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a better reason now for believing it is yours than before? A. I certainly have - for I have examined it closer than I did at the George; it was not in my hands there, but in the officer's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state if it was your's it had a different lining? A. I think I said it was my hat, but it had a different lining - I have no doubt I am correct about it; I will venture to swear it is my hat from its general appearance, the dislike to the shape, and the particular wear near the leather - it is not the shape I usually wear, it is too narrow in the brim.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Mile-end Old-town. My beat is within twenty or thirty yards of Mr. Newton's house - I recollect the night his house was broken open; on the night before the robbery I saw two persons passing very near Mr. Newton's; they looked rather suspicious - I looked at them and they went on; it was the night of the robbery, rather before twelve o'clock - there was a gas-light near them, I could see their faces, and should know one again better than the other, having frequently seen him passing my beat before - it was the prisoner; they passed by, and stopped by the lamp for a short time - I was five or six yards from them then; I was relieved by another watchman soon after one o'clock, and communicated what I had seen to him, and gave him a description of the persons I had seen - the other man was nearly a head saller than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first hear of this house being robbed? A. In the morning, as soon as I got up - I went and told Newton what I had seen; I was not taken to see the prisoner till he was at Lambeth-street; I did not tell

            . I am a watchman. I relieved Andrews on the morning in question a little after one o'clock, and received directions from him, in consequence of which I kept a look out - I saw nothing happen till Newton gave the alarm that there were thieves on his premises; I went to his assistance, and saw a person getting over his fence towards the street - as soon as he saw me he retreated back on the premises again; I sprung my rattle, and another watchman came to my assistance - I stationed myself in front and heard a rattle spring, went to the spot, and saw two men running about fifty yards before me - I had my great coat on and they gained ground on me - one ran after the other as close as they could; one of them was about the prisoner's size, and the other about a head taller; Andrew's had given me information of having seen suspicious characters lurking about, and said one was short and the other a head taller - the bind one had a hat on, the other had passed the gas-light, and I could not see what he had on - the short one had a hat; nobody was nearer to them than I was that I know of</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did they not run close by the gaslight? A. Yes; I saw them before they got to the gaslight - I saw the short one better than the taller; I heard no disturbance till Newton alarmed me - I was not in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160050"></xptr>box; I was twenty yards from Newton's - I had been pretty near the house all the time; I had been my round.</p>

            . I heard the alarm. I am superintendant of the parish; I ran to assist - I was the first person by the prosecutor's gates; he was at his window; I climbed over the gates, with a watchman's lantern, and on going to the back door, I stumbled over a cloak, and some boots outside the house - I then found a pannel out of the door; I showed the cloak and boots to Mr. Newton - I found a hat, cap, and a small crow-bar on the premises; the crow-bar was in the kitchen - I examined the premises, and found the trunks open, and linen spread in different places; a watch dog was killed in the yard - it was not quite dead when I got over; it had been knocked on the head, I believe; I saw no marks of its having been stabbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How did you know it was knocked on the head? A. I apprehend so - it died shortly after; I never saw it after it was skinned - I was subpoened here this morning, I believe by Lea, but I did not see the person - I went before the Magistrate, but my deposition was not taken.</p>
               <p>MR. NEWTON. The great coat and boots shown to me by Larkins, were my property; I had a watch dog - he died about six o'clock in the morning, and was quite well when I saw him at nine the night before; I saw the skin after he had been skinned, and there appeared to be a settlement of blood about the neck.</p>

            . Q.Do not you know that many hatters do mark the dimensions of a hat with ink? A. Very probably - I do not think it is common for a hatter lining a hat which he did not make, to mark the dimensions - this lining is marked 6 1/2 in ink; it is not my mark, nor the manufacturer's - I mark my hats on the paper, outside; no maker would mark it as this is done - this leather has been put in by a hat liner.</p>

            . I am a hat seller, and occasionally line hats. I was examined before the Magistrate; I went there voluntarily - Lea, the officer, told me to come- I was sworn; I believe Lea and Shellswell heard what I said - they were in and out; I believe what I said was taken down - I did not take notice; I signed no examination; I do not know the prisoner - I know the lining of this hat; I cannot say that I lined it, but to the best of my belief, I did - the leather is mine; it bears my private mark - it is not my own writing but I know the hand; I do not manufacture hats - I know the leather, but I cannot speak to the other part of the lining; I do not recollect lining a hat, but I have an entry in my book of a job having been done on the 26th of April, which might be for lining.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Are you able to say on your oath, you never sold that hat? A. I swear I did not; I have no recollection of lining it, but many things are done in my shop which I do not know of; I was asked before the Magistrate if I had lined it for the prisoner, and said I did not.</p>

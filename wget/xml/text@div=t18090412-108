On the 25th of March the prisoner came to my house; she lodged in my house a fortnight, she had a two pair of stairs front room at four shillings a week, furnished; she worked at the straw bonnets; she did not pay the first week, I let it alone till another week. On the pay day of the second week I went into the room, she was laying upon the sacking, and all the articles were gone contained in the indictment. The first thing I missed was the looking glass, I asked her what she had done with it; she said she had pledged it at Mr. Wadmore's. The officer and I went to the pawnbroker's, and there I found all the things except the counterpane and pillow; they have never been found yet.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Wadmore, pawnbroker, Charlton street, Somers Town. On the 5th of April the prisoner pawned a flat iron with me for eight pence, on the same day a bolster was pledged for three shillings and sixpence; she came afterwards and borrowed sixpence more on it. On the 7th of April she pawned a looking glass for four shillings; a bed was pledged before I came to the shop, she had half a crown more upon that; the bed was pawned for fifteen shillings. On the 5th of April a curtain I took in myself, and two articles that I did not take in.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden. The prisoner was brought to the office. I went to Mr. Wadmore's and ordered them to bring the articles. I took some duplicates from her, they correspond exactly with the things. I know the prisoner very well; I know her father; after she got along with a young man, he got her to do this, and then he went away; she believes she is pregnant by him.</p>

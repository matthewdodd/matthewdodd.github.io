             saw it, I asked them whether they intended to murder me, I took a hair broom, and said if they did not let me out, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210016"></xptr>would break the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman that you picked up assist. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to make such an effort as that while you were in the room three hours. - A. I did, I called the watchman, when I was up stairs the watchman knocked at the door; when I said I would break the windows if they would not let me out, Ranger took me by the shoulders, opened the door, and pushed me out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask for the two pound note. - A. No, at the time that I was put into the court, I called the watchman again.</p>
               <p>Q. What court was it. - A. Marygold court, in the Strand; the watchman came to my assistance, he knocked at the door and was refused admittance; he advised me to go to St. Martin's watchhouse, and relate the story to the constable of the night, which I did, the constable came from the watchhouse with me to the house, he knocked and was refused admittance; I told him the situation I was in, and all the circumstance, he saw how my shirt was torn and my hand was bleeding; when he knocked they said Mr. Ranger was gone out and they had lost the key, they could not open the door; we heard Ranger talking to some of the women.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this. - A. That was after two o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock was it when you first went. - A. About a quarter before eleven; the constable went away and desired me and the watchman to remain at the door till he should return, he returned to the watchman and me, we waited at the door till half after six, at last a man came out of the house, we then gained admittance; we went up stairs and found the woman prisoner in bed with her clothes on, the constable took her into custody, and returned down stairs and knocked at Ranger's door, he refused opening it, a girl came from the back parlour and told him if he went through her room there was a little door with a bolt, he might go into it, which he did and found Ranger in bed; after we had got him in custody, he asked leave to go into the yard, the constable gave him leave (he had not quite dressed himself), instead of going in the yard he went up stairs and made off out of the back of the house, and was missing for about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your note again. - A. No, I did not see it after it dropped on the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. You picked up up this girl and went into Marygold court. - A. She picked me up.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had been in the room some time before she and you had a dispute. - A. I had not been there above five or ten minutes before the dispute began, I offered her a compliment, but she did not think that was enough; there was some words between us, but there was no disturbance.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Ranger came up upon being called, and after he had been there a little while he returned down again. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this woman put herself against the door, and vowed you should not go till you had paid her what she demanded. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You got down stairs after being there about three hours. - A. Yes, when I got down stairs Mr. Ranger locked the door, Mrs. Gamble came down stairs as the mistress of the house, she vowed I should not go any farther without paying immediately; she saw the note in my hand, she put my hand into her mouth and bit it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that Mrs. Gamble at that time knew that you had a two pound note in your hand. - A. I certainly could not swear to that, I believe she knew it by her attempting to bite me, I resisted by striking her.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether with the pain that you received from the bite the note did not drop on the floor. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the note went. - A. I should naturally suppose that she took it out of my hand, I can only venture to swear I lost it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, will you venture to swear that Mr. Ranger knew any thing at all of your having a two pound note. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Ranger called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

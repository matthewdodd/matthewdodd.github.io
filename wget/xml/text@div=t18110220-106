            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Ford, trunk-maker, 110, Minories. On the 5th of November the prisoner and another man he called his steward came to my master's shop and asked if my master was at home, I told them he was not. He told me he wanted a dozen nests of trunks for the West Indies; I told him I would take the order and acquaint my master when he came home. He told me he was captain of the ship Swallow, lying in the London docks, and he lodged at Mr. Downing's, slop-seller, Upper East Smithfield. He then looked round the shop, he saw a red trunk at the door; he asked me to shew it him; I did. When I opened the trunk I found one within it; he said he would take them both; he asked me the price; I told him. He gave them to the man he called his steward, and told him to take them to his lodgings. I saw no more of him. In the afternoon the man that he called his steward came running into the shop, he said he wanted a trunk for the captain. When he came on shore there was one in the shop; I said, will this do; he said, yes, book it to the captain; I did. About a fortnight before that the prisoner came to my master's shop, he bought a trunk and paid for it. I thought him to be an honest man. I knew him again. I took that trunk to where he said his lodgings, were at Mr. Downing's.</p>
               <p>MR FORD. In consequence of the information that I received from my lad on the evening of the 5th of November I desired I might see the prisoner when he called again; the next morning he called and said he wanted to see the trunks, if they were ready. On my coming to him I asked him what his name was, he said 
               <persName id="t18110220-106-person932">
                  John

            , he was captain of the ship Swallow, lying in the London docks. He asked me if the nests of trunks were ready; I told him they would be ready in a day or two; he said he did not want them for ten days, get them ready, I will pay you when they are ready; I am of Miles's house in London, but I pay all these kind of things myself; he had looked out a trunk which he said he wanted to put his own clothes in, he begged me to send it down and to charge it in the bill with the rest; I told him I would. Mrs. Downing, the wife of the person that he lodged with, was with him at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lodge with Mr. Downing - A. He did, to their sorrow. About a week after that I had a medicine chest to make up for a gentleman, I took it down with me, and when I went to Mr. Downing he had ran away. He obtained goods of me to the amount of one pound two shillings.</p>
               <p>MR. HOOKER. The prisoner came to me, I made up goods for him in the upholstery way to the amount of seventy-nine pounds sixteen shillings and sixpence. He called himself captain Nonmus of the ship Swallow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They never sent the bills in, or else I would have paid them with pleasure. This gentleman said he would hurt me if he could.</p>

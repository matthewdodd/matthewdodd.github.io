I found the screws of the hasp were wrenched; I missed two sovereigns, six half-crowns, five shillings, a blue coat, a black waistcoat, a blue silk handkerchief, and a pair of breeches. I went out that night in search of the prisoners, but could not find them - they did not come home that night. I gave information at the office next morning, and did not see either of them again till the Monday following, when I saw Jobbins in the park - I got Pace, an officer, to take him. I saw Frazer on Sunday, the 12th of March, at Millbank, and said to him, "Ayn't you a pretty fellow?" he said di<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060008"></xptr>rectly, "I know nothing about it;" he then said his mother was waiting at my lodging, with three sovereigns for me; I said I should wait with him till his mother came back - he stood a good bit, and then said he was waiting for a person, and asked me to go round to his mother's - I had him secured; his mother lived about five minutes walk from my lodging.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Bowley, a carpenter. I know Jobbins by working down the stable yard, and Frazer by seeing him down the yard with him; Calcott's shop is at the corner of the stable yard. I saw them together in the yard about six o'clock on Wednesday evening, the 15th of February - they were at the foot of the stairs where the prosecutor lodged; I lodge in the next house - the foot of master's stairs and Calcott's both come together. Frazier went half way up stairs - Jobbins stood at the foot of the stairs; Frazer said, "Come on Tom - I have got the key - it is all right," and he then followed him. Next morning, at six o'clock, I heard of the robbery.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took both the prisoners into custody. I examined the box - it had been forced open by a blunt instrument. I found a piece of iron in the fire-place on the 21st; the end of it exactly fits the marks on the box, and there is a little paint on the end of it, the same colour as the box. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster.</p>
               <p>FRAZER'S Defence (written). On the night of the 15th of February I got the key of the room from the landlady, and went up stairs, for the purpose of getting my great coat - I then came down, and went to my tea, leaving the key in the door; I returned in an hour - the key was still in the door; I locked it, came down, and went to the theatre. I went home at twelve o'clock, and found the gates closed against me; I was forced to walk the streets all night, and next morning I met two women on Westminster-bridge, who said Fergusson had been robbed, and I was supposed to be concerned; I said I was not. I went home to my mother at night, and found it was true; she told me she could not let me remain there, for the officers were ready to take me up. I went to Gravesend to try for work - my cousin there could not give me work - I returned in about a week to my mother's- I met her in Francis-street; she said she dare not let me into her house, for the officers had been there, I was obliged to sleep in lodging-houses, and next morning I heard Jobbins was in custody. On the Sunday after I saw Furgeson - he asked if I was not ashamed of what I had done; I said I knew nothing of the charge; he gave me a pint of beer, and said if I would tell him who it was he would not hurt me - I said if I knew I would tell him - he then came down to my mother, and told her what I had said, and had me taken - I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave Frazer a good character.</p>

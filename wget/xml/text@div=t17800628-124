             sworn.</p>
               <p>I came from Oxford on Tuesday the 27th of June. I put up at an inn in Piccadilly, and went to see a friend in the city; he was going to the masquerade. I was coming back from the city to Piccadilly; my friend was going to <placeName id="t17800628-124-crimeloc621">Carlisle-house</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17800628-124-crimeloc621" type="placeName" value="Carlisle-house"></interp>

When I thought to return back I felt some one in the crowd pressing violently on the small of my back, and he cried get on, get on, as if an ox or a carriage was coming; I saw nothing to justify this. I felt a hand at the flap of my waistcoat, taking my watch out of my pocket. As I saw the hand come from my fob, I catched the man by the waistcoat and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280279"></xptr> said he had stolen my watch; he put his hand over the shoulder of a man who stood before him; I called a constable and told him the prisoner had taken my watch and given it to another person. We secured him and took him to the watch-house, there was nothing but a few half pence, a knife, and a bit of silk, found upon him.</p>

               <p>I never had the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I think it my duty to say some thing for the prisoner. There is but one evidence against him, that is me; I may be mistaken. When the watch was taken from me it was eleven o'clock at night, in the dark, and in a crowd. The same voice which cried, get on, as it hurried me on, might have burried another person. If the jury bring him in guilty, I hope they will recommend him to mercy.</p>

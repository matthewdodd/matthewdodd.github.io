On the 9th of January I had a little business out in the evening, I went out between six and seven o'clock: when I returned I found the prisoner at the bar sitting in a box with another man, drinking a pot ; they continued so for about three quarters of an hour; they went out; as soon as he parted with the other he returned again and joined company with some other gentlemen; he stayed in the house an hour longer ; and I heard him say, all his money was gone but four pence, and said he would not carry that out of the house; so he had two glasses of usquebaugh for it; then he went out of the house, and betwixt nine and one he returned again, and asked my wife if she would trust him a pint of beer; she told him she did not chuse it; then he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out something, I did not see it, but he said here is money enough; then he went out of the house again, and in about half an hour returned again, and called for a pint of wine. I told him we did not sell wine ; then he said he would spend a shilling, and threw it at my wife: I then said if you will have it, have it in punch. There was no sugar below stairs; I went up stairs for some and found the door open. I came down to my wife, and asked her what time she was in the room, she said not since four o'clock; then she run up and came down again, and said, I am robbed, but spoke softly to me. I went up with her to see; then she said, I'll lay my life that fellow has robb'd me, for I saw some pieces of money in his hand; we came down immediately, and he was gone away and left his punch behind him: I saw no more of him that night. I went into a house in Piccadilly that very night, and the gentlewoman that keeps the alehouse, told me he had been there changing two pieces of gold.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Collingwood. The prisoner was in my house all that evening; he and another person came in and called for a pot of beer, then they went out again; the prisoner said he would not bid me a good night, he would come back again.</p>
               <p>She went on and confirmed the testimony of her husband with this addition: That when he came again the last time but one, he pulled out of his pocket and shewed to her a 36 shilling piece and a 27 s. piece; then he went out again and soon came in, and she saw in his hand much silver and half a guinea amongst it.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my house, the Boot in Piccadilly, on the 9th of this instant about 9 o'clock; I changed him a guinea, he paid for what he had and went away; he came again a little before eleven and asked me to change him a 36 shilling piece; I saw he was very much in liquor, I advised him not to change it; he insisted upon changing it; I said, let me keep it till morning and do you come for it; he insisted upon 10 s. I gave it him, and bid him come for the rest in the morning, which he did, and I gave him the rest of the change.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Charles Birt; we live in Carthusian-street. The prisoner came into our employ in Oct., 1843—he was our collecting clerk for some time, and then an ordinary clerk—he remained as such about four months; we then again sent him collecting—he went out on the 12th of March, and did not return—I went to his father's the same night, and could not hear of him—it was his duty to have returned that night, and rendered an account of the monies that he had collected that day—he was taken on the Thursday—he never accounted to me for any money received from Wilkinson, Wisden, or Ward.</p>

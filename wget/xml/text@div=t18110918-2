               <p>Q. When did you first see the defendant - A. About five years ago I cannot be accurate to the day, I have got my book here, it was in February the 7th 1807. He was introduced to me by a man calling himself Newcastle, he told me the prisoner was a merchant, and did a deal of business. I was not at home when the prisoner first came to my house. An order had been given in my absence, they called to see if the order had been executed; they said they should want three or four hundred poundsworth of goods to send to Russia, he told me he could not pay me ready money, he would give me a good bill; I said I should have no objection if the bill was good; I got the goods ready and left them in the hands of my clerk. I went out and returned about two o'clock, and the goods were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the goods were gone did you see them again - A. About four or five days after I saw them at Mr. Farron's, a jeweller in the Strand, they were exposed in the window for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of those goods - A. Three hundred and seventy odd pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home did your clerk shew you any bill which he got - A. Yes, the body of the bill is my clerks hand writing. I put the signature to it after I came home. It is made payable at Smith's and Company, 42, Lombard-street. I went there that afternoon but found no banker there. There was a man of the name of Smith that kept a little room there, but not no banker. I never got payment of the bill.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Sampson. When the prisoner came for the goods he was introduced by Newcastle, and Newcastle and he looked out the goods as they said for the express purpose of going to Russia.</p>

             that bill. I told the prisoner my master wanted a bill accepted by a merchant of respectability or made payable to a banker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he accept this and represent that Smith and co. were his bankers - A. Yes. I delivered it upon the ground of Smith and Company being his bankers.</p>

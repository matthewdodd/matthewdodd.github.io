             was called on his recognizance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to sleep there on Sunday night, a young man and I were both together there. In the morning between five and six o'clock I awoke, the chamber door was open, which I shut when I went to bed; I spoke to the young man; there were a great many lodgers in the house, but not in the same room, the door was open when I awoke, I supposed it was done by some lodgers down stairs.</p>
               <p>Court to Salmon. Is there lodgers in the house? - There is, but they are all creditable people, and have lodged there for several years. He says he called to me, but he did not; he only lodged there one night before, about a week ago. I went to the Vinegar-yard, and they knew nothing of him.</p>

               <p>Q. You must not tell us what passed between you and him? - A. On the Wednesday following, in Charter-house-square, I met Mrs. Carney, a person I never saw before in my life, I was very sure that the bonnet she had on was one that was made at our shop; she passed me, and I came back, and begged her pardon, and said, Madam, pray did you buy that bonnet in Cornhill, that was the satin bonnet; she said, no, Sir; but pray why do you make this enquiry of me; I asked her if she knew Mrs. Hilliard; she said, no; I said, I cannot let you go, I will treat you like a gentleman, but I cannot let you go till I know where you had this bonnet; she went with me, and told me she would take me to where she had the bonnet; she took me to a two pair of stairs room in Grub-street, to the room of a Mrs. Clements; there was a conversation between them, and they said, they were willing to come forward to bring the prisoner at the bar to justice; Mrs. Clements said, she had it of the prisoner; I left the satin bonnet at a gentleman's house in Bunhill-row, Mr. Bellamy's, who is not here, and it remained there till the Thursday; the next day, when we went before a Magistrate, a young man brought it to the Magistrate, whose name is Madder.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it to be the same bonnet? - A. I know it by the make of the bonnet; and the caul had been cut by Mrs. Carney to get her head into it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this satin bonnet? - A.Five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, with certainly, that that is the bonnet that was upon the table when the prisoner was there? - A. I believe it was, and I have no doubt of it; I will not swear positively that it is, but I will positively swear it is a bonnet that was made at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many may you have made of that sort? - A. Thirty or forty, more or less.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she was at your shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Whether there was not another person in the room at the time I was looking at the bonnet? - A. Yes;

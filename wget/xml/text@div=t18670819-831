                  </hi> I am in the employ of Mr. Henry Mason, of the Grove, Sydenham—on Friday, 2nd August, I left my bedroom window open in the morning—between twelve and one o'clock I had occasion to go to the bedroom on the back of the first floor—I was occupied some little time in dusting it—as I was going out I noticed the box move which had been under the bed—it contained a victorine and a muff, and a packet of cam<lb></lb>phor—I stooped to put the box back, when I saw something under the bed—I looked a second time, and, seeing it was a man, I locked the door on the outside and took the key out—I ran down stairs and sent for a policeman, who unlocked the door—prisoner was then sitting comfortably in a chair—I did not say anything to him, but the policeman asked him what he was doing there—the prisoner said the house belonged to him—I cannot remember anything else said—prisoner was then taken to the station—I had other things in the room—I examined the window; there was a mark on the window-ledge—the value of my muff was 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I went to Mr. Mason's house and went with Davis upstairs and unlocked the bedroom door—the pri<lb></lb>soner was sitting in a chair—I asked him what he was doing there—his reply was, "This is my house; I live here "—he was then given in charge—I took him to the station—I came back afterwards for the box—it con<lb></lb>tained a muff, victorine, and a small packet of camphor—I searched the prisoner and found some camphor in his pocket—he would not speak when at the station till he found he was charged with stealing the box, when he said if he had moved the box it was by accident to get under the bed—the box was near the bed—I found some marks on the outside of the house—the window was open—I did not notice the window-sill and the flower-pots.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he drunk - A. No, I cannot say he was drunk; he was very collected and knew what he said; he offered to pay his score; the landlord said no, he had better let it be till the morning; he put the money in his pocket again. In the morning Fowler went out and came in again; he went up stairs, and returned down again in about ten minutes; he saw the landlady; he told her he wanted breakfast: he went away as fast as he could towards the Haymarket; the landlord and I called after him in the street, he must have heard us; he did not turn back, he was not above thirty yards off. The landlord went into the Haymarket, collecting of pots, and happened to see him having his boots cleaned; the landlord came home; Westcoat, I, and the landlord pursued him; we found him at the Dog public house with his slippers on, he had left his boots to be cleaned; he seemed very much alarmed at our presence; we brought him back to the George and sent for

I took the prisoner in custody; I searched him, I found nothing but sixpence and a few halfpence; he said he had never seen that note nor the silver; he said the sixpence he had in his pocket before, but the halfpence he picked up on the floor in the bed room. I was in the tap room when he put the paper in the fire.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I contradict almost all the evidence which they have given. In the first lace, the prosecutor says he did not ask what he spent the over night - he certainly did ask me; I told him I could not tell, as I was not there. With respect to their halloaing after me in the road, they did not, as I could hear them. I asked a parcel of boys where there was a barber's shop; from there I asked where I could have my boots cleaned, which was not above twenty or thirty yards from the place.</p>

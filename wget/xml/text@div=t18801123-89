                  </hi>. I live at Randon Terrace, Balham—I have had a shed in the Ramsden Road, Balham, six years—it was built of brick, tiles, and timber—on 27th October it was burnt down—I first heard of it in my dinner hour, between 12 and 1 o'clock—I went out, and it was one mass of fire—some shavings, benches, and wood were in it—it was a workshop; men's tools were there—it was burnt down in about half an hour—its value was from 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bricks extended right to the roof—I noticed the lock was on the post—I am certain it was locked, and I had the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was glass in the door—there was an entrance because some of the brickwork of the chimney had fallen out.</p>

I saw the shed after it was burnt down at 2.30, and about 5 p.m. I saw Hales about half a mile from the shed—I told him I should take him in custody for setting fire to a shed belonging to Mr. King, in the Ramsden Road, Balham—he said he knew nothing about it, he was not there—I said I had evidence to prove that he was running away at the time the fire was burning—he said that Webb made a heap of shavings in the place, and he set fire to fire them, and as soon as they began to burn they ran away—I took him to the station; I took Webber about a quarter of an hour after, and told him it was for being concerned with another boy in setting fire to a shed at Balham—I took him to the station.</p>

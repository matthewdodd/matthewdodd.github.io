                  </hi>. I am an engineer employed on the South-western Railway at the Twickenham Station—on the evening of 28th June I went to the Duke D'Aumale's to see some friends of mine there—there is a lane which leads from the church at Twickenham past the Swan Tavern towards the Duke D'Aumale's—that lane runs parallel to the high road from Twickenham to Richmond along the water-side—afterwards, when you get in the direct way from Twickenham it turns up and joins the main-road again—I was in this lane that evening about 7 o'clock—I cannot say whether it was after or before—there is a gate there—I saw a woman of the name of Fitzgibbon in the road—she came up to me whilst I was standing at the gate—I saw young Mr. de Vidil come up to where I and Fitzgibbon were standing—he had his hat off, and his face was covered with blood—he ran up and crouched down between me and the old woman—while he was there two saddle-horses came up, one after the other, both without riders, and directly afterwards the prisoner came round the corner, close after the horses; he was running—he came up to the gate where I was standing—he was in this manner (<hi rend="italic">trembling</hi>), and saying, "What is the matter? what is the matter?" twice over—he made an attempt to jump over the rails—he missed the first time; in the second attempt he succeeded in getting over—he got over the rail next to the post that the gate was hinged on to—he got over the fence—there are tenter hooks at the top of the fence, and he got his hands fast in the tenter hooks—that was in the second attempt that he made to get over—there is a shrubbery on the other side of the fence; that leads down to the river—there is a foot road down to the river from the footway where I stood—I should say it is from twenty to thirty yards from the footway where I stood to the river; I do not know exactly, because I have only been once or twice in the place since this occurrence, I never was in the place before: it is something of that distance—as he was getting over I called to him, "What do you want there? there is nothing there for you"—at the time he came up he had a whip handle in his hand it was a whip handle with a loop at one end, and silver mounted, or some white metal, at the other end—I did not take particular notice what it was—it was somewhere about two feet, or two feet six long—the handle was of a yellowish colour—this is not it (<hi rend="italic">looking at the whip already produced</hi>), this is not the sort of thing the prisoner had in his hand—the silver mount was longer—I expect the yellowish colour was the colour of the material—I did not notice what kind of material it was—my attention was taken up with the young man more than anything else—I cannot say whether the prisoner carried the whip handle over the fence with him or not—when he got over the fence he got into the path, and then there is another iron fencing, and he jumped over that and got into the shrubbery, and there I lost sight of him—I went with the young man towards the Swan Inn at Twickenham—the prisoner came up to me again before I bad got three or four yards away from the gate where I was first standing—I should not think he was absent in the shrubbery above two minutes; I do not recollect exactly, but I should say it could not be more than that—the gate is between one hundred and two</p>

               <p>hundred yards from the Swan—he walked with me along the lane to the Swan—as we were going along I asked him how the injury had happened—he said the horse had shied and thrown him against the wall—I did not fetch the doctor—I cannot say who did—I did not see any whip afterwards picked up on the road—I do not remember whether the prisoner had anything in his hand when he rejoined me—I do not remember seeing any<lb></lb>thing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long altogether do you say he was away after he had got over the palings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From one to two minutes, I should think—he appeared to be very much excited—he went in the direction of the river—he could have reached the river in the time he was away, if he was running; not in walking—he could have done so without my seeing him—the shrubbery takes a winding turn to the river—he had to get over two palings from the lane—I saw him get over both, into the shrubbery, and then I lost sight of him—there is a path-road there leading down to the river—the distance between the two palings is about a couple of yards—they stand at about right angles to each other—part of the shrubbery reaches down to the river on one side, or nearly so—there is a footpath all the way down to the river—I do not know whether it also runs by the side of the river—the high road, where this happened, is very much frequented, not the foot-path—there is a footpath at the end of the lane leading down to the Twickenham Meadows—that is some distance off—at times a good many persons walk in that direction.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Twickenham—on the evening of 28th June I was called to the Swan Inn to see a young gentleman who had met with an injury there—I believe the prisoner was in the room when I got there—I am not very sure whether he was or not; he was immediately afterwards—all the front part of the young man's person appeared to be covered with blood—they had washed his face, therefore I do not think there was any blood running down his face at that time—I examined his head—there was one wound on the forehead, near the centre, just at the junction where the hair begins to grow—it was a contused, starred wound—the skin was cut—I did not probe it, from the character of it; it was quite through the scalp—I found another wound at the back part of the head, and rather on one side—I should say that was about the same depth as the other; it was through the scalp, apparently—it was of the same character as the wound in front; it was starred like the other—there were no scratches about the face—when I first got to the young man he was faint—I should say, from the state of his dress, that a great deal of blood had flowed, I think principally from the wound in front; but of that I cannot be certain, because the blood from the wound at the back might have trickled round to the front of the neck on to the dress, as well as from the wound on the forehead—I asked the prisoner, as any one naturally would, under the circumstances, how it had occurred (the young man was present at the time)—he told me that the young man had been thrown from his horse against a wall—I asked him in what way it had occurred; if the horse had run away, or had fallen, or shied—he told me the horse had shied and had thrown him against a wall—I did not make any observation to the prisoner with regard to there being two wounds, one at the front and one at the back.</p>

I am the more anxious, that he met yesterday with an accident in riding; the horse having hit him on the forehead in rearing. I sat with him till 12 last night, and I told him I would call early next morning. I beg you may be so kind as to inform me whether you have heard from Alfred, and with my very best regards to Mrs. Parker and children, believe me, yours very sincerely, Baron de Vidil.")—Young Mr. de Vidil came to my house in Hertfordshire on Saturday morning, the 29th—I am not sure whether he was with me when I received this letter; I think not: certainly not—he did not remain at my house—I think he stayed about three hours.</p>

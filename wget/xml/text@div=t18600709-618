               <p>John's-street, Clerkenwell—on 4th July, about half-past 8, I was walking alone in West-street, Smithfield; there was a fire there and I stopped to look on—whilst there I felt my watch chain dragged—it was round my neck—I had seen my watch safe about 10 minutes before—it was attached to a chain by a small ring—upon turning round I saw the prisoner—I am quite certain he is the man; he had got the chain passed through his hand, and the watch appeared to drop from his hand—the wire of the ring was broken, but the watch had not come quite out, it was ready to drop out—I laid hold of him directly—a policeman came up and I gave him into custody—he was taken on the spot.</p>

On 4th July I was in West<lb></lb>street—I saw the prisoner standing in front of the prosecutor; I am confident he is the man—after that I saw the guard in the prisoner's left hand—I saw the watch drop from the end of the chain and the prosecutor caught it—I laid hold of the prisoner directly, and held his left hand tight, so as to keep what was in it—I led him along to the station—at the station I let go his hand and I heard something drop on the ground—I looked at his feet and picked up this ring—he dropped it directly I let go his hand.</p>

            . I was cashier to Messrs. Harvey, and was stationed at the desk in their shop - it is the duty of the shopmen to bring the money and the bills to me; I stamp the bills, and return them. On the 13th of July, between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner brought me a bill of 1s.; I did not know whether Mrs. Wright was there - I received the shilling, and stamped the bill; I think he left the bill at the desk; it is usual to give it to the customer, but there was no change, and he did not require the bill back; I have my books here, in which I enter every payment - there are twenty-seven entries of money to him that day, but none of 21s.; each shopman has a column marked for himself - No. 19 on this bill refers to his book; each shopman has a book of his own, and writes on the bill the folio in which he enters the transaction in his book - there is no entry in his book of 21s. being received that day; the bill produced by Mrs. Wright, I believe to be in his hand-writing.</p>

In folio 19 in his book, here is 1s. entered, but no 21s. - if the entry in the book had been correct it should have been 21s. Information was given to me that evening; we took the prisoner into custody next morning, and a sovereign was found in his boot - upon my charging him with it he denied it, but on the following morning, as I was going out of the door to call the officer, he called me back, and said he had got the sovereign, he took off his boot, and produced it - he had been about three months in our employ, and we had a good character with him; he had from 30l. to 35l. per annum, and his board<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080075"></xptr>and lodging; I have nothing to do with the countinghouse, and cannot say whether he had been paid - if he had applied for his wages he could have had them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Steer's-buildings, Queen-street, Chelsea. I have a small open yard there, and a pigeon-house, in which I keep pigeons. On Monday evening, the 17th of Nov., I went home at six o'clock, and left home about five minutes past six—I fastened up my pigeon-house, and know that the pigeons were in it—I came back about ten, found the pigeon-house broken open, and three pigeons gone.</p>

               <p>between eight and nine o'clock, and saw the two prisoners there, and another one at the top—they walked down the court into <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Newton's yard—I was up at my father's loft, going to feed my rabbits—I could see into Newton's yard and all about there—I saw Ralph get up the ladder, break open the pigeon-house, and give some pigeons to Greenwood—I do not know how many—Greenwood was at the bottom of the ladder, and Ralph at the top, by the pigeon-house—Ralph got down and went up the court, and they went away together with the other one, who was standing at the top.</p>

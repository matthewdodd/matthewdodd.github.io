            . The prisoner lived in our service about a year and a half - she is single. I had no reason to suppose her in the family-way till a week or ten days before this happened, I then told her of it - she denied it. She slept in the front parlour, alone, and we in the back. I cannot hear what passes in her room - there is a wooden partition between us. On the <rs id="t18210606-36-cd208" type="crimeDate">5th April</rs>

At half-past five o'clock in the morning, I found a child in the privy - I saw it before it was disturbed; its two little legs stuck upright, the other parts were under the soil - it was exactly under the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in such a situation in which it might be, if it fell from any one sitting on the privy - A. I cannot say. It was taken out and examined by Mr. Watkins, Mrs. Bowers, the midwife, first saw it. I asked the prisoner, what she thought of doing such a horrid deed; she made no answer - she was in bed. There were symptoms of her having been delivered in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they more than what might be there if she had been delivered in the privy, and came to the parlour - A. I cannot say - I have not had a family myself; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060019"></xptr>were marks of blood on the floor and bed - they were only marks of blood that might be after delivery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were there not also blood marks on the privy - A. There was on the boards where she might have sat. The child appeared to have fallen with its head downward.</p>
               <p>MR. WATKINS. I am an apothecary, and have had a good deal of experience in the delivery of women. I was called to attend the prisoner on Friday, the 6th of April, and on Monday, I saw the child - it was a female; there is nothing that enables me to say whether it was born alive or not. It is very common for women to mistake the pains of childbirth, for an inclination to go to the privy; it is rather unlikely that the child should drop from her, but it depends on local circumstances, and the strength of the woman - the case is so seldom, it is not necessary to caution them against it. It is not uncommon for them to swoon away, or go into an unusual sinking at these times, and it is very likely they are not conscious of the moment the delivery takes place. I examined the child for marks of violence - I should have examined it before, but I was well aware there was great uncertainty in distinguishing between a still-born child, and one who died shortly after birth, and thought a surgeon of eminence should see it. I found no marks on it, that I should consider marks of violence; I should think them such as would have occurred by its falling down, or from natural causes. If she was delivered in the room, there would be other marks besides what there was; she might have been delivered in the privy, there was nothing to enable me to say it was born alive, and no more appears than a natural birth might have produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. I believe a head presentation is usual at birth - A. Yes, if born while she sat on the privy, it would fall head foremost.</p>

            . I am a midwife. I first saw the prisoner about eight o'clock on Friday morning - she said she was delivered in the privy, at one o'clock in the morning. I had a patient myself the other day, who had liked to have dropped her child in the privy - I am in the habit of cautioning them against it sometimes.</p>

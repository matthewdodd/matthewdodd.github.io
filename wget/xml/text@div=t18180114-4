On the 29th of December last I went out about twelve o'clock at noon, and returned in about half an hour. When I returned I met the prisoner nearly on the last step of the stairs, coming down; as I had lodgers up stairs, I asked her if she had been up to any of them, but before she could answer me one of the lodgers came down behind her; I asked him if he knew the prisoner, and he said he did not. As I saw she had a bundle in her apron, and observed the corner of the coat, which I knew, sticking out, I shoved her into the parlour, and sent for an officer - We found the coat and sheet in her apron. When I went out I left them in the bed-room. When the prisoner was taken into custody I went up stairs, and saw that both sheets had been dragged off the bed, but she had dropped one in the room. The prisoner was a perfect stranger to me.</p>

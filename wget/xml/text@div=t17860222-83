               <p>What sort of watch was it? - A silver watch, a cornelian seal, and steel chain; she got off the bed, upon hearing the noise, and struck a light; she opened the door, and looked out, and fastened the door again; I then laid down again, not being contented; she begged earnestly, and intreated I would permit her to get up; upon which she opened a trap-door in the wainscot, where she threw the watch, and put my hat over my face, that I should not see what she was doing, after taking it from off the bed; well, says I, there goes the watch, and I kicked the door to, and said, I will take care of you; I sent for a constable, and I saw two or three friends.</p>

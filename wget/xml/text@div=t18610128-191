                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SWIFT</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I think it was on the last remand, I will not be positive, that the prisoner James sent his master to me—somebody came to me, and in consequence of that I saw James Beading—he said, "I own I took your property away, and if you will not prosecute me I will tell you where I took it to"—I said I could not do that—I said, "If you like to state where the property was taken to, the Magistrate, no doubt, will deal favourably with you."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Tetley, and live in Kingsland-road. We sell carpets—on the 27th of October, we lost this piece out of the shop—I know the prisoner—he came half-an-hour before, and asked me the price of an article—I answered him—he went away and came again in half-an-hour—I turned my back a minute and he was gone, and this carpet-in ten minutes he was brought back with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was standing at my shop door, within a few doors of the prosecutor's, and saw two people pass with the carpet—I noticed the pattern of the carpet—I heard that the prosecutor had lost a carpet in a few minutes, and went after them—I saw them walking very leisurely, and my father who was behind me cried, "Stop thief!"—they threw it down and ran—I caught the prisoner—I cannot say whether he carried it or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. He swore that a man threw down the carpet, and the man was not five yards off me—he took me, and never offered to take the man—I was walking in the Kingsland-road, and the man asked me to carry a roll of carpet—I said I did not think I should be able—he said, "Very well"—I went a few yards further on, and this man laid hold of me—I never had it.</p>

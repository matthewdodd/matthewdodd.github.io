On the 8th of May, I lost some lead off the roof of my skittle-ground, which is covered with lead, and nailed on. I saw it all safe about nine o'clock on Sunday evening, the 7th of May. The watchman called me up about one o'clock in the morning - I found part of the roof stripped - he fetched the lead, which we compared with the roof at daylight - it fitted two nail-holes which were left and corresponded with the next sheet - here is about 50 lbs. in all. I found the prisoner in custody at Shadwell police-office. He was a stranger.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Stepney. On the 8th of May, about a quarter past twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner, and three more, about twelve yards from Brice's skittle-ground. I heard them whispering, held up my light, and saw the prisoner by the side of two bundles of lead. I was going to take them, and the stoutest man said,</p>
               <p>"If you come near us, you old b - g - r, I will knock you down." I sprung my rattle and two watchmen came to my assistance. As soon as they heard footsteps, they made off, and I after them - all three escaped. I alarmed Brice and took the lead to him. I traced them by footmarks,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170052"></xptr>and took the prisoner about half-past two o'clock that morning, about twenty yards from where I first saw him. When they escaped, he got over a fence into some rains. I suppose he must have returned. I am certain he is one of the men. I saw his face and viewed his dress. He was the only remarkable man among them. The moment I took him, he whistled twice. I was concealed. I told him what I took him for, and asked him where the other two were - he made no reply.</p>

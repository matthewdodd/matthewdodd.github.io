The prisoner was <hi rend="italic">my</hi> potboy, and had been so three or four months—I had a gun in a case in the club-room—I saw it there on 15th July, between 10 and 11 o'clock, and missed it about half-past 10 in the evening—I was told something, and went to M'Carthy, and, in conse<lb></lb>quence of something he told me, I went to Bermondsey-street, where I saw the prisoner coming out of a public-house with my gun in his hand—he was very tipsy—I gave him in charge—I also lost three books the same evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Shepperton-street, Islington. On 18th July, a little after 10 o'clock in the evening, I was at Mr. Clapperton's—the prisoner asked me to carry a gun out for him—he was in the yard, just out<lb></lb>side the door, and said he was going home that evening, over the water—he had got the gun in his hand—I asked if it was his own—he said, "Yes"—he was a little in liquor—I carried the gun about twenty yards outside the door—it was in two pieces, and not in the case—he came out with a little can, and some beer, and brought two or three little books which <hi rend="italic">be</hi> asked me to take care of for him till the morning—I agreed to do so—he took the gun and went away—next morning I gave the books to Mr. Clapperton.</p>

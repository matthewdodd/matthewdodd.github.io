On the 22nd of May, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was at my master's shop, and saw the prisoners and another lad walking up and down on the same side as my master's shop, opposite to Mr. Moses's—at half-past seven the two prisoners went over to Mr. Moses's, and left the other one on the other side—they looked at the window—Chapman went a little way from Sims, took something out of his jacket pocket, and <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> it down the glass, then went across the road, and Sims after him—in a little while they both came back together—Chapman went and stood in the same place—Sims put his hand into the broken square, took something out, and ran across the road to the same place, and Chapman after him—they were both together—I did not see what he took out—I saw no more of them.</p>

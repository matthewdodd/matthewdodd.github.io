                  </hi>. I live in Little St. Thomas the Apostle. On the 4th of July, about nine o'clock at night, I was at the tap of Calvert's brewery, where I am a clerk, talking with one of the men—the prisoner and another woman came up—we stood talking and laughing with them, and in a few, minutes the prisoner left me abruptly—I thought something was wrong—I went to her, and said, "You have got my green purse, give it me"—she denied it, and I gave her to the policeman, who found it under her arm—this is it, and the money stated is in it.</p>

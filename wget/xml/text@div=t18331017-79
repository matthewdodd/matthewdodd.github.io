               <p>GEORGE CRAWLEY (City police-constable No. 61). I took the prisoner on the 16th of September - I saw him and another go to a shop - the other went in, and the prisoner stood at the door - I went and took him to the watch-house - he gave up these eleven half-crowns, and said he got them from a man in Smithfield, whom he would show me, and who was the maker of them - Waller went with him, and he pointed out Robson, who was taken into custody - we went to Robson's house, and found some moulds, and three more half-crowns, which we have - those which the prisoner had were wrapped up in silver paper.</p>

            . These eleven half-crowns are all counterfeit, and are cast in the same mould - these three are also cast in the same mould.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I met the other prisoner in Smithfield, when he asked me as a favour to take care of the money that was found on my person; in a short time after I was taken into custody by a policeman, who asked me how the money came into my possession; I immediately pointed out the man who gave it to me.</p>

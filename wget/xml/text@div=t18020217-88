             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a <rs id="t18020217-88-viclabel469" type="occupation">bookseller and publisher</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18020217-88-victim867 t18020217-88-viclabel469"></join> in Paternoster-row? - A. Yes: I had employed a person of the name of Mary Pettit, to few up publications for many years past; she has sewed many thousands of Dr. Wright's Family Bible, which were delivered to her in quires; but I never sold any in quires. In consequence of information I received, I went to Mr. Davis, a cheesemonger, on the 14th of last month, about nine o'clock in the evening, with Mr. Gill; we found, on examination, one hundred and twenty-four pounds weight of paper, which I got back again, and paid him at the rate of three-pence per pound Eighty-two pounds were mine, enough to render three or four hundred pounds worth of books imperfect; there were three numbers of the Bible also, and two numbers of the Lady's Magazine; I have no doubt they all belonged to me; I saw the prisoner the day after, about four o'clock in the afternoon; I made her no promise or threat, but I asked her several questions about the paper, and she told me she stole them by degrees from Mrs. Pettit's house, and tied them up in a parcel, which she took in her apron, and carried to some receptacle, where she kept them till they accumulated to a large quantity, and had done so for years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The prisoner was not employed by you? - A. No, by her sister, as a chair-woman.</p>
               <p>

            Other persons serve in your shop? - A. Yes, Mr. Kelly, my clerk, is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, upon your oath, that they have not sold these articles? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-88-person872">A. </persName>
            Certainly it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a perquisite of waste paper in the trade, is not there? - A. No, I never heard of it; I know thee is no such custom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not make a promise, or tell her it would be better for her? - A. No, I never heard it said; I believe none was ever made.</p>
               <p>MARY PETTIT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. In Angel-street, Butcherhall-hall, St. Martin's-le-Grand, and was employed by Mr. Hogg to stitch books for him; the prisoner is my husband's sister, and has assisted me in the household work, but I had never missed any of the books he trusted to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know any thing of those numbers charged in the indictment, of how they came into possession of the prisoner? - A. Not at all; I know nothing about it; I gave her leave to take waste paper from my house, but, as to numbers, I cannot conceive how they could come among waste paper; neither numbers or quires are waste paper.</p>
               <p>RICHARD DAVIS sworn. - I am a cheesemonger, in Lincoln's-Inn-fields: I bought one hundred and seventy-four pounds weight of paper of the prisoner, for three-pence per pound, and delivered to Mr. Hogg one hundred and twenty-four pounds; I had used the other; that which Mr. Hogg received had remained on the shelf from the time I bought it; I did not notice that it was in quires; it was not in the same state that it is now, because it was tied up in a rough manner, with paper of different sorts, what I call waste.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You cannot venture to swear to it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you enquire who she was? - A. I understood, when I bought it, that she had sold to the man who kept the shop before me; she said, she had friends in that way; I bought it was waste paper.(

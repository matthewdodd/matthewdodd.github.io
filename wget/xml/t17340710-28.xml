            , the Prosecutor's Servant. On the 18th of January my Master had a Sum of Money brought into the House, he told it over, and put it into a Canvas-bag, and laid it upon a Prayer-Book in the right hand Chimney-corner, near his Couch; then he got out of his Chair, which stood next to the Bag, and went to sleep upon his Couch. The Prisoner, who was then sitting on the left Corner of the Chimney, got out of her Chair and sat in his. I was then in the Yard, and saw her take the Bag and put it into her Lap under a Cambrick Apron that she was mending; upon which I came in, and ask'd her where the Bag was; she said, as it was left to her charge she had taken it into her Lap for fear she should fall asleep, and somebody should come in and steal it. So I went into the Yard again, and peep'd through a Crevice of the Door, and saw her put her hand into the Bag, and take a handful of Gold out, and put it into her Pocket. Then she ty'd up the Bag again, and laid it where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173407100015"></xptr> she took it from. and then moved from my Master's Chair into her own - My Master had a Green striped Sattin Waistcoat, it was one that his late Wife used to wear; but she has been dead 9 or 10 Years. I ask'd the Prisoner, what was become of this Waistcoat? She said my Master had given it to her, and she had got it at her own House.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you acquaint your Master with what you saw the Prisoner do?</p>
               <p>Patrick. Yes, a Week or ten Days afterwards, I desir'd him to look into his Bag.</p>
               <p>Court. But why did you not speak of it sooner?</p>
               <p>Patrick. I was afraid of the Prisoner, for she bore a great Sway in the House - She was a sort of a Housekeeper, and often threaten'd to turn us away; but when I had told my Master, he turn'd her away in two or three Days after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not live constantly in the House, but came once or twice a Week, and sometimes was there a Week together. I had no settled Wages, but took what he pleas'd to give me.</p>
               <p>Juryman. Was the Writ serv'd before or after she was turn'd away?</p>
               <p>Patrick. It was after.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it before she was indicted?</p>
               <p>Patrick. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Goodcheap. The Prisoner's Husband ow'd me above 12 l. - above a Year ago the Prisoner promis'd to pay me 20 s. of it at such a Time, and when that time came, she brought me 15 s. and desir'd me to take this silk Gown, 'till she paid me the other 5 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Prosecutor gave me that Gown.</p>

            . The Prosecutor brought her to my Shop - I keep a Fish-shop in Redriff, and he lives at Blackwall - He gave me a Guinea to fetch a Quart of Brandy to make Punch. But she said, What need you change, when I have got Silver? Have you Moll? says he, then give her two Shillings, for it's all one betwixt you and I - They din'd and drank Punch together. He had dress'd up Moll. in his Wife's Clothes, and ask'd me how I lik'd her, and how I should like him for a new Kinsman? And I said, That's according as you like, Sir.</p>

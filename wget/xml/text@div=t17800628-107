               <p>I belong to the Rotation-office in Litchfield-street; I went to the house of one Mr. Gocart, in Hog-lane, three or four days after the fire at Lord Mansfield's, there I found these copper things (producing the several articles mentioned in the indictment). Gocart said he knew nothing of them. The prisoner said she bought them when he was out of the way. I believe she is a servant in the house; it is an old iron-shop; I found some on the compter and some behind it, and some were in the back shop; I took the goods, and left the prisoner. Two or three days after that, when Lord Mansfield's servants came to town, and saw these things, they said they were Lord Mansfield's, I went and told the prisoner she must come to the office. She said she would come as soon as she had put on her cap; she came there soon after me.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Gocart. Four or five fellows came in with blue cockades, and brought this copper; I said I did not buy any thing; my master keeps an open shop. They said if I did not buy them they would say we were papists, and would have the house down.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280248"></xptr> They demanded money; I gave them what money I had, and should have given them more, if I had had it in my pocket. When my master came home he asked me how they came there; I told him. He said, Let them lie there, for I suppose they come from some of the demolished houses. The next day he went out to market, and the officers saw the things and took them. There is a person here, who lodges in the house, that saw the men in the shop.</p>

On the 7th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock, while I was in my chamber, I heard a noise, I came down stairs, and saw five or six men in the house with blue cockades; they insisted upon the prisoner buying these things; she refused to buy them. They told her, if she did not buy them they would set fire to the house, because they were papists.</p>
               <p>Is the man of the house a catholick? - Yes, he is a Flemish man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Woburn's-buildings, St. Pancras. The prisoner has been in my service upwards of five years—it was part of his duty to receive money, which he should pay to me every night—on the 2nd of June I went with him round to my customers—the servant at Mr. Boyle's produced this book to me, which she kept—I found an entry there in the prisoner's writing, by which it appeared that only the last week's bread was owing for—I had much more in my books—I find entries here by the prisoner each week—the last is on the 24th of May, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that appears to have been paid, and there it a receipt in the prisoner's writing—on the 17th of May here is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 3/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. entered as received by him, and also 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 8 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the 3rd of May—I spoke to him about it at the time, and he said he would make it all right—I said I had a great mind to give him in charge at that moment, but I did not till the Wednesday following.</p>

               <p>—I cannot say that I accepted a proposition to compromise the matter—they asked me if I would—I did not make any answer to it—I told them they were at liberty to make me any proposition they thought proper—I cannot say that I accepted it—I left them to offer—I did not accept or refuse it.</p>

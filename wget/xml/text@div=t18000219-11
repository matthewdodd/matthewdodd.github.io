             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a surgeon, in Holborn: I was called in to attend the deceased, on Thursday the 6th of February; he complained of a pain in his belly, and a great soreness in making water; I ordered him what I thought necessary, but he died on the 11th, I saw him only till the 10th; when I saw him on the Friday I thought he would not live; I and Mr. Hodgson opened the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any external marks that appeared to portend to you dangerous consequences? - A. None; upon opening the belly, we found the internal covering of the lower intestines very much inflamed, nearly approaching to mortification; the bladder was in a state of mortification, and had ruptured.</p>
               <p>Q. To what cause did you ascribe his death? - A. Cold, fever, or drinking, might cause those appearances.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that fair, or cheating? - A. Cheating; the deceased put his right-hand upon the table, jumped over, and hit the prisoner in the face; the prisoner then said, you are fightable, are you; the deceased said to the prisoner, come along my lad; the prisoner came out of the box in the tap-room, and as soon as ever he was out, the deceased struck him again, and then they got to fighting, and, in the scuffle, the deceased got a hook in his hand; Mr. Lawrence, a porter in the yard, took it from him, and I threw it under the table; then they got to fighting again, and threw one another down against the tap-room door, they both fell down; then I begged and prayed the prisoner to leave off, which he did; the deceased then got up, and sat down in one corner of the tap-room; he seemed to me to be very ill, groaned very much, and seemed very full of pain; my wife went to him, and he laid his head upon her arm; she asked him if he wanted any thing to drink, and she fetched a glass of gin, and he drank about half of it; he staid about ten minutes, and then I assisted him; he walked stooping quite double, and groaned all the way home; he lodged in the same yard, and there I left him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When Mr. Lawrence took the hook from him, I said I would make it up, I would sooner pay a pot of beer than have any words with him that night? - A. I remember, very well, you wanted to make it up with him.</p>

I work up the King's-arms yard, when I am off duty; we were at work late that night with a country waggon, and my mistress gave me a pot of beer and some bread and cheese; this man came in, and challenged the best man in the house for a pot of beer at dominos; I played him for a pot of beer; I saw he had got but six cards, and when I saw that, I dropped one; and when he saw me drop a card, he got up and struck me several times, and I said I would make it up; he stuck a hook into my head, in several parts, and in my forehead, that he took out of his bosom; Mr. Lawrence took the hook out of my forehead; he would not make it up, but would fight on.</p>

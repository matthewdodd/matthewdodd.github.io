I was on duty about 4.30 in Chambers Street, Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's front door, and close it behind him—he was carrying a large black bag and a bundle under his arm—he saw me coming in the opposite direction—I followed him into Great Prescott Street, stopped him, and asked him what he had—he said "Goods"—I said, "What goods?"—he said, "Clothes I am going to take to the tailor"—I asked him to give me an account of them, and said I should have to take him to the station for unlawful possession—Balcoe came up and said, "That man has broken into my house"—I went back and examined the premises, and found the prisoner had climbed over a wall between 7 and 8 feet high—there was a broken pane of glass, and a brick torn out of the wall where he had climbed up.</p>

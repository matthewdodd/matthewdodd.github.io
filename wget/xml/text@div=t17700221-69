She lived a fortnight after, all but three days. He went and surrendered himself up to the constable. He was asked how he came by the pistol? he said, He found it, but did not know that it was charged. He said to her as she lay in bed, If you die, have you any thing to lay to my charge? she said, No: what I have to say, let it fall upon myself.</p>

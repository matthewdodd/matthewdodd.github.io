            . I superintend the going out of the teas from the yard after delivery. On the 5th of November, I saw a horse and cart come to the yard; the two prisoners and another man were with it - the other man had some permits in his hand, and he said he wanted five chests of tea, for Brown, of Watling-street, and gave me two permits; I said it was usual for Mr. Brown to send his own cart, and likewise a man who I knew well, but it was not him, nor either of the two prisoners - the prisoners were within hearing at this time; Bennett then said, "You must know me, I lived with Watson and Heath, but I am now in the service of Brown of Watling-street;" the man who gave me the permits, saw I was very doubtful, and he said, "I will go home and send our own cart, and then you will be at a point - but there is Jones our porter at the bottom of the yard, you must know him, I will go and fetch him;" he then went down the yard - I walked round the cart, and saw on it the name of William Hill, Church-street, Newington, Surrey; my suspicions were then very much excited, and I looked again at the permits; I saw the name of Constable on one, and Bowyer on the other - they were Nos. 497, 498, 499, 400, and 491; I told my partner, in the prisoner's hearing, that I was persuaded things were not right - we shut the gates and detained the cart; one chest, No. 490, by the London, had been put into the cart by Bennett and a person acting in the yard - it is impossible that there could be another chest with the same number, and the same ship.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. In these permits, is the name of the ship mentioned? A. Yes, certainly - this is the permit which has this chest on it; the name of the proprietor is always on it - here is the name of Mr. Constable; they are quite right, except not being presented by the right person; this chest had been put into the cart - the person who brought the permits had a pen behind his ear, like a person serving in a shop - I think I had seen Bennett before, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had the third man mentioned the name of Brown first? A. Yes, before Bennett had said any thing - I do not know Broughton; he did nothing but stand by the head of the horse.</p>

            . I am yardsman at the warehouse, at Crutched-friars. The two prisoners came there with a cart and another person - Price looked out the chests of tea, and Bennett, with my assistance, removed No. 490, by the London, into the cart; Price then said he had strong suspicious, and no more should go into the cart; I then made Bennett lift the chest out of the cart to the pile where it had been before, which he did very reluctantly; I have seen Mr. Brown's cart before, but I never saw these men with it - Bennett wanted to escape, but I ran and shut the gates; a man, named Hickman, had then got into the street, and cried Stop thief! no one has appeared to claim the horse and cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.These permits related to the goods in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010082"></xptr>possession of the East India Company? A. Yes, they relate to these teas, but the names on the permits are not what they asked for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did not Bennett remain at the cart and say he would not go till he got his shilling? A. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PRICE re-examined. I sent to Mr. Brown's in Watling-street - I told him what Bennett had said; he said they never were in his employ.</p>

            . I am a warehouseman at the East India Company's warehouse. I was present on the 5th of November, and I went to Mr. Brown's in Watling-street; I found but one tea-dealer of that name there - I brought Mr. Brown to the yard; he said, in the prisoners' presence, he had never employed them, and knew nothing about them - the prisoners made no answer to that - I was there when the prisoners first came with a horse and cart, about ten minutes past three o'clock; the other man, who was with them, had the two permits, which he gave to Price; I asked Price what they wanted - he said five chests; I went to some chests of green tea, which we call twankay - I pulled one over, which was No. 490; Edwards and Bennett lifted it into the cart; I said to Price, "This is not Mr. Brown's cart" - Bennett said, "Our cart is gone another way, and we were obliged to get this cart to come;" I said I never saw him with Mr. Brown's cart before - he said, "I come occssionally;" I turned, and said to one of our elders, "There is something suspicions in this case; I shall stop the horse and cart, and the men" - the man, who had brought the permits, had then walked out; I walked down the yard, and Bennett followed me - I said,"It is of no use your following me, you shall not go out;" he pointed to a man over the way, in black breeches and a blue waistcoat, and said, "That is the man that got the permits;" I beckoned to the man, but be ran away - he was not the man who had come into the yard with the pen in his ear; my partner cried Stop thief! and he was taken, but discharged at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Bennett followed you down the yard? A. Yes, and I told him he should not go out; I was going to look for the man who brought the permits -I cannot say whether Bennett followed me for the purpose of pointing the man out; I had not said any thing about a man before we began to move - when we got about ten yards Bennett said, "That is the man that got the permits;" he could not see that man from where the cart stood.</p>

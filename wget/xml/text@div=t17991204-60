             sworn. - I am a watchman; I saw the warehouse, the lock of the door was forced almost off; I was called by my brother about half after one on Wednesday morning, I sent my brother to get a constable and I and another watchman stood to mind the door, that the man did not come out; when the constables came we forced the door open upon him, and pushed him down over the sugar; she was taken to the Compter, and the sugar delivered to the constable.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MACKENZIE sworn. - I am a patrol; at half past one o'clock, the watchman came to the watch-house, and I went with the watchman to this house, where we found the prisoner; I forced the door open upon him; when she found that he could not keep the door any longer, she was making off, and tumbled down over the sugar, and I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>- WILLIAMS sworn. - I am constable of Dowgate-ward; I was sent for from the watch-house, we went to the house, forced open the door, and the first that I saw was the prisoner, lying down in the passage, and the bag of sugar along side of him (produces the sugar); I heard something drop from him, and looked and found this instrument (producing an instrument); one end of it answered the purpose of a crow, and the other as a claw hammer.</p>

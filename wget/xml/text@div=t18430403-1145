On the 3rd of Mar., about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Drury-lane, and saw the prisoner go into a gin-shop with a basket, which appeared very heavy—I went into the house, and asked him what he had done with the basket—he said he had no basket—my brother constable brought a basket from the tap-room, which was a few yards off—it appeared to be the one he was carrying—it contained a quan<lb></lb>tity of lead, a hammer and saw—I asked how he came by it—he said he had no basket—I took him to the station—the inspector there asked him how he came by it—he said his employer sent him to sell it, and his name was Hurst.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went into the public-house with Hine, and saw the prisoner carry the basket into the tap-room—he came out of the room, leaving it there—Hine asked what he had done with it—he said, he had no basket—I went into the tap-room, and brought it out, with 65lbs. of lead—I went next day to Angel-court, Strand, and found a quantity of lead taken off the roof—I compared that in the basket, and it corresponded with what was left—it was only part of what was missing—Roach was dis<lb></lb>charged by the magistrate.</p>

I live in the Strand, and have premises in Angel-court—the prisoner was employed by Roach, my bricklayer, as a labourer in the cellar on some premises four doors from this house—he could pass along the roofs of the houses—I saw the lead compared—there is not a doubt of it having come from the roof.</p>

On the 3rd of March, I was employed at No. 2, Surrey-street, four houses from Angel-court—the prisoner was employed under Roach—I never authorized the prisoner to sell the lead or any part of it, and did not know he had got it—the first knowledge I had of it was from the policeman.</p>

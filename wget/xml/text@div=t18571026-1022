                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On 5th Oct. I was on duty at Isle<lb></lb>worth between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning, and as I passed the gate of some gardens belonging to Mr. Wilmot, in the Hounslow Road, I heard footsteps in the garden, went towards the gate, and saw the prisoner coming over it—(there were a quantity of pears on the ground by the gate)—I asked the prisoner what he had got in his bag; he said, "Nothing"—I asked him again, and he said that it was nothing to do with me—I said, "These are pears in the bag," and that I believed they had come out of Mr. Wilmot's garden, and I should take him into custody for stealing them—he said that he should not go with me—I took hold of the bag of pears, and of him by the collar of his coat—he struck me in the face with his fist, put his legs between mine, and threw me down; we both fell together—when we were on the ground, he tried to gouge my eye with his</p>

               <p>thumb; he put it on the side of my eye in a very severe manner, but I wrenched his hand away; he then took hold of my collar, and tried to throttle me while I was lying on the ground—I called out for assistance, got partly up, and sprang my rattle—he threw me down again, and after a good deal of struggling I got the best of him, and got up, and drew my staff; he took hold of it, and pulled me on top of him; he flung his legs round mine, and said that if I did not let him go, he would jump my b—guts out—I still kept hold of him, and would not—the string of my staff broke, and after a great deal of struggling the prisoner got possession of it, and struck me across the bridge of the nose with it while we were still on the ground—I was not able to more for two or three minutes, and when I lifted myself up, the prisoner was about twenty yards away from me—he came back, and struck me across the head, which caused the blood to flow; he also struck me on the back of the right ear, and I was not able to stir for some time—there was a very great deal of blood; it was flowing from my nose and also from the wound in my head—the prisoner went in the direction of Brentford; I was not able to follow' him—I called a party to assist me to a surgeon's, and gave information to another constable—I saw the prisoner in custody from 2 to half past 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and I have not the least doubt of his being the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Isleworth, and am in the employ of Miss 8 quires, a basket maker. I live near Mr. Wilmot's—on Monday morning, 5th Oct., I was awoke by a cry of "Murder!" and saw a policeman scuffling with another man—I saw the man go from the policeman, and return, and hit him, and go away, and return and hit him again—he hit him on the head with something which he had in his hand—I did not see enough of the man to be able to say who he was—I did not see his dress.</p>

On 5th Oct, about 1 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in New Brentford, and saw the prisoner coming in the direction of Old Brentford from Hounslow and from Wilmot's—it is about a quarter of a mile from Wilmot's to where I was standing—he was in his shirt sleeves, and had his coat on his arm—I asked him where he came from; he said that he had turned in with some of his mates, and the landlord found that he was not billeted there, and turned him out—I turned my light on him, and saw that his face was smothered with blood—I told him that he had blood about his face, and that I suspected he had been fighting—he said, "I had a <hi rend="italic">scrimmage</hi> with some of my mates"—he showed me a scar on the right side of his neck, but there was no wound bleeding at the time—he said that he had been in the war, and was wounded—the blood appeared like a smear from a hand—after talking several minutes, he went on from me—I afterwards received information of what had happened to Botterell, and went after the prisoner with another constable—we met him about 1 o'clock the same afternoon, coming from Brentford, in the direction of Hounslow—I said that he was the very man I wanted to see, that he was charged with assaulting a police constable in Hounslow Road; he said that he had been in London all night—I am quite sure he is the person I met at 1 o'clock in the morning, in New Brentford—I took him to Botterell's house that afternoon.</p>

I was stationed at Brentford, and on 5th Oct, about a quarter to 2 o'clock in the night, I was on duty, and met a man with his coat on his arm, going towards Kew Bridge, away from the Hounslow side of Brentford—I stopped him, and he asked me if I knew where he could get a lodging, that he had been knocking at his billet house"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Isleworth. On 5th Oct I was called to see Botterell; he was supported by a policeman and another person; he was much exhausted, and covered with blood and dirt—there was a wound on the top of his head, and he was in a very exhausted state—I should say that he had bled a great deal—he was only under my care a sufficient time to get him into a state to walk home—the wounds on his nose and head had been inflicted by a blunt instrument.</p>

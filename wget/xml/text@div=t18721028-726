               <p>7th October I was on duty in Peter Street, Westminster, and saw the prisoner with his coat off fighting with another man—when he saw me he ran down the court—I followed him to take him in custody—he had been causing a disturbance all the evening—I caught him in a passage at the back of 13, Peter Street, but he got away, and got in at the back door; I got it half open, and he put his back to the door—he halloaed out "Come down and bring a stick," and then he said "You b—, if you put a hand on me, I will put a knife into you," and he put a knife into my wrist—the door was then shut—I waited till my sergeant came round; we then went in and searched the house, but did not find the prisoner—as we came out I lifted up the cellar-flap and found him there—he said that it was not he who caused the disturbance in the street, it was several others—a window was broken in the house; I did not open it—I am certain my hand was cut with a knife and not by the broken window.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a crowd in the street, and when they saw me they fled in all directions—it was some time after that that I saw the prisoner again—nobody ran into the house but the prisoner; he was the only one who went down the court—the prisoner was behind the door, but I was half-way in and could see him—he denied cutting me.</p>

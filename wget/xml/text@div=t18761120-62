                  </hi>. I live at Roxley, North Cray, Kent, and am a labourer—I remember going home to Roxley Farm on Saturday night, 12th August, at about 10 o'clock—I had a basket with me, containing a little piece of beef, a loaf of bread, and tea and sugar—I had 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my smock pocket—when I was going over the hill I met the three prisoners—I passed by and said "Good night, lads," and stepped on to the footpath running along the high road—I saw they followed me, and I had not got far before they all came on me at once—I felt their hands in my pocket robbing me—then they got me down and got atop of me, and knocked me about the head and arms, hurting me very much and making a wound across my eye—I heard a footstep along the bottom of the hill, and they got up and ran away—I got up and saw my basket was gone, and then my nose went off bleeding—my 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was gone—I kept my hand where my shillings were—I saw a policeman, and made a complaint to him—I went home—I had lost my hat—next morning I went to the spot again at about 4 o'clock, day<lb></lb>break—I looked for my hat, and looking down another road I saw three persons down by a shed—I know'd they were the same, and I hid myself under the hedge—they came on to the pitch of the hill, and I heard one say "How he stuck to his pocket," and another "He lost his things," and when they got 2 rods further on one said "I did hit him "—I goes on a little further into a shore—then I looked down to see if I could see any policeman down Foot's Cray, but no man or soul could I see about—I came back again, and I heard a footstep on the North Cray Road, and then I lost them all at once—then I took and shot right back to the police station—I afterwards went to the police-station at about 8 or 9 o'clock at night, and I went into the court where there were others, and I looked round and saw them, and I said "My lads, I must give you in charge for robbing me on the high road "—they said nothing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Adams</hi>. I started away from London on Thursday, and got down to Foot's Cray on Friday. I asked for a job, and I started work at 6.30 and stopped till Saturday evening. We went into a public-house and had some tea, and came out about 7.30. I am quite innocent, and know nothing at all about it.</p>

               <p>Archibald McDowell (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 371). On Saturday night, 12th August, at about 12.20, I met the prosecutor between Foots Cray and Roxley Hill—he was bleeding from several severe wounds on the face and seemed quite stunned—about an hour and a half after I saw the three prisoners and another man in a shed of Mr. King's, Foot's Cray, about half a mile from the hill—I went in and asked them what brought them there, and they told me that the foreman of the place had told them they might stop there that night—I saw them again in the morning, about 5.30, in Foot's Cray Road, just on the bridge; that was before the prosecutor had been to the station—I did not speak to them—afterwards some other in<lb></lb>formation was brought to the station, and I went with Sergeant Dixon in search of them in private clothes, and saw them all three together on Foot's Cray Bridge at about 6 o'clock, Sunday afternoon—we told them we had suspicions of their being the persons who had violently assaulted and robbed the prosecutor the night before on Roxley Hill—they said nothing—we took them to the station, and the prosecutor was sent for, and he identified them by the side of six or eight others, one of whom was provided with a white smock like one of the prisoners—he had not the slightest difficulty in picking them out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farm labourer, of Roxley—I saw the three prisoners together under a hedge on Sunday afternoon, 13th August, about half a mile from Roxley Hill—they had a basket with them—when I was coming over the stile one picks up the basket and puts it up behind—one says "What is the time?" and I say "4.55," and another said "What time are publics open?" and I said "6 o'clock"—I don't know what became of the basket.</p>

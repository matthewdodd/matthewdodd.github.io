               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner taking a small quantity of oats and beans on the 7th of September last - A. I believe it was the 7th, a little after five in the morning, I observed the prisoner coming out of the stable with something in his smock frock; I let him walk about forty or fifty yards; I then tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him what he had got there; he said a little horse corn, it was the first time, and he hoped for mercy; I brought him back to the stable door; I told him to stay there until I brought something to put the corn in, and while I went he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180047"></xptr>strewed the corn about the yard as thin as he could. It was beans and oats mixed for the cart horses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a little horse, I let Mr. Nicolls have it to ride over the farm; he was to feed it. I took this little corn to give to the horse, I did not at the moment think I was acting wrong; I am now convinced of my error and am sorry for it, I should not have thought of taking the oats if the foreman had not have had the horse.</p>
               <p>Nicolls. With regard to the poney, when the young man Mr. Harper had it, it was in the lane, it was literally starving; the young man asked me to give him some corn, provided he would let him ride it for a week, and then it was in our stable. The poney had been returned about ten days before this transaction.</p>
               <p>The prisoner two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

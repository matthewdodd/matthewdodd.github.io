               <p>some note-paper—they both looked at the articles in the shop—Stone paid for the paper—the dressing-case now produced was afterwards shown to me by Braddick, the officer, and a pocket-book—there were pocket-books on my counter—I know the dressing-case, it had not been sold, and this red book, which was taken at the same time—this is such writing-paper as I sold them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of pavements for the parish of St. Giles. On the 31st of May, between eight and nine o'clock, I saw the prisoners in Drury-lane—Stone had his coat over his arm, and something bulky under it—I followed them to a shop in Tottenham-court-road—they came out and went into another shop—I spoke to the master of the shop—in consequence of what he said, I followed, and took them into custody in Tottenham-court-road—I asked Stone where he got this dressing-case from, which I took from under his arm—he said it was his own, and he had brought it from home—I searched Voisin at the station, and found the note-paper and pocket-book on him—I asked where he got them—he said he could not speak English—I took the articles to Mr. Dobson, whose name was on the dressing-case, and he identified them—they were about a mile from Mr. Dobson's.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOBSON</hi>. I know this dressing-case—it is quite new, and had only been in my house two days—it is an advertised case by an "advertised libeller"—an opposition shop—I bought it to see what it was like—the selling-price as advertised was a guinea—I changed the instruments, and added about 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to its value—I could sell it for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, and get 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by it—I should sell it for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;</p>

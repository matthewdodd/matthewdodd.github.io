            . I am an officer. Between two and three o'clock I went to the privy at the back of Guildhall, while I was there this truss was thrown against the door. When I came out two gentleman said a man in a smock-frock had thrown it there. While they were talking to me I saw the prisoner in the yard, he came from Basinghall-street. The gentlemen said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man who brought it here!" The moment they spoke, he turned back and ran away - I called Stop thief! and followed him into Church-passage, Basinghall-street - a person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270008"></xptr>stopped him there. I took him back, and when I came into Basinghall-street he said,</p>
               <p>"That is the cart - a man in a velveteen jacket gave it to me out of that cart to carry for him." I took him to where the truss was - the gentlemen were there, and said they would follow me, but did not. I saw no man in a velveteen jacket. It was Brooks's cart.</p>

            . On Monday afternoon, between two and three o'clock, I was in Basinghall-street, heard the cry of Stop thief, and saw the prisoner running very fast - I collared him; he said,</p>
               <p>"Pray let me go, I was only going to take it into Cheapside for a man." I said,</p>
               <p>"Where is the man?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I have lost him all at once." Drinkwater came up and took him.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man dressed in a velveteen jacket stood by the horse, and asked me to take it to Cheapside; he gave it me out of the cart, and said he would follow me. I could not find the way through the passage, he told me to put it behind the door and follow him - I did so and lost him. I returned to the yard, the officer called Stop thief, and being afraid, I ran away,</p>

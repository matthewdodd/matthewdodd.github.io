                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 273). On 25th Aug. I was at Lewisham, just above the turnpike, and heard a noise about 150 yards from the railway station like the pulling a door to—I turned my light on, and saw the prisoner and another man not in custody walk from a shutter, which fell the minute they walked from, it—I ran towards them, and they ran away</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140096"></xptr>
               <p>as far as a public house—I turned back, sprang my rattle, and brought two other constables, and gave them a description of the men and which way they had gone—one of them ran down Hanover Street, which leads over the bridge, to New Cross—in three or four minutes afterwards another constable brought the prisoner to me—I asked him where he had come from, and what he had been doing at the shop; he said, "Nothing," and that he had just come from Bromley—I took him to the shop where the shutter fell, and found it on the ground; it had been prised with some instrument—it was a watch maker's and jeweller's shop—I went back with the officer who took him to the spot where he was taken, and found this instrument (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found on him, at the station, a handful of lucifer matches—I have no doubt of the prisoner being the man; I knew his features before, but not his name; and as he ran to and fro, I had a good opportunity of seeing him by the lamp at the toll gate—he gave his address accurately, but I could not find him by that name; he goes by the name of Brown—I went with Macknell, and picked up this old key close to where the prisoner was apprehended; it has been made into the shape of a chisel—there was a mark on the shutter where it fitted, and another mark on the bottom of the shutter where an instrument two inches wide had been used.</p>

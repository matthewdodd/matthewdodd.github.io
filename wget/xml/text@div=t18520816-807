                  </hi>. I live at 45, Queen-street, New North-road, and work at Mr. Tirebuck's printing establishment, in Monk well-street. The prisoner was an apprentice there—it is the custom for the workmen to go to dinner at 1 o'clock—there is a room adjoining the shop, in which we dress after wash<lb></lb>ing—a person must come through the shop to go there—there is no open communication with the street—I never go out to dinner, but stop to look after the place—the prisoner was in the habit of going at 1; but on 15th July, having some work to finish, he did not go till half past—from the time the other men went at 1, and when the prisoner went, no one came in—I had a waistcoat hanging up in this dressing room, with a silver watch and chain in it—I saw it safe there at 10 minutes past 1 when I went and got some money out of it—the prisoner's clothes were also in that room, and when he left he went there, put his clothes on, went away, and I did not see him for a week afterwards, when he was brought back by his mother—I went into the room at a little to 2, and found my waistcoat was gone, and the watch—two of the men had then come back, and gone into that room; one of them was still in the room, and I immediately communicated it to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you present? A. No - I have no recollection of it; I bring it here in the course of my office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are your principals present when these affidavits are made? A. In general - they were on this occasion, because it is signed by one of them, and, had none of them been present, I should have signed it - they would not have signed it if they had not been present.</p>
               <p>RICHARD CASE COLLS. I was last year an <rs id="t18261207-74-viclabel438" type="occupation">assistant-surgeon</rs>

The prisoner lived nearly opposite to me; I became acquainted with him in the beginning of 1825, when he sent a note for me to bleed him - he was not in business at that time, but I understood from himself, that he had been running a coach - a legacy had been left me, which the prisoner did not know then, but did afterwards. About July, 1825, he stated a great deal to me about coaches, and said if I liked to have any concern with him, he was going to run a London coach, and if I would advance him 100l., I should have three horses, half a new set of harness, and half the profits, and if I did not approve of the business, there was an agreement entered into; it is burnt - I did not see it burnt - I understood so from Mr. Becket; if I did not like, the agreement was, that I might return the horses and harness, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070047"></xptr>money should he returned to me; I continued to run them about seven or eight weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any limited time for you to see whether you liked or disliked it? A. No - after I had run them some time, I told him I did not like the concern, and requested him to return me the money according to his agreement; I returned the horses, and he told me he could not pay the 100l., but wished me to draw a bill on him at three months - this was in October - it became due in January - he accepted it, but did not pay any part of it when due; I produced the bill (this bill was here read, it was a promissory note for 136l., and interest for the same, dated October, at three months, signed T. Becket; and endorsed was a receipt for 21l. dated March 9, 1826 -"11th of March, received for rent and fixtures of place, No. 26, Blackfriars-road, 6l. 10s. 8d.") I have given him credit on the back for all I ever received on account of the bill. I received this letter from him about the end of March, or beginning of April last - it is not dated - he gave it me himself - (the following extract from the letter produced was here read, "N. B. The balance of 108l. 10s. 8d. shall shortly be paid, that we may quit friends") - subsequent to the receipt of this letter, I was arrested at the suit of the prisoner for 21l. - this was at the end of June - I was taken to a lock-up house in George-street, Blackfriars-road, and kept there two days and two nights; on my solemn oath, I did not owe him a farthing, but he owed me the balance of the bill 108s. 10s. 8d. - about five minutes after I got to the lock-up house, the defendant called on me, and much violent altercation took place upon the impropriety of his arresting me; I told him he had perjured himself - he said if I used any such abusive language as that, he would take his hat and go out - in about half an hour he sent for some porter, and asked if I would have some, and told me he had arrested me on purpose, that I might not be hostile to him with regard to his commission of bankruptcy (he was a bankrupt at that time, as I understood, by the papers), and that he was going to bring an action against a clergyman in Lincolnshire, which he could not do without my evidence; he said he would endeavour to get me out, but it was too late that night; he called several times next day; I was afterwards liberated, and he paid all the expenses; I am married - my wife was at home - she called at the lock-up house that night, but whether while the defendant was there I do not know - (here the following extract from the letter produced was read,"This is the account as it stands, leaving to you 108l. 10s. 8d. of my own good will and gift.")</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the first application, on the coach account, made by you to the defendant? A. No. I did not tell him I was tired of my profession, by which I was not getting a farthing, and wish him to allow me to horse a coach; I swear that - Herbert Evans was our book-keeper - he was about three months in our employ - we were concerned in two coaches - the bill was the balance of all accounts; he sold me five horses and half a set of new harness; they came to 106l.; I was to horse the Worcester coach from there to Pershore, which is nine miles, no further; I was to horse the Independent coach to Bromyard, fourteen miles; I did that five or six weeks; I was to pay for the forage of the horses on that stage - the defendant paid that, but it was settled in the balance - I could see the books when I liked - I cannot say whether Evans, the book-keeper, knows of my paying for the forage; I think I never conversed with him on that subject; I swear that I paid it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give the defendant a bill for any money you owed him? A. Yes; and that bill was cancelled at the time of our settlement - it was not given up to me; he told me he had burnt it at the time of the settlement - nobody was present; I know the defendant was a bankrupt; I swear he said he arrested me that I might not be hostile; he was not a bankrupt when we made the settlement, nor had he even told me he was about to become one - what I mean by the settlement is, when he gave me this promissory note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If the note had been paid, it would have been a settlement? A. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you say whether he become a bankrupt, or arrested you first? A. I cannot exactly state - I think he was a bankrupt about a week before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, when you gave him the 21l. bill, owe him 150l.? A. No. I had taken no proceedings on my bill before he arrested me; nobody was present when I paid him for the horses and harness - I took no receipt - I received a note from him, saying, he had the 21l. bill, and if I did not pay it, I should be arrested; I believe he has stated he has a claim of above 100l. on me; I do not know E. Eastwood, and am not aware that I ever saw him - I was at a house in Basinghall-street with the defendant and a gentleman; I was not then in conversation with him on the subject of our accounts - nobody was present when we talked about our affairs; I never said the 108l. bill was nothing but an accommodation bill, or that the defendant liberated me, on my promise to give up that bill, and call it an accommodation bill; I never had any conversation with the defendant on the subject of this bill in the presence of Evans - he was not present when this bill was drawn, nor sent out to buy a stamp; the defendant advanced to me the keep of the five horses for about five weeks; I did not pay him weekly - it was settled monthly, with the coach accounts, out of the earnings of the coach, instead of giving it to me; the book-keeper is aware of that, I should think.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not some coach stopped, and 500l. due to the defendant in consequence of it? A. I do not know that he was to receive 500l. - he never told me so; I was witness to a signature on a stamp; this bill was not given for my expenses and trouble on that occasion; I never stated in Evans' presence that it was given for that; Becket gave me the bill in his lodgings, at Worcester - Evans was not present at any conversation about this bill being given - Becket never told me he had brought an action to recover the 500l. - I am now assistant to a physician; I was living with Mr. Humphreys, an attorney, when I was served with this writ; I lived four or five months with him, and have left only ten days; I lived with Messrs. Raymond and Co., at Worcester; when I settled with the defendant for the keep of the horses, I had the books; the book-keeper was not there; I received 28s. or 29s. as my share of the profit, after he had paid himself for the horses; I have not proved this debt under his commission, as I intended to take him for it afterwards; I went to examine his ba<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070048"></xptr>lance sheet before the Commissioners - they asked if I was a creditor; I said, Yes, but declined proving.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. If you had, you must have given up your bill? A. Yes; what I call the settlement, was the bill being given; nobody was present.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the 136l. bill was given, there had been a 21l. bill given before; what became of that? A. It was cancelled; this bill was given as a final settlement of every item on both sides; Becket said he had burnt it; it was reckoned before the balance was struck of 136l.; there was no money transaction of any kind after that, or any thing upon which a debt could accrue.</p>

            . I am a commission-broker. I have known the defendant several years - I have seen Colls once or twice - I saw him in company with Becket, who said to me, "This is my friend Mr. Colls, who I mentioned to you before;" some conversation took place, and Becket said, "We have had some differences, but they are now made up;" Colls nodded assent; this was on the 5th of August; some of Becket's friends then came up, and Becket went away with them; Colls told me he was very sorry for what had passed, and he would do any thing for him; that Becket had arrested him for a 21l. bill, and at the same time he had a bill of his for 108l. - he considered the arrest was unjust, but matters were settled between them - he said Becket had released him, and they had settled their differences - that Becket was a good fellow, and he would do any thing to serve him - he did not say he had promised to give up the 108l. bill - this was after the arrest, on the day of the third meeting of Becket's creditors - he walked into the Bankrupt-court, and I asked if he meant to prove his debt - he said, No, they had settled their differences; he did not say where the bill was - Becket bears the character of a perfect gentleman.</p>

I was book-keeper to these parties; Mr. Colls horsed the coach to Birmingham - Mr. Becket fed the horses for about three months - I was never present when Colls paid Becket any of the money advanced: I never saw this 136l. bill before; I was present when a bill was given by Becket to Colls; I bought the stamp - this was the latter end of October, or the beginning of November 1825, for it was after the London coach had stopped, which was on the 28th of October; the other coach stopped on the 10th of November; I heard Colls say it was an accommodation bill - it was said Colls was principal witness to the signing of a bond respecting the stopping of a coach, and he being necessary to prove the signature of Mr. Bowen of Pershore, Colls said it would be a great expense to come from London to Worscester to give evidence, and wanted 150l.; and after consideration, Becket gave him a 140l. bill, considering the 40l. would pay his expenses if he was absent a week, and the 100l. to put into his pocket - I heard this between Colls and Becket.</p>


               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. What are you now? A. I am in the employ of Mr. Hyde, an attorney at Worcester - I left the defendant's service in November, 1825; before that, I lived with a Mr. Clark, who made a charge against me for having misapplied some of his money - I had left him before I heard of it - he is a coach-owner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the defendant dismiss you for embezzling his money? A. No - I left them because the coach stopped - I was not charged with going off with 50l. or 60l. - I never saw a bill paid by my father to Becket - I never heard of his paying the defendant any money on my account - I went from him to Mr. Hyde.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any charge true or false made by Mr. Becket? Q. No - I left on the 10th of November.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Mr. Clark make any charge against you? A. No; he was under-sheriff of Worcester last year; both coaches had stopped in 1825.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. With respect to the 140l., what became of the action? A. It dropped on account of Becket being involved; he could not carry it on.</p>

            . On the 17th of July, I was crossing from Long-acre to Drury-lane, and I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Morgan's shop, with a bundle under his left arm - I asked him what he had got - he d-d my eyes, and asked what it was to me - he knocked me down and ran away - he dropped three parcels near Broad-court, and I secured him with one - he was never out of my sight - he ill used me very sadly - I have been under the doctor's hands ever since - the bundles were picked up - they are black velvet - he had one when I took him.</p>

             - I was called down stairs about twenty minutes or half-past nine o'clock - I found the velvet gone from the shop, it had stood about two feet within the door of the shop - three pieces were brought back by the next witness - I saw the prisoner with the other at the station-house - it is worth Â£7 altogether - that is rather under the value, I had seen it ten minutes before.</p>

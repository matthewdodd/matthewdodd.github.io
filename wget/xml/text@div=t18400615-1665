                  </hi>I am a barrister. In July, 1838, I occu<lb></lb>pied chambers in Parliament-street, in the parish of St. James, Westmin<lb></lb>ster—I had lived there three or four months—the prisoner was employed to take care of the various chambers—I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—in the course of that month I gave a cheque for 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Saffrey to go and get charge for me—in the course of the day I received the change from Mr. Saffrey—there were two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I cannot remember the rest—I do not remember the number of either of them—I paid a bill of exchange with one of them—the other note I deposited in my iron</p>

               <p>chest which I had in my chambers—I locked it, and put the key in a secretary—the prisoner was in the room at the time—I do not know whether he saw me put the note into the iron safe—I do not know whether I took the key of the secretary out after I had locked it—I went to the Opera, and returned about eleven o'clock—I went to the secretary, but the key was not there, I could not find it any where and have not found it since—two or three days after I caused the secretary to be broken open—I found the key of the iron chest there—I went to the chest immediately, and missed the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I then told the prisoner I had missed a note—I did not accuse him of taking it, because I did not think myself justified in doing so—he said he was very sorry that it had occurred, and was very much astonished and hurt about it—I did not hear any thing more about it till a month or six weeks ago, when the note was shown to me by inspector Busain, and he also brought a small key with him—the moment I saw it I said it was my key, but I cannot swear to it,—it is not a common sort of key—I have not the same secretary now—I disposed of it six months ago.</p>

                  </hi> I am a traveller, and live at Everard's-buildings, Back Church-lane. On 3rd Feb. the prisoner came to me, and said he had got an order for wages, but could not get them till they got a letter from the coun<lb></lb>try—he took a piece of paper out of a cigar-case—he asked me if I would let him have 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did so—he said the ship was paid off at Antwerp, and the coin he should receive there would not amount to what he had to receive in London—he said he received it from the captain—he did not mention his name—I let him have more money on several other occasions—the first time I read the note was on the Tuesday or Wednesday in the next week, when I went with him to Mr. Arnold's office—he came down with a cigar-case in his hand, and said, "What can I do? I can get no money; but Mr. Arnold says it is all right, he has accepted his name on the back of it"—I looked over his shoulder at the order—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went with him every morning during the week to Mr. Arnold's—we never saw him—on 12th Feb. the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184802280146"></xptr>
               <p>came to my house and said, "I cannot get this order cashed; they have put me off again; you know it is right, or else Mr. Arnold would not advance me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it; do you think Mr. Crellin will cash it for me, deduct<lb></lb>ing what I owe you and him?"—I took the note, and gave him half a crown—he got 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from me altogether—on Sunday morning I went to Mr. Arnold—the prisoner was not aware I was going, I had told him to let it stand over till Monday—I should not have given him the half-crown if he had not given me the order.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Joseph Hayman Arnold of clement's-lane, Lombard-street, shipping-agent. I first saw the prisoner about six months ago—he came two or three times in Feb., and said he had a claim for a doctor's bill, for being left sick at Monte Video, and he had left the order six months before, and had had to go on another voyage, and could not get it—we said we did not know anything about it, and could but write to the owner—he called several times—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on account of the doctor's bill—he gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I do not know a Cap<lb></lb>tain Robert Taylor of the barque <hi rend="italic">Sagittarius</hi>—Mr. Arnold is not the agent for the ship, or for the captain, or for any of his ships—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was never paid to the prisoner on account of this note—I do not know whose writing it is—I have seen the prisoner write, and believe this acceptance to be his—I never told the prisoner I had not received orders from the captain to pay it—he never asked me for it.</p>

I took the Pri<lb></lb>soner on board the <hi rend="italic">Ajax</hi> steamer—he asked me what it was for—I said it was for putting his pen to paper for what he ought not to do—he said, going along, he should give them a <hi rend="italic">puzzler</hi> in his name, and he did not think they would have been so fast on him as they were.</p>

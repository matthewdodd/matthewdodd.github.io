I lived, on 11th March, in King-street—on that day the prisoner Lynch came to my shop, between 12 and 1 o'clock, for 3 lbs. of potatoes; my wife served her in my presence—I saw her pay a sixpence; my wife gave her three pence change, and she left the shop—my wife turned the sixpence over, and handed it to me; I saw it was bad, and I called Lynch back, who was twenty or thirty yards off—I said to her, "Where do you live? this is a bad sixpence "—she said she lived nowhere—I asked her where she slept last night; she said some-where in the Borough, and she got the sixpence from her nephew—I was bending the sixpence in her presence, and she said, "Don't destroy it; I must take it back to my nephew, where I got it from "—I marked it, and bent it, and gave it her, and she left—I followed her, and saw her sit down at the corner of King-street, Old Kent-road, for about twenty or twenty-five minutes, and then the other two prisoners came up to her—she got up, and they had two or three words together, and went away together—I afterwards saw them in Surrey-square, which is 300 or 400 yards from where Lynch had been sitting—I gave information to a policeman—I then missed the prisoners for a short time—I saw them again in King-street, about 150 yards from Surrey-square—I saw Jones and Cowderoy leave Lynch, and go into Mr. M'Donald's, in King-street—Lynch was coining towards where I was standing—I saw Jones and Cowderoy come out of Mr. M'Donald's shop—I cannot say that they joined Lynch, but they went into Mrs. Herbert's, which is a few doors from Mrs. M'Donald's—I after<lb></lb>wards saw the prisoners taken; I went to the station with them—when Lynch was taken I observed a sixpence drop from the side of her; No. 209 picked it up, and showed it to me—it was the one I had been hammering and marked.</p>

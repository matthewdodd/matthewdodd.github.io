            : On Monday, the 26th of March last, the prisoners, Blew and Gooch, came to our shop, and asked to look at some calico; I shewed them several pieces, and they disputed about the quantity; one said they would take a whole piece of calico, and the other said only a yard and a half; Blew fixed upon one piece of calico, and agreed for the price of it, which was two guineas and a half; she said I was to send it home into Bedford-row, next door to Dr. Latham's house; they were going out of the shop, and the prisoner Gooch laid down three shillings, and said the remainder of the money should be paid when the goods were sent home. From their conduct, and from her saying she lived in Bedford-row, and she not appearing a person of that respectability, I suspected they had an intention of stealing; our porter was in the shop the whole time; he does not serve; I followed them to the door, and saw them turn the corner, into Featherstone-buildings; I called the porter, and sent him to watch where they went to.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160033"></xptr>In the mean time I went to the counter to see if I missed any thing, and I missed the piece of muslin in question.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the prisoners said they lived the next door to Dr. Latham's? - A. Blew; the other prisoner only gave me the three shillings, and called Mrs. Blew, mother, several times in the shop; I went after them to where I heard they were, at the Golden Lion, Warwick-steps, and found the prisoners there; I challenged the prisoner Blew with having the muslin, and she denied it; I sent for a constable, and ordered him to search her; she refused to be searched there by a man; she said she would be searched by a woman, and desired to be taken to the Office in Hatton-garden; I then left her, and he took her down, and delivered her to White, the officer, I went down to Hatton-garden, when she was examined in the evening.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am porter to Messrs. Francis: By order of my master I followed the two prisoners to watch where they went to, and I saw them go into the Golden Lion, Warwick-steps; I then went, and told my master; I went back to watch; they did not go away; when my master came, he told me to fetch a constable; they would not let the constable search them; I went down to the Office with them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.

               <p>(The muslin produced and identified.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the Kent-road. Vickers was my servant. On the Thursday before the 31st of December I sent him to Dulwich, where I have a farm, to fetch a load of hay—he was to put half in my yard, and leave the rest with a gentleman named Dodd—I went into my loft after he had delivered it, and found only seventeen trusses instead of eighteen, and I spoke to the policeman to watch him—on the 31st of De<lb></lb>cember I sent him again to Dulwich for a load of hay, and the team was brought home by the officer—I have seen the hay found in Kirby's pos<lb></lb>session—it corresponds with the hay I was to have received from Dulwich on Thursday, and also with what I expected on Saturday.</p>

On the 11th of November I directed another man, who has escaped, to take fifty bags of pepper in a boat. The same evening I sent the prisoner to assist in conveying them to the Sermaphore ship - it was loaded from Bow Creek. The other man was a watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. The prisoner continued in your service until he was taken - A. Yes. He was to navigate the barge.</p>
               <p>JAMES ATTWOOD. I am an Excise watchman. On the 11th of November, in the evening, I was sent for to take charge of the bags of pepper. Next morning, I was coming up the River, and missed the men from the oars; the prisoner and another had both left. I went aft, and immediately Peck came forward. I saw the other sewing up a bag of pepper, and a parcel of loose pepper was in a handkerchief by his side - I took it from him, put it by my side, and kept alongside the bag. The watchman called to Peck to help move the bag, which he did. When I came up to the ship I went to shew it to the superior officer, and took the prisoner with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you missed them from their oars - A. I was forward, in the same barges; they were all together. Peck came forward on seeing me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was the barge when you went to her - A. At Bow Creek. It was not a wet night then. I heard the oars cease when we were about the lower part of Limehouse - they both ceased together. I went aft directly, and met the prisoner coming forward. The other man said he was only going to take a little pepper for his own use. The prisoner remained in the barge with me. He did not go to the superior officer with me. I cannot find the watchman.</p>

I slept with her and the infant on the night before she went out of town—she suckled the child—it was also occasionally fed—it was fed that night—it was taken ill about two o'clock in the morning—it was crying, and appeared as if it had the stomach-ache—I applied hot water and flannel to its stomach—it afterwards went to sleep—nothing was given to it in the night, while I was in the room, except the breast—it had been fed in the course of the Wednesday with some boiled rusk—I boiled it, which I usually did—my sister got up early in the morning, and sent for Mr. Woolmer—his assistant, Mr. Hustler, came about half-past seven o'clock—we had sent twice for him—after seeing the child, he said he would send some medicine for it—a bottle and a powder came—I saw my mother give the child a tea-spoonfull of the medicine—she was in the habit of attending to the child as well as its own mother—the powder was not given then, but was taken with the medicine to the Isle of Wight—Mr. Hustler was asked whether the child could be safely taken with its mother to Ryde, and he said it could—they went about eight o'clock—the child then seemed somewhat easier—they returned next afternoon—the child was then much worse, and died next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Merton, of Grosvenor-street West. Mrs. Dore is an acquaintance of mine—I lodged with her mother nine or ten months—that was before the child was born—I was on intimate terms with them—I paid for my lodging—I did not lodge there after the child was born, but I have occasionally seen it when I have visited there—they were always very kind to it—from a desire of rendering Mrs. Dore a service, I proposed that she and the child should go with me to Ryde—it was to be a treat to her—that had been settled about three weeks before we went—I called for her on Thursday morning, 13th July; I went into the kitchen, and saw Mrs. Spry give the child a teaspoon-full of a mixture—I did not see her uncork the phial—I saw the phial it was taken from—some of them told me that the child had been unwell in the night—Mrs. Dore and I left for Ryde by the nine o'clock train—I went by the first class, but she said she was afraid the child would annoy the passengers, and as it was to be a treat to her she went by the second class, to save me expense—we crossed in a steam-boat from Gosport to Ryde—the child seemed much worse when we arrive: at Gosport—it was crying very much—it was restless and ill all the way to Ryde—Mrs. Dore appeared very anxious about it, and in a great deal of trouble—she went down into the cabin with it—when she came up on deck she was in tears—I asked her what was the matter—she told me she had noticed some appearances of blood on the child's napkin, and she was afraid it would not live—on arriving at Ryde we went to Stamford-house, where I had in<lb></lb>tended to go—it is kept by a lady named Stamp—application was made to her to recommend a skilful person to see the child, and Mr. Bloxham, the surgeon, was sent for—Mrs. Dore had brought with her a phial containing medi<lb></lb>cine, and some powder in a paper—I do not recollect her doing anything with that—Mr. Bloxham saw the child, and sent a liquid and powders—I saw Mrs. Dore give the child one of the powders in a little sugar, according to the direc<lb></lb>tions, and the child went to sleep for two or three hours—we landed at Ryde about three o'clock in the afternoon, and Mr. Bloxham came perhaps about two hours after, or more—the medicine was given about half an hour after he sent it—when the child awoke it cried, and I believe it was sick—it was then put into a warm bath, and immediately after castor-oil was given it, according to Mr. Bloxham's directions—I did not sleep in the same room as Mrs. Dore that night—she called me between four and five in the morning, in great trouble, and said, "Oh, do come, Mrs. Merton, for I fear my baby is dying!"—I went into her room, and for a minute or two I thought the child was dead—it revived after some few minutes; and Mr. Bloxham saw it again twice that morning—he strongly recommended Mrs. Dore to return to London with it; in consequence of which, I accompanied her to Gosport, and saw her into the express train.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and general practitioner, at Victoria-square, Pimlico.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Pimlico, and am a member of the College. I had arranged with Mr. Woolmer to attend to his practice during his absence—I saw this child on the Friday, two or three hours after its return from Ryde—I found it vomiting, which 1 understood it had been for a con<lb></lb>siderable time—the stomach was very much swollen and hard—the napkins which Mrs. Spry showed me were stained with blood and mucus—it was also slightly convulsed—the eyes were rolling about—I inquired who had been attending it, and Mrs. Spry told me it had been seen by Mr. Woolmer's assistant, and also by Mr. Bloxham, at the Isle of Wight, who had said the child was labouring under a locked bowel—I ordered a dose of castor-oil to be given at intervals of an hour or two, and a mustard poultice to be applied to the stomach—I saw the child again about two hours after—there was no relief from anything I gave it—I could see it would not recover, and that most likely it would not live till morning—I told Mr. Hustler to give me</p>

               <p>about four or five grains of calomel—he had accompanied me all the time—I told him to go for it, and I would wait till he returned, and do it myself—he was gone perhaps three or four minutes—he brought me back the powder, and I gave it to the child, either with a little breast milk, which Mrs. Dore had drawn from the child, or some of the mixture that was on the table, with a little sugar—I ordered a leech to the temple, and told Mr. Hustler to watch the child, and apply it—I left him with the child, saying I should make an early visit in the morning; I also ordered the calomel to be continued every two hours, as I did not get down the quantity I ordered from Mr. Hustler, for a good deal of it stuck on the spoon, and some on the thumb—I got down about two or three grains—I desired Mr. Hustler to repeat the calomel every two hours, until evacuation—he was not to continue it after that—he must have gone back to the surgery for the calomel—I went again between eight and nine o'clock next morning, and found the child had died about three or four o'clock—when I entered the house I saw Mrs. Spry, and I told her that there was one symptom which I could not exactly account for, and that was the bloody stools—she told me the child had been labouring under thrush for some time—I said I could not see that the child died of that, on the contrary, it had not any indication at all of thrush, and I proposed, as I was not satisfied in my own mind of the case, to give her such a certificate as would not be returned by the registrar, but yet I would endeavour to ascer<lb></lb>tain the cause of death, by making a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—that was strongly objected to by Mrs. Spry—I believe she said she had had a large family, and never found any trouble with any of her children—I said I was very sorry trouble should be occasioned in this case, but I did not Know how to proceed, I had seen it so short a time that I could not do it without—she said when Mr. Woolmer came home he should do it, and I acceded to that, as she did not know so much of me as she did of Mr. Wool<lb></lb>mer—I called again in the evening, to propose that a Mr. Sharpe, a medical man, in the neighbourhood, should make the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—he was also a stranger to Mrs. Spry, but I thought, although she would not allow me to do it, for what reason 1 could not tell, she might allow another party—I saw Mrs. Dore on that occasion, Mrs. Spry was out—Mrs. Dore told me that she was quite satisfied there ought to be <hi rend="italic">a post-mortem</hi> examina<lb></lb>tion by somebody, she was most willing that it should be done, and she also told me that she believed the only cause why I did not obtain it before, was the rude or unpleasant manner in which I introduced it—I could see that there was some unpleasant feeling on their mind—it was more on the mind of the grandmother, nothing at all on the part of the mother—Mrs. Dore sent for Mrs. Spry immediately on my entrance—she came, and when she saw me she was very angry, and desired me to leave the house—I had seen her many times before Mr. Hustler took me to the child—I had lived next door to her for six or seven years, and had attended her children merely for ex<lb></lb>tracting their teeth—I was not present at the first <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I was at the second, when the body was exhumed—I saw the appearance it presented—the seat of disease was brought to me in a gally-pot—I saw quite enough to satisfy me that the intersusception was sufficient to account for death, and I gave a certificate to that effect—that would not exactly account to my mind for the bloody stools—the rupture of a vessel might possibly take place by strangulation, and that might produce hæmorrhage—it is not im<lb></lb>possible that that might cause a flow of blood to the body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lecturer on Chemistry. I made some experiments with a view to test the contents of the child's stomach—I applied all the ordinary tests, and ultimately produced arsenic in the me<lb></lb>tallic form—I discovered less than two grains in the stomach—I saw the characteristic effect of arsenic in the form of a large patch on the stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the stomach at all inflamed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was so long after death that no opinion could be given; but I saw the effect of previous inflammation in the patch—I found no calomel—I believe that the intersusception, and the inflammation consequent upon it, was the cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if there had been any mistake in the giving of arsenic for calomel at any one of the doses, the appearances you found would be entirely accounted for, would they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Conscientiously, I should say, no; because it must have taken time to produce the appearances of that patch—arsenic must have been given at least two days before death—the patch was gangrenous, in my opinion—Dr. Taylor saw it—the arsenic I found was unquestionably white arsenic—the arsenic on the patch was yellow, owing to the decomposition by which gases are evolved, which change that which was originally white into yellow arsenic.</p>

Last Wednesday I insti<lb></lb>tuted experiments with a view to ascertain the presence of arsenic in what was put before me as the contents of the child's stomach—I found about a grain of arsenic hanging about the black patch that has been spoken of—I have heard the evidence in this case, and have made notes of it—in my judgment death was caused by the intersusception of the bowel alone, and the inflammation of the colon that followed inconsequence—where the strangulation has proceeded to the degree described, I should always expect to find bloody stools; it is one of the most prominent symptoms</p>

               <p>where the strangulation is so great and so low down—my belief is con<lb></lb>sidering all the facts of the case, that the arsenic was not in the child's stomach till it returned from the Isle of Wight, and that it was administered to it within eight or ten hours of its death—all the symptoms exhibited by the child during life would, in my judgment, be referable to the intersus<lb></lb>ception—there has not been a single symptom of arsenic, except vomiting which is common to both—some of the most prominent symptoms of arsenic have been entirely wanting—the witness, Elizabeth Susan Spry, has stated that she slept with the child on the Wednesday night; that it went to bed at eleven, and slept till two o'clock, when it awoke in pain, now I declare it to be utterly impossible that three grains of arsenic could have been in the system of that child at eleven, and all the symptoms be suspended until two—the effect of arsenic on a child is exceedingly powerful; more so than in an adult—I have known a child, sixteen years of age, killed by one-third of a grain, which was considerably less than was discovered here—then it is proved that the child went to sleep again, and awoke at six, screaming, and in pain; thus we have an interval of four hours without any symptoms whatever to indicate the presence of arsenic; it could not have been in the system at that time—I think I understood that the child did not vomit in the night; now vomiting is one of the most prominent symptoms of arsenic, and where the bowels are at all obstructed it must exist in a most intense degree—it appears that the mixture sent by Mr. Woolmer's assistant, on Thursday morning, was given about eight, and up to the time she left by the train a period of an hour and a half, there are no symptoms referable to arsenic—in crossing to Ryde there was a discharge of blood from the bowels; that is exactly what I should expect where intersusception has lasted fifteen or sixteen hours; for when the bowels become constricted the congestion of the vessels leads to bursting, especially in the case of an infant, and it is not a consequence of arsenic until a later stage of the case—I think Mr. Bloxham has taken a most judicious and sound view of the case—he saw only a bilious vomiting, no blood—now if Mr. Rodgers's theory were correct, and the arsenic had then been in the system, and gone on to produce gangrene and ulreration, the destruction of the lining membrane would have caused blood to exude from it, and would have been seen in the vomited matter which Mr. Bloxham speaks of—the sickness was undoubtedly referable to the obstruction of the bowels—if arsenic had been given in the morning the child would have been in a dying state—there would have been cold sweats, violent convulsions, and incessant vomitings; so that no person of ordinary science could possibly mistake the effects of arsenic—then the child reached London about half-past three on Friday, and we see there just such kind of inter<lb></lb>mittant symptoms as we should expect from the state of the bowels, occasional vomiting, not incessant, as in cases of arsenic; occasional pain, not incessant burning, as in arsenic; indeed, the symptoms all through, up to that time, refer to the strangulation of the intestine—Mr. Hustler saw the child at six in the evening, and it was then very ill; he thought it suffering from inflammation of the bowels, and it was rather convulsed—the question is, what caused this inflammation of the bowels; it is quite impossible that arsenic could have caused it, because the symptoms hitherto have only been in connection with what the child took, and are not reconcilable with arsenic, which would operate upon a child in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—then it seems that Mr. Driver gave it a powder about nine; there appears to have been no symptoms to indicate the nature of that powder; in fact I should judge from the description given that the child was dying: that</p>

               <p>shortly after its return from Ryde it was in a morulent state, and therefore the stomach would lose that irritability which characterizes it in a healthy condition, and it would not be affected either by calomel, arsenic, tartar emetic, or any substance which, in a healthy state, tends to irritate the coats; so that we have no symptoms produced, as far as I can judge, by that powder; I am unable, therefore, to say what the nature of that powder was, as far as the symptoms are concerned; but this I must say, that I examined the stomach with the greatest care, and as Mr. Rodders has admitted, there was not a particle of calomel in the stomach—I cut up two square inches of the stomach, and tested it with every test I am in the habit of using, and by which I have discovered calomel ten hours after it has been administered; but here, although five grains are said to have been administered, not one atom of calomel remained—Mr. Rodgers has admitted that there was no in<lb></lb>flammation of the bowels, and my Lord asked whether three grains of arsenic could remain in the stomach three days without some portion passing through into the bowels, and taking effect there; I say decidedly not; it is utterly impossible—if food passed, arsenic would have passed; and if arsenic passed, it would indicate its presence by inflammation of the intestines—Mr. Rodgers's statement, that arsenic must have been two or three days in the stomach, is quite unfounded; there is not the slightest ground for it, unless he admits that which I believe to be utterly impossible, that three grains of arsenic can remain for three hours in the stomach without producing any effect—I never met with or read of such a case.</p>

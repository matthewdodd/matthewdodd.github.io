               <p>Q. Did the prisoner and the deceased lodge at your house at the time that this melancholy affair took place? - The deceased lodged seven months with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner lodged in the same house? - Yes, one month.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this business happen? - The 2d of this month, at supper time, about nine o'clock; the men were at supper altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. How many together? - I cannot tell, because he just came in, and began to abuse, began to quarrel and use bad language to all, sometimes to one, and sometimes to another; then I went into the room, and begged, for God's sake, that he would be quiet, several times; he began then to abuse me with bad language, and then he got up and went to strike me; he did not strike me; the other men there laid hold of him, and prevented him from striking me, and pushed me into my own room; they took me and the man that died, and put us into my own room.</p>
               <p>Q. Before these persons took you and the man that was killed, and put you into your own room, had any blows passed between Bonnevento and the man that is dead? - No; I sat there, and the man that is dead, and my wife, were trying to make peace, not to have a quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there? - About half an hour. I cannot recollect certain, it is impossible. The prisoner then came and opened my door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing at that time in his hand? - No, I never see nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - He never spoke, but opened the door, and Scampraw flew to the door after him.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then? - I never see any thing, only I heard a noise in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Scampraw fly to the prisoner in a passionate manner? - Yes, as if he was going to quarrel with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the noise which you heard in the passage, like the noise of people fighting together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you judge from the noise you heard, that they were fighting together? - I heard them knocking down one another.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after that? - I sent for the watchman.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160083"></xptr>Q. Did you see Bonnevento and Scampraw at any time during the time they were scuffling together? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to send for the watchman? - Because there was such a noise I thought they would make a mischief in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first learn that any mischief had been done? - I opened the door, and a man just came out of the other room, and cried, I am dead! I am dead!</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after you sent for the watchman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard the struggling in the passage, what means did you take to send for the watchman? Did you go through the passage? - No, my wife threw up the window. I called several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you opened the door? - And somebody put Scampraw into my room again, and he said, I am dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Scampraw lay that before the watchman came in, or after? - I went down to open the door for the watchman, and I heard him say so, and and then I went and see him lay down in my room.</p>
               <p>Q. You see him laying on the floor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he bloody? - Yes, he was stabbed; the blood came from the right arm, and the back, in great quantities.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first see this man, with the blood flowing from him, where was. Bonnevento at that time? - In the back room, and this was it the fore room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Bonnevento afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he got any weapon of any kind? - No, I never see any weapon, or any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the deceased after he had received the wounds? - He was sent to the hospital, they told me he died at six o'clock; I never see him dead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the time we were quarrelling together, I stood in my own defence, and he cut me to pieces.</p>

               <p>Q.

I heard a dispute after they were at supper; my husband and myself were settling the accounts of the nine men that were going away, and my husband went in to demand peace, several times; I followed my husband into the room; finding the noise grew higher, and seeing one man of one side of the table, and one on the other, I cleared the table of the knives and forks directly.</p>

            , took the deceased in his arms, and carried him into my room, and I kept hold of him, I shut the door, and held the deceased by the hand, and said, dear Jem, don't go out again to have any more words; and he said, no madam, my passion is over; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160084"></xptr>was about five minutes with us, and then he said he would go out; and I said, pray do go; and he went on the outside of the door, and the words he expressed were, that he was going to meet his wife. I was going to shut the street door after him, and I see him return to the door again; and I took hold of his hand and said, pray, Jem, don't go back again to cause more words; and he said, I must speak to Mr. Thomas, (he called my husband Mr. Thomas,) for he must go off the next morning at half after six. He came into the house, and the words he expressed were, he had left his beer on the table; and I catched him by the jacket, and I said, Jem, you shall not go into that room. He was going into the same room where Bonnevento was, but I pushed him into ours. I told him there was beer in our room, and he might go and drink there. He was not in a passion at all then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased at that time appear to be in a passion? - Not the least. He went into my room very kindly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he there before any thing took place? - I shut the door, and the evidence that is here, and another man, had been out to buy provision, what they call their sea stock, and they were to settle with me, and all the time Bonnevento was very noisy, and he is very troublesome in liquor, but when sober quite the reverse.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the deceased with respect to liquor? - He did not perceive to be the least the worse for liquor. After we had settled the accounts of these two men, the evidence and another, and then the account of the deceased was just settled, when the prisoner came to the door. My husband ran to keep him from coming into the room, and the deceased followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either the deceased or the prisoner appear at this time to be in a passion? - The prisoner appeared to be in a passion; the deceased was in serious discourse with us about going away when the door was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. But when the prisoner opened the door, did the deceased appear to be in a passion? - My flurry was too great to express that; but I endeavoured to catch the deceased by the collar, and he kicked me, but whether through haste of going away, or to prevent me holding him, I cannot say; after that, I found it was impossible to endeavour to separate them; they got into a hustle in the passage, and I threw up the sash, and opened the shutters, and jumped out of the window to call assistances.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the wound was given? - No, I was not present, nor in the house for above an hour after. I see the deceased when he was laying in the room, and I said, O Jem! and he said, O Ma'am! that was all he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long he lived after? - Not after half after six in the morning; that was the time that he exexpressed so often that he would go off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any knife? - I see the prisoner have a knife in his hand about a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a knife afterwards? - I did, it was all blood by the appearance of it; I think it was the same knife I saw in the hand of the prisoner. I take my oath, and God forbid I should say false.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say that during the time that he had lodged with you, you had observed him to be of a good disposition when he was sober? - A very quiet man.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was the man that he unfortunately killed? - A very peaceable man.</p>

               <p>Q. They had no words together at all? - I did not hear it. I see them sit on the chair and had a few words, and then the landlord came into the room, and persuaded him to be quiet, and the prisoner at the bar put his hand on the landlord, because he told him to be quiet. He was drunk, and the deceased took the part of the landlord. Then I took the landlord and brought him to the fore parlour, and then I took Jemmy, the deceased, and likewise brought him to the parlour; then Jemmy, after he was in the fore parlour, he would go to the next parlour, where we eat and drank likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. In the other parlour where Bonnevento was? - Yes; then the mistress told Jemmy, the deceased, not to go there, but she would bring the beer to the room; then they staid a little while, and the deceased got up and opened the parlour, and then the prisoner was at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did one parlour open into the other? - No, they both open in the same passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in that passage? - He was, then the deceased came out of the room, and they began to fight again in the entry.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who struck first? - I did not see the first brow. They were fighting together, and some others endeavoured to part them from each other. They fought a very little time. Then Jemmy, the deceased, went into the other room; he had broke his buckle, and he put his foot on the chair; then the prisoner went to the room door, and he took a knife out of his pocket, and went into the room, and looked round, and began to strike him. He opened the knife at the door, it was a sailor's knife; he began to strike the deceased with his knife.</p>
               <p>Q. In what posture was the deceased when Bonnevento struck him? - He had his foot on the chair to mend his buckle, and when he felt the stroke, he left mending his buckle, and I took the prisoner by the hand, and I said, what are you about, I ewy?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that to Bonneveno before he struck him, or after? - After he struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the effect of the blows? - The first was in his arm, the next was in his bosom, and the third was below the breast, but the fourth did not touch him. On his jacket were four holes, but in his body but three.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the deceased after he received these wounds? - He went into the parlour where the master of the house was, and I pushed Bonnevento into a corner of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that the deceased received the blows, was he speaking to Bonnevento, or did he see him? - The deceased said to this prisoner, in Spanish, I will have your life to-night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he say that? - While I was holding of him, before he received the blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him when he died? - I went to see him to the hospital.</p>

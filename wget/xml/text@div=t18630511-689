                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was hen read as follows</hi>:—"I solemnly declare that the young man, Jesse Bobbins, who is now charged with me, is innocent of the charge, for he did not know that I had such things about me I went out about 9 in the morning to work, and as he did not come home I went out with a friend, and was drinking. I met him down Cheapside; he was very drunk, and he hit ma I said I would lock him up if he did it again, and he did do it again, and I gave him in charge to the policeman. As soon as he saw me speaking to the policeman he ran away. He never knew that I had such a thing as bad money with me; it was given to me by the young woman I was drinking with to mind for her till the next morning. That is the humble and truthful statement of Jane Robbins."</p>

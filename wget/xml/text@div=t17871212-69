               <p>Did Mrs. Burkitt claim any property in the things? - She was asked, and she said they did not belong to her.</p>

               <p>He was informed at Bow-street, that unless he made a full disclosure of every thing in which he was concerned, he was in considerable danger? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the examination of Fleming? - I cannot say particularly.</p>
               <p>Fleming, it seems now, has been a notorious and common receiver of stolen goods? - Why sir, I am sorry the man is in custody now; he has lived in good credit, and has come forward with me to give evidence.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Duck-lane, Westminster, Higgins and Holden lodged in my house; I know the other two prisoners by living in Duck-lane; there was a bundle brought into my apartments; I did not see it brought in, nor I saw nothing brought in; I saw all the four prisoners in my house, and they went up stairs with Mr. Fleming; it was the same night that Mr. Jealous came about an hour after and found it; Fleming came in with them, they went up stairs together, into Higgins's room, and in about a quarter of an hour after, Fleming brought down this bag, and put it where Mr. Jealous found it, in a cupboard in the back-room.</p>
               <p>Who brought down the bag? - Fleming.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoners all come in together with Fleming? - Yes, I saw them come in, but I did not see them bring any thing in at that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mrs. Burkitt, did you know much of Fleming before that time? - I knew him when he was apprentice at Mr. Wright's.</p>
               <p>Have you had much dealings with him lately? - Not much; I never dealt with him to buy any thing of him; he left these things in my possession till he called for them; he has left things about four times.</p>
               <p>How long before? - It might be about a month.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived in Duck-lane? - About a quarter of a year.</p>
               <p>Where did you live before that? - In Fleet-lane; I kept a chandler's shop and sold greens.</p>
               <p>Where does your husband live? - I have never a one; I buried him in Fleet-lane.</p>
               <p>How long have you been called by the name of Burkitt? - Very nigh two years.</p>
               <p>Your name was Lymes before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that your maiden name? - No.</p>
               <p>So poor Mr. Burkitt is dead? - Yes; he was a boat builder, but he was in the Fleet for debt; he was one of the turnkeys of the Fleet prison.</p>
               <p>You know you was examined at Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you told us all that passed at Bow-street; on your examination, did not you there say, that Higgins had not been out of your house that day, nor the day before, nor the day before that? - No, I did not say that; I said I believed he had not been out that day, but they all came into my room together.</p>
               <p>Did not you say at Bow-street that you believed Higgins had not been out of your house that day? - I said I believed not.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, you believed he had not been out the day before? - No, I did not, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Tell me whether you will venture to swear that you did not say to the magistrate at Bow-street, that Higgins was not out of your house either that day, or the day before, or the day after? - I did not say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120076"></xptr>so; I said I believed he had not been out on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Did you say the Saturday or the Friday? - I will not venture to swear that I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe that the young man was not out of your house on the Friday night; that is a dangerous question to such a witness as you? - To the best of my knowledge, I cannot say; but on Saturday I know he was not.</p>
               <p>What time was you at home on the evening of Friday? - About six or seven.</p>
               <p>Did you go out after seven? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was Higgins out after seven that night? - No, not on Friday night; but in the day time I cannot say; but after night, I am sure he was not out.</p>

               <p>I take it for granted that you came today from Duck lane? - No.</p>
               <p>Where did you come from to-day? - Why, from prison I came to-day.</p>
               <p>You have been in a little trouble, as they call it about this business? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Therefore you are swearing to get yourself out of trouble? - I would not swear any thing wrong; if you was a widow with two children, you would be glad to do any thing in the world to maintain them.</p>
               <p>Is it a furnished lodging? - Yes.</p>

             came in together to our house; Fleming came in afterwards; they went up stairs into Higgins's room; but I cannot tell what passed, and Fleming brought down stairs a black bag; I cannot tell what was in it; he desired it might be put away into the closet where Mr. Jealous found it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you lived with Mrs. Burkitt? - About six or seven years.</p>
               <p>You lived with her then, when she lived in Fleet-lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You came from prison too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You knew her when her husband was alive, poor man? - Yes, I lived with her, and have been with her ever since.</p>
               <p>You knew Fleming very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long has he been used to come backwards and forwards to your house? - I cannot recollect.</p>

               <p>How long has she lived in Duck-lane? - Abot three months.</p>
               <p>You know she lived there by Fleming's desire? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Was not you present when they agreed that she should take the house in Duck-lane? - No, I was not; I cannot tell when Mr. Fleming called first upon us; he did not assist in moving.</p>
               <p>But you saw him as soon as you got in? - He called in as he went by.</p>
               <p>Was that the first day after you went to Duck-lane, or the next day? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>After that, how often did Fleming use to call? - He used to call as he went by.</p>
               <p>He was a very intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Burkitt's; was not he? - Not as I know; he went about his business; he used to call in.</p>
               <p>Did he use to leave things at your house? - I believe he did; really I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Will you swear he did not leave things at your mistress's, till he called for them? - He has left things several times, till he fetched them away.</p>
               <p>How soon after you went to live at Westminster, did he come with the first bundle of things? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Were the things always put into that cupboard? he put them in himself.</p>
               <p>What part of the house was that cupboard in? - The back room; there was no lock upon it.</p>
               <p>Court. You say that Higgins, and all the rest of the prisoners came in together on the Saturday evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had Higgins been out? - He had not been out at all.</p>
               <p>Grace Maddox, Holden and Grose, all came in, and went up stairs with Higgins? - I cannot tell you whether Higgins<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120077"></xptr>was out or not; they all four went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Then it was not true that the four prisoners came in together; you have sworn both ways; which is the truth? - I cannot tell; Higgins came in with Grose and Holden, and Grace Maddox.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that he came into the house or into the room; did the four prisoners all come into the house together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Do I understand you right, that you are now, upon recollection, sure that Higgins; Holden, Grose and Maddox, all the four prisoners came into the house together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then how long had Higgins been out? - That I cannot say, I was at home all the evening.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing Higgins before he came in with the other prisoners? - I saw him up stairs in his own place.</p>
               <p>How soon did he go out from his own place? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Did you see them come in or not? - Only Grace Maddox.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoners come into the house, or did you? - Yes, I did see them come in.</p>
               <p>Who did you see come into the house? - I saw Holden,

             in the room, there were other persons in the room; I went up stairs, Holden followed me; and there were Mrs. Burkitt and Charlotte: Higgins desired I would go up stairs; I went up with him and the other three prisoners; then, I believe it was Holden, but I will not say which, positively, told me there were some sheets and tablecloths to sell, I cannot tell which; I told Sir Sampson Wright so; but one of them said so in the presence of all, and asked me if I would buy them? I told him yes; they were in a black bag then; I do not know rightly which it was that gave me the bag to look at them, I looked at them, and I think I paid for seven sheets, eight table-cloths, four napkins and a white cotton counterpane; there were more in the bag than that, but the others I considered of no value, and I gave them to the prisoner Maddox; then after I had looked at them, I think it was Grose, but I am not sure, asked me five guineas for them, which I refused to give; I told him I could not afford to give more than three guineas for them, which if they would not take, it would not suit me; I then went down stairs to Mrs. Burkitt's, and while I was sitting in Mrs. Burkitt's front room, Higgins called to me; when I went back again, they agreed to take the three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120078"></xptr>guineas; I folded up the things separate, and put them on the table; after I had done that, I put them in the black Nags and paid three guineas for them; I carried them down stairs into Mrs. Burkitt's back room on the ground floor, and I put them there into a closet, and desired her to take care of them till I came for them; she told me she would; I paid the three guineas into the hands of Grose.</p>
               <p>What became of the money? - I believe it was divided among them; Higgins said, we must give her something; I saw no other woman in the room besides

               <p>Had you any further conversation with them about these things at any time? - No; not a syllable more than what I have told you.</p>

               <p>You have told us; on a former occasion, that you have carried on this trade of receiving stolen goods for six months before you was discovered? - That was the only time I was in business for myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And that was the only trade you carried on? - No Sir, it was not; I had not any promise of making a full discovery; I was not charged with any thing; when I came before Sir Sampson he asked me if I knew Higgins? I told him yes, and Grose; Townsend came to me, and said Sir Sampson wanted me.</p>
               <p>That is the usual way? - I might have gone away if I had chose it, but it would not do for me to leave my country on such a thing as this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You added last, that you found it necessary to fix somebody with every article that was found in your possession? - That I found it necessary; yes, I certainly did.</p>
               <p>That unless you could get rid of every article of stolen goods found in your possession, traced or to you, you would be in danger? - If I was the most the most vile person in the world, what punishment should I deserve to fix on an innocent person.</p>


               <p>A punishment that the laws of this counttry do not impose on you; how long have you been connected with Saunders; - I have known him several years; I have sold him several articles.</p>
               <p>Did you use to sell your plate to him to go to Holland? - No, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Who is the person who took your plate to Holland, Davis? - I never sold any thing to Davis in my life.</p>
               <p>How many times may you have sold articles to Saunders? - I cannot tell how many times.</p>
               <p>Did Saunders know you was a common receiver of stolen goods? - He might know.</p>
               <p>Did not he know it? - Well, he did know.</p>
               <p>He knew it from you? - There is not the least doubt of it; I look upon it I know the value of these things as well as any man in England. I look upon the utmost value of them to be four guineas, or four guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Court. Giving the full value makes no difference.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Saunders that those articles you sold to him were stolen? - From our connection he could not doubt of it; I did not tell, my Lord, last-night, that I sold plate to go to Holland.</p>

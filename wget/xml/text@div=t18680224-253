On 10th February about 5.30, I was near Peel's Statue, Cheapside, and saw the prisoner and a man not in custody—I followed them down Aldersgate Street to Long Lane, and back to 85, Newgate Street, Mr. Grossmith's, where the prisoner went in, leaving his companion at the door—he came out with this packing case on his shoulder, and I followed them to Bull and Mouth Street—they walked quick, and the one not in custody said "There is some one on to us," and ran away—the prisoner pitched the packing case at me off his shoulder and ran away, I followed him, calling "Stop thief," a gentleman in Little Britain, knocked him down and I assisted him up—I had not lost sight of him—he said "What do you want with me, I am porter to the gentleman I was with"—I took him in charge, searched him, but found nothing.</p>

I am a printer in Crane Court, Fleet Street—I did not print the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Gazette</hi> of 24th July, I printed the supplement of 25th—the manuscript was brought to me in detached "parcels by three or four persons; the first portion of it was brought by Mr. Purcell, and two other portions I think were brought by servants of Mr. Pugin—I refused to accept the first portion from Mr. Purcell; I refused to print it—some of the other portions I had from Mr. Pugin himself and one or two of his servants—I can't say what part I received from Mr. Pugin; he only gave me directions as to the time it was wanted—he said that he wanted it by the next day—he told me to print 4,000 copies—I printed those 4,000—I think it was on 23rd or 24th that he came to me, I am not quite certain—I complied with his directions and he paid me; it was about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I forget now exactly the sum—the copies were fetched away when they were ready, by servants of Mr. Pugin—he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down before it was touched, and the balance after it was fetched—it is not usual for me to print a supplement of the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Gazette</hi>—this was not the only one I have printed—I have printed supplements on previous occasions when I have printed the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> itself—it was an unusual thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an artist, and a Member of the Royal Academy—I frequently exhibit pictures at the Academy—the house in which I live was built for me some years ago, and the defendant was the architect—he afterwards made a claim," which I disputed, and he brought an action, which is still pending—after the action was brought, and before, I received letters from him from time to time—among others I received this letter of 21st June, signed by the defendant; the signature is his hand writing—it came to me by post—I also received this letter, dated 3rd August, signed by him—my son gave me this letter, headed "The Eve of the Fight"—I also received this letter, dated 13th August; that is signed by the defendant—I also received a number of telegrams—my cook and housemaid gave me these two papers, which are addressed to them; they are copies of the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Gazette</hi>—the addresses are in the same handwriting as the letters, and as the manuscript of "The Eve of the Fight"—I know the defendant's handwriting; they are not written by him, but by his clerk, as all the other letters are.</p>

               <p>sufferer, and a great loser in health and pocket, and in my delay of Government works, all occasioned by this man—I have said that Mr. Pugin has treated me badly, and I believe he has—I am not aware that I have in many places expressed myself strongly with regard to what Mr. Pugin has done—I don't remember particularly that I have spoken of him to his dispraise and discredit—I have said that his claim was a most unjust one which would be settled if he liked to bring the action—I don't remember particularly that I have expressed myself to that effect to more than one person and in more than one place—he has written and sent me telegrams of insult and letters also, before the late trial—he made attacks on me before I pleaded to the action—I had received letters of insult before, and he had attacked me in various directions among my friends, calling me a liar, and expressions of that kind—these letters in the supplement were written since his return from America—I was present at the previous trial—I believe this letter headed "The Eve of the Fight," came into ray hands on the day previous to that trial—the trial, I think, was on the 14th July—I am unable to say whether that letter was here then—I believe it was not among those letters which formed part of that enquiry—I am not sure where it was at that moment, but I believe it was not among those letters which were put in as containing the libels—I have gone through the letters in the supplemen t—I have been so inundated with letters from this man that it is extremely difficult for me to recognise a particular letter—I am not perfectly certain whether or not the letter of 10th April, 1874, was produced at the former trial—I don't know—I should be sorry to say one way or the other my memory might deceive me—I can't say that after I had put the pleas of fraud on the record I noticed that his manner was altered, because I had received insults before any letters were written: I don't mean insults with regard to the dispute about the house, but things said of me to my friends—I had heard of stinging things said of me before there was a thought of an action arising out of the architect's claim in connection with the house at Kilburn—I only made one affidavit—that was with reference to his going to America, and I conclude it was that he' referred to when he called me perjurer. (<hi rend="italic">The affidavit was here put in and read; it</hi> was <hi rend="italic">dated 6th October</hi>, 1873, <hi rend="italic">and stated that he had been informed that Mr. Pugin intended to go to America for two years; that he was without means, and had to be supported by his friends while he was absent in America.</hi>) I have stated that the imputations of perjury refer to my affidavit—it is impossible to know to what he does point in these letters—I suppose he is partly referring to the affidavit and partly to the extraordinary statements which he has made, for I declare upon my oath that there is scarcely a sentence in the whole of these letters which is true—I had not made any affidavit but this one, which he could impeach, therefore it is natural to refer his charge of perjury to this affidavit: now I understand you—I knew that I had not made a false oath, but I partly understood him, in his dreamy way of putting it, to allude to that—I understood the various imputations contained in that letter to refer to a desire on my part to avoid payment in relation to the claim made by him, and to nothing else—I don't know that ho ever charged me with wronging anybody else—I beg your pardon, there are letters in which he does accuse me of not paying other persons—there is a letter there with regard to a Mrs. Thornton, in which he says that I had refused to pay a sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or some such sum, to a lady—I can't say that I found any difference in him after I made</p>

               <p>this affidavit; he has always been excited—I don't know that these pleas of fraud were the common talk in the profession to which we belong—I did not find it so—Mr. Pugin's claims upon me, from the beginning to the end, I have heard, but not this affair of the affidavit—if Mr. Pugin will bring his action the question of fraud will be made quite clear—I did not try to sell my house, nor did I ever give him permission to do so—I did not put it on an agent's books—I was not willing to take an adequate offer for it—I did not want to sell my house to him: what right had he to buy my house?—at Bow Street he desired to refer all disputes between us—there was something said about it before then—I did not break it off—it is so long since that I do not remember these things well—there was a proposition, and it is one which Mr. Pugin has always been making everywhere, throwing the house into measuring value; these propositions have only been made to put off the trial—I do not remember instructing my solicitor to agree to the proposition—I did not afterwards refuse to refer—it fell through in this way, Mr. Pugin became bankrupt and there were difficulties in the way of anything, and what was done I am unable to say—I don't know that Mr. Pugin was a sufferer in pocket by these disputes as well as me—I have of course suffered in pocket with regard to the house which he built—if his claim is well founded he has not got his due, but it is not Well founded—I say that owing to his misconduct I have paid more than I ought to have done—by his neglect he was dismissed—I should not think that the put-ing the two pleas of fraud on the record had injured him in his profession, I believe not: but with regard to the house I want to say that I do not owe that man a farthing; the house is paid for, and the receipts are there—it is not my fault that he is indicted before the case is <hi rend="italic">tried</hi>—I believe the Magistrate suggested to Mr. Pugin that he ought not to write to me any more, and he pledged his honour that he would not—there was-somethin to that effect said, I believe—I have received no letter from him since he gave me that pledge, but letters about me have been written to my friends.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> What I meant by the plea of fraud was that he gave certificates for bad timber and bad work, and for zinc instead of lead, and so on, there were other things—that was not circulated in any way, except by instructing my pleader to plead it—he has given me no notice of trial for the action for the extra money, or tried to go on with it—the plea of fraud is hanging over his head, because he does not choose to bring the action on—my house was put on the agent's books by the defendant, he wrote a letter to them, he advertised my house for sale without any permission from me, and also sent crowds of people to value it, every day constantly he sent people to get into my house at various times, even at night and in the day, sometimes ten people of a very bad type indeed, saying that they wanted to measure and examine the honse to see what was wanted to be done to Mr. Pugin's house before he offered it for auction—that has been followed up every day, sometimes ten in a day, large fighting men—in the letter of 13th August he accuses me of being a perjurer in police courts—I had forgotten that, it is not easy to remember these terrible things.</p>

I did not say of the defendant at the Stafford Clab and elsewhere that I had evidence against him that would send him to the hulks—I know Mr. Wallis—I did not state that to him—I gave the opinion of my lawyer, who said that the affair of the bond would be, in his opinion, sufficient to send them to prison, or something like that—it was there believed that he was in partnership with a builder and that he gave to the builder a bond for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over the cost of my house—before the contract was signed he told me that the builder would build it for 2,403<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but that he bad given him a bond for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over that, so I said to him "I have done with the transaction, I will have nothing whatever to do with that, and it dropped—I conceived that I should have to pay that sum when the bond was presented—some days afterwards he came to me and said "I have seen the builder and have abandoned the bond, and he will build it for the sum named"—that being the case I thought the matter was fair and clear, and I said I would sign the contract, and the builder signed it, and the sum to be paid was 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believed that the bond was destroyed—towards the close of the year, when the house had got a good way up, the builder came to me and said "I must ask you to give me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a bond I hold against you"—I said "From whom?"—he said "From Mr. Pugin"—he told me that Mr. Pugin was my agent—I immediately wrote down to Mr. Pugin and said "I am astounded at what has happened, the builder has been to me with a bond for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he tells me you have given on my part"—Mr. Pugin wrote to me by the same date, and I believe before he had my letter, "Hodgson has applied to me for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I have had no choice but. to pay 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it"—Mr. Hodgson writes to me declaring that he had not paid him a farthing of that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I have Mr. Pugin's letter stating that he had given this bond—the three letters are in Court—I had no idea what the bond was for, I did not ask what it was for—it was a year and a half ago that I said to Mr. Wallis I had evidence which Mr. Field was of opinion was sufficient to send Mr. Pugin to prison—I am not aware that I repeated that to other gentlemen—I know Mr. De Beauville—I did not tell him at another time and in another place, that I had evidence that could send Mr. Pugin to prison—I don't remember that I said anything of the kind—I say no, I did not—I did not use language to him to the effect that I had evidence that could bring him within the criminal law; I undertake to say that I did not—it is a year and a half ago that I had the conversa<lb></lb>tion</p>

The builder took a contract from me for a certain amount—I don't know that the defendant undertook to pay the builder an amount if it should be worth more—Mr. Field thought it was fraudulent, because he said they were in partnership—he said "Mr. Pugin who ought to be your bulwark is giving certificates for unsound timber and bad work," and that is a fact, for the house has settlements all round it—the contract was signed before the building was begun—the story of the bond was told me some days before I signed the contract, but he told me he had destroyed the bond and so I signed it.</p>

The letter headed "The Eve of the Fight" was handed to me by Mr. Herbert after the trial was over—I had no list of the letters that were in Court at that time—the indictment con-taiued only 3 letters—I should say that Mr. Herbert has handed me probably 200 letters—I have got no list of the correspondence that was then in my possession—I have simply got in Court a number of letters that have been written since the last indictment—The Eve of the Fight" was not shown to Mr. Poland in Court—it was never produced in Court or referred to in any shape or way—it was not among the. bundle of letters that are here now—Mr. Herbert handed it to me after the trial was over, and said "Here is a letter that I received last night, how is this to stop, what am I do?" and I have received letters continuously down to last night—Mr. Pugin has further brought an action against me—he writes to me and lays his damages at 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>upon you that you were born, have lived, and will probably die, a humbug; and it is now ray duty for the public benefit that this conviction should no longer be confided to yourself, but should be laid before the world at large. Have I. to go further than this year's Exhibition at the Royal Academy? Go look on those walls. Go, behold the daubs of yourself and your son, placed on the line, to the exclusion of talent and honest efforts. Reflect on the number of men your injustice must have driven to despair. Why, I am told that even your fellow hangers shuddered with disgust at your imperturbable impudence. Will you deny this? You may do so, for you will do anything. But, on the other hand, I will tell you that it is the last time that you will have the opportunity of so thoroughly disgracing yourself, or of insulting the nation. It may seem hard to say it to a father that a picture which bears his son's name, and that is on the line, is not only the worst picture in the Exhibition, but is the worst picture ever publicly exhibited. I observe on the frame the mystic star denoting that it has been disposed of. Excuse, I beg you, my doubting that it has found a purchaser, and forgive me for adding that, if such is the fact, the question which all beholders will ask themselves will be whether the picture or the purchaser has been the most sold.—E. Welby Pugin. Mr. J. Rogers Herbert. I. P. S.—I will add this letter to the collection which will shortly appear. 2 P.S.—The whole of my nieces will be in Court to confront their detractor, and to tell you that you are a liar and a perjurer to your face. Wretched man! how will you explain this matter to the satisfaction of the Judge, the Jury, and the public?"July 13, '74,</p>

               <p>'Stand to it! renew the fight (For Pugin's wrong if Herbert's right). These slaves! they dare not hand to hand Bide buffet from a trueman's brand, Impetuous, active, fierce, and young, Upon the advancing foe he sprung.

               <p>Sir,—At this moment ask yourself, did I not try to cajole Pugin out of a house worth 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? I Did I not, in conjunction with others, act as though he dare not strike a blow in his own defence? Did I not, under the impression that he was penniless, exclaim, now I have drawn my sword it shall not be sheathed until it be covered with either glory or gore I Did I not resort to every dirty and filthy trick to avoid paying my just liabilities? Have I not loved my 'louis' more than my honour I Am I not a cur of the worst breed, to have shirked opening my own letters, and to have requested my wife to keep them from my sight? Am I not a coward of the most contemptible nature to have made such a request, and then to have gone howling about the country. I did not mind so long as his letters were addressed to myself, that I could endure; but to have placed them in the hands of one's wife, exceeds the bounds of endurance I Am not a dog too contemptible to be worth kicking, for having apologised to Edward Barry for having written what I believed to be true I Have I not justly incurred the wretchedness I am suffering?

               <p>reputation and purse? Will not the evidence that will be advanced at the trial, make me wish I had never been born I Can I deny that I am a perjurer I Can I deny that I am a slanderer? Can I deny that such conduct as I have been guilty of makes me even in my own estimation more stinking than the dunghills, more foul than the cesspools to which Pugin has referred? &amp;c."—"August 3. Sir,—Not only are you a coward; not only have you proved yourself to be all that I have depicted you; but your solicitors, I am told, hold the same opinion of you and were ashamed to appear in Court in support of your proceedings. I hear you are consoling yourself with the idea that you will have four Bishops as fellow-sufferers. Believe me, Sir, that is utterly impossible; for not even among the worst criminals would it be possible to find another man who had sunk to your depth of degradation. No doubt you have done your utmost by your slanders, your plea of fraud, and your libels, to induce others to join you in your nefarious schemes; and bad as some may be, none can be found to sacrifice, as you have done, every sense of honour at the shrine of sordid aims. Yes, Sir, you are a singular example among the most contemptible.—E. Welby Pugin. To J. R. Herbert."</p>

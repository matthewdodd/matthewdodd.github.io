                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, of 4, Rose and Crown-gardens, Chelsea—on 2d October, I left home with my wife about 6 o'clock in the evening, and returned a little after 12—in consequence of a communication made to me, I went to the police-station, and found the prisoners there—I went home and found the door of my room burst open, and the window quite open—on leaving home, I had locked my room door; the outer door was open—the house is let out in rooms—I found the drawers open and the key in them, which, when my wife went out, she had put into the pocket of her dress behind the door—I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under the table—it does not belong to me—the prisoner Copplestone is my brother-in-law—I had seen White before, but I had never allowed him to come there—I do not know what he is; I never saw him do anything—he is not a costermonger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Copplestone. Q.</hi> When I went round at 5 o'clock, did you not say you were both going to the play? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not say I would not give you any money to get your lodging then, but that you were to come round at 11 o'clock—I did not say 11 o'clock; it was 3 o'clock in the afternoon when your sister gave you your victuals—I did not see you after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Copplestone.</hi> I asked Williams where he was going, he said, "Nowhere." I said, "Come round to my sister's; they promised me some money to pay for a lodging when I got there." I said to Williams, "We must get in somewhere, because the police hunt us about seeing us out so late at night." He said, "What is the use of going there?" I said, "I am going to try and open the window, and stop there until they come home." I was partly drunk; I had been drinking all the afternoon.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many people live in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two—there are only two rooms in the house; it is a little cottage—a man named Rose lives upstairs, and I live downstairs—I believe Rose was in bed at the time in question—my brother-in-law is not in the habit of coming to my house very frequently—he came for his victuals that day, because he has only just come out of prison, and his sister gave him his victuals.</p>

                  </hi>. I had occasion to go to Rose and Crown-gardens on this night for a whip, which I had hidden under a board for safety—I saw the prisoner Williams at the window, with a knife in his hand, and Copplestone standing at the gate—Williams was cutting a piece away—I asked him where Carter was, and he did not make any answer—Copple<lb></lb>stone was looking up at the window—he was about five yards from the other man—Copplestone had been drinking—I went to Carter's father-in-law, Mr. Fidler—there was one other cottage near this.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in the park, and saw Mr. Plane go into the crowd where the guns were firing, and immediately after I saw the prisoners and two shore occasionally in their company; they spoke to each other at times, and then went away. I observed all four get behind Mr. Plane. Thomas was close behind him, and Moir on the right side, and the other two behind them. I saw Thomas put his hand into Mr. Plane's pocket, but could not see him draw any thing out, for the first gun fired which occasioned a move - he shifted to the right, and then Moir put his hand into Mr. Plane's other pocket, and drew it out without any thing, if either of them took the handkerchief it must have been Thomas. I followed them about the crowd for ten minutes or quarter of an hour, and saw them attempt several people's pockets. I saw Thomas lay hold of the pocket of a man named Harley. I then ran to Mr. Plane and asked if he had lost his handkerchief, he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes." I went and seized the prisoners; the other two heard him say he had lost it, and ran away. I found nothing on them, but 3 s., on Thomas and a knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why not give him back his money - A. The Magistrate ordered me to detain it. I said at Marlborough-street, that I knew them to be bad characters. I knew them to be in bad company.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you are not the person who was tried at Clerkenwell - A. Very likely. I gave evidence against Jay. I am a special constable now. I was suspended from office for not attending the House of Lords, when I was obliged to be here. I was suspended for twelve months, because constables are only returned once a year. I have seen the prisoners in company of those who I know to be thieves, because they loiter in the park every day, and must get their livelihood some how.</p>
               <p>THOMAS'S Defence. I never saw Moir before. I am innocent.</p>
               <p>MOIR'S Defence. I never had my hands in any body's pocket.</p>

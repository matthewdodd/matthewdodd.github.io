                  </hi>. I was mate on hoard the barque <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi>, which laid off a port of Mexico, in May last—she was an English vessel, and had sailed from Liverpool—the prisoners both belonged to the ship—one of the seamen gave me information in May last, in consequence of which I looked about and missed a boat, and four men of the vessel were gone—the prisoners are two of them—I also missed some oars, a top-gal-lant studding sail, a cask, my own watch, and some clothes belonging to two seamen—I had been on deck myself till eleven o'clock the night before, and left the prisoner Thomas on deck in charge of the watch—the other prisoner was below—the master of the vessel had been on shore some days—the captain made a communication to the English consul of what had occurred—I am sure the prisoners are two of the men.</p>

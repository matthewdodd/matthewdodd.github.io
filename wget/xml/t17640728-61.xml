            , clerk to Smith, Wright and Gray, struggling together. Ware had hold of the prisoner, and the prisoner was striving to get away; Ware called to me, and begged, for Christ's sake, I would stop that man, for he had robbed him of near 50 l. upon which I ran up and seized him by the collar, and the moment I laid hold on him he flung something from him, down into a cellar opposite to him. I told Ware, whatever he had lost, the man had flung down into that cellar; we took him into the shop, and the man of the house and Mr. Ware went down into the cellar, while I took care of him; they came up, and said they could find nothing: they went down again with a candle, and brought the bag up, and when they had told the money over, there wanted a guinea, upon which Ware went down and brought up two half guineas. The bag was not tied but twisted round at the neck. We took him before my Lord-Mayor, and he was committed. Mr. Ware and his masters are Quakers, and he will not swear.</p>
               <p>Edward Williams, the master of the cellar, confirmed the account of finding the bag and money.</p>

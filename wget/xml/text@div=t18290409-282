            . I am a porter. I was going into the King's Head public-house, to light my pipe - I met Tom Shields, who asked me to take a drop of beer; I came out, and he said, this box was to go to No. 112, Newgate-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090125"></xptr>street, and if I would take it he would give me 1s.; I took it - the prisoner said nothing to me about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner afterwards? A. Why, I did see him - but Shields is the man who employed me; the prisoner never mentioned a sentence to me concerning the box whatever; Shields was the man who employed me and paid me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean you never talked to the prisoner about it afterwards? A. I did not speak a word to him about it nor he to me; I met him on the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you nod to each other, or say "How do you do?" A. It might be the case, for all that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he mention about the oranges or the box? A. No; not who employed me - nor any thing about it: I did meet him on my journey from Pudding-lane to Newgate-street - I had the box on my knot; I cannot tell which side of the way he was; I cannot tell which way he was going - I knew where I was going myself; I rather think he might be about Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pitch at all? A. Why I got rather tired, and the prisoner took it on his head, as I was rather tired - he carried it from Cheapside to where I was ordered to take it - to assist me, I rather thought, from where I pitched it.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you tell me that you did not know that you had spoken to each other? A. I did not mention that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know you are bound by your oath to speak the whole truth, as well as nothing but the truth - then the prisoner, when you pitched, and were heavy loaded and fatigued, carried it to this place, did he? A. Yes, he did take it on his knot, in Cheapside, to where I had been ordered to take it, to No. 112, Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Shields here? A. I understand not; he employed me to carry this box, and said it belonged to a countryman, who was rather drunk, and could not carry it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner near Shields at that time? A. No; Shields was the person who said he would pay me, and did pay me - it is customary for us porters to give one another a lift, all in good-nature; I cannot say what it contained; I dare say oranges - I did not look into it -Shields agreed to give me one shilling, and he gave me half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner never gave you a farthing? A. No; he has often given me a lift when I have been tired - I have known him three years; he never did assist me before, nor I him; I only meant to say that us porters are in the habit of doing it - Shields paid me when I came back; we did not speak a word to one another going back; it was not Shields who helped me; I never saw him till I got back and he paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, directly or indirectly, employ you to carry that box? A. He never did: I was examined before the Lord Mayor; I told there every word that I have to-night - I said Shields agreed for 1s., and gave me 2s. 6d., and that the prisoner gave a lift on the road.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

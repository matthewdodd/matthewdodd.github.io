Last Friday evening, about half-past six o'clock, I was with Prince, at the house of Mason, No. 13, Neville 's-court, Leather-lane—while there, I heard a knock at the door—I opened it, and in came James Gooding, the prisoner—he inquired for Mason—he had a bag over his shoulder—I asked him what he had got in the bag; he said old metal—I asked where he got it; he said he bought it of a man in the street—I asked if he knew the man he bought it of; he said he did not—I searched the bag, and found two metal screws, two caps, and seven flanges—I put the bag on one side, and told him he must consider himself in custody—I called Prince, who was about the back premises; and then I heard another knock at the door—I opened it, and in came the prisoner Jones—I asked him who he wanted—he told me he wanted his mate—he was going away, I told him to come in—Prince came up and laid hold of him, and brought him into the house—he was on the steps, and we thought his intention was to go—when I told him to come in, he said, "Oh, never mind," signifying that he would not come in; and he was in the act of turning round to go—I did not hear exactly what he did say—I heard him say, "Oh, never mind"—he was in the act of turning round to go away, when Prince came and took him—Gooding was in the shop at the time—when we got him inside, Prince asked him what he had got about him—he said he had got nothing—Prince unbuttoned his clothes, and, in searching him, found some metal concealed under his waistcoat—I then heard another knock at the door—I opened it, and in came the prisoner Rumble—I do not remember what questions Prince put to him; but I saw him find some metal concealed under his clothes—we secured the three prisoners, sent for assistance, and took them to the watch-house—I did not remark whether they spoke to one another.</p>

I went with Drew to Mason's at the comer of Neville's-court—about half-past six o'clock Good<lb></lb>ing came—we asked what he had got—he said, "Some metal to sell"—Mrs. Mason said Mr. Mason was not at home—about two or three minutes afterwards, a knock came to the door, Jones came in, I said to him, "Who do you want?"—he said, "My mate"—he was in the act of turning round, when I said, "Come along in"—and I dragged him in—I said "What have you got?"—he said, "Nothing"—another knock came directly afterwards, before I could search him, and Rumble came—I said, "Who do you want? Come along in; have you any thing about you?"—he said, "I have not"—I tapped him on the body and said, "Now strip;" and on Jones, I found nine pieces of metal, and the name on Rumble—it was in the form of the stomach—they had it under their waistcoats, next to their shirts, slung over their shoulders, and this piece Rumble had in his hat—the prisoners were all put into one room together—they did not ap<lb></lb>pear to be acquainted with each other.</p>

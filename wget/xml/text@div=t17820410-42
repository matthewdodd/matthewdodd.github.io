               <p>On the evening of the 26th of March, about twenty-five minutes past six, I was sitting in a room in my apartment, which looks into a yard adjoining, there is a line there on which hung two silk handkerchiefs, I perceived them slipping down, I went towards the passage door and found the prisoner with the handkerchiefs upon her, she had them in her right hand, I saw the handkerchiefs dropping from her hand and catched them before they dropped, I took her into custody, she said if I would forgive her she would never do so any more.</p>

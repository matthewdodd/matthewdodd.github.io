I saw Mr. Parry come to the bar, he disappeared at the same instant. He said to the landlord, "How do you do?" that is all I heard - he looked very wild. I saw the prisoner at the house - I did not hear him speak to Mr. Parry. Mr. Parry went away directly, and in four or five minutes I went out, and saw Mr. Parry, and the prisoner standing opposite to him - I heard the prisoner say "Stand up, like a man!" Parry was standing up like a statue, not in a fighting position - the prisoner instantly gave him a blow, which knocked him down, I said, "Why do you strike that man; who is incapable of resisting?" He said he had been very badly used by him. Mr. Parry did not get up again - he fell on his left side almost double, his head laid against the gutter, which is made of small stones, his head was on the stones. I gave notice to the landlord. I did not see the prisoner render him any assistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you see the prisoner bring a piece of paper to the bar, and ask for change? A. No. There might be half a dozen persons about when I got outside the house. I never saw the deceased before - he was a tall, good-looking man, not very stout.</p>

            . I am a labourer. On the 5th of February I was near the Prince of Wales, public-house, coming from Collyer-street, and saw Mr. Parry, the prisoner, and another man, coming from the public-house, which lays backward. The prisoner said, "If you are a man, stand up and fight." A man behind said, "Don't strike him, let him have fair play." Mr. Parry stood with his back towards me - I could not see in what situation his hands were. The prisoner struck him about the nose, and he fell with his head against the stones. Parry appeared to be very much in liquor - I do not think the prisoner was quite sober, but he was not drunk. Parry rolled into the kennel against my feet, and never spoke afterwards. I said the man was dead. The prisoner said he was not dead, but drunk; that he had struck him, and broken a pipe in his mouth. I saw no broken pipe. I said I was sure the man's skull was fractured, and he should go for a doctor. The prisoner said it was of no use, for the doctor would not attend to him. I said he was a respectable man, and the doctor was bound to attend to him. I and some others took him up to the front of the public-house, but he was so heavy we were obliged to rest several times. The prisoner said he supposed his hat was knocked over the railing in front of the house, and fetched it for him - it all happened three or four yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mr. Parry was much in liquor? A. Yes. I had never seen him before. There is a step to the public-house - there is no pavement but small stones, and the gutter goes down aslant - I think a trifle would have knocked him down.</p>

            . I am servant at No. 25, Pleasant-row. I was passing the Prince of Wales, public house - the deceased was two or three yards from the door. The first I heard, was somebody saying "D - n your eyes, if you want any thing come on!" The person who spoke was nearer to the public-house than the deceased. I only saw the deceased and the man who said these words - he had no pipe in his mouth - I was close to him - Mr. Parry made no answer, nor did he raise his hand to strike the person - he seemed to be very much intoxicated, and the man appeared quite sober - he struck Mr. Parry a tremendous blow in the mouth, and then struck him a tremendous blow on his side, which knocked him down - he fell with the back of his head against the curb-stone - I walked away immediately, and next morning I heard he was dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons besides you saw these blows? A. I saw nobody there. I did not wait to see him carried away - I had not seen either of them come out of the house.</p>
               <p>HARRIET OLIVER. I live next door to the Prince of Wales, public-house, in the kitchen. I was standing against my steps and saw the gentleman. I heard the prisoner say, "D - n you, will you insult me?" The gentleman made no answer to him. I went up my steps, and saw the prisoner go and tap two or three times at the tap-room window - he called some one by his Christian name to come out and assist him, but nobody came. He then went up to the gentleman, who stood off the curb-stone. I was at my own gate, which is about thirty yards from them. I cannot say whether the gentleman was intoxicated or not - he saw the prisoner coming, and put up his hand to prevent a blow from coming, and said "Don't hit me, for I won't fight;" or something of that sort. The prisoner struck him, and he fell back - I only saw one blow - I was frightened, and went in doors.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How could you see thirty yards off? A. I heard the words, and after the gentleman was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170026"></xptr>knocked down I went close to him, and put my ear down to hear if he breathed, and the first witness came up. I did not see the prisoner when he first came out of the house - they might have been quarrelling before.</p>
               <p>MR. SYMES. I am a surgeon, and live in Judd-street. I have known Mr. John Humphries Parry for some years. I was called in, about half-past nine o'clock on the 5th of February, and found him on a bed at the Prince of Wales public-house - he had been dead some time. I afterwards examined his body, and have no doubt his death was caused by apoplexy, occasioned by a blow, and very likely by concussion. A blow which knocked him down, and knocked his head against the pavement, was very likely to produce that effect, and, supposing him to be intoxicated at the time, it is more likely.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If a drunken man fell, from reeling, without a blow, the same effect might be produced? A. It is possible. He was thirty-eight years old, and about five feet ten in height - he was not so strongly built as the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have witnesses who saw him strike me, and saw the pipe in my mouth.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and work for the prisoner. I went to this public-house to receive my wages - he usually pays his men there: I went there about three o'clock in the afternoon; I had not seen Mr. Parry in the house, but about a quarter to nine I heard a rapping at the window, went out, and saw my master and the gentleman standing together - another man was there, who had gone out before me; my master and Mr. Parry were both in a fighting attitude, and as soon as I stepped forward Mr. Parry made a hit at my master; the blow caught on his elbow; the prisoner then hit him; I could not see where; he staggered back, and fell, with his head against the curb stone - Mr. Bennett stepped forward, and lifted him up; two or three more gentlemen assisted, and got him to the door. I did not see the French gentleman there. They put him down at the door, for they would not let him in for some time; I went in and said, there was a man very ill - three or four persons came out and brought him in. My master went into the tap-room. He had had a pipe inside the house, but I did not see it outside.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did your master live? A. In Exeter-street, Lisson-grove. We were working by this public-house. I saw my master next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on Monday and Tuesday about his work as usual? A. No; he was taken up on Tuesday afternoon; I had seen him at the Hope, public-house, at the bottom of the City-road, about a quarter of a mile from the Prince of Wales. I was at the Prince of Wales when the Inquest sat, but was not examined. I told a friend of the gentleman's what I had seen while the inquest were sitting. I saw Johnson there when it happened; he came up after I did: I was at the public-house door, about four yards from them. I did not hear Mr. Parry speak, nor did I hear master d - n him - he carried him to the door, and then went in: somebody said, "Take him to where he has been getting drunk."</p>

            . I am a sawyer, and was working where Bennett was. I was at this public-house. I saw the prisoner drinking and smoking there; he went out with his pipe, and in about a minute he pushed the door open, and hallooed for assistance; he said, Bill or Will - I went out, and directly I got to the door I saw him and the deceased, in a fighting attitude, seven or eight yards from the door; Bennett struck him - he reeled, and fell; I went to assist him up, and Bennett also went for the same purpose - he had no pipe then. Before he struck the blow he said the man had struck him. I do not think the blow would have hurt the man if he had not been in liquor. We sat him against the door, thinking he would come round, as he breathed - I thought he was only stunned. Bennett went into the house; I left at twelve o'clock - Bennett did not stay so long.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he stay long enough to hear that the man was dead? A. I believe he did. I was at the house when the Inquest sat, but was not called in. The beadle knew I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out, "Don't hit the man?" A. No. I did not hear a word spoken, except that Bennett said,</p>

               <p>"This man has struck me," and then he struck him. - The prisoner had not paid his men; he had not got the money.</p>

            . I keep the Prince of Wales, public-house, and have done so for twelve months. The prisoner paid his men there; he wanted me to cash a bill on this night, which I refused. Mr. Parry had not been drinking at my house - he came to the bar door soon after eight o'clock; he was intoxicated. Bennett was drinking and smoking there. When I let Mr. Parry out Bennett followed him with his pipe in his mouth; he went for a necessary purpose: there is a place outside. When Mr. Parry was brought back we thought he was only stunned - I had no idea of his being dead.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had Mr. Parry been in your house? A. About two minutes; he only came in and asked how my wife was; he appeared very much in liquor. He could not open the door, and said, "Cannot I get out:" I let him out. He said, "I don't want to mix with your tap-room company;" the prisoner replied that tap-room company was a good as him, and followed him out. I saw the sawyer go out in two or three minutes, and in about five minutes the body was brought in. I heard nothing about a pipe being broken. Bennett stopped there about half an hour after. I saw the prisoner at the Inquest on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in custody then? A. I suppose he was; he did not desire that Williams or Lines should be examined.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did he come before the Coroner of his own will? A. A warrant was issued against him; his brother went to fetch him, but the officer went after him.</p>

               <p>Manby. She is a large dark brown saddle mare: I heard of her about two months afterwards. I went to Justice Welch's;

             That was about a month or six weeks before Mr. Manby had her again of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you buy her?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I bought her at Turnham-green; she stood there, where we call to water, going up and coming down, the farther Pack-horse. Mr. Clark, that lives there, told me she was to be sold; she was standing in the street, with a sack on her back, and the prisoner was by her. He said, if I had a mind to have her, I should have her on trial; so I took out one of my own horses, and put her in, and drove to London, and out again to Turnham-green. The prisoner met me on the road, and got upon the coach, and rode to Turnham-green. I asked the price of the mare, but cannot be certain whether he asked eight guineas or seven: I agreed to give him six guineas and a half: I think I gave him half a guinea earnest, and he rode the mare along by the coach to Staines, and paid him the remainder of the money, and he delivered the mare up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the mare?</p>

               <p>Bradley. I cannot tell; she is over age.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is the mare worth?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never intended to part with her, so I never set a price on her. She can be worth no less than 16 or 18 guineas.</p>
               <p>Bradley. The prisoner came with me to Turnham-green the next day; he said, she was his own, and he sold her because she was too heavy for him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grinstead. I saw the mare in Mr. Manby's field, on the 17th of August, between six and seven at night, and in the morning she was gone. I was with Mr. Manby, when Mr. Bradley delivered the mare up to him; I know her very well.</p>

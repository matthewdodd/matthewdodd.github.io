            . I live in Long's-buildings, and am a headborough. On the 21st of May I received information, went to a public-house in Golden-lane, and found the prosecutor and prisoner sitting on a seat together - the prosecutor charged him with this robbery, and the prisoner denied it; I asked if he would give charge of him - he said he would rather have his money; I hesitated some time, and the prisoner said, "If you or Bishop will go with me, you shall have your money back again" - I did not countenance that, as there were some of his companions about there: I had heard mention of a bag and seven shillings in silver - the prosecutor said he had lost upwards of 30s.; I took the prisoner - he gave me a thrust away, and ran off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found no bag nor money? A.No.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner - I said I wanted him for stealing a canvas bag and seven shillings from Bishop, in Old-street, on the 21st of May - he said there were but six shillings in the bag, and that it was hanging out of Bishop's pocket when he took it; he said the same to the inspector, at the station-house - he said before the Magistrate, "I don't deny it."</p>

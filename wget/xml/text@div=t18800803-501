                  </hi>. I am salesman to the firm of Jesse Davidson Barker, and have been acting for them in this matter—I know the prisoner's writing—this letter contains the terms of the arrangement between my firm and the prisoner—the prisoner had a partner named Pretty in 1877—this is the prisoner's signature; he ceased to be Pretty's partner at the end of 1878, and in December, 1879, we received this stock list in the prisoner's writing, showing that he had 571 dozen umbrellas in stock—with a very trifling difference that is correct—this document is in the prisoner's writing: "May 30, 1879. Please let bearer have 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on half-dozen umbrellas, and oblige G. A. W. Morton"—Messrs. Smith and Dimond are pawnbrokers of Newgate Street, and we have obtained several umbrellas from them—in consequence of instructions I came to London on April 19—this letter of April 30, 1879, is in Morton's writing, and is an order to Mr. Barker for 200 dozen umbrellas—this letter of 3rd September, 1879, is in the prisoner's writing; he says, "Stock wanted at once," and in this letter of September 6 he says, "Hope to see more stock next week, now is the time"—on 22nd September he writes, "I am working your</p>

               <p>goods well just now"—I saw him on 21st April and he produced a bundle containing a number of pawn-tickets, and said that it was no use hiding it longer, he would make a clean breast of it—I asked him how he could do such a thing—he said that he was to blame, it was his own extravagance, and he had spent the money—I asked if he had disposed of any other goods; he said "I have, to job buyers and others," and that he had received the money and spent it—I said that I should telegraph to J. D. Barker—this letter of 22nd April is in his writing, in which he says that he cannot find words sufficient to express his sorrow—on 1st May I took out a summons at the Mansion House, returnable on the 10th—he did not appear, and I obtained a warrant, upon which he was brought up on the 24th, and remanded till 29th July—the 157 dozen pawn tickets he gave me represented 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—100 dozen had been pawned up to December 13, 1879, and partly by special contract—in consequence of his not appearing I redeemed about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, but could not redeem more as the tickets had expired—the manager or I had the whole of the pawn tickets, but we cannot find them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Barker is not here—I have invoiced goods direct to Pretty and Morton, but "Stock" has always been written on the invoices—I never made an cut sale to them—they never made a purchase of me which was charged against the commission account—they have not made direct purchases from me—I never consigned goods to any place in England for sale by auction, nor were any sold by auction at my direction—I have sent goods abroad for sale, but do not know how they were sold—umbrellas do not depreciate in value for a year—Mr. Pretty retired in 1878, and Morton went on; besides being our agents. they were independent merchants, excepting in umbrellas—they could not retain our agency and have another—they could sell to wholesale houses only—I cannot say what discretion they had—you will find the terms of the contract there—the prisoner frankly told me what he had done, but I do not think I made any remark, I only asked why he could dispose of goods in that way—I was on very good terms with him—I went and had some refreshment with him—I said that he could not starve though he had committed a breach of morals and a breach of contract—I had a statement with me, which I corrected by his duplicate books, showing the account between him and the firm—I did not take stock, I assume that he had disposed of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—there is no ledger account—I did not draw up the account debiting him with the value of the goods which he has not accounted for by regular sales—Mr. Barker has only been up to town once since Mr. Pretty retired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After the prisoner gave me the pawn tickets I told him that I must communicate with Mr. Barker, which I did that day or the next—I put myself in the hands of the solicitors, and took what course they thought right—the prisoner was not authorised to pledge goods in any way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an eating-house keeper, of 43, Bethnal Green Road—on Saturday, 20th September, the prisoner, who had been in my employ a month as extra man, was boneing meat at the back of the shop about 1 p.m.—I told him he was doing it very slowly and badly and wast<lb></lb>ing the meat, and he threw the things off the table, bones and all manner of things—I <hi rend="italic">blowed</hi> him up for it, and he swore at me—I went to serve my customers in the shop and afterwards had my tea—I then went behind the counter, and about G.20 the prisoner came to me and said "You b——what have you to say to me?"—I told him to go away about his work or I would send for a policeman and have him taken away—he went away from the</p>

               <p>front of the counter, where he was standing, to a settle and stayed there a few minutes—he then took bis blue smock off, threw it down, and came to the counter with his shirt sleeves tucked up on both arms; he had nothing in his hands—he came behind the counter and pushed up against me—I pushed him back twice—he came a third time, and as I went to push him away again I received a dreadful blow under my left arm—he got away from me then and came back, and then I saw this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his right hand in the attitude of striking—I put my left hand up to ward off the blow and it cut the palm of my hand nearly in half—I felt blood fast running down my body from where I had been struck under my arm, and cried out "I have been stabbed!"—the prisoner was held down and I was taken upstairs.</p>

I was a waitress in the prosecutor's service—about 4 o'clock in the afternoon I was in a room at the back of the shop—the prisoner was there boneing meat—his master asked him what he had been doing all the afternoon, for what he had done he himself could do in five minutes—the master left and the prisoner'then said that if he offended him once more that day he would stick the b——knife in his b——ribs—he had this knife in his hand at that time—I was in the shop about 6 o'clock when the prisoner used bad language to the prosecutor, who was behind the counter serving customers—the prisoner went behind the counter and drew a knife from his right hand pocket—my master said "Oh, good God, there is a knife, I feel a knife!"—I saw them struggling together, but did not see him stabbed—I ran for a doctor.</p>

I live at 12 Ravenscroft Street—I was in Clamtree's shop about 6.30 and saw him behind his counter—the prisoner asked him what he had been finding fault with him for—he said that he had better go down and attend to his work—he would not go and Clamtree said that if he did not go he would have him removed—the prisoner came from behind the counter and sat down on the settle where people were waiting—he then pulled off his smock, pulled a knife out of his pocket and a piece of sand<lb></lb>stone, about two inches long, which he kept rubbing up and down the knife to sharpen it—he said that before the night was out he would have his b——life—he ran at the master and they struggled behind the counter—the prosecutor told him to go from behind the counter, but he would not, the prosecutor caught hold of him and the prisoner stabbed him—I saw him reel round and fall, and ran for a policeman—this is the knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 180, High Street, Shore<lb></lb>ditch—about about 6.30 on this evening I saw the prosecutor at his own house—he was excessively low, fainting, and prostrate, bleeding from a wound on his left side, which commenced about an inch below the armpit, and extended downwards, and a little backwards, it was two inches wide and six or seven inches long—such a knife as this would produce it—if the knife had entered laterally it would have wounded the lungs, and he would have died, and if it had entered one inch lower down death must have en<lb></lb>sued—he went on fairly for a fortnight, erysipelas then set in, and his life was in danger—the inside of his left hand was cut across, and his right hand was out just a little—I have attended him ever since, and he is still far from well.</p>

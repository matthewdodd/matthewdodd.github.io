On the 25th of May I received information that some iron plates had been taken from the rail-road on the premises; I went about eleven o'clock in the morning, and missed a pair of plates- I had information, and saw them that afternoon, when John Wyard brought them to the premises, about three o'clock; I know the prisoners by sight; Chamberlain and Thomas Earl were in our employ as brick-makers; I had seen them about seven o'clock that morning; that was before I had received any information; I went about twelve or one o'clock to Chamberlain, and told him he had taken some of the iron railing; he said "Earl is in it too;" he said he had taken one piece to Henry Hughes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you threaten him, or offer him any thing? A. No; he said it had just gone into his dinner bag, and he had received one penny for it; he then told me Mr. Hughes offered him so much a week to bring iron in; he said he had taken it to the deaf man, Henry Hughes; but he said nothing more about this particular piece of iron; I had been to Hughes once before; I spoke to him, but I have never seen this particular piece of iron there; I met Hughes before the Magistrate the next day at eleven o'clock; I got a warrant against him the same day about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Where did Wyard bring these plates? A. To the premises, from a lane at the back of Old Brentford; I had not seen them before that; they weigh about 1 1/2cwt.; I cannot say what they are worth as iron; they are worth 15 shillings as plates, for a rail-way; West has worked for us about a fortnight; Hughes did not come forward voluntarily; I never went to him to demand an explanation; there was a person there who called himself Hughes' father, and said some boys had been there the night before; he said too much for me to remember; he did not tell me that iron had been brought and refused, and that I might look over his premises; I did not look, because I had good reason to know that the iron was not there then; I went to see if there was any more.</p>

            . I do anything. I have been living with my father, who is a sweep, in Brentford. I went with the two Earls and young Chamberlain, and got some iron, about one o'clock in the day - it was about a week before we went to the Magistrate's; we took the piece of iron from Mr. Trimmer's, and went to Henry Hughes, who gave us about 2s. among us - all my share was 5 1/2d.; the men were at their dinner; we went through the field, and Thomas Earl took up some little pieces of iron, and put them into his pocket; after that Farn and I took a pair of plates; Chamberlain, the two Earls, and I took the rail roads about a month before we went to the Magistrate's.</p>

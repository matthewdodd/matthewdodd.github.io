                  </hi>. I am a publican, and live in Clerkenwell. This picture and frame hung in my parlour—I lost it—it never was taken from the house—he could not get out with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of George White. I saw the prisoner come into the parlour about half-past eight o'clock in the evening of the 9th of November—there were several persons in the parlour—he had a glass of half-and-half, and drank three glasses of gin and water—there were some pic<lb></lb>tures in the room—I went into the parlour about a quarter past eleven o'clock, and saw this picture behind the door, under the stool where the prisoner had been sitting—it had been hanging on the wall—the prisoner was close by the fire—I thought it was a curious place, and went out and gave information to my master—at twelve o'clock I went into the parlour, and told them it was twelve—I then placed myself behind the passage door—'the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man came out,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184211280103"></xptr>
               <p>and held the door in his hand—the prisoner went back, and put the parlour gas out—he brought the picture out in his hand—he tried to go out of the door, but the other one did not go out sufficiently for him to get out, and the way was blocked up—he then went to the back door, and could not get out—he came to the passage door, and saw the place was not clear—he put the pic<lb></lb>ture down behind the passage door—the other one said, "We are going to have a drop to part"—the prisoner said, "No, my funds won't allow it"—then the prisoner went out and saw the policeman—the caiman came back, and said he thought the man was robbing my master—he said, "Yes, I sus<lb></lb>pect you both are."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I, during the evening, sit under where the picture hung? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—you went out several times, and left the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man alone—it was about three yards from the place I saw the picture to where I found it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 120.) I took the prisoner—he said he knew nothing about the picture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was the door a little ajar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yet—you had been drink<lb></lb>ing, but were not drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence,</hi> I left the caiman in there, and was it not possible that some other person might have removed the picture? I do not recollect having it in my hand at all, but I was drunk. I left several persons is the room, and we cannot tell what jokes were played in the house. I can only account for the part I took in it, which was only removing it from the ground. There was no attempt to remove it from the premises. I think it is true that the landlord did suspect the caiman, and that he gave the information to save himself. It might be imprudent for me to move it, but there was no effort to take it off the premises. I placed it there, not to come back for it, as it was a late hour at night. I had no felonious motive. I know nothing of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man. I did not attempt to run away; I paid, and was about to depart in a quiet manner.</p>

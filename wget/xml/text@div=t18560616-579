I was staying with my aunt Jones, in Took's-court, Lincoln's-inn—on 24th April, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was in Searle-street, going to look for my uncle—I met the prisoner—he asked me if I would go and fetch him half a quartern of rum, and he would give me a penny—he told me not to go to the first public house, but to the second—I said I would—he gave me a bottle, and a half crown—I went to the house, and they gave me the rum—I gave the half crown to the bur girl, and she gave it to her mistress—there was a potman there—the half crown was shown to him, and he broke it—he went out, and could not find a policeman at first—he went again, and found one—I staid there all the time—when the policeman came I told him about the half crown—I went into the street, and the policeman followed after me—I did not see the man that gave me the half crown again, till the policeman came to me some days afterwards—I went with him to the station at Clerkenwell—I do not know whether I saw six or eight men there—the man that gave me the half crown was amongst them, and the prisoner is the man—I pointed him out directly—no one pointed him out to me—I am quite sure he is the person.</p>

I asked him what he wanted; I went out; when he got me about twenty yards he knocked me down, and took three guineas and a purse out of my pocket: as soon as he had robbed me he ran away. A man who was putting his horse in called out to know what I did there; when I got up I went to the Black Lion; I was all on a gore of blood; he cut my mouth very bad.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - I was as sober as I am now: we had two pots of beer among four of us. The prisoner was taken that night, and I saw him at the Rotation Office next day. I knew him, and immediately swore to him at the Rotation Office. Two of the companies at the Black Lion went out after him, and a coachman that is here took him; it was at the time the snow was upon the ground, and it was pretty light, but I did not see his face when we were out.</p>

               <p>What did he knock you down with? - I don't know whether he knocked me down with a stick or his fist; my own stick lay by the side of me afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did you call out? - No: it was under the dead wall; I called out, and a man asked what was the matter, and the prisoner said I would not let him go away.</p>
               <p>How long had he been in your company at the alehouse? - He went backwards and forwards, he was there till we drank two pots of beer; I cannot say how long it was.</p>
               <p>How long do you think? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>You did not resist? - I could not resist, I am an old man. I came back to the house as soon as I could; he got me by the arm and ran me along.</p>

               <p>I came to town with Mr. Cooper on the 30th of January. The first time we met with Evans was at Marshall's the Horseshoe and Magpye in Holborn; there was a woman that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210024"></xptr> goes a nursing had got a shirt to sell, Mr. Cooper bought the shirt; I went to get change for a half guinea of Mr. Marshall; I brought the half guinea and gave it to Mr. Cooper again; the prisoner took up the half guinea, and did not lay it down again; then Evans said, if we would go to the Black Lion she was there, and would meet Mr. Cooper there; we went there and drank, he went out at the door, and said to Mr. Cooper, I want to speak something to you for your good, and the woman will give you the half guinea. As soon as they were gone out, the landlord said, Do you know any thing of that chap? I told him we knew nothing of him. I went after Mr. Cooper, and just as I was going, he came in al l over blood, and said, the man that took him out had robbed him. The landlord and others went out after him, and a little before twelve o'clock they catched him. I saw him at the watch-house after he was taken; he had shifted his cloaths, he had then lightish cloaths on; he had an old blue coat with a red cap on when he called Mr. Cooper out of the house. I saw the money the constable of the night took out of his pocket, there was eight shillings or thereabouts.</p>

The prisoner and these two men came into my house about half past eight o'clock; they had one pot of beer; Evans went out two or three times; he came in the second or third time, and told Cooper, if he would come out, there was the woman would give him a half guinea they had lost. Cooper immediately got up and said, he would like to see the woman, for he knew her very well. I asked the prisoner, why he did not bring the woman in, because the woman would steal? and he said, she would not come in, she was down at the wall. Mr. Cooper went out with him; he came in again, and said he was knocked down. He asked me, if I did not know the man? I said I did, because I knew him in his apprenticeship. He said he would give any body ten pounds to take him; I said, I would go, if any body would go with me, and seek him; we could not find him for two hours; when we were out in Gray's inn-lane, we saw two lads, who said he was in a house; they took him in Gray's-inn-lane a little after that.</p>

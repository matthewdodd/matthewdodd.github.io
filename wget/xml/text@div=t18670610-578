                  </hi>. I am a carver and gilder, of 20, Great St. Andrew Street—about twelve o'clock on Saturday night, 11th May, I was in my shop, when my father, the deceased, went to get some beer for supper—a few minutes afterwards I heard my sister scream, I ran outside and found my sister had just caught my father by the arms, he was about two feet from the kerb, lying down on the ground—he was perfectly insensible—his head was covered with blood, I saw a cab there, it had just passed over him—it was not more than an inch or two from him, ho was just behind the wheel; the cab was going on when I saw it—it went on for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100054"></xptr>
               <p>about three doors before it stopped, just at the end of street—the prisoner was driving it—he was drunk, I told him so directly I saw him—I assisted in taking my father to the hospital—it appeared to me as if his left temple was smashed—some persons in the street turned the cab round, I went to him and said, "You have run over my father, and you must take him to the hospital"—he would not answer me—he did at last take him—when we got there I asked him for his ticket—he said he was not going to give me a ticket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there a crowd when you went out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some people were running over, directly they heard the scream, from the George public-house opposite, where he had been for the beer; there was a crowd in a very few minutes—there was a cab behind the prisoner—I could see the prisoner was drunk, by his ways, his face was red and he seemed going forwards on his cab, as if he was not able to control himself—I have seen men excited; he was quite drunk—I and another person went in the cab with my father to the hospital; I did not see any persons on the springs behind—I did not notice any one in the cab when I first came out—there were no cabs or conveyances going the other way; the prisoner was going up from St. Martin's Lane—the prisoner was sitting on his cab all the time, he did not get off—there was no policeman there, or I should have given him charge, I looked out all the way to the hospital and could not see one—there was a waterman at the hospital, but I had no idea he had power to take him—the porter at the hospital got the ticket from the prisoner after some demur.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Neale's Yard, Drury Lane, and am a costermonger—on the night of 11th May, about twelve o'clock—I came out of the Geroge with the deceased and another man, we walked for about two doors—the deceased then crossed the road—I stood on the kerb; therewas a cab coming down the street at a fast pace, on the right-hand side, his wrong side, the driver hallooed "Hoy!" two or three times; he was then between four and five yards from the deceased—he was knocked down by the cab, and the wheel went over him; he was perhaps about a yards from the kerbj or a little more—the cab went on, a man went and the corner before it was stopped, that might be the length of a shop and a half, or two shops—I don't know in what state the prisoner was; he was going at too much of a pace, or else he might have pulled up before he reached him—there were lamps on each side of the way—I should say he was going at the rate of twele miles an hour.</p>

I live at 20, Great St. Andrew Street, and am a photographer's assistant—about twelve o'clock on this night I was stand<lb></lb>ing at my door, which is five or six doors from the Geroge, talking to my wife—she suddenly screamed out—on turning round I saw the cab within a foot of the deceased; he was knocked down by the horse when he was</p>

               <p>within about two feet of the kerb, and I saw the right-hand wheel go over his body—he was on his wrong side of the way, within about two feet of the lamp-post—after running over the deceased he crossed on the opposite side of the road, and went about two doors and a half from the spot—I ran over and seized the horse's head—I could not judge of the pace at which the cab was going; if he had been going at a proper pace he could have pulled up much quicker than he did—he was going very fast—I heard the deceased's son say he was drunk—I was too agitated to notice his state—he refused to turn round for a long while, till another person came to my assistance and turned his horse round—I did not say anything to him—I tried to pull his horse round to take the deceased to the hospital—he made no answer, but he did not offer to turn; we had to turn the horse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he not agitated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say; I did not notice—he was going at a faster pace than cabs generally go—I suppose the ordinary pace is seven or eight miles an hour—I did not examine the horse; I am no judge of horses—there were not many people there until the accident took place—I swear positively that I saw the wheel pass over the deceased; it was the off wheel, the one next to me—I should think it passed over the lower part of his body—I did not hear the cabman call out; I was talking to my wife, and did not see anything of the accident till the horse was within a foot of the deceased.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Charing Cross Hos<lb></lb>pital—I saw the deceased there at one o'clock, a short time after he was admitted—he was insensible—he had a wound on the left temple about an inch and a half long, from which he had been bleeding profusely—I did all I could to restore him, but he died about a quarter to eight—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination opposite the wound in the left temple—I found a portion of bone depressed, also extravasation of blood on the right side of the skull—all the vessels of the brain were more or less congested; the stomach contained about two ounces of undigested food, which did not smell of spirit or drink—all the other organs were healthy—the cause of death was the depression of bone and the extravasation of blood on the brain—supposing his head had been struck by a horse's hoof, or a wheel had gone over it, I should have expected to find the appearances I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hackney-carriage attendant, and live at 7, Heathfield Street, Notting Hill—on the night of 11th May, about ten minutes or a quarter past twelve, I was on duty in Agar Street, when the prisoner's cab came up to the hospital, and the deceased was taken in—the cab-stand is just in front of the hospital, but there was no cab on the rank—it is part of my duty to watch the cabs that come up to the hospital—seeing three or four persons round the cab, I went up to it—I had plenty of opportunity of seeing the prisoner—in my opinion he was perfectly sober; if he had been otherwise it would have been my duty to have con<lb></lb>fined him—I was at the police court, called on the other side—I told what I had to say about the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you tell Inspector Thompson that the pri<lb></lb>soner was the worse for drink? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A man might have a glass of drink; he was a little excited—I did not say he was the worse for drink; I swear that—I have been suspended, for not taking the prisoner into custody, until this inquiry is over—I never told the inspector or anybody else that the prisoner was drunk.</p>

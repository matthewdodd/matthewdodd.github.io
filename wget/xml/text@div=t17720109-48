There is the mark of two chissels, which had been made use of in order to strain the sash off to take away the effect of the screw; it is very plain they entered there: by the violent wrench the bed within side gave way, so they then got up the sash. In order to favour their design, when they came in, the curtain was let down so as to screen every thing above the top of the wall, for fear, I suppose, that the light should appear. The same people that entered broke open a chest of drawers. In the front palour there was a tea-chest, in which were two silver cannisters, a pair of silver tea-tongs, and a silver strainer; they took them, and they threw the sugar out of the sugar-dish on the table between the windows: they went, I suppose, next into the back parlour; there was a chest of drawers with five large drawers. The chest was a very strong one, which they had great difficulty in opening; they broke open the bottom of a book-case, a bureau, and a closet in that room (the back parlour). They also broke open in the passage another place that the servants bring the linen down from, that is used on the table (the house-keeper's pantry) but they took nothing from that.</p>
               <p>Q. What was lost out of the back parlour?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. A gold coronation medal, a broad five-and-twenty, a piece of gold coin, &amp;c. (repeating the things mentioned in the indictment) with many other things of great value.</p>
               <p>Q. The most valuable of these things, where were they?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. In the chest; the rest, the gold chains, the crown pieces, and the half-crown pieces were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that chest very difficult to open?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. It is a mahogany chest, of an inch and a half-plank, with plates at each corner, fastened with wood screws; they began it at one corner, then they whirled it round and went to the other corner; and at last drew three screws out that screwed the siaple, about this length ( describing it, about a foot long) I do not suppose a horse could have drawn them out.</p>
               <p>Q. No body had access to it but yourself?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. No other person.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it since you had been at the chest before?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. There was hardly a day in the year when I was in town but I went to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen most of these things in the chest in some reasonable time?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. Yes; and there was a pocket-book with some notes of hand, and to a very considerable amount. I verily believe they were all there that night, at twelve o'clock, that the robbery was committed. I returned home from the tavern about twenty minutes after eleven, and from half an hour till three quarters after eleven I went to bed. Some of my family will shew you lordship; they were up after me. I went into the back parlour, as I always do, to hang up my hat, and put down my stick. I always go into the fore parlour to receive my cap to go up to bed; every thing was safe then; it was one of the finest nights, perhaps, as ever was seen; it was full moon, and a remarkably clear, fine night; that if any man had stood upon the hill, if I had stood at the top, and he stood any where between the bottom and the top, I should certainly have seen him, it was so remarkably a clear night. I was disturbed about a quarter after seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light then?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. It was not light enough to see to dress myself properly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think they must have been about breaking open this strong chest, and the other places?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. I should think they could not be less than two hours; there was another box in this strong chest that had nothing but writings in it; they broke it open; they were disappointed, and meddled with nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing, the persons that had committed this burglary, left behind them?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. My servant saw some things; there was a chissel, which was a very useful thing to them in this robbery; after having got the chissel into this chest, they broke the saneer, and came at the screws; for it is a very strong chest. They had then recourse to my parlour poker,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090028"></xptr> which had been new steeled, that was so drove against the end of the top of the chest, that it has left almost a polish on the poker now.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in your judgement you have no doubt but the thieves got in at this window?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the servants use candles when you came down?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. Yes, when I came into this back parlour the chest was opened, and the writings and things thrown about; some writings remained in the drawers, some were thrown about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go out of the door or window?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. They went out the same way they came in I believe; they opened the gate to go out of it; but they went out of the window of the house; they unbolted the bolts but could not get the lock open; the key is always carried up stairs, and so they went out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. from all the prisoners. Whether you ever saw us loiter about your house with intention to rob you?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. No.</p>

            . I got up about half an hour after seven. I came down a little before my master.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Sir Robert said he got up at half after seven; the servant says he got up before his master.</p>
               <p>Wargent. I can't speak exactly to the time. The thieves had got in at the parlour window next the gate; it is about a yard and a quarter high; I believe they had broke the bolt of the outside shutter off, which I had bolted over night, there is a pin goes a-cross the window; they had forced there their chissels in, and so separated the sashes and got them open. I fastened the window about four o'clock in the afternoon. I went to bed about twelve o'clock; I was in that parlour a little before I went to bed; the window was safe then. When I came down stairs I went into the fore room; I saw the window up and one of Sir Robert's swords lying naked in a chair; it was a mourning sword; it was in the sheath the night before standing upon the ground in the back parlour. I found three pokers in the back parlour, one of them was bent.</p>
               <p>Q. Does no servant lie either on the kitchen or parlour floor?</p>
               <p>Wargent. No; all above stairs. I saw this chissel (producing it) and the chest was drawn out about a yard, the chissel is broke; here is the bolt of the parlour window (producing it) it was broke off, a strong poker very much bent; they made an attempt at my pantry, but had not broke it open; they broke open several drawers in the kitchen; the door was locked, and they had tried to wrench it with this chissel by the mark of it; they broke one of the points of the nails.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing lost out of the kitchen?</p>
               <p>Wargent. Yes; three silver saucepans, two silver skewers, three tea-spoons, and one old table-spoon. I saw them there the night before when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you wake in the morning?</p>
               <p>Wargent. Not till the house-maid came to call me. I laid up three-pair-of-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoners. If he saw us lurking about the house at any time?</p>
               <p>Wargent. I saw two men there about ten o'clock over night, they were in the passage of the next house but one to Sir Robert's; there is a court; I cannot tell who they were, one was standing at the end of this passage, another standing at the next house; I came up to our gate; I did not ring, but turned round, and looked at them; I went towards them, and they went up the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this when you went to fetch Sir Robert home?</p>
               <p>Wargent. No; I had been out about my own business before.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoners. Whether it was either of us?</p>
               <p>Wargent. I do not think it was; I went to fetch Sir Robert about eleven; we got home about a quarter after eleven; but saw none of them then.</p>

            . I got up about a quarter after seven, after the robbery was committed; when I came down two-pair-of-stairs from the garret, I saw the dining-room door open, and the best bedroom,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090029"></xptr> nobody lay in that room.</p>
               <p>Court. Did nobody lie on the first floor?</p>
               <p>Jones. No: when I came to the parlour door I saw both the doors open, and the window wide open, and the curtains were down; I went up to the house-keeper to call up Sir Robert; we let the curtains down when we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Sir Robert said they were up.</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. When I came from the tavern I went into the room, the curtains appeared to me to be up then.</p>

               <p>Jones. Entirely down; I drawed the curtains up before I saw Sir Robert.</p>
               <p>Q. How far up?</p>
               <p>Jones. I drew them up pretty near the top, not quite, they do not go quite to the top. There were missing one quart saucepan and one pint saucepan, and another saucepan without a handle, all silver; they were upon the shelf in the kitchen, and there was a silver skewer and an old silver kitchen spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing the persons had left behind them?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, a match and a candle in the fore parlour window.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the match one of your matches?</p>
               <p>Jones. No; we have not such matches in the house, as I know of; these are them (producing a bit of a large match that had been lighted and a piece of candle) the candle was in the window that was broke open.</p>

               <p>Jones. Without a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Up stairs, where you were, it was I suppose light enough, but dark when you came</p>
               <p>down, because the windows were shut and the curtains down?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>

               <p>Jones. I opened nothing before I called Sir Robert, but drew up the curtains and opened the door.</p>

             brought to me the two gold chains, and all the plate; there were two gold snuff-boxes, one round and one flat and square; one large linked gold chain and another small one; they were all in the room at the time; but Jones and Phanix delivered them. I saw a picture in the square snuff-box. There were between thirty and forty mourning rings; I never counted them; there was about eight or nine diamond rings. I picked one or two diamonds out of the other rings; there was one white enamelled ring, with a large diamond in it, and one ring with a motto with diamonds all round.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what the motto was?</p>
               <p>Lyons. No; I did not take notice of that; there was one hoop diamond ring set, I think, in gold; there was a diamond breast buckle; there were three silver saucepans, two skewers; one of the silver saucepans had the handle broke off; two silver tea cannisters, one silver sugar bason, with a cover, they were square, both of a size; there was one eating spoon that had been used very much; there was a kind of a coat of arms upon it, but I did not understand it, and there were one pair of tea-tongs, and two or three old silver tea spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect any mark on the plate?</p>
               <p>Lyons. The spoon wa s marked: I do not recollect it.</p>

               <p>Lyons. Nothing was said; but the gold and silver was weighed; and I gave them sixteen guineas and half a moidore in part of payment; it was for the silver plate.</p>

               <p>Lyons. A great quantity of them, for they took them away with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay with you?</p>
               <p>Lyons. About three quarters of an hour, Burton and Flannagan went away first about a quarter of an hour before the other two; Phanix and Jones staid to reckon what they would come to.</p>

               <p>Q. What did they say?</p>
               <p>Lyons. I asked them where the things came from; Jones and Phanix said they came from a house in the city, but could not tell whose; they said the house went down somewhere by the water side; that it was a very great house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you what way it was got?</p>
               <p>Lyons. They told me they broke it open. Jones said that they were near three hours before they could get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Near three hours getting in, or after they were in the house?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Near three hours before they got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they explain whether they were near three hours trying to force their way in; or what was the expression they used?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Very near three hours before they could get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jones say this in the presence of the other three?</p>
               <p>Lyons. No; after Burton and Flanagan were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation about the house where these things came from in the presence of Burton and Flanagan?</p>
               <p>Lyons. No. (A spoon shewn him) That is the very crest.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the same crest on the old spoon?</p>
               <p>Lyons. There was no crest nor coat of arms, but only three letters.</p>

               <p>Lyons. I saw them no more after that time. On the Monday following I sent nine guineas to the prisoners, in sealed-up papers; three guineas in three separate papers to Burton, Flanagan, and Phanix. I paid Jones three guineas at my own house on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you send these three guineas to each of them by?</p>
               <p>Lyons. My servant-girl; she is just by. I bid her carry one paper to Burton in Clerkenwell Bridewell; the others to Phanix and Flanagan in New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send money to these prisoners at any other time?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Yes; in the Christmas-week I sent fifteen guineas to prison, and five I gave to Jones when he came; five guineas to Burton, five guineas to Flanagan, and five guineas to Phanix: Jones came to me, and I gave him five guineas; that was a Saturday. I sent these parcels to the prison by my wife. I went last Saturday a week to Newgate, and carried them sixteen guineas. I saw there the four prisoners. Jones was then not confined, but was taken as he came down stairs. I gave them then four guineas a-piece out of my own pocket. They said they should want some more money before the sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the gold chains?</p>
               <p>Lyons. All the gold was melted down; the chains, medals, and boxes. One Josephs melted them down. There are two brothers of the Josephs; one had the silver, the other the gold.</p>

               <p>Lyons. I have not followed my religion a good while, for I cannot live by my religion.</p>

               <p>Lyons. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In that hand bill I believe all the things you have mentioned are described?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Yes; there were rather more things than were in that hand bill; the gold watch was not in the hand-bill.</p>
               <p>Q. You was asked whether you saw any crown pieces; you said you believed there was; you said you believed you saw some; it is only belief now, is it? You say Flanagan and Burton were gone away when you had this conversation?</p>

               <p>Lyons. I had very little conversation; this was all the conversation I had with them, which was after those two were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You was asked whether you enquired where the things came from, and they said, from a house in the city, but did not know where?</p>
               <p>Lyons. They did not know the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had no conversation with them whether they had been concerned in taking them, but only they said they came from a house they did not know where?</p>

               <p>Q. How long was it before you was taken into custody?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Near three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to charge the prisoners, above all the people you were acquainted with, with these things?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Because they brought them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that now, and insist upon it?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Yes; I said it before Sir John and Sir Robert.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never read over that hand-bill since, in order to refresh your memory as to the quantity of these things?</p>
               <p>Lyons. No; I kept it in my pocket: it was as black as ink: Mr. Tinsdale has got it.</p>

               <p>Bromly. Cave, or Lyons.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they tell you how much Lyons owed them?</p>
               <p>Bromly. No: I went to Lyons, and said I came from Phenix, and told him, that they desired he would send them some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you whether he had any thing of theirs?</p>

               <p>Q. Now mind you speak the truth, and tell us all you know.</p>
               <p>Bromly. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. That information was true, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Bromly. Yes, it was. Jones said, Lyons had some things of his; he said that he asked forty or fifty guineas for them; and Lyons said they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090033"></xptr> were not worth half the money, not nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Bromly. About three of four o'clock in the afternoon. I cannot say exactly; and Jones and I came away together. Lyons said he had got a piece of gold to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. He said this in the presence of Jones?</p>
               <p>Bromly. No; Jones was not there at that time. I said I would send somebody to buy it of him. I went to one Heatley.</p>
               <p>Court. He is not here?</p>
               <p>Council. No; he was here last sessions, but was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any gold at Lyons's?</p>
               <p>Bromly. I saw a piece of metal that they called gold; they put it in a scale; Heatley bought it; he gave him about thirty guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the conversation was about the rings; was any thing said about Heatley?</p>
               <p>Bromly. No; Heatley was not there. Jones said he had some rings worth 40 l. I saw none of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lyons or Jones talk about any other rings?</p>
               <p>Bromly. No.</p>

               <p>Bromly. He said he owed them some money, and desired he would send it.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he sent you, was there any talk about goods?</p>
               <p>Bromly. No, not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Heatley do with the gold?</p>
               <p>Bromly. He took it to the refiner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him?</p>
               <p>Bromly. Yes, I went to the place, and staid at the corner of the square. It was taken to one Mr. Cox's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go into the place?</p>
               <p>Bromly. I saw him turn down; and he came back, and asked me to go and buy and ounce of silver to hear what they would say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any reason?</p>
               <p>Bromly. He said, do you go and buy an ounce of sterling silver. I went and bought it; and when I came back, Heatley asked what they said; and I told him, they said nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Cox's?</p>
               <p>Bromly. I went to a house in Little-Britain.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember their coming to your house?</p>
               <p>S. Lyons. About a fortnight ago Jones came and enquired for my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being sent by your husband with a message to any of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>S. Lyons. Yes; about a fortnight ago he sent me to Phanix, Flanagan, and Burton; two of them were at New Prison, and the other at Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to carry to them?</p>
               <p>S. Lyons. Fifteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was in Clerkenwell?</p>
               <p>S. Lyons. Burton. I gave it to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with them?</p>
               <p>S. Lyons. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body present?</p>
               <p>S. Lyons. No; I called them out into the yard, and delivered five guineas to each. I staid about half an hour, and drank some wine. I cannot recollect any conversation that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Bromly?</p>
               <p>S. Lyons. Yes, I saw him once or twice with my husband. I believe the last time was about ten or eleven days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come about?</p>
               <p>S. Lyons. He brought a young man about some business. I was not up stairs. They said his name was Heatley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what Bromly brought?</p>
               <p>S. Lyons. A bit of gold that was melted. Bromly said he was sent for money; he said he came from New Prison; and said, the lads desired to know why he did not send them the money?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Jones there?</p>
               <p>S. Lyons. Yes, he came there the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Jones there with Bromly?</p>

I have the scales they had in Lyons's, house for weighing these things; Lyons produced them. He wanted to take them himself; we did not chuse that, without seeing him take them from thence. There was another piece melted at the same time this was; in the ingot was put some clay, to make one ingot smaller than the rest that were disposed of by Lyons to one Hankley.

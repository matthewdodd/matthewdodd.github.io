                  </hi>. I am the wife of Herman Rock, and live in Phillip-street, Back church-lane, Whitechapel. About nine o'clock at night, on the 1st of February, I was going along King William-street, holding my dress a little on one side—I felt a pull at my gown—I turned short round and saw the prisoner close at my elbow, and the bottom of my dress was resting on his arm—I put my hand to my pocket, turned on the prisoner, and met him face toface—I had a sovereign, a half-crown, two shillings, and one sixpence before in my pocket, but it was all gone, except the sixpence—I took the prisoner by the collar, and held him till the policeman came—I put my hand in my pocket—the prisoner walked past to a biscuit-shop—I followed him—he turned and went the other way—he had not got three yards from me—there were two of them when I turned round, but his hand was under my dress—I had seen the money safe three minutes before—I said to him, "You have robbed me"—he said, "I know nothing of you or your money"—I said, "How do you know I have lost money."</p>

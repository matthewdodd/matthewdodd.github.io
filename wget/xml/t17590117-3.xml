               <p>Rout. She came to my house, and brought some of my things that they had pawn'd.</p>

               <p>Rout. I do not know. I had not took up the prisoner, but I was told I should be prosecuted myself if I did not; I believe she would have brought the other things if I had not stopt her, had she known where they were. The goods produced in court.</p>
               <p>Mr Trip. The prisoner pledged these things with me as the property of her mother, on the 19th and 27th of October last.</p>

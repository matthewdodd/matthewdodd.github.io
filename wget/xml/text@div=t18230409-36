One handkerchief was in my husband's drawer and the other is mine; I missed some other things - she left on the 26th of February - I missed these things after she was gone, and went with an officer to her father's house, where I found her; this was on Tuesday, the 4th of March; a handkerchief was found on her neck, which was my husband's, and the other was found in an old box in the house; she said she bought the handkerchiefs at a pawnbroker's, for 2 s. The officer took her away before he found the second handkerchief; they have no initials on them, but were marked 1820; the mark upon one is now altered to 1821; the figures 182 are my own work.</p>

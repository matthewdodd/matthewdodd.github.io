             - A. I left the other prisoner when he was going to Hanway yard; I then saw Stone with two empty pails on his shoulder; I followed him to the back part of our premises, where the yeast was kept; he did not come on the premises, he merely deposited a pail on the premises where the yeast was kept, I believe; I did not stop to see; I went round to the front and concealed myself. In about twenty minutes I saw two of our servants fill a stand with yeast and heave it up to the loading place. I then saw our two men look very anxiously about them, and heard a signal given, when the loading place gates were opened sufficient to admit the body of a man; an empty pail was brought in by one of our servants.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner all this time - A. Walking outside of the premises. This pail was filled with yeast, and was then taken out and placed on the head of Stone; the other pail was outside of the gates. I immediately rushed from my hiding place, and took the prisoner Stone in custody; he requested me not to detain him, he would tell me where he lived if I would let him go; he said he paid our tunman for the yeast; the tunman immediately absconded, and has not been heard of since.</p>
               <p>JURY. You know it is not uncommon for bakers, or any body else, to go to the tunmen and get a quantity of yeast without the knowledge of the owners - A. Not at our house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I will trouble you with a question or two - whereabouts is the value o A. I fancy ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. For one pail of yeast! it must be a very large pail - you are first clerk to a very important concern - with respect of yeast are you competent to form a judgment what the value of a pail of yeast is - A. I do not precisely know it.</p>

            . Q. You are the chief brewer - do you know this Stone - A. I think I recollect him when I come to look at him - he said he paid three shillings for the yeast to one of the tunmen who is run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he was in the habit of coming to one of your tunmen to buy yeast - A. No, it was never allowed for any man to come and buy without applying to the accounting house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it allowed in other places for the tunmen to sell - A. I believe it is.</p>

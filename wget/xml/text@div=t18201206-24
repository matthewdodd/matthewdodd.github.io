On the 28th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in - we were rather busy - he asked for a quarter of a yard of linen, we could not serve him immediately. My young man afterwards said he had stolen a piece of lustre; I went to him, and found he had it in a wrapper which laid on the counter - I had observed the wrapper under his arm when he came in. He said a woman gave it to him.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Morris. I saw the prisoner put something in his wrapper. and asked him what he had got? he said a piece of goods which a woman gave him - he did not point the woman out.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOND. I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and found two silk and two cotton handkerchiefs on him, and a row of child's beads under his shirt, round his neck; also a piece of meat, about two pounds, and he had two great-coats on, the under one was marked PR. Four half-crowns and 18 d. were found in his mouth at Guildhall. I was obliged to tie his hands and legs to secure him.</p>

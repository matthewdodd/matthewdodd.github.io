I have known the prisoner ever since he lived in my grandmother's house, which is five years; he came, and told my mother a lady wanted her, and after she was gone he came up, and knocked at the door - I took no notice of it; the door was fastened but then a voice said, "If you don't open it, I will burst it open;" I did not know the voice - I then opened the door, and it was the prisoner; he came into the room, and I then saw two lads on the stairs - he took my mother's box from the room, and carried it away; it was not a very large box - he took hold of the box and said," Your mother sent me for the box;" I said,"You shan't have it," and took hold of it - he then said,"I must have it;" he pushed me down, and carried it away - I went down stairs, but he was gone, and the other two lads - my mother came back very soon; my two younger sisters were in the room with me.</p>

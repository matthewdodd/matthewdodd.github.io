            . On the 9th of May, I saw the prisoner run across Oxford-street, at half-past seven o'clock in the morning - he had nothing with him - I then met Mrs. Dundon - she asked which way Stockman had gone - I told her, she said he had robbed her of several things - I saw him again about nine o'clock - I asked him if he had got the poor woman's things - he said he sold them for 1s. 3d. at Scholey's - he asked if I would take 1s. 3d. to Dundon - I did, and went with her to Scholey's - I asked if she had bought a bundle of things of Stockman - she said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150083"></xptr>"No" - I said, "You have" - Mrs. Dundon saw a table cloth, and she said "This is my property" - the other things were found there.</p>
               <p>MRS. DUNDON. These are my things - they were hanging on lines on the second floor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the water-closet, and found them.</p>

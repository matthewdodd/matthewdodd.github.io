             walked by my side; I live at Deptford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A No; he did not walk a great way with me; he directed his discourse to me, saying it was a fine night; I answered him, yes, I thought it was; he then told me I was walking very fast; I told him I had need, I had a long way to go; he asked me if he should accompany me home; I told him, no, I was going to my husband and family; with that I perceived a piece of paper kick against my foot; I picked it up, and saw it was a song I had had in my pocket; I then put my hand in my pocket to see if any thing else was taken out; I missed a pocket-book and a little snuff-box; I turned round to look for the man, and he was gone; I ran as far as the corner of Water-lane, and could see nothing of him; I returned back to my mother's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your mother's? - A. She keeps house for Mr. Bilson, in the Strand; the next morning I went to the corner of Bedford-street, in the Strand, to stop eight yards of silk lace I had pledged for 8 s. the duplicates were in my pocket-book; I lost a great many duplicates in my pocket-book; some of gowns and other things; when I went for the silk lace it was taken out; then, on Tuesday, I went to Mr. Burn's, in East-Smithfield, a pawnbroker, and told him of my misfortune, and if any person came to take them out, to be so good as to stop them; I had pawned there a great many things of different descriptions.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was in your pocket-book? - A. A 2 l. note, a 1 l. note, and three 7 s. pieces; I went home to Deptford, and on Wednesday, the prisoner came to Mr. Burn's.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you know is, that you had your pocket-book taken from you in Fleet-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure to the person who took it? - A. Yes; I took particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he walk with you? - A. Not past twenty doors.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it? - A. About half-past ten at night; it was rather dark.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you take notice of him? - A. I thought he was a very decent man, and I had no occasion to be afraid of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his countenance or his clothes? - A. His countenance and his clothes both.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner; is that the man? - A. (Looks at the man.) Yes, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had he the same clothes on then? - A. No; he had a kind of plaided waistcoat on then.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How soon after did you see him? - A. On Wednesday Mr. Burn sent for me, and then I went and saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. On Wednesday were you sure he was the person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any conversation with him then? - A. Yes, at Lambeth-street office; I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any of your property been found since? - A. Yes, on the prisoner; the duplicates and the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You were coming to town that night? - A. No; going to Deptford.</p>
               <p>Q. You are really a married woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no difficulty of speaking to him? - A. I looked at him first.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked at his face, to see if you liked him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him before that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of hat was it he wore? - A. A round hat.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was very dark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the man before, and yet you mean to say the prisoner at the bar is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the prisoner after that time, you saw him in the street; he was then in custody? - A. Yes; the pawnbroker sent a man to Deptford for me to come up.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you directions to come to the Police-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you came up to the Police-office with that impression on your mind that you might see the man that had robbed you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever discovered any of your notes since? - A. No, nor the money.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you pawned eight yards of silk lace for 8 s.? - A. That was in September last.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a good deal of money for you to have about you? - A. It was money we had saved up to pay our rent.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker; I live in East Smithfield: on the 18th of June, at night, the prosecutrix left word to request that I would stop any body that came for her things; I was out; on the 19th, about two o'clock, the prisoner accompanied by another man, came and presented two tickets.</p>
               <p>Q. Who presented two tickets? - A. The prisoner; which were mine; I asked him many questions, to which he gave me such evasive answers that I had no doubt he was the person; he walked out of the shop with the other man; I followed and collared him; he begged me not to collar him; he said he would come back, which he did; I sent for a parish-officer; he had many doubts whether I had any right to keep him; I took him to the Police-office; there was no Magistrate sitting; I caused him to be locked up in the parish watch-house; I sent a man to Deptford for the woman, and she appeared; Griffiths has the duplicates; the other man was a Jew dealer; he had brought him to buy the things; I had a young lad that ran after him, and he gave him a blow.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What do you know of this? - A. On the 20th, this man was brought up to our office, about five o'clock in the evening; our office shuts up at six; he was taken before the Magistrate by the Headborough, and the Magistrate asked if he had been searched; the Headborough said, no; I took him out and searched him, by order of the Magistrate, and out of his pocket I took this pocket-book, with a large quantity of duplicates in it, which were shewed to the prosecutrix; she said it was her's, and the pocket-book likewise; I asked him how he came by it; he said he picked it up. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To prosecutrix.) Look at that pocket-book - is that your pocket-book? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these duplicates your's? - A. If you will have the goodness to look, you will find them all in my own name.</p>
               <p>Griffiths. They are all in her own name.</p>
               <p>Q. (To prosecutrix.) Did you not feel any thing taken out of your pocket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first alarm, when you saw the song at your foot? - A. It was the appearance of paper kicked against my foot; when I took it up, I saw it was a song I had had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not he laid hold of you at all? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. By the arm or by the side? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was walking down Fleet-street, on the 18th of last month, and just by Water-lane I kicked the old pocket-book before my feet; I looked at it, and saw the contents of it; I called at that gentleman's house to see the articles were these duplicates were; as for money, there was none; there was not a penny in it; I tendered two of these tickets, to see what these goods were; I made no resistance; I told him I found them; I was taken into custody, and confined in the watch-house, and at the time when the lady came in she said a tall man accosted her in Fleet-street; she did not know me at first; she said afterwards that I was the man that did rob her; she said she lost three articles out of her pocket, a snuff-box, a screw box, and the book; I think it is not likely any person could take these three things at once; if there had been money in the book, I should have advertised it, and consequently I knew I had come fairly by it; I did not think it wrong; now farther, she never felt her pocket from the time she came from home till she saw the song, and picked it up.</p>
               <p>Court. Duplicates are as valuable as money to the owners of them.</p>
               <p>Q. (To prosecutrix.) Did any person accost you besides? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Jury. Was the duplicate of the silk lace in that pocket-book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

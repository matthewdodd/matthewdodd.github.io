                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery at Woolwich—on Wednesday morning, 5th October, about 1 o'clock, I was in High-street, Woolwich—the prisoner came up to me—I had not known him before—he asked me if I would go to a cook-shop, and have something to eat, and asked me if I had any money about me; I said I was going home, and did not wish—he then felt my jacket pocket; I had on a shell jacket; he then put his hand in my trousers' pocket—I had in my pocket two half-crowns, one shilling, and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper-after he took his hand out, I felt that my money was gone—he ran away, and I ran after him, and shouted out, "Stop thief!"—he was stopped by a police-constable—I had not lost sight of him—I had been drinking—I have no doubt about this being the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Inspector of police at Woolwich—on Wednesday morning, 5th October, somewhere about 12 or 1 o'clock, I was at the corner of Hare-street, Woolwich—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running very rapidly towards me, pursued by the prosecutor—I placed myself in a position to stop him, but just as he got near me he saw me, and made an attempt to run down a side alley—he was running so. fast that he ran against the corner of the alley and I stopped him—the prosecutor immediately came, up and charged him with robbing him—I asked him what he had done, and he said he had taken some money out of his pocket—I then felt in the prisoner's hand, and in his right hand I found a halfpenny—the prisoner did not say anything at that time—we went to the station—on the road he said that the prosecutor wished him to go to a coffee-shop with him, and that he wished him to sell his clothes, and he would not do so—at the station the prisoner was searched, and in his pockets were found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, which he said had been collected for him in a public-house by some persons who knew that he was</p>

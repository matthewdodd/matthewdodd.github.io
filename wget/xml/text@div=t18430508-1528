                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Brooks, I am a tambour-worker, and live in Frederick-place, Goswell-road; the prisoner was my appren<lb></lb>tice, and has been with me six or seven years. On the 28th of March I missed a sovereign from a work-box on a sideboard in the drawing-room—the box was locked—she was aware of my habit of leaving money in this box—I mentioned the loss of this sovereign to the whole of the girls—there were eighteen girls—I afterwards sent for a policeman—when he came I was up stairs with the prisoner—I asked her what possessed her to take it, as I was convinced she had taken it, by the money she had spent—she said she did take it, but did not know why she took it.</p>

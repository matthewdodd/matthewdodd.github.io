I know the prisoner, by seeing him at the Repository in Little Britain; he came to my gate on the 14th of October, said he was out of work, and in great distress - I told him to go over to the public-house, and have a pint of beer, and I would come and pay for it, which I did - in the afternoon he came again; I felt ill, and went to get a glass of gin - I gave him a glass, and went to work; a gentleman came in with a chaise - I took out the horse, and washed it; the chaise stood in the street - he said he would finish the horse while I moved the chaise; a person came to a different part of the stable - he came to me, and said he was going home to bed, and in less than five minutes I missed the bit, bridle, and reins; I told an officer, who brought him to me in the morning.</p>

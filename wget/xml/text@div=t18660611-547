                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe manufacturer, of 48, Craven-street, Finsbury—in 1865 I had an account at the London and County Bank, Islington-branch—I usually kept my cheque-book in my desk, and sometimes in the safe—in May, 1866, I drew a cheque in favour Messrs. Somerville for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that cheque I received back from the bank, and filed it—it is now missing—the prisoner was in my service—he had only been with me a few months—he was with me before Christmas last, and left about 9th January this year—he was a clicker—two men named Wheeler and Wilson were also in my service—about 13th January I had occasion to look at my cheque-book, and I found two cheques missing—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I first saw on 13th January—it is signed in my name, but not by me, and I never authorized anyone to sign it—I have seen the prisoner write, and am acquainted with his writing—I believe this cheque is in his writing—the whole of it—"Somerville &amp; Co." and "sKauffman Greenbaum," is an imitation of my writing, but the date is different—after the 13th</p>

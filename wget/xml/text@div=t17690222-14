I told them I had a wife and family at home, and was not willing. They asked me to drink; I said I did not value a pot of beer; they went out, but instead of bringing beer they brought six-pennyworth of brandy and water, or some such stuff. While we were drinking it they threw me down backwards on the bed twice, and the third time I perceived they had got my watch from my pocket: I desired them to give it me; they said they had not got it: I told them I was determined to have it, for I had lost it in that room, and I would have it before I went out of the room: one of them struck me several blows on my face, and called me all the names she could think of; after that two men came up into the room to their assistance, threatening me, if I did not get out of the room immediately: I declared I would not quit the place till I had recompence. I staid about half an hour, and then the watch came; I called the watch, who took the prisoners into custody.</p>

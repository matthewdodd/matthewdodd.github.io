                  </hi>. I am the wife of Everett Ewen, of Tennison-street, Lambeth—the prisoner came to lodge at our house on 20th March last—he spoke to me in English—I do not understand French—he continued there</p>

               <p>up to the 8th June—when he had been there two or three weeks he borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me, and gave me a small memorandum, which he said was as good as the bank of England—he brought me back that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I returned him the memorandum—he said, "My father is a Frenchman, and allows me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. amonth"—he afterwards applied to me for a further loan of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was about the middle of April—he paid me up to the first of April—he shewed me this paper; a bill—he said he had bills which would become due in June, and on the next day I lent him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—and he shewed it me several times after I had lent him the money—whenever I said anything about money he always said that he had bills coming due in June—this is the bill I saw—I have had it in my hands a dozen times, or more—I mean that he shewed it to me—he had it on the table among several other papers—on 8th June, about 11 in the morning, he came in in a great hurry, saying that he had come to pay his bill, as he was going to Paris—he was always very anxious about paying his bill—he said he wished to have it made up with all I had lent him, and he would pay all together—I called in Mr. Davis, a lodger, who has been in my house these six years, and the prisoner packed up his things—Mr. Davis made out the bill, and I gave it to the prisoner—he gave me this paper—I did not understand it, but, of course, there was nothing else to take—he proposed to pay me with this bill—the amount of my account was 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for money lent, and the rest for lodgings and breakfasts—he said the bill was a genuine one, and he might be back from Paris and take it up before it was due, which was on the 3d—21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the amount, and 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the amount of the bill—he wished very much to have the difference—he said he must have the balance to go to Paris with, as he could not go without money, and if the train was gone and he did not go he should be back that night—I said I could not give him the change, I had no money—he said he must have money to pay his fare to Paris, and asked Mr. Davis to be very particular to see what the balance was to come to him—Mr. Davis would not allow me to pay it—he said he bad had quite enough—the prisoner packed up his things and left the house for a few minutes, came back with a cab and took them away—he called on me again about half-past 10 the same night, for some linen which came home from the laundress, and I did not see him again till he was in custody.

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer, and lived at Mrs. Ewen's house—on 8th June she came to me, and in consequence of her statement I went down stairs, made out the account, presented it to the prisoner, and told him that I understood he was going to pay it—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Mrs. Ewen has asked me to come down and settle the account for her"—he looked at it, and said it was perfectly right and he was perfectly satisfied—he took out his pocket-book, and presented this bill to me—I asked Mrs. Ewen whether the account was to be settled with a bill, and she left it to me—I said, "Who is Mr. Hunter, and where is he to be found?"—the prisoner said that he knew him to be a respectable gentleman, and referred me to the address on the bill—I made some demur about it—I told him I did not like it—I was rather suspicious—he said that he knew it to be perfectly correct, and I need not have any doubts at all about it—it was repeated over and over again that the parties were all respectable; the two firms—he did not know Mr. Foster so well as the other party, but said that he was respectable—he asked for the change, and I told him that I should advise Mrs. Ewen not to give him more money until she had something more satisfactory—I thought he had had money enough—he remained a considerable time, and said, "Well, if you do not give me the change out, I cannot go to Paris"—I said, "That does not matter"—when he found that I would not agree to his having the change, he said, "Then I must have my bill back"—I referred again to Mrs. Ewen, and said that she must keep possession of the bill, and she did so—I left him in the room—after some time he went out—that was 11 o'clock—he returned at 2—I then went to the Change for the purpose of looking after Mr. Hunter, and when I went down stairs, to my surprise I found the prisoner at the door putting his luggage into a cab, of which I took I the number unobserved by him—I then went to Pudding-lane to ask how it was, as it occurred to me that there might be lodgers in the house—I could not find Mr. Hunter—the cab was at the door at a little after 11, and the prisoner went away in it with his things—I saw him again the Sunday week following in custody—I gave information to the police—I had told him on the Sunday what I had done, and also other parties who followed me—I told him that I had been up and down Pudding-lane twice, and could find ✗ such person—he referred to the directory, but could find no such person—he shook his head a good deal, and seemed very much excited—the policeman questioned him and he gave his name.</p>

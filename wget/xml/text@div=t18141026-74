               <p>HENRY BREWMAN. I am a shopman to Mr. Griffin. On the 21st of September, the prisoner came to look at some handkerchiefs; the price was too high; they were seven shillings and sixpence. I then shewed him some at three shillings, which he held up to the light to examine with one hand, and with the other hand he put the four handkerchiefs in question in his pocket. I saw by his actions that he was putting some thing into his pocket; I saw him move his hands. I did not see him take the property. I saw by his actions that he was putting something into his pocket. I got over the counter, and touched his trowsers. I asked him what he had got there: he instantly took the handkerchiefs out, and throwed them on the counter, and said he had nothing. We gave him then into the custody of the people at the watchhouse. These are the handkerchiefs; they are Mr. Griffin's property,</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He did not find any handkerchiefs about me.</p>
               <p>GUILTY, aged 40,</p>

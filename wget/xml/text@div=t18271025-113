               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the laundress could not give him change, and he had returned the sovereign to Mrs. Williamson; and that he was in the habit of paying small sums for his mistress, or keeping back a few shillings for that purpose.</p>
               <p>MRS. WILLIAMSON. He was in the habit of laying out small sums when I was out of town, and kept a shilling or two.</p>

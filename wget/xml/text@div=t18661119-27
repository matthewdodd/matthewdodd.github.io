                  </hi>. I am a seaman—on 7th November I was lodging at the Sailors' Home, Whitechapel, and about ten o'clock in the evening I was in the highway—I had had very little to drink, and was as sober as I am now—the prisoner came behind, put his arm over my shoulder and his hand on my mouth; another person then came up very quickly, and they got me down between them, and one of them took my money from my pockets very quickly and ran away—I ran after them, kept close to them, and kept the prisoner in sight till he was stopped by a policeman, and I charged him—they did not strike me—I lost from 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I had felt safe a quarter of an hour before.</p>

I was on duty in St. George's Street East about 150 yards off, and saw a number of persons running towards me, but they turned up Prince's Street—I ran towards them, turned up Prince's Court, met the prisoner running as hard as he could, and stopped him—all the others were following him, crying out, "Stop thief"—Wigley came up first, and said something, and then Shehan came up and said, in the prisoner's presence, "That is the man that robbed me"—Shehan was very much exhausted—Wigley said that he was one of the two who were running, but he did not see him rob the man—going to the station Wigley said in the prisoner's hearing, "I believe that man (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) has given something to that girl"—that was a girl named Hunt, who was taken in custody—I took them both to the station, but nothing was found on either of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the editor of the "Bayswater Chronicle," and was so in March—I wrote the article of the 6th March, On the Mary<lb></lb>lebone Readings, and on the 7th or 8th March I received a letter from the defendant, stating that the article in question would be commented upon at the next meeting, and asking me to send a reporter—wrote to the defand<lb></lb>ant, telling him that I would be there, and I went there on 9th March—the first thing I had to drink that day was 3 a glass of ale at luncheon, about</p>

               <p>2 o'clock—after that I went with Mr. Hope to the London Docks, where had two glasses of Madeira—we stayed there about half-an-hour, and left about 3.45—the next thing I drank was between 6 and 7 o'clock, I think, when I had, I think, two glasses of sherry—I had nothing else before I went to the room—I got there as near 8 o'clock as possible—Mr. Hope was with me all the time, and accompanied me into the room—when we arrived at the hall I saw a great confusion, in consequence of which I went on to the platform—I did not know the defendant personally at that time—as one was on the platform at that time—I spoke to the meeting, and the de<lb></lb>fendant came and asked me who I was, and what right I had there—I in-formed him that I was there by his invitation, to hear myself commented upon, but as he was not commenting upon me, I proposed exposing the humbug, and showing why the great names and great artists were not pre<lb></lb>sent—Dr. Halshall, who I did not know, took the chair at the defendantant's request, and I also, at his request, took my seat with the rest of the audience, and the readings at once proceeded—after they had proceeded some time, Dr. Halshall made a statement to the meeting as to the reason that the artists were not there; he said that, although he had been reading until he was nearly hoarse, he would read another piece, because the artists, when names had been announced, had been prevented from attending by an acci<lb></lb>dent—I then rose and said, "With all due deference to you, I must contra<lb></lb>dict that statement," because I had previously given the reason to the meet<lb></lb>ing, and I stated that the artists had been there, but finding no preparations, and no piano, they left, and were very much annoyed at being brought great distances for nothing—Dr. Halshall told me to sit down, and someone called the proprietor of the hall, who came in—there was great confusion, and the proprietor said to me "I am a special constable"—I said, "I am very happy to hear it"—he then proceeded to put the gas out, the reading being con<lb></lb>sidered to be over, and I left the room—there was not the slightest pretence for saying that I was intoxicated—it is not true that I conducted myself in an abominable and disgusting manner—no one kicked me out of the room or <hi rend="italic">bonneted</hi> me; nothing of the kind—this pamphlet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was sent to my office about 16th July—it has the prisoner's writing on it.</p>

On Friday, the 10th of March last, about eight o'clock in the morning, I left my shop - I saw this clock safe then, on the counter; I pulled the shop door after me, but think the lock did not catch - if it had it could be opened from without. I left nobody in the shop - I only went a few steps, merely across the avenue, and was talking to a neighbour, when the witness, Woodman, came up, and said something to me; I instantly went back to my shop, and the clock was gone; I have not seen it since - I would have given 20l. for it - it was a large table clock, and very heavy; it was rather antique, had a mahogany pedestal, with a great deal of brass work, and a silver face. The shop is part of my dwelling-house.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Paxton, of Warwick-street. I was in the Albany on the morning of the 10th of March, and saw the prisoner there; I first saw him in St. James's-street, with another young man, and followed them in to the Albany - the other young man went into Mr. Porker's shop; the prisoner stopped, and was looking in at the window; I saw the young man come out of the shop with a clock - he put it down at the entrance of the Albany; (the shop is close to the gate) - the prisoner said to him, "Cannot you carry it?" he (the prisoner) put his apron over it, took it up, and went away with it, down Burlington-gardens, and the other down Sackville-street. I asked Mr. Porker if he knew the man who had got the clock - he was inside the next shop. The other person was a young man - I am sure I saw them both together from St. James's-street to the Albany. I saw the prisoner again three or four days after, looking down some areas; and about two days afterwards I saw him in Charlotte-street, and told Bond, who took him.</p>

I live at Hammersmith—on 26th January, I was in Wellington Road, Hammersmith, and saw an old man pushed out of the Anglesea Tavern, but I could not see by whom—the potboy, I mean, the prisoner, then came out and pushed him down on the road with his fist—it was a hard push—I cannot say where he placed his hand, but the man fell violently—he got up and said to the prisoner "Will you leave me alone," and the prisoner ran after him and knocked him down—I do not know' whether he used his fist—he knocked him down three times alto<lb></lb>gether once in the room and twice by the broker's shop, and he never got up any more—he called out "He has broken my leg"—the prisoner ran away up the Wellington Road—the old man did not run after the prisoner or use any bad language or shout.</p>

               <p>I was close by—Smart might have had a little beer, but he was not tipsy—I did not hear him say "I will cut your young head off," he said nothing whatever to the prisoner—when Smart made his exit from the door he commenced walking slowly across the road; he walked perfectly straight towards his home, and the potman went behind him—Smart did not wait on the door step and use bad language, he had just stepped off the kerb when the potman came out and pushed him—I have not often been in the neighbourhood of public-houses at night—Smart was not drunk, and he was already out of the house—no blow was used, he was merely pushed with the fist—the road is out of repair, but it is level for 20 yards from the house—after the prisoner pushed him Smart said "Will you leave me alone," and he pushed him down again—Smart used no bad language—there are gas lamps in the street—the second push was 20 yards from the Anglesea—there was a light at the Anglesea and at the grocer's shop—I did not run after them, of course I walked on with my friend—I was about 10 yards from him the third time he fell—I had walked quick—it was not quite dark where I got to—it was not a dismal-looking night—I had not got up to the rough ground—it was rough at the corner, but not where the poor man was knocked down—the third time he knocked him down with a push, I was not near enough to see if there were any blows—I still say that Smart was not tipsy, he had had a little beer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 21, Nasmith Street—I was with the last witness near the Anglesea, and saw an old gentleman pushed out; I did not see who by, but the potman came out directly afterwards, when he had walked as far as the kerb, and knocked him down in the road with his fist—he struck him on the side of the head—I saw the blow light on his head, and his hat fell off into the road—the old man got up and said "Will you leave me alone, I am going home"—he walked about 10 yards, and the prisoner went after him and knocked him down again with his fist, but I did not see where he struck him that time; he got up again—he said nothing, but was going away, and when he had gone about two steps the prisoner knocked him down again, and he said "You have broken my leg"—I ran up to him, and he said "My <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> is broken, do fetch some one"—the pri<lb></lb>soner ran away—I saw Mr. Tailbee there; he said "That's right, give it to him," three times, and I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself—he told me to go home and mind our own business—I first saw Mr. Tailbee when the deceased was knocked down the second time; he was standing at the door with his sister and a man—he was not there the first time the man was knocked down.</p>

I have hurt myself"—he said "You have broken my leg," and the prisoner ran away—I cannot account for his leg being broken—I will swear that the prisoner was not 4 or 5 yards from him when he fell—half a tumbler of brandy was brought out for him, but he was not allowed to drink it; it was sent over by a man from the public-house—I did not tell any one of this till I saw deceased's son at the Inquest, but I had given my address, and he asked me what I saw—Tailbee is not a friend of mine—I have seen him two or three times, but I don't make use of these houses.</p>

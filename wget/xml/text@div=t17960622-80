               <p>I am son of the last witness; I am near 14 years of age; the prisoner came into my father's house for a glass of gin, with a woman at the door that sells greens; and he gave me a shilling to change; he observed which till I put the bag in that I took the sixpence out of; he walked up and down the taproom, I had no suspicion of him, and I went into the kitchen; my mother heard a noise, and ran towards the bar and saw the prisoner in the bar shutting the till; he turned short out, and shut the door after him; I asked him what he wanted, he told me to give him change for sixpence and take for a glass of gin; I told him he had paid for it; he did not know what to say, but concealed the bag in his hand behind him; I turned back to go to my mother, and he threw the money bag upon the counter again; my mother asked him what business he had in the bar; he said he had not any business there, and then he was taken into custody.</p>

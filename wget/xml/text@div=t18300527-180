             re-examined. Q. Did you owe him wages? A. No, nor tell him what he has stated - I never gave him leave to pawn my tools; I have known him do it in several instances, and when I was at Edmonton I know he took a bed quilt, but he told me of it, and I said I would say no more about it - I was three weeks in the Fleet-prison, in September last; he did work for me then, but I owe him nothing - I have not employed him since January, but he lodged in my house; I did not see him from the Sunday till the Thursday, when I was standing in New-street, Covent-garden; he passed me - I got a Police-man, and took him afterwards, when I found where he lodged; we had a quarrel some time before, because he locked my premises, and I could not get in.</p>

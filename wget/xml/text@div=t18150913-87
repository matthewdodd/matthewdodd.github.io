I was first acquainted with the prisoner in 1809, he was in the habit of constantly coming for small parcels of goods to the amount of twelve or fourteen shillings for which he always paid ready money. From being a man of gentlemanly appearance and address, he gave me an order to send some goods to his house in Queen square, Aldersgate-street. The money was not brought back, but the receipt I sent was, and the goods left. I did not see the prisoner for a long time, and when I did, it was in a quarrel in our street, which he had with a woman, who exclaimed, Mr. Bowyer, here is

The next time I saw him, was on the 16th of April, 1813. he came into my shop on that day, in company with a gentleman, and said I suppose you don't know me? I said I did; Ah, said he, I have suffered a great deal since I saw you, I have been in a French prison, but being released, I have just landed at Plymouth, and I determined the first step I would take in town, would be to discharge your debt; but how you have altered and improved your shop! Whilst he was making this last observation, he presented me with the bill in question.</p>

            . This is the note, I know it by the prisoner's name being written upon it. I wrote it myself, in his presence, before I gave him the change. It was for ten pounds, and I gave him a check upon my bankers Down Thornton, and Tree for the difference. After the prisoner went out, I began to suspect, and went immediately to stop payment of the check, but the prisoner had just got it cashed, and gone out of the house. I sent the bill to my banker, and did not do any thing, until it became due which was on the 23rd of April. On that day I went to No. 4, Mark-lane, I found there a counting house, but shut up, and nobody there. I did not see the prisoner again until the 27th of July last. I never found the person to whom this bill was directed.</p>

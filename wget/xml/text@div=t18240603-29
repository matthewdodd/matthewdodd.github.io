On Sunday, the 16th of May, a lodger who keeps a shop below, gave us information<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030014"></xptr>that the prisoner had gone out with some iron; I sent a person to watch him; he came back himself without the iron; (he lodged in my house,) and as he was going up stairs, I said I suspected he had stolen some iron, as I had missed some several times; it was kept in the kitchen, where I live.</p>
               <p>JOHN PARKINS. I live in Mr. Harding's house, and am his servant; as soon as I heard of the robbery, I went out, and saw the prisoner turn into an old iron shop in Gilbert-street (it was on a Sunday); he had something with him, and as he turned to go into the shop, I saw the end of the bars; I followed him into the shop, but did not speak to him; I heard him say to the person in the shop</p>
               <p>"Give me 1 s.;" I asked the person if the young man that did her business was at home; she said No; I said it was of no consequence, and I came away and told my master, who sent for a constable; I went with the constable and got this iron; I am quite sure that it is my master's.</p>

            . I live at 44, Gilbert-street; I keep the shop and parlour; my little girl had occasion to go out, and left the door open; the prisoner came in very much in liquor, with something in his hand, and asked me for a shilling; in about half-a-minute the last witness came in; the prisoner then laid down the iron, and seemed so insensible, that I had not patience with him, and went into my room; Parkins must have seen the iron, but he did not claim it as his master's; I had known the prisoner for some time.</p>

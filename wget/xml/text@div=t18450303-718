               <p>About nine o'clock in the morning, on the 20th of Feb., I was in his stable—the prisoner had the care of a loose stall and locker of my mas<lb></lb>ter's—I found in that locker two bladders of lard—it has no lock to it—about ten o'clock that morning I saw the prisoner come from the stable into the mess-room, where there are some cornbins, (one of which the prisoner had charge of, and kept the key of the padloek) with a peck measure with corn in it—it was large enough to contain a bladder of lard, which might be covered with corn—it appeared full—he went three times from the stable to the mess-room, on each occasion with the peck measure apparently full of corn—I do not know whether there was com in his bin in the mess-room—about half an hour after I went to the locker under the manger, and the two bladders of lard were gone—next morning, a tittle after seven o'clock, I was in the mess-room with Gilbert—we had a candle, and looked into the bin of which the prisoner kept the key—we saw a bladder of lard, partly covered over with corn—there was another bin in the mess-room for the carmen, which is divided into three partitions, but the prisoner's bin was by Itself—in the course of that morning I saw the prisoner go from the mess-room to the stable with this measure full of corn apparently—he had but one horse to feed at that time—it was not necessary to take a peck for one horse—in the evening we looked again into the prisoner's bin, and could not perceive the lard—we searched the hayloft over the stable, to Which you have to go by a ladder, and found two bladders of lard in a hand-bag, under some hay, between a truss of hay and a truss of straw; on the fight<lb></lb>hand side in going up—Mr. Binns, Brazier, and Gilbert, were with me—we took the bladders out of the bag, cut an incision in them, attd put a piece of straw into them, put them back into the bag, and left it in the same place—on the Saturday evening, about nine o'clock, we went agaift into the loft—the lard was then gone from where we had seen it, and we found it out of the bag, in a hole on the left-hand side, in the loft, and some hay placed over it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Lillwall—it is a provision warehouse on a very large scale—there is lard kept in the warehouse amongst other things—on the 20th of Feb. I saw the prisoner come from the warehouse about nine o'clock in the morning—he went in a direction towards the stable, but I did not see him go in—next morning, about seven, I went with Blenkard into the mess-room and looked into the corn-bin kept by the prisoner—I saw a bladder of lard partly concealed by the corn—I looked again in the evening, and could not perceive the bladder—we went to the loft and found two bladders of lard in a hand-bag—on the Saturday morning, about seven, I saw the prisoner go into the stable—that would be in the way to go to the loft—he was afterwards sent out—I went into the loft again on Saturday evening, and found the lard, not where I had seen it before, but in the opposite corner, concealed in a kind of shoot and covered with hay—on the Sunday morning I went to the premises about five, and after six I went with the policeman to the loft—I there saw the lard, to all appearance, in the same place where I left it on the Saturday evening.</p>

I sent the prisoner into the Borough on that Saturday, and on the same night I went with the other witnesses to the loft, and found two bladders of lard in the left hand back corner of the loft—they had been marked—I had seen them on the Friday evening in another part of the loft—I looked into the prisoner's bin on the Friday evening, but I could not discover the lard—the bin was nearly three parts full of corn—we could see about half-way over it—I desired a police<lb></lb>man should be sent for—I have the padlocks and the keys of the pri<lb></lb>soner's bin, and the bins of the three carmen—this key of the prisoners will not unlock the other men's padlocks, nor will their keys unlock his.</p>

               <p>into the loft—he went directly up to the place where the lard was—he then came back, and opened a pair of folding-doors to let in more light, looked very cautiously round him, then came and put his hand on some hay within a foot of where I was, but there was a bag over my head, and he could not perceive me—he went back, shut the folding-doors, and re<lb></lb>turned to the place where the lard was, and he must have stooped down, as he was out of my sight—I had seen him upright before—he then went down the trap-door, towards the stable—I followed, and saw him lighting a fire—I went and told Mr. Binns, and then took the prisoner into custody—I examined the place where the lard bad been deposited before I went down—I can swear he had been there twice, and the hay that covered the lard had been disturbed, but the lard was not taken away—it was under<lb></lb>neath the floor of the loft, about three or four feet deep.</p>

               <p>JOHN HUTCHINSON. On the 23d of July, between two and three in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in Northumberland-street, he was close to to Mr. Barnes's house, he was in company with two or three other boys, they hesitated a little while, then the prisoner went down the area steps; the area door was open. In two or three minutes he came up again, and brought some things up in his apron. I then asked him what he had got there, he hesitated, and either said what is that to you, or somebody has given it to me. I told him I should not let him go. He then said it was his first offence, he hoped I would let him go, and that the other two had desired him to go down stairs. I told him, if the person to whom the property belonged to would let him go, I had no objection, but I should not let him go. Mr. Barnes was not at home, he was sent for, and the property was identified,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what the property was - A. I did; I took it from him; it was two sheets and a towel, Mr. Barnes had the property, and the prisoner was taken to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went down the area, a man there gave me this property, he told me to go to the corner of the street, and he would give me something for my trouble.</p>

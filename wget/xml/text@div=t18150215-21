On Saturday evening, the 14th of January, the prisoner came into my house, about eleven o'clock at night, he asked me if I would let him have a bed; I first told him no, he was not a lodger I liked to take in I took in respectable people; I did not altogether like his appearance he said he had just come from the country; out of humanity to him. I thought he should have a bed as he was distressed; he gave me a three shilling piece to take for the bed. The next morning, the girl who has the management of the beds, told me to get up immediately, the man had robbed the bed of a sheet; when I came down, I saw the man surrounded by several persons in the parlour, who had assisted my girl in taking him; the prisoner begged me to let him go, he would never do such a thing any more. I said you do not deserve to be forgiven, you were not distressed. My girl went up stairs, she came down and said he had taken a pair of window-curtains.</p>

The prisoner came there last Saturday night to redeem a pair of shoes, which he had pawned before. I asked what name, he said Hainsbury - I found them, and put them on the counter; he then said he wanted a handkerchief out - I said, "Pay me for the shoes, and you shall have it." I turned round to get it, and he ran off with the shoes. I pursued, and saw him running - he was taken with them in his hands - he was to have paid 3 s. 1 1/2 d. for them.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a girl who asked me to go with her, I said I was going to take some things out of pawn - she said she would wait for me, she stood at the door and said "Are you going to stay there all night." I said "I have got the shoes, and I am waiting for the handkerchief, and have got the money in my hand." She snatched the money from me, and ran off - I ran after her, and called to a man who is not here to stop her, as I ran along the street. I kept the shoes in my hand all the time - here is the ticket of the handkerchief in my pocket. I have lived within thirty yards of this gentleman's house these three years.</p>
               <p>LEWIS FURNEAUX re-examined. Q. Is this ticket your's? A. No; it belongs to another house - there was no woman there, nor did I hear him call after any one.</p>

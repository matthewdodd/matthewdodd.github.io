What, says I, are ye going to rob me? Rob ye? says she, what signifies such a foolish Thing as this? It well never fetch above the Consequence of a Slling. I found I was in a lewd House, and so I did not offer to take it from her; and then I felt in my Pocket, and found my Money was all gone too, and I had 31 s. 6 d. when I went in.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure you had so much? Where did you count it? Ford. I counted it in the Street 2 Hours before, and there was 31 s. 6 d. Court. You say you was drunk, are you sure you dropp'd none of it in the Street? Ford. Yes, I was drunk, that's true; but not so drunk as that comes to neither. Court. Did you go into no Company before you met with the Prisoner? Ford. Yes, I went to drink with 2 Men, upon the Acknowledgment of my coming out of the Country, and then I was more fuddled than before; when we came to pay the Reckoning, I had 33 s. 6d. Court. You said you had but 31 s. 6 d. before you went into the Alehouse. Ford. I said so because I made no Acknowledgement of the Consequence of the 2 s. which I spent afterwards at the Alehouse. Court. And whither did you go next? Ford. I went to another House, and drank the Consequence of 2 or 3 full Pots of Beer, but I spent no Money there, because I was treated. I remember it well enough, for I was sober when I came out of the House. Court. Do you drink yourself sober ? How came you drunk then before you came to the Bandy-house? Ford. Why, I don't know; with talking of one Thing or another, I think: But I was full of Liquor, that I was. Court. When you was so full of Liquor, could you know one Woman from another? Ford. Yes, I acknowledged the Woman next Day. Court. Did you feel her pick your Pocket? Ford. No, I felt nothing about my Pocket, being heavy to Sleep; but when I began to wag my Head, she proceeded to the Feet of the Bed, and having a strong Suspicion that she took my Stock, I charged her with picking my Pocket. Court. You said, you felt her take your Stock. Ford. Yes, she took it by main Force. Court. Then she did not take it privately without your Knowledge, and therefore she cannot be guilty of this Indictment. The Jury <rs id="t17320705-35-verdict170" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, of Holywell-street, Strand. On Tuesday, 2nd May, Coward came to my shop; or, I rather think it was Monday afternoon, about 3 o'clock—he brought a small piece of paper; it was part of a catalogue, with the name of this work on it—he asked me if I would use that work if I could buy it—I said I did not know the work, and I could not tell unless I saw it—a short time afterwards he brought in these four volumes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "I do not know anything about them, but I think I know a gentleman who I can sell them to"—he went away—Mr. Bohn's porter came, and saw the books lying there; he said he thought his master could use them, and took them to show them to him—next morning the prisoner came again, and asked me if I could use the books; and in the evening he came again, and asked me to let him have a trifle, and I gave him a half crown—I should not have lent him that, unless I had had the books—these books are published at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; but with coloured plates, as these are, the price is 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner came again on the Wednesday morning, but I had not then heard from Mr. Bohn—on Wednesday evening, Mr. Moss, another policeman, and Mr. Van Voorst came, and gave me some information—I told them that I expected the pri<lb></lb>soner to call again, and Moss and Mr. Van Voorst waited—Mr. Van Voorst went to fetch the books, and left Moss sitting in the shop—the prisoner came, and the conversation Moss has mentioned took place—the prisoner was not a yard from Moss—Mr. Van Voorst brought the books to my house that evening, and then went with them to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think you said that the first time Coward called was 2nd May? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I thought it was Tuesday, it was in the evening—I am now quite positive that when he called next morning it was Tuesday—he came on Monday, Tuesday, and twice on Wednesday—I had not the least suspicion that the books were improperly come by—there was no con<lb></lb>cealment; he came according to appointment each time—he conversed before the policeman openly about the books—he offered to sell them for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and as he was going out he said 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard Mr. Van Voorst say that he valued them at 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Q.</hi> You say you heard part of the conversation between the prisoner and Mrs. Dodson, was that before you left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was the conversation between Mrs. Dodson and Moss that I heard; I left the premises before the prisoner came, I did not see him there at all—I published 1,000 copies of this work, I have supplied the trade with some in single copies at a time—I have never sold two copies at a time to any bookseller—this is a very common binding, but here is a mark made in it before it was sent to the binder, and which will be sworn to—I can swear to it by this; it is a copy which had been sold with the plates plain, and they have been coloured by the possessor.</p>

Carpenter—I saw them safe on Friday morning, 28th April: I missed volumes 3 and 4 about half past 9 o'clock that morning; volumes 1 and 2 were there then, but I missed them about 20 minutes afterwards—about half past 9 or 25 minutes to 10 o'clock, the prisoner Clamp came and asked me for a book, called "Domestic Scenes in Greenland and Iceland;" he was very near the books—I had missed volumes 3 and 4 then, but two men who I cannot recognise had been in before that, and were near the books—directly Clamp left I missed volumes 1 and 2; about eight days afterwards I saw him in custody and recognised him—I had not known him before.</p>

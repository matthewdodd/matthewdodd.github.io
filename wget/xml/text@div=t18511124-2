                  </hi>. I am solicitor to Mr. Thomas Holt. On 31st. last year, the prisoner applied to me for an advance of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he proposed the security of the household furniture, plate, &amp;c, of the gentleman upon whose behalf he professed to apply, which he afterwards declared to be himself—he had his carriage at the door, and at his solicitation I went with him to his house, called Holly-house, in the New Kent-road—I went over the prin<lb></lb>cipal rooms of the house, the drawing-room, dining-room, chief bedrooms, and so forth—I then told him. that my opinion unhesitatingly was that the property had cost him more money, but I could not advise any client to lend 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it without the valuation of an auctioneer an to what it was likely to realise—he had spoken of having a large amount of plate, and I said, "If you will let me see the plate, I shall be able to judge without any difficulty"—he said the plate was locked up previous to his wife going out of town, and she was then at Herne Bay—I saw the furniture, linen, china, glass, and other things, except the wine—I said to him, in rather a familiar manner, "Why, my dear fellow, you have got into a very splendid position here; it this at all settled on your wife?"—he said No; that be had been doing a very successful business, amounting to 3,000. a year, for several years past in the law agency, and that he had got far above the world; but he explained to me that the alterations then in progress in the law had rather interfered with the coming off of some negotiations which he had on hand—he distinctly Stated that it was his own property—I asked him; and he stated that after applying the money an he proposed, which he was seeking to raise through me, he should not owe 20/. in the world; when I asked him if there was any settlement upon his wife and family, and when he declared there was nothing of that kind, I afterwards told him that I must treat his application strictly as a matter of business, and I must request him to make the usual statutory declaration that the property was free from any incumbrance whatever, and he said, "Oh, my dear Sir! I will make it with the greatest pleasure, without any hesitation whatever; when I apply the money an I propose, I shall not owe 20/. in the world"—it was in consequence of the representation that he was possessed of this property, and that it was not subject to any charge or incumbrance, that I got the money for him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But he had not, at that time, told you that there was no en<lb></lb>cumbrance upon it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he bad not in direct terms told me that, but on my proposing the declaration he distinctly stated that there was not any encumbrance of any sort or character—the words he used were, "Oh my dear Sir! there is not any encumbrance, no man has a claim of a shilling upon it; and when I have applied the money I am seeking to raise through you as I propose, I shall not owe 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the world"—in consequence of that I advanced him 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in one 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—note and one for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was the money of Mr. Holt.</p>

               <p>position here;" I did not say that the property was worth more than the sum he asked me to advance upon it—I said it had no doubt cost him more—the property appeared to be in very good condition; but I spoke of his splendid position with reference to my knowledge of his previous state of things—I went there to satisfy myself as to the value of the property, and I refused to lend him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I dare say it might have cost him more, but I did not think it would realise 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not employ an appraiser, but I suggested so doing, and he in consequence abated the amount of his demand from 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at our first interview, in answer to my observation with regard to the furniture, he was to have made arrangements to let me see the plate—it is not for me to say why he did not carry out that arrangement, but he called on me next day, and said he should only want 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not wish the property to be seen by an appraiser, bnt he said, "My dear fellow, when I show you my plate you will be perfectly satisfied"—that was when I told him I could not advise any client of mine to advance 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the furniture with<lb></lb>out the appraisement of an auctioneer—he did not tell me that he did not wish to have an auctioneer—he deemed it unnecessary—he said so—in answer to my suggestion, that I would not advise any client to advance 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with<lb></lb>out the valuation of an appraiser, he said, "Oh! my dear Sir, there is no occasion for that when I show you my plate"—he did not on that day, or the next, express any desire that an appraiser should be sent.</p>

                  </hi>. Mr. Stafford was acting as my solicitor in the early part of Nov. last year—I saw the prisoner at his own residence, in the presence of Mr. Stafford, on 5th Nov.—Mr. Stafford said that the inventory of the furniture, plate, &amp;c, had not arrived at his office when he came away, and in consequence of that nothing could be done respecting paying the money,. but he would read over the declaration to me in his presence, which he did—I then told Mr. Stafford, to save me the trouble of coming again I would pay the money to him, which I did in the prisoner's presence—I gave 320/. to Mr. Stafford—I have never received a farthing of that money back again—(looking at the declaration) I do not remember this paper; it appears to be the same that was read over to me—if I were to hear it read I should know whether the contents are the same (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—it is quite the same—it was read over before I handed over the money.</p>

               <p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 127). On 24th July I was with Hunt, concealed in a field opposite the Bee-hive, near Eltham. At six o'clock in the morning I saw Wood driving a cart and two horses, of Mr. Walker's—he stopped right opposite the Bee-hive, where Twitchen was on the look-out—as soon as he stopped, Walker gave Twitchen a sack, which he put into the stable—he then came out to the cart again, and Wood gave him another bag, which he took to the stables—I and Hunt then jumped up, and I seized Wood—I went into the stable, and found a sack marked, "W. Walker, Eltham"—I asked Wood why he left it there—he said he left it for his horses—upon that I went to the cart, and found the nose-bags full, and another bag containing three bushels of mixed chaff, beans, and bran.</p>

I was with Twyman and took Twitchen—I asked him why the bran had been taken there—he did not answer till Wood was brought, and then he said it was left for the horses after they had been for a load of gravel—I saw the nose-bags, they were full, and there was some in the cart besides.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of William Walker, a farmer, of Eltham. Wood was his carter—we have a stable, about 500 yards from the Bee-hive—it was Wood's duty that morning to drive two horses from that stable—he had no business at the Bee-hive; we do not keep corn there for our horses—the nose-bags are filled when the horses go out—I do not know whether they were filled that morning, I was not there—these sacks are my master's, and to the best of my knowledge what was in them also—it was worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is not Mr. Walker the contractor for mending the roads in that district? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the men are allowed to take out a certain quantity besides what is in the nose-bags for the horses—if the day was wet Wood was to have gone to Shooter's-hill, for a load of gravel—that is about two miles from our stables; the road is rather hilly.</p>

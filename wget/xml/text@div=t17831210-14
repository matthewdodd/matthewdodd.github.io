               <p>Really sober? - Yes; I agreed to lay with one of them for one shilling, and I gave it her; that was the prisoner Sherlock.</p>

               <p>What did they do with your shoes? - They let me put them on again when they saw there was no money in then; they searched all my pockets, and took my breeches down the thigh to see if there was any money in the breeches; then they me go.</p>
               <p>How long might you be kept in the house? - About a quarter of an hour from first to last. There were only these two up stairs; M'Cabe had gone down stairs, and then Sherlock called her up again.</p>
               <p>Had you any candle in the room? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Sherlock. The next morning when he took us up to the justice, he said if I could raise five shillings and sixpence he would make it up; I sent this handkerchief and an apron to pawn, and a gown that I had, and I made up five shillings and sixpence.</p>

               <p>To Prosecutor. Is that your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you had it? - Not above five or six hours, I only bought it that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it is your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who did you buy it of? - I changed it with a young man a companion of mine.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; as I was attending the prisoners in the justices yard, I saw Mr. Lucas take a watch from the prisoner Sherlock.</p>
               <p>PRISONER M'CABE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As I was going down Cross-lane I heard a great noise, and I went in, and the prosecutor was standing, and he said he was robbed; I went to a public-house, and the constable came and took me.</p>
               <p>PRISONER SHERLOCK's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I met the prosecutor, he asked me if I would have any thing to drink, and we went together into Cross-lane; I told him I had no apartment, but I would take him to a place I knew, and I took him to one Mrs. Martin's; he said he had no money; he said, if I would let him sleep all night he would let me have his watch for a crown; I said then I will call up the woman of the house. We had not been in bed quite an hour before he demanded the watch, and I would not let him have it without the five shillings; the watchman took us both to the watch-house, and the next morning he said if I would give him five shillings and sixpence and his watch he would make it up; I sent my handkerchief and gown to pawn, and when the five shillings and sixpence came and his watch, that watchman and another went out to him and told him not to make it up at all. We have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Wells. You took them up that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it that you took them up? - Eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was the prosecutor sober? - Yes, to all appearance.</p>
               <p>What did he tell you then? - He told me he had lost a watch and five shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, this is a very serious story, because the prisoners stand charged with a capital offence;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100043"></xptr> and if you are satisfied with the evidence, there seems to be nothing in the case that authorizes me to wish you to reduce the offence from what the law describes it to be; for a robbery, you well know, is a taking by force and violence the property of another, from his person: it is not often indeed that we meet with robberies of this kind committed under circumstances of violence on the person; but when we do meet with cases of this sort, they certainly deserve punishment; though women of this bad character must of necessity be in such a country as this, yet they ought to confine themselves to their trade, bad as it is; and in this case undoubtedly they have committed a plain robbery on this man, and if you are satisfied as to the evidence you are bound to find them guilty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—I keep the Elephant, in Fenchurch-street. In the beginning of Oct., the prisoner came to me, and represented that he was employed at Mr. Hart's, a wine<lb></lb>merchant—I had never Seen him there myself—he said he had been shut out at home, and begged to have a bed at my house, which he had—the next day he expressed himself satisfied, and he continued there for a fortnight—after he had left, I sent Mr. Cook to try to get the money for the prisoner's board and lodging at my house, and the prisoner wae taken into custody—I know this snuff-box—(<hi rend="italic">looking at It</hi>)—I have had it some years—the prisoner might have had access to it when he was at ray house—I did not give him authority to take it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, and live in Dalby<lb></lb>terrace, Islington, I went, at Mrs. Eaton's request, to the prisoner to get the money, on the 15th or 16th of Nov.—I found him at an Alton ale<lb></lb>shop—while I was there I saw him take this box out of his pocket—it was standing on the table, and he had his hand upon it—I went up to him, and asked him to allow me to take a pinch of snuff—he tried to put it into his pocket—I took hold of it, and said, "This is Mrs. Eaton's box "—he said, "Oh no, it is not"—I sent to Mrs. Eaton, and the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I deny that it was Mrs. Eaton's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I am a merchant—I buy goods and sell them—my place of business is at Mr. Ainger's, in Mark-lane—I do not pay any rent for it—I have a counting-house there—Mr. Ainger is a friend of mine, and I have the use of one of his offices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I never denied having the box; it has frequently been put in my possession; I have frequently taken it out and brought it back. On the 28th of Oct., I was about to go in the country, and I went the next morning. I did not return till a day or two before I was taken. I could not pay Mrs. Eaton the small sum I owed her, or I should have gone and paid her, and she would have had her box and money; but before that Mr. Scott came in and said, "This is Mrs. Eaton's box;"I said, "What is that to you;"he gave me into custody, and I was dragged to the station-house. I was never asked for any money; the question was never put to me; if it had I should have said I waited for a remittance. I never kept the box concealed; it was out before other persons; I would not let my friends know, or I would have subpœnaed Mrs. Eaton's mo<lb></lb>ther, to prove that she has brought me the box repeatedly; my intention never was to keep it.</p>

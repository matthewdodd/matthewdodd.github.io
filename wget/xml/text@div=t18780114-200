                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Hollidge, a railway porter—about 8 o'clock on Saturday, 22nd December, I went to Sully's house and knocked at the door—I got no answer; as I was leaving I turned back again and saw two men on the top of the side wall—I says "What are you doing there?" they said "It's all right, missus, the place is on fire at the back"—they slid from the wall and one of them fell at my feet—we ran after them and cried out "Stop thief" down Church Row.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 50, Fuller Street, near the prosecutor—on this evening, about 7 o'clock, I see the prisoner pass me three or four times with another man—I was with Mrs. Hollidge—we went round afterwards and knocked at the prosecutor's door, and I saw the prisoner and another man on the top of the wall—the other <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> says to him "What are you doing up there?" the prisoner said "All right, <hi rend="italic">missus</hi>, the place is on fire at the back," and then they jumped and we ran after them and raised an alarm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I cannot say how high the wall is—I never saw the prisoner before—I saw him afterwards at the station and identified him. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM SMITH</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 52 <hi rend="italic">H</hi>). I was on duty on the evening in question in the neighbourhood of Sully's house—I saw the prisoner and another man run across Bethnal Green Road from the direction of Sully's house—I followed them about 300 yards and never lost sight of the prisoner—I apprehended him—we were both out of breath, we had had a desperate run—I asked him what he was running for—he said "I don't know, do you?"—I told him I should take him back to see what he was running for—I saw him fumbling about in his pockets and said "What have you there? I must have it"—he said "You shan't"—I laid hold of him by the neck and thrust him up against the wall and a man came and assisted me—when I got my hand to his right-hand pocket he said "You will find what you want in that pocket," and I found these skeleton keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took him to the station, and charged him with having these keys, and on the road Mrs. Sully said "That is the man, policeman"—I went to Sully's house and put these keys in the door, and on unlocking the front parlour door I found a terrier dog lying dead from a wound in his head—the drawers were all open—I found this sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the floor, which I was told was removed from the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. One of the keys fitted the street door, which I found shut, and opened it—I had not seen either of the two last witnesses when I began to pursue the prisoner—Church Row is about 120 yards from the house—the other man was not present when I put my hand on the prisoner—I ran them into a court where there was no thoroughfare, and if I had had another man with me I could have taken them both—the prisoner was the last that ran—these keys are double, you might call them six or three—if I ever said five it was a mistake.</p>

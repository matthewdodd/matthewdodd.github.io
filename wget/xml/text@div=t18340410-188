He does not live in the house - I live in it, as his servant - he pays the rent and taxes - on the 9th of March, I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock, and left the shop and everything safe - I was alarmed by a crash in the night - I got up, and went down stairs - I found two shutters wrenched from their place - the bar was knocked off, and two panes of glass were broken - I missed a time-piece - it was dark in the shop - it was about half-past eleven o'clock at night - the shutters had been secured by me the night before(Saturday) - I saw Mary Turner about fifteen yards from the shop, when I got up - a person was afterwards sent for the watchman - I did not see either of the three prisoners - I saw one who was taken, but is now at large - I know the prisoners - I went out that night after the robbery, in my shirt, to see if I could find any of the depredators - I watched about fifty yards from the premises, and when I returned back, there was Michael George, the prisoner, and a person named Streak, by the shop - George asked who were the people who had been doing the mischief? - I told him we had sent the officer for one Muggleton - he said, "You should not have sent for him, for he is an innocent man, you should take Lake and Champkin" - I saw some hands taking things out of the window, when I first came down, and saw a table-clock in somebody's hands - I caught hold of it, and made an alarm - they immediately withdrew, and I recovered it - I could not see who it was had hold of it - it was a man - I saw the other two prisoners next morning, about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What time did you find out the robbery? A.

            . I am married - on the night Newsom's shop was robbed, I was about 200 yards from the shop, when I heard the fall of the shutters, and soon after that I observed Samuel Lake coming in a direction from Edmonton - he passed me in a direction from Newsom's shop - he was running - I followed him to the next door to mine - I asked him what was the reason he stopped out at those hours, to be locked out? - he said his father had fastened the door up, and the shutters too, that he should not come in - I saw nothing more of him - I saw him about two hundred yards from Newsom's shop, at first - there are a great many houses between Newsom's shop and where he was running - I cannot say whether he was alone, or in company - there was another man running, but I could not say who it was - he was running with Lake in the same direction - they ran to the next door to me, No. 11, Union-row - I followed them, but they separated before they got to the bottom of the row - they ran together a very few minutes - I lost sight of the other man in a few minutes, at

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were in Union-row; does that go in the same line as the High-street in Edmonton, or turn off from it? A. It turns off from it - every body coming along Edmonton would be coming from the prosecutor's shop - Lake was over at the door when I overtook him - his father lived next door to me - I heard him at the door, and they refused to let him in.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the night in question, I apprehended Lake and a man named Muggleton - I took Lake about half-past two o'clock in the morning, and Muggleton about a quarter before twelve o'clock - I took Muggleton to Mr. Fletcher's shop - Michael George was there - and after Fletcher ordered me to take Muggleton up, George asked me what I was going to do with Muggleton - I said to lock him up - he said, "You need not take him, he is an innocent man," and he would be answerable for him, if I would take Lake and Chamkin; they were the two - I afterwards took Lake and Champkin - I searched Champkin, and found a handkerchief and a glove on him - I laid them on the table at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did you take Lake? A. In

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did not George ask what was the matter when he first came up? A. I was not there when he first came up - the robbery was on Sunday night - George was ordered to come before the magistrate, and was taken into custody on the Friday afterwards- he had attended before a magistrate - I went with the summons, and fetched him from Southgate - he was before a magistrate three times, and was at large after the first and second examination; and at the third he was detained - that was on Friday - I went to him on the Monday, and found him at work at Southgate - I told him he must come before a magistrate to give evidence against Champkin and Lake - he said he could not say any thing against them - I told him he had said last night that he would - he said he could not prove what he had said - that he was in liquor, and did not rightly know what he did say - he said he had seen the persons who committed the robbery at the Roebuck public-house, and that was the reason he said it was them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far is the Roebuck from Newsom's? A. A quarter of a mile - I did not notice whether he was too tipsy to know what he was saying - I am sure he said what I have stated: and in consequence of that I took the other two men by order of Fletcher - George was examined first as a witness - I took Champkin at a quarter past six o'clock, about 100 yards from his own house.</p>
               <p>MRS. TURNER. I did not see George that night.</p>

            . I live at Tottenham. I have known George six months - on Sunday night, the night of Mr. Newsom's robbery, he was with me from eleven to five minutes past twelve o'clock, down at the Bell - we just went into the Roebuck that night - there was George and Champkin, and Lake there - about twenty minutes before eleven o'clock, they were coming out - there were four of them - the Roebuck is about 100 yards from Newsom's shop - I and George and Henry Davis went down to the Bell - we left Champkin and Lake about the Roebuck - we left the Bell about a quarter or ten minutes before twelve o'clock - George had not any means that I know of, of knowing that Champkin and Lake had committed any robbery that night.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FLETCHER re-examined. This happened on Sunday night - the Bell is about 300 yards from the house.</p>

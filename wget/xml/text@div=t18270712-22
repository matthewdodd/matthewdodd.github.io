On the 16th of June, 1826, I left my house about twelve o'clock at night, to go to Covent-garden market - the doors and windows were all fastened; I let myself out by a key, locked the door after me, and put the key into my pocket. About five o'clock in the morning a woman, who was in my employ, came to me, and informed me the house was broken open - I returned, and got home between ten and eleven. I found the street door, which I had fastened, broken open; it appeared to have been opened from within, the first floor window was broken, large enough to admit a person through. I do not know how they got to that window; there were two or three marks outside the door, as if a crow-bar had been applied to it. I missed a brown box-coat, two black coats, a blue and a brown one, a striped, a black silk, and a white waistcoat, two pairs of trousers, one dark mixed and the other a black, six or seven bottles of brandy, two or three bottles of home made wine, a black hat, two gold seals, a gold ring, key, three brooches, and four silver spoons - some of them were in drawers and some in a chest. I lost about 6l. in money; every thing was safe when I left home. I wore part of the clothes two days before - the value of the articles stated in the indictment is about 15l. I gave information at Bow-street that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has any of it been found? A. Part has been found at some pawnbrokers - the street door was broken open; the girl who fetched me is not here - the market is five miles from Fulham.</p>

            . I live in Fulham-fields, near Mr. Adam's; my husband's name is George. In June, 1826, about two o'clock one morning, I was near Mr. Adam's house - it was very moonlight, and there was light enough to see a person's face without the moon; I was going to Mr. Adam's, to see if his cart was gone to market; I am in the habit of going there at that time in the morning; I found the door ajar, and heard several people talking inside the house; I listened, and heard James Evans swearing dreadfully in the parlour. I heard the parlour door open, and then made my escape to the water-butt; I saw

I said to Evans, "Jem, tell me what it is o'clock;" he made no answer till he had passed me - he then used an improper word, and said, "Run, for she knows us;" I followed them at a distance, and hallooed after them; I saw them pull two bottles out of their pockets, and throw into Mr. Poynter's garden; one was found whole, and the other broken;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120015"></xptr>Beal pulled out one bottle, and James Evans the other; I was examined twice at Bow-street, as Griffiths was not in custody at first.

            . I live at No. 12, Perkins-rents, Westminster. One Saturday morning in June, 1826; I do not know the day of the month; at half-past five o'clock I saw James Evans, the prisoner Griffiths, and Henry Woodger; they came to my house - I was in bed; my door was not fastened; they opened it, came in, and awoke me - they asked if I would have any thing to drink - I said I did not mind; they said I should have some brandy - they took a small glass off the mantel-piece, then took a bottle out of one of their coat pockets, and poured a glass full, but it was wine instead of brandy; they remained there about a quarter of an hour, and asked if I could get up and take breakfast with them - I got up, and went with them to No. 9, Perkins-rents; I lived at that time at No. 56, Old Pye-street - we breakfasted at No. 9, Perkins-rents; they asked me to take a walk with them: we went over the water; Evans asked if I would pledge a waistcoat for them - Griffiths was with us, but not close enough to hear what he said; I pawned it in the Borough, for 3s., I do not know the pawnbroker's name; Woodger asked me to pawn a coat - I pawned that at Sowerby's, in Cable-street, for 1l., I think; Griffiths did not hear him ask me to pawn it, he was behind a long way; it was a dark brown coat - he had it on over his own; the waistcoat was a striped kerseymere, with brass buttons. The prisoners went on while I went into the shops; I parted with them about five o'clock in the afternoon; we were together all that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have mentioned all the persons who were with you? A. Yes; Beal was there, but I received nothing from him; Woodger gave me nothing to pawn. This was above a year ago. I was examined before the Magistrate at Westminster; I was taken into custody. I am an unfortunate girl. I recollect it was in June, and near the end of the month I believe, but will not swear whether it was the beginning or end; they were in the habit of coming down the place where I lived; they never called at my lodging before; I was alone. The officer took me up a fortnight afterwards, and then I told this, as I could not swear falsely - I did not accuse them to save myself; I will not swear I had no fear for myself. I did not mention it till I was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. You accused them to save yourself? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Chip there? A. Not in my room; I saw him with the others that morning. I was not afraid of being prosecuted; I was afraid of being ill-used, as some people of Hammersmith said they would murder me if I said a word about it. I appeared against them because I was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. You said just now it was to save yourself that you accused them? A. Yes, to save myself from being ill-used. The men from Hammersmith said if I said a word against them they would dash my brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you save yourself by accusing them? A. I have been threatened to be ill-used so often; I was obliged to accuse them when I was taken for it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you were taken for this robbery, did you not accuse them to get yourself out of a scrape? A. Certainly I did - if I said otherwise I should say false.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to accuse them? A. I was brought to appear against them; every thing I have said is true.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to ELIZABETH GOLDING. Q. Did not you tell Elizabeth Salter that you hid yourself in a hedge and point out the spot to her? A. I said I was at the corner of a hedge, by my own house, when they came by.</p>

               <p>Q. Why not tell her of the water-butt? A. I did not wish every body to know my secrets; it was of little consequence to tell her, as she is of no character whatever.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 19th of June last I saw Beal with two more persons, in the Strand; I followed him up to Covent-garden-market, as I had received information of this robbery; I suspected them - I went up and said I suspected something was wrong, and should take him into custody; I said, "Don't you know Mr. Adam, of Fulham?" he said Yes; I put him into the watch-house, and searched him, but found nothing relating to the robbery; the next morning, as I was going from the watch-house to the office, I told him there were persons up against him - he said, were the girls against him, meaning, I suppose, the two women; I said, Yes, and a person named Golding as well; I said it was a long time since the robbery occurred, and perhaps Golding would not know him - he said Yes, she would be sure to know him; I did not either threaten or promise him anything; I said I wondered he had escaped so long - he said he had been to Brighton; I said he had better have continued there - he said he should have done so, but he could get no employ - he then said he knew nothing of the robbery. The pawnbrokers are not here, as the things were redeemed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you in the habit of examining prisoners? A. No; this was promiscuously, in the course of conversation.</p>
               <p>MR. ADAMS re-examined. The robbery was between the 16th and 17th of June. I have a coat on which I redeemed; here is a striped waistcoat with brass buttons, a pair of trousers, and a box coat - they were all taken from my house at the time in question - I can swear to them all - the waistcoat was new, and worth 10s., the trousers, 15s., the box-coat, 30s., and the one I have on is worth 30s., it had only been worn three times when I lost it - I got the box-coat from Matthews, a pawnbroker, in the Minories: the close coat from Annis, at Sparrow-corner - the trousers from Watts, of Smithfield, and the waistcoat from somebody in the Borough. I swear positively to them all.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE HAYES. I pawned this waistcoat in the Borough - I had it from Evans; I do not know the coat which Mr. Adam has on.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH PARKER. I can swear to this box-coat - I pawned it in the Minories; Tom Evans gave it to me, and the coat Mr. Adams has on I pawned in Sparrow-corner; Evans also gave me that. The prisoners were in our company, drinking afterwards; and they had been together before Evans gave me the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were they from him when he gave you the coat? A. About one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE HAYES. When Evans gave me the waistcoat the prisoners were about fifty yards off; they had been drinking together before.</p>

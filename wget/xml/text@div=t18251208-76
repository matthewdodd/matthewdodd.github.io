            . I am an officer. I met the prisoner about half-past nine o'clock on the morning of the 18th of November, in Oxford-street, carrying a basket slung with a cord, across his shoulder, and an apron was over it; I asked what he had got - he said some lead, which he had brought from a house in Upper Brook-street, which was his own perquisite, and his master, Mr. Hurley, allowed it to him. I went to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not tell you he got it from a house he was repairing? A. Yes, and said it was a piece of lead his master allowed him.</p>

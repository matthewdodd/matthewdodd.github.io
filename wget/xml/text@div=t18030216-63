               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before? - A. Never that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes; I gave him a duplicate of them; I have had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160057"></xptr>them ever since: On the 2d of February he brought another set; I thought it suspicious, and stopped him, and had him before the Lord Mayor; the officer, Clarke, found out who they belonged to.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Thornton.) Are you sure that is the piece he pawned the first time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Kerr. There is no mark on it; I have no doubt of its being mine; I cannot swear to it; we have the pattern of it at home; we bought a great quantity; I have seen the same pattern in other shops; we missed one furniture exactly of this description after we had been before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I took them with no intention of defrauding my employers; I owed some money, and was afraid of being arrested; I meant to take them out and replace them; I did it more through foolishness than a roguish intent; I had some money due to me; I thought I should get that money, and take them out.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Kerr.) What is the value of that? - A. Forty shillings; it is the other that has the private mark. GUILTY, aged 32,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Union-place, Commer<lb></lb>cial-road. I had a distress in my house for rent—the person that came as broker brought his son there one night, and in the morning he brought the prisoner, and took his son away-in the evening we were at tea together—I went out to fetch some butter, and left the prisoner in the room-in the course of the afternoon I was in my shop, and found a shoulder of mutton in a place where we keep saw-dust—I hung it up, and while I went</p>

                  </hi>. I was standing talking to a person—the prisoner came out of the prosecutor's shop, took the mutton from under a block, and put it under his coat, with the hook—the policeman brought him back, and took it from under his coat.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 70.) I found the shoulder of mutton on the prisoner, partly concealed under his coat, hooked with this hook inside his coat—he told me he had purchased it, and afterwards said he had it given to him—the prosecutor said it was his.</p>

I went in about ten o'clock—the prosecutor was so tipsy he did not speak till nearly one o'clock—I endeavoured to rouse him, and the first that was said was about this mutton—I told him I had not had meat for some time, and I should like to have it for dinner on Sunday—he said I should have it; and when the broker's son came in the evening, I was going home, and took the mutton—these boys followed me to near the turnpike, and there gave charge of me—the prosecutor denied having given me the meat, but he was in such a state of stupor, that he could not tell what he did, and he was so before the magistrate—he was forced to have a prompter to tell him what to say.</p>

            . I work at Mr. Genelley's, imagemaker, Cock-lane. The prisoner came to me on Monday morning, the 2nd of November, and asked if my young master was at home; I said Yes, he was up stairs- he came back to me in a short time, and said my young master had given him leave to put a sheep in there; he did not see my master to my knowledge - a drove of sheep was in the lane; when he came the second time I saw them - he took one of the sheep out of the drove, and put it into the shop; I saw him do it, and said, "Mrs. Genelley is coming down stairs - she will make a noise about its coming through the shop;" he instantly threw it out again into the drove - I went round and opened our large gate where the cart comes in, he drove it in before him, and shut the gate after him - it was a very large sheep; I noticed a red mark down the face, but not round the nose - he left it there, and came with another man at dusk in the evening, and fetched it away; I went up and told mistress, that he had come for it - she said she dare say it was all right, and he took it away; I believe the mark was ochre.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SIMMONS. I am the last witness' brother, and live at Geuelley's. I did not see the sheep brought; I had occasion to go into the mill-house, and saw it there in the afternoon - it was a large sheep, marked from the head down the nose, with red ochre, and then round the nose; I was in the mill-house with it for about an hour.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday, the 2nd of November, I was left with another person in care of the sheep; about a quarter to twelve o'clock, four or five sheep came running into the lane with a dog, which turned them all back except one, which got among our drove, and just after that I asked Mr. Genelley if I could put it into his yard - he said Yes; I went, and asked Simmons if I could put it in, and said his master had given me leave - he said Yes, and as I was getting it through the shop, he said Mrs. Genelley would be cross about it; I drove it out again, and drove it in at the gate, and said I would endeavour to find the owner - I went about the market, and told four or five people in the market I had a sheep which did not belong to me, and if they heard of one being lost to send the person to me; about four o'clock, a countryman, who is a drover. came to me, and described the marks - I went and showed him the sheep - he took it away; on the Tuesday, the prosecutor came to me at the Three Tuns, Smithfield, and said, "Where have you sold my sheep?" I said I did not know what he meant - I did not know he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030004"></xptr>lost one; he repeated that I had sold his sheep - I told him I had left one at Genelley's, but he went away, and said"I shall give you in charge;" I went to find out the person who had it, but could not - I returned to the house, and he was not there; I do not live a quarter of a mile from the market, and was at home all the week: on Saturday I was taken at the same house; there was no mark on the nose - it was only down the face - I should think there are thousands of sheep marked in the same way; it is a very common practice among drovers to catch sheep when lost, and take care of them till somebody comes and describes their marks: when Mr. Procter came, he requested me to count the sheep out - I did so, and told him how many there were; he said they were all right; I met

             in the market just as it was over, and he asked if I was going to take the sheep away - I said when the market was over I should go for it, but I had not found the owner; when the Simmons were asked about it they described the sheep in different ways.</p>
               <p>JURY to HENRY SIMMONS. Q. Do you recollect whether the same sheep as he brought into the shop was put into the yard? A. I cannot say; he took it out of the drove - it stood on its legs, and ran about the mill-place, not like a worried sheep.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a merchant, at Kennett Wharf, Upper Thames Street; the prisoner has been my clerk several years. On 1st Jan., I took a partner into my business, Mr. Mesnard—up to 1st Jan., it was the prisoner's duty to keep the cash and pass book; he did not after 1st Jan.; he occasionally filled up a cheque, but Mr. Mesnard took the cash and pass books—the prisoner always went to the banker's for the cheque and pass book—I sign the cheques invariably—this has been the cheque book during the present year—I did not issue a cheque on 19th Jan., for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but Mr. Mesnard did one—I remember Monday, 27th Jan.; the prisoner was in the office that day—I did not see him come in when the pass book came in; I saw him in the office in the early part of the day—I saw him with the pass book; I think he handed the pass book to Mr. Mesnard—I saw him leave the office, and after he left the office, Mr. Mesnard called my attention to the pass book, and I looked at it—after looking at the pass book, I looked at my cheque book—I observed a cheque was missing, about 19th Jan.—supposing a cheque had been spoiled, I had told the prisoner it was to be cancelled by crossing the margin in the cheque book—here is no such word in the cheque book on that day, or about that day.</p>

               <p>Mr. Mockford—the prisoner sometimes took them to him to sign, and some<lb></lb>times myself—there were some cheques drawn in blank, since 1st Jan.; I am able to state that I filled those cheques up—there were crossed cheques drawn, and blank cheques—I did not fill up the crossed cheques; I filled up those which were not crossed—I remember, on 27th Jan., I sent the prisoner to the bank for the pass book—I was not there when he returned; I came in afterwards, and found him there—I did not see the pass book at first; I asked him for it, and he pointed to it on the table—this is the pass book—after I had asked him for the book, and he pointed to it on the table, I was talking to Mr. Mockford, and remained talking a short time, and the prisoner shortly afterwards told me he did not feel well, and if I had nothing parti<lb></lb>cular for him to do, he would like to go—I told him he might go, and he did go; he did not return that day—after he had gone, I took up the pass book; I looked at it; I found an entry in that pass book which attracted my atten<lb></lb>tion—I then looked into the pocket of the pass book; I did not find any cheque there, corresponding to the entry in the pass book, of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not find a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 19th Jan.—I am able to state, that on that day no such cheque was drawn—I filled up a cheque on that day, but it was after bank hours, and it was dated on the 20th, being filled up after bank hours——I saw the prisoner the next morning; I did not speak to him at first; I immediately went to the Joint Stock Bank—when I came back, I saw the prisoner—I said to him, "Ratcliff, I want the cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which has been taken out of the cash book, corresponding with this entry of the 19th"—he looked rather confused, and said, "I have not got it"—I explained what cheque it was, a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 19th Jan.; he denied any knowledge of it—I found a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I told him we had discovered that the cheque had been paid in notes, and some time after he remarked to me, that if the cheque had been paid in gold, he did not see how it could be traced—as well as I can recollect, that was after I told him we had discovered it had been paid in notes.</p>

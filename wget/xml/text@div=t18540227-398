                  </hi>. I am a seaman, living at No. 2, Baker-street. On the night of 19th Feb. I was at the Cock and Neptune—I went out for a short time, and when I came back the prisoner and another young woman were having a bit of a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I told the prisoner to get out of the way, as I wanted to get into my place—I had called for a pot of half-and-half—she took up the pot, threw the half-and-half about, and cut my head with the pot—I had only touched her, and asked her to get out of the way—I had never seen her before—when I got to the station I lost my senses, through loss of blood.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) The prisoner was given into my custody—I said, "You have hurt that man very much; how did you do it?"—she said, "Well, I did do it; he struck me first"—he was so covered with blood that I could not see whether he was a black or a white man, and while he was at the station he lost his senses for half an hour—the prisoner had been drinking, but knew perfectly well what she was doing—I was hardly able to judge whether Phillips was sober, as he fainted away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master bill poster, and reside at 1, Burleigh-street, Strand—the prisoner was employed by me for the purpose of posting bills—Messrs. Waterlow, of London-wall, employ me to post bills for them—on 30th September, I received from them, for the purpose of being posted, a large quantity of bills, some of which were like these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner was my servant, and I handed him some of those which I had received from Waterlow's, with instructions to post them—two hundred, I should think, was about the number I gave him—if he has posted any district according to his judgment sufficiently, and does not exhaust all the bills, his duty would be to bring the residue back to me—I do not know the date of the month when I gave him those bills—it was on a Sunday;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186011260054"></xptr>
               <p>the day after I got them from Messrs.

I am a stationer carrying on business at 5, and 14, Theobald's-road—I know the prisoner—he has brought about one or two lots of bills to my place, and I have purchased them of him—he brought some to me in October—I believe these bills to be the same which he brought me, the same description—the bills that he brought to me were the ones that I showed to Scott—my initials are on some of these—I paid him at the rate of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt.—I bought 63lbs. from him in October—this portion of them which has been produced to-day, was retained by me on my premises and given up to the officer—I bought these by the instructions of the officer—the last purchase was on 26th October—here are two of the bills which have my initials—I can say from that fact that I bought those identical bills of the prisoner—I did not understand that he was in the employment of any body—he told me that the bills were perquisites, and that he had a right to sell them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Soames—I saw these bills in his shop—I have seen the prisoner there—I have, on one occasion, bought bills of this description from him—I did not ask him any questions as to how he became possessed of anything that he brought.</p>

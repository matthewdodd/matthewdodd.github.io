I will dig a cesspool," and I took out two loads of rubbish; I began to white-wash and colour the premises; I had not been at work above a day when a gentleman said he should put a broker in for King's taxes; I went to Mrs. Stevens, and she said it was paid, but could not find the receipt - they said they would send in the course of the day; I was going to repair the tiles, but was annoyed by these things, and I left the premises.</p>

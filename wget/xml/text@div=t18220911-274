On the 14th of August, the prisoner Fraser came into my shop saying that he was at work at Low Leighton, and the lady wanted five mats. I said, as he was a stranger to me, I should send my son with them; they both left together about six o'clock. I did not see my son again till between eleven and twelve o'clock. On Sunday the 18th I received information, and went to a hay loft in Three Colt-lane, Bethnal-green, and found Fraser there; he told me not to make a noise; and he had no doubt he should be able to settle it, and would send for his master; who came and refused to have any thing to do with it; Fraser was a stranger to me; I knew Wade well, and have trusted him, and he has always paid me.</p>

            . I am twelve years old. I went with Fraser and the mats; we crossed a field into Three Colt-lane, and by the Three Colts, public-house, Wade came up; Fraser asked him to walk with us, and we all three walked together; Fraser carried the mats part of the way, and

               <p>"Take them to the top of the hill, and I will take them of you, when I get to the top of the hill," there were some men fishing; Fraser asked me to stop and look at them. I said, No; Wade said, I had better, and when we got to Temple-mill, Fraser said,</p>
               <p>"That is the house; we will take them in;" and told me to pick a few blackberries if I liked; I stopped there till half-past nine o'clock; they never came back; I did not see them again till Sunday night, when my father took Fraser; the mats have not been found.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes, on Saturday the 22nd of August, about a quarter before five in the afternoon, he presented a check upon Messrs. Prescott and co. to me; I produce it; I have had it ever since. I suspected that it was not the hand writing of Mr. Griffiths, I shewed it to another clerk; then I was satisfied that it was not a good one. I took him into the back office and asked him from whom he had it; he said he had it from Mr. Soames, a hatter in St. John-street; I asked him if he lived with Mr. Soames, he said he did.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160049"></xptr>Q. What did you do with the prisoner. - A. It was desired that he might be detained; I went to Mr. Griffiths in Houndsditch and made some discovery; I then asked the prisoner the number of Mr. Soames house in St. John-street; he hesitated, he said he did not know. He then said that he did not live with Mr. Soames, but that he had the check of a gentleman in Bartholomew-lane, whom he did not know and that this gentleman desired him to say that he came from Mr. Soames. I asked him how he was to meet the gentleman, and how he was to give him the money; he said he was to take the money to an eating house in Bartholomew-lane and there meet the gentleman. I went with him to the eating house; there were several persons sitting there, he looked about, but he did not fix upon any person; one person sitting asked him who he was looking for, he answered Mr. Soames. Upon leaving the house I asked him if he lived with any person in the neighbourhood; he answered that he lived with Mr. Simpson in Coleman-street; I told him he must go with me there. In passing the bank he said he did not work for Mr Simpson, but that he lodged with him, he worked with Mr. Dutton in Bartholomew-lane; we were in sight of Mr. Dutton, he was standing at his shop door. I then desired the prisoner to write his name, he wrote

               <p>I keep the Mecklenburgh public house, in James's street, Manchester-square. On the 12th of October, I was sitting at the window, and the boy called to me, master! master! he had stopped the woman, and I went out and asked the boy what was the matter? and the woman begged I would search her, and I stroked her down, and found a pot at the bottom of her petticoat tail, it hung quite at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that pot your's? - Yes, I marked it, I wrote my name on it at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. There was none found on the child? - I did not meddle with the child, I should think by the looks of the poor thing that she could not have any.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have every reason to believe that the child had not the pot? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court to Elizabeth Miller. Where did you see the mother standing? - About forty yards from the public house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Plant. When you found this pewter pot at the bottom of her petticoat did you look to the petticoat and see how it got there? - I cannot say, I turned the the petticoat up and got it out of some hole. How it went in, I cannot say.</p>

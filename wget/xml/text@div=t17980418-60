No, I did not; I am a chandler, I live in St. John's-court, West Smithfield: On the 1st of this month, about a quarter after nine o'clock, I was at supper with my wife, and a friend, and I heard the cry of stop thief; I immediately went into the court, and when I came to the door I saw the prisoner at the bar, close to my door, and the prosecutor about laying hold of him, and having laid hold of him, accused him of having taken his watch, the prosecutor was very drunk; I immediately assisted the prosecutor, and took hold of the prisoner at the bar, and I knew him.</p>

               <p>Q. When they came out of the parlour what did they do then? - A. I saw no transaction of any kind; the prisoner's master was bound for his appearance, he gave his word, and so did Mr. Dye.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were in the parlour? - A. I was, my Lord, after I came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us know who were the persons in the parlour? - A. I mentioned Mr. Bull, his nephew, the landlord, and several other persons, besides the prisoner and the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean, upon your oath, to say you left them in the parlour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go into the parlour for? - A. For the purpose of hearing him examined; he went in to be searched but was not searched.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left them, and went home to supper, where was the prisoner? - A. To the best of my recollection, he was in the parlour; I can speak pretty clear the prisoner was in the parlour when I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. How come you, not above five minutes ago, to tell me you did not recollect what they said when they came out of the parlour? - A. I don't recollect what was said; there was nothing passed more than I wished them a good night.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You went into the parlour for the purpose of examining the prisoner, but did not examine him? - A. There was no officer in the way; we did not know we were authorized to search a man without an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to take him to Mr. House's to be examined? - A. I meant to have gone for Mr. Wells to have searched him, I took him there for safety; I did not know it was in my power to search a man.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the prisoner in the house, in whose custody did you leave him? - A. In the custody of the prosecutor; the tap-room was nearly full, there was a vast number of people.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am wife to the last witness, I work for the hospital: I never saw the prisoner, to the best of my knowledge, till the night this affair happened, the 1st of April. My husband told me in the morning, that this young man had an inward complaint, he spit blood; I gave him some lavender drops; I believe he had not been above a minute and a half out of the house when he came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing at all about this watch? - A. When he was brought back, I immediately opened the door, and was very much surprised to see him come back; the prosecutor was very much intoxicated indeed. I said, bring the man in, and search him; the prosecutor objected to having him brought into the house. I asked him if he could tell the number of his watch; the prosecutor said he could not tell. Can you tell any marks upon your watch, and what sort of a chain it was; the prosecutor said, no, the maker's name was on the watch, and he said he should know it if he saw it. I said, can you tell no mark upon your watch; he said he could not, but if he saw the watch he could tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He came to you for this complaint of spitting blood, and you gave him lavender drops? - A. Yes. (Produces the bottle.)</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the bottle again? - A. He brought it back to the door, and gave it me back, the young man was flurried.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he brought to be examined? - A. Yes, but the prosecutor objected; he said he would not have him brought into a strange house to be examined; the prisoner was very willing to be searched, but the prosecutor would not let him; he pulled his coat off, and said, search me, I am innocent, I would not rob a man of a pin off his sleeve.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How near was your husband then? - A. My husband was close by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Smith? - A. He stood close by the prisoner. I have known Smith above two years.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I keep the Cooper's Arms: I know the prisoner at the bar; I saw him and the prosecutor on the 1st of April, about twenty minutes after nine o'clock, between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober at that time? - A. Far from it, very drunk. The first I saw of the business was, the prosecutor and defendant came in, and there was a gentleman of the name of Smith, and a multitude of people rushed into the taproom suddenly; the prosecutor cried, and reeled very much; he said he had lost his watch, and the person he had in hold, he said, had robbed him of it, at the corner of Snow-hill; he said positively that the prisoner was the man that had robbed him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did the man say to that? - A. he said he had not got the watch, nor did not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all he said, are you sure those were the words? - A.Something similar to that, signifying that he had not got it. The prisoner made no other defence; he said he was willing to he searched. There were a great number of people in the tap-room. My house is in West-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. West-street is not Chick-lane? A. No, it joins Chick-lane. In consequence of my knowing the man's character, I told the prosecutor he certainly must be mistaken in the man; I told him, if he thought that was the man, to withdraw from the public room into the parlour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180046"></xptr>he told me he would not. I could not get any reasonable word out of him, but crying he had lost his watch. After that the prisoner's master was sent for; and before his master came, I wanted the prosecutor to have the prisoner searched, and to give charge of him in the regular way. After that, I offered to he hail for his appearance, provided he was regularly charged; he would not consent to any thing that I said, but would stay in the tap-room. Before the prisoner's master came, he was taken from the tap-room by my maid servant, she laid hold of his arm, as he was pushed about by the prosecutor and anotherperson, his name was M'Carthy. I went directly to the bar, and got the keys of my back doors, and locked my back door, and the passage door, to prevent any body going out backwards. After that, his master came, and another gentlemen, his master's nephew, to answer for the prisoner's character; and then, by a deal of persuasions by Mr. Bulle, they all went into the parlour. Mr. Bulle put several questions to the prosecutor, whether he had lost his watch, and he still persisted that the prisoner was the man that stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went into the parlour? - A. The prisoner, the prosecutor, Mr. M'Carthy, Mr. Bulle, and his nephew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go? - A. I was obliged to attend the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where Smith was at the time? - A. I believe Smith went out for an officer to secure the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door shut? - A. No, it was not shut at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When Smith went for an officer, and returned, where did he go then? - A. He went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you go into the parlour? - A. As soon as the company went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you observed? - A. All the conversation was between Mr. Bulle and the prosecutor, concerning the watch, and his vocuhing for the man's character and honesty; he told the prosecutor he was sure he was mistaken in the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why? - A. Because, knowing the man was such an honest character. The prosecutor said, he would give a guinea if any body would produce the watch, and cried, and reeled about; and the woman that gave her evidence was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was M'Carthy drunk? - A. No, I did not perceive he was drunk; for he and his friend had only a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. While the prosecutor and prisoner were in the tap-room, were they jostled about? - A. There were many people there, and it could not be helped.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you strike the prosecutor? - A. I took hold of him gently by the arm to come into the parlour, and take his party with him, and not expose themselves in the public room.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who were the party? - A. The party was the prisoner and Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him searched? - A. No. I understand he was searched in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you before the Justice when he was examined? - A. Yes; it was before Mr. Alderman Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not comitted till the second examination? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was House there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say about it? - A. He said, he had that minute before he was taken up left his house with a bottle of stuff; he came to me first of all to borrow a bottle to put the stuff in.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go into the parlour? - A. I did, as soon as I had an opportunity.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented you? - A. Nothing but my wife's being so poorly; it was but a very few minutes before I went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was he not searched in the tap-room? A. I don't know; he was willing to be searched, but nobody stepped forward to search him. I am sure he was searched in the parlour by his master and his nephew.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Had be been out of the house before that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were present when he was searched? - A.His master and his nephew, M'Carthy, and the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is not true that the parlour door was shut? - A. No; it was bolted back all the day long. I am sure it was not shut at that time.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a carman: The prisoner was a servant of mine; he has been in my service between three and four years. I live in White-horse-yard, West Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know any thing of the prosecutor before this time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did House work for you likewise? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How many people? - A. I cannot tell; it was a large tap-room. I saw the prosecutor there, when I came up. I desired him to go into the parlour, to search the prisoner; there was a person there, who said there was no occasion to search him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that M'Carthy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your requiring the prosecutor to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180047"></xptr>into the parlour, did you all immediately go into the parlour? - A. Yes. There were the prisoner, the prosecutor, my nephew and Mr. Smith, and M'Carthy came into the room; I told the prosecutor, it was proper to search the prisoner, to see if there was any property about him; M'Carthy said, there was no occasion for it; I told him, I thought they should be satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he, in point of fact, searched? - A. He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What other conversation took place? - A. The prosecutor spoke several times, but I could hardly make out any thing he said, only that he had lost his watch; he cried like a child that had been corrected. Nothing particular passed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner? - A. He went home to his lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that you would be answerable for his appearance? - A. I told the young man, I would be answerable for his appearance the next day. The next day, he went voluntarily before the Magistrate.</p>

             sworn. - I am the nephew of Mr. Bulle; I have lived in my uncle's service about nine years; I have two or three and twenty men under my care. I have known the prisoner at the bar about five years; and with respect to his character, I believe him to be honest; I have sent him to wine and brandy-merchants, and I never saw him intoxicated in my life. On the 1st of April, about half past nine o'clock at night, I went to the Coopers' Arms, and when I came into the tap-room, I saw a great number of people very inserior characters to my appearance, such as Irish labourers; I saw the prisoner at the bar and the prosecutor, and I took them into the parlour.</p>

               <p>Q. Who went into the parlour with you? - A. There was Mr. Dye, an Irishman, a Mr. Smith, the prosecutor, the prisoner, and my uncle. When I first went into the tap-room, I said, if you have any thing to alledge against the prisoner, you had better take him into the parlour; when we went into the parlour, the prosecutor cried, and said he had lost his watch; he was very much intoxicated, in short, he tumbled against me. I think he offered the prisoner a guinea to give him his watch; he said, I have not got your watch, you never saw me before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing at all about searching? - A. The man offered to be searched, I did not see any body that wished to do it. My uncle and Mr. Dye become answerable for his appearance the next day. On the Monday, he went before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Pray, as you came for the purpose of searching this man, why did you not search him? - A. I did not know that I was authorized to search him.</p>
               <p>Five witnesses were called to the prisoner's character, who had known him from three to four years, and believed him to be a very honest man.</p>

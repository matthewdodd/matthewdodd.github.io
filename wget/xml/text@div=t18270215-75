He came to me in July - I discharged him on the 17th of January without notice - his box was searched in my presence - there were six or seven bottles of wine, some books, and a few trifling articles belonging to me in it - he said the wine was from the lees I had given him; I had some time before bottled off a cask of Madeira, and gave him leave to take what he could, after I had got all I could - the wine found consisted of sherry, white wine, and Madeira - I should think he could not get much out of the Madeira lees; perhaps three or four bottles - the wine found in his box was drinkable, and better than that from the lees could possibly be - a key was found on him, which answered to the lock of the cupboard-door, where the cellar key was kept sometimes - I kept Hermitage, Sherry, and Madeira wine in my cellar - the bottles were corked with a peculiar kind of patent cork, two pieces of cork joined together with a kind of composition at the top.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had not you many of these corks in your possession? A. Yes, but not many new ones - I never gave him any lees of wine before - I kept the corks in the cellar locked up - I gave him lees of the Madeira; I had drank some of the wine - my wine is generally decantered in the cellar, and the bottles left there.</p>

            . I am a watchmaker. On the 30th of November last the prisoner came to my shop about a watch - he called the week after to take the watch away - he said he had got some port and sherry - I asked him where he got it; he said from his brother at Kensington, who was a butler - I asked him the price; he said half-a-crown a bottle - he came again on the 7th of December for the watch, and brought four bottles of sherry; he paid for the watch; I paid him half-a-crown to make up the difference - he said he lived with Captain Jones, of Harley-street. He brought four bottles of wine on the 7th of December - I drank them; I did not observe any difference from other corks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the bottles sealed up? A. No; he gave his right address.</p>

            . I am an officer, and apprehended the prisoner on the 22d of January, in Piccadilly, at the Swan public-house, the corner of Dover-street - I told him I had a warrant against him for robbing his master - he said his master had forgiven him.</p>
               <p>J. PALMER re-examined. I gave Captain Jones the bottles which the prisoner brought to me - the seals were put on afterwards.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN JONES re-examined. I put the seals on to prevent their being changed - I drew the cork of one of the bottles of sherry, and tasted it; I believe this to be my old Madeira - It would be impossible for such wine to come from the lees - It is excellent wine - I should know my own Madeira as well as I should know my own coat - it is fifteen years old - I gave a very high price for it; as far as I can positively say, I believe it to be my own wine; I would swear to it as I would to the identity of my coat; this basket marked R. P. is mine; it was sent with some game and fruit from the country.</p>
               <p>J. PALMER re-examined. I believe this basket is the same I received with the wine, but I cannot swear to it; I gave Captain Jones the same that was brought by the prisoner - the prisoner brought other bottles of wine in this.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN JONES. One of the corks I could identify now if I was to draw it; it was the sherry bottle which had the peculiar cork; I think I tasted from this bottle, but I am not sure; this one I know I opened; I mean to the best of my knowledge; it is by the corks that I judge it is my wine.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Now, Sir, will you swear that to be your Madeira, or is it sherry? A. As far as I can judge from the taste, this is sherry.</p>

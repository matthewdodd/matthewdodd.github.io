                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Handcock, who keeps the Cricketers beer-shop at Woolwich. On 1st Dec. about half-past 11, or 12 o'clock, the prisoner came to the bar alone for a glass of half-and-half—he was served in my presence—a short time after another young man came in—he said, "Halloo!" and called the prisoner by some name, I think it was <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>—the other man had a glass <hi rend="italic">of</hi> ale—in two minutes afterwards, two others came in—they spoke to the prisoner, and the other—they were all talking together; they appeared to know one another—the prisoner then asked if I would allow him to wash himself—I said, Yes, and took him into the kitchen, which is about twenty feet from the bar—I left no one in the bar, but the three other persons in front of the bar—I showed the prisoner where to wash himself—I came back to the bar, and one of the last two that came in asked me if I sold peppermint—I said, I did not—they then said, "What is that in that cask on the bar?"—I said, it was spruce—they said, they would have 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth—it was what is called Dantzic spruce—I served them with half-a-quartern—they then asked for some hot water—spruce is generally taken with water—I had a fire-place in the bar, but I had no water there—I went to the kitchen to get the water—the prisoner was still washing—I brought the water to the bar, and it was put with the spruce—they said it was too strong, and I must get more water—I went to get more, and when I came back the one that said it was too strong was gone—that excited my attention, and I put the glass on the bar, and went in the bar parlour, and the cash-box was gone—I had seen it there when I first went for the water—when I went in the bar-parlour I had left two standing at the bar, but before I could turn round they were gone—they did not give me a chance to say any<lb></lb>thing to them—I went to the door, and came back, and called to a person who was in my kitchen—I said, "They have stolen the cash-box"—the prisoner could hear that very well, and he came up the passage and said, "I will run after them"—I said, "No, you won't"—the person that I called took hold of him by the shoulder—and I went to the door to keep it shut—the prisoner got from the person who had hold of him, in a violent manner—he came to the door and pushed me on one side—he did not hurt me much, but he got out and I could not prevent it—I did not go out, but my husband was coming along and he saw the prisoner go out of the house—there were plenty of people very soon round—there was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the cash-box—I have never seen it since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Levy's-cottages, Charlton. On 1st Dec. about 5 minutes before 12 o'clock, I was coming from the dockyard, and heard a cry of, "Stop thief! he has run away with a woman's cash-box!"—I saw the prisoner running along as fast as he could—he came up to me—I told him to stop—he made a stop, and crossed the road, and went under the rails of the footpath—I ran round, and held him till Mr. Handcock came—the pri<lb></lb>soner said it was a <hi rend="italic">gallows</hi> shame to stop him, he had not stolen anything—I said, "If you have not stolen anything, why did you run away?"—he made no answer.</p>

I was returning home to dinner on 1st Dec, about 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner come out of my door, and run as fast as he could—I did not know what had occurred—I went to my own door, my wife told me, and I followed the prisoner—I sung "Stop thief!" and the witness stopped him till I came up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Sand-street, Woolwich, and am a baker. On 1st Dec. I saw the prisoner and three other persons about a quarter past 10 o'clock at the left-hand window of my shop in Sand-street, which is about seventy yards from Mr. Handcock's—I was in my shop—they were all four conversing together—I thought they were making some obser<lb></lb>vations about the train—I went into the Cricketers the same day about a quarter past 11, and saw the same four men at the bar—they bad a glass of ale at the bar—soon afterwards I heard of the robbery.</p>

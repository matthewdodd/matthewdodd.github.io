On the 23d of May, he had finished three instruments - I saw them and thirteen others all right on the 24th, and on the 25th I was going to pack them up, and missed two of them, and a pair of shoes - the prisoner was not at home then - I told him of it the next morning at breakfast - he said it was very hard that he should be suspected of every thing - he denied all knowledge of them, and endeavoured to implicate other persons - I said I was determined to find them, and I would go to the different pawnbrokers - he said, "I will save you the trouble; I took two of them, and pawned them at

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did you say it would be better for him to tell you? A. No; I found what he said was true, as to where they were - I went to his mother on the Wednesday afternoon, and said he should go home with me - his mother said he should not - one of his brothers directly collared me - I gave him in charge, and he was convicted - I should have taken the prisoner again before the Chamberlain, where he had been a few weeks before - I did not dash his head against the wall - I told him to take hold of my arm, but when he became restive I took him by the collar, but he ran away, and got into the hands of the police - he walked with me from his mother's door to the street door - he then took hold of the rails, and said he would go no further - I can hardly tell whether I had hold of him or not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any mark on this instrument? A. No; only the general character of the work - the handle was not on when the prisoner made it - I know it is one of my handles - the prisoner has made dozens of them - I cannot distinguish one from another.</p>

On the 31st of December I saw the prisoner in my master's shop, just before the gas was lighted - I do not exactly know the time; I was serving a customer at the door; the prisoner was three or four yards from me - I saw him putting something into his bag, but what it was I did not know; I went to him, and asked what he wanted - he replied some black ribbon; I then asked what he had in his bag - he replied, "Nothing but my work;" I then told him if he would step on the other side he would get served with the ribbon - I returned to my customer at the door, to receive the money for what I sold to him, and then kept my eyes on the prisoner - I saw him on the other side, and in a few minutes saw him go to the door; he attempted to open it: I called him, and asked if he had been served with the ribbon - he said he could get no one to serve him; I then said I would serve him if he would return, but seeing a young man disengaged I referred the prisoner to him, and while he was in the act of showing him the ribbon I called him to the further end of the shop, and asked him again what he had in his bag; he again said nothing but his work; I said, "I should like to look," and when I opened the bag I found this piece of silk, containing one hundred and eight yards, value 16l. - I detained him, and gave him in charge; he begged for pardon. (Looking at the silk) I swear this is my master's - I do not recollect having seen it during that day; our people were busily engaged with customers - two other young men came into the shop about the same time, which particularly drew my attention to the door; one of them tried to draw my attention to the door.</p>

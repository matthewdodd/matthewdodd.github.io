On Saturday evening, about half past seven in the evening, in the beginning of December, I cannot say the day of the month, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked me if I had a pair of second hand shoes. He looked at two or three pair of shoes. He paid me four shillings for a pair. I had just put out of my hand a pair of new shoes to serve him, and as soon as the prisoner went out of the shop I missed them. I had nobody in the shop but a bricklayer and a carpenter that were doing work for me. On the Sunday following the prisoner came past my shop. I asked him where he lived. He said, if I followed him I might see where he lived. I followed him. In the course of ten minutes afterwards, the prisoner and his wife came to my door. The prisoner abused me very much. I then told him, if he abused me much more, I would charge an officer with him. I was almost sure that he took them, though I did not see him take them.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was in the prosecutor's shop at the time that the prisoner came in to purchase a pair of shoes. I observed Mr. Coleman put a pair of new shoes at the further end of the counter. I saw the prisoner take them up with his left hand, and take them away. I thought they had been the shoes that he had been purchasing of.</p>

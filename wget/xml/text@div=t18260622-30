            . The deceased was my brother. On Sunday, the 7th of May, an agreement was made between him and Palmer to fight on Monday; they had not quarrelled; Palmer was against fighting, and it was put off from Monday till Tuesday evening, as I was not present; they fought on Tuesday evening, in a field by <placeName id="t18260622-30-crimeloc142">Bethnal-green</placeName>

I took him home to my master's, in Oak-town; he laid insensible all night, and next morning we sent him to the Hospital. It was a fair battle - he slipped by running back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Palmer was very reluctant to fight? A. Yes, always.</p>

            . On Monday night I heard the deceased challenge Palmer to fight - he did not wish it, and declined; on Tuesday he came down, and said he would have it out that evening; Palmer wished not to fight, but they called him a coward several times - at last he said he did not wish to fight, but he did not mind - they fought for three-quarters of an hour. I desired the deceased to leave off after the first round - he said he would not; I told him Palmer was too powerful for him - he said No, he was not; I remained in the field, but not near enough to notice the fight, and saw no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Did they shake hands? A. Palmer offered the deceased his hand before they began, but he being deaf did not hear it.</p>

            . I am a student in the London Hospital. On the 10th of May the deceased was brought there, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220018"></xptr>lived twelve hours; I opened him after death, and found an effusion of blood on the brain, and marks of bruises on the scalp, about the back part, and some injury in the internal part of the brain, but no fracture. I should think the injury was produced by a fall.</p>

            . I was awoke at a quarter past two o'clock in the morning, by a person falling down stairs; the lodger in the next room called to me. I opened the window, and saw the prisoner go out with a bundle; it was between the lights, just break of day; I should not have been able to swear to him without the gas-light - I am sure he is the man; he walked across the road, and turned the corner as quick as possible - I saw him afterwards in the house, and knew him to be the same man; I am certain of the time, for I looked at the clock.</p>

            . I found the keys on the prisoner, as I stated before, in his left-hand breast pocket - there are 8; one is a latch-key and in his trousers pocket I found one, which opened the room door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I am charged with entering the house with a latch-key, and the room door with another, which I do declare was never opened by me. I was out at a friend's house, and did not leave until near three o'clock, and this robbery is stated to be between one and two. I have been all my life-time in respectability, succeeding a father-in-law, as a jeweller, when he retired from business in Paris, where all the family still remain; I have always had a supply of money when required, with my own industry - I never have had cause to commit such a dreadful act. The witness states she saw me run across the street - it could not be light enough to distinguish any one.</p>

I live at 19, Riley Street, Bermondsey—on 29th December last, in consequence of seeing an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Clerkenwell News</hi>, I went to 19, Havering Street, Commercial Road, and there saw Noakes—he said he had come from Mr. Belcher, as his foreman, to engage me, as he understood the business better; that Belcher wanted a person with 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash security, as the man would have a great deal of responsibility in collecting money, and he asked if I would put down ft half-Crown as a deposit that I would put 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down—I gave him a half-Crown and promised to bring 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the afternoon—he told me to go to 149, Back Church Lane—I did so, and there saw both prisoners—I put down the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Belcher said I was to make up the rest by next Monday morning—he gave me a piece of paper as a receipt for the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I afterwards gave it back upon paying him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, when he gave me a note of hand for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went again on Friday, 31st December, saw Belcher, and said I could not find 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said he would not be hard upon me, he would give me the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back again if I would pay the expenses for some more advertisements—I said I would—I went again next day, and asked Beloher for my money—he said he would give it me as soon as he got another man—he afterwards said he had got a man, and he would pay me as soon as he could—afterwards, on 17th or 18th January, he came to my house, and said, if I would put down 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more I could come to work on Monday as storekeeper, at a salary of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I went to the Stores on the Monday following, and put down 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did no work, there was none to do; I had to walk about the cellars with my hands behind roe all day—it was a bottled ale store—there was about a cask and a half of ale there—there was no business of any kind going on—I was there a fortnight—he paid me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in that time, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at one time and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at another—I have never been paid back my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—i have applied for it—I signed this agreement on 17th January, after I had paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it must have been about the 10th that he came to my house—(<hi rend="italic">This was an agree<lb></lb>ment to engage the witness as storekeeper, at</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week</hi>)—Belcher signed it—no ale was sold while I was there—some persons came down and had a glass of ale, that was all; they did not pay for it—Belcher said they were going to bottle come ale—he gave me back the half-Crown which I had deposited with Noakes, when I paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I witnessed this document and the pri<lb></lb>soners signed it—(<hi rend="italic">This was a memorandum of agreement between the prisoners, dated January</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1870, <hi rend="italic">by which they agreed to share the rent of the cellars between them, Belcher to carry on the ale business on his own account, and Noakes the bottle business</hi>)—After I had been there a fortnight and three days Belcher told me to leave; he did not say why—I asked for my wages or my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would pay me as soon as he got some—he never gave it me—this is the advertisement I answered—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "A young man wanted to manage bottled ale stores; no knowledge required.

On the 24th of March, the prisoner and two other men came into my shop to purchase a watch. I shewed them several watches; they bought one, they gave earnest for it, and left it to be repaired. After they were gone, I missed a silver case single watch, maker's name, J. Davis. On Monday, one of the men, who were with the prisoner, who bargained for the watch, came for it. I told him, when they were there, on Friday, I missed a watch; he seemed surprised, and said, the Black must have taken it. Having no suspicion of him, I let him have the watch away, he had bargained for. Two or three days after, the prisoner came into my shop, and shewed me an old watch he had, I took the watch, and then charged him with the robbery: he denied it; I sent for a constable, and he was taken to justice Welch's office. I found a watch paper in the watch I took from him; by the direction of that paper I went to Mr. Triquet, in Cranbourne Alley, and there I found my watch.</p>

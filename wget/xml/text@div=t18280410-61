I saw the horse at Chigwell, about the 26th of January, and the chaise at Romford, next day. The prisoners are strangers to me.</p>

On the 20th of January, I was going up Staines, and saw the prisoner Smith, who I knew before; he had two persons with him, one of whom was Hall, the witness. Since that, there were warrants against both the prisoners; I sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100055"></xptr>to Cook: several officers went with me, to apprehend both the prisoners, at Turnham-green, on the 17th or 18th of March. Smith asked what I apprehended him for, I told him for stealing Jennings' horse and chaise; he said he knew nothing of it. I told Latchford, I took him for receiving the horse, he said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you take them both at Turnham-green? A. Yes; I know Latchford was not one of the persons I saw.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Chigwell, Essex. On Sunday afternoon, about four o'clock, I saw Mr. Jennings' horse in my field. I think it was on the 27th of January; I know it was on Sunday; the hedges of the field were down, and I think it had strayed in there - I saw Latchford fetch the poney out of the field. I knew him before - he lived at Chigwell, with his father. I told him if he did not keep it out of the field, I should send him to the pound; it was the same horse as Jennings afterwards claimed.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer, and live at Romford, Essex. On the 22d of January, in the afternoon, Latchford came to my stables, where property is generally brought for public sale; he brought the pony and chaise there; I had some conversation with him next morning - he stated to me that he had a chaise brought there for me to sell by auction on market day, for a gentleman named Smith, of Munt - Munt is about seven miles off; the chaise was afterwards claimed by Jennings, and returned to him. I was not present when it was brought.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are quite sure of his person? A. Quite - I saw him again at Bow-street about March - the chaise was sold to Mr. Colyer, and I gave Latchford the produce of it. The same chaise was given up to Mr. Jennings, by the Magistrate's order.</p>

I went to Mr. Carmichael's before this robbery was committed; the horse and chaise were stolen from Mr. Jenning's stable, a little after ten o'clock at night on the 20th of January - I was coming by at the time; Colonel Carmichael had told me to watch them; I saw Oades leading the horse out of Mr. Jennings' yard by the head, and afterwards saw a man resembling Smith come out and shut the gate; I had known Smith two years, but am not positive that it was him; Oades has absconded - I saw him about a week afterwards. I have seen Smith since, but I had no conversation with him about it; I have heard Oades talk about it in Smith's company, a fortnight or three weeks after; he said, "No doubt as they have found the horse and chaise, they will find other things;" when I saw the horse and chaise brought out they were harnessed together. About half-past six o'clock on the evening of the robbery, Smith and Oades came to me, and asked if I would make one of the party to go down and get Mr. Jennings' horse and chaise - I said I would not; this was in the market place - they left me. As soon as Oades brought the horse and chaise into the middle of the road, he said,"I hope you won't take any notice of this - I hope you won't say anything about it;" I told them I thought it was a very bare-faced trick to get it out at that time; I did not promise not to tell. There are watchman at Staines - I gave no alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you suffered them to go away with it? A. I expected Colonel Carmichael would have taken them; it was in a retired part of the street; I do not think I could have got anybody to take them; I gave no alarm. I was not taken up. I have never been confined in my life; I am sure Latchford was not one of the party, and cannot identify Smith as one.</p>

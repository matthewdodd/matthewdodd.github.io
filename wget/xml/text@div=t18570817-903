                  </hi>. I am a lieutenant in the Royal Marines, stationed at Woolwich, the prisoner is a private in the same corps, and has been my servant two years—on Wednesday morning, 22nd July, I went on duty soon after 10 o'clock—the prisoner was in charge of my quarters—I returned about half past 11 o'clock on the following day, and he was not there—I missed a silver watch with a gold chain attached to it, a key in the shape of a gun, three sovereigns from a small box, a black coat, a pair of trowsers, a waistcoat, and a pair of boots—gave information, and the prisoner was brought to my quarters in the afternoon dressed in my clothes.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Kensey, of Woolwich—the prisoner came to our beer shop on Thursday morning, 23rd July, between 6 and 7 o'clock, with a gentleman and two young girls—they had a pot of porter first, then a pot of ale with ginger beer in it, after that they ordered breakfast for four—they had the breakfast, and after that came out of the tap room to the bar and had some more ginger beer—one of the girls said, "You had better leave your watch at the bar for fear you might lose it," and they persuaded him to do so, and they went away—he was dressed like a gentleman in a black coat, and had a watch and chain outside—he paid me in silver, but I had changed him a sovereign previously for the ale and ginger beer—the woman afterwards came back and said that she had come for the watch by the prisoner's orders, but I would not give it up unless he came himself, and about 1 o'clock they all returned—I fetched the watch, the girl took it, and he said that it was quite right, and then he said, "Give the mistress the watch back again," and he said to me, "Lend me ten shillings on it"—the gentleman with her ordered dinner for three—the other girl was not there then, and while they were having it the sergeant came.</p>

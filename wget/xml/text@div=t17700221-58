I went to Justice Camper, got a warrant, took him out of the Savoy, and brought him before the Justice, where he owned he took the money and buttons out of a till in my chest. He told me what girl he had given the buttons to to carry to pledge, and said he went along with her to a pawnbroker in an alley near Well-close square.

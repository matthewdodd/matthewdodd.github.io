On the night of 19th April I locked up the premises—the plate was then safe—I came down at 6 o'clock next morning, and the plate was gone—it had been in a box on a chair in the kitchen—it consisted of dessert forks, spoons, and other things—I had seen the prisoner once—the house appeared to have been entered by the kitchen-window being opened—I cannot say whether it had been fastened the night before, but it was shut down—if it was fastened it was with a snap on the top—these spoons and forks are Mr. Pennell's property—I know them by their ap<lb></lb>pearance, having been so much used to them—there is G. F. on them, and a crest.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Soho-square, and am a gold refiner. On Tuesday, 20th April, a person came to my shop, about 9 o'clock in the morning, and asked if I purchased silver—(to my best belief the prisoner is the man)—I said, "Yes, what have you?"—he then produced some dessert forks—I asked him whose they were—he said they were not his, they belonged to a gentleman, that he had to dispose of them for—I asked where the gentleman lived—he said he did not know, only he lived a little way out of town—I said I was not in the habit of buying of strangers at all, but if the person they belonged to would call on me, and give me those answers which I required, I should then do business with him—he said, "Very well;" and being unsuspicious I offered him to take the forks away with him, but he said, "No; I will leave the forks, and tell the person to call"—in the course of conversation I asked the prisoner his name, and one of the names he gave was Boyce—what the Christian name, or the first name was, I cannot tell—he said he had lived at Whitechapel, and also at Charles-street, Drury-lane—upon that the forks remained in my possession—I asked him when the person would call—he said he would call next day, in the course of the evening—no person calling I gave information to the police in a day or two after—the prisoner showed me no other silver beside the forks—I saw the prisoner again; I cannot call to mind exactly the day, but I think in five or six days afterwards—he was brought by two persons—at that time I did not hear him speak—I did not at that time identify him, as being the person who brought the forks to me—he was quite differently dressed, and I did not hear him speak—the person who came on 20th April had a hat on, with a long great coat; and the second time he had a blue cap, with a peak, on the side of his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185206140105"></xptr>
               <p>head, and a rough blue sailor's jacket, which came down to the lower part of the waist, with pockets on the side—I saw him after that; I think it was the next day, or two days afterwards—he was then dressed the same as he was the day he brought the forks—on that occasion I heard him speak, and having heard him speak, I recognised him as the man who offered me the forks, and I still believe him to be the man—I have no doubt about it—when he came to offer the fork's I should think he remained in my shop nearly ten minutes—I had been in conversation with him during that time, and had asked him various questions.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness. I recollect a man coming to our shop on 20th April, and bringing some forks—I was in the shop at the time, and I remained till he left—I believe the prisoner was the person—he gave the name of Boyce, and said he lived occasionally in White-chapel, and sometimes in Charles-street, Drury-lane—I think a person was brought to our shop by two policemen on the following Monday or Tuesday—the 20th of April was on Tuesday, and it was about a week afterwards—that person was not dressed in the same way as the person who brought the forks, and I did not recognize him—I did not hear him speak when he was brought the first time—I saw him again in three or four days afterwards, and at that time I heard him speak—after I had heard him speak I was able to recognize him—I believed he was the man then, and I still believe it—I have no doubt of it now—I recollect something was said about betting—he said he transacted business in that way for other persons, and sometimes for himself.</p>

Q.</hi> Was that when your father was present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—I think it was about a week after 20th April when the person who I now believe was the person who brought the forks, was brought again by two officers—I do not know their names—I do not think it was so long afterwards as 1st May—I cannot say positively, not making any memorandum at the time—the first occasion on which I saw him might have been on 1st May and the second occasion on 12th May—my memory is deficient with respect to particular dates—it was not the same officer who brought him the second time who brought him the first.</p>

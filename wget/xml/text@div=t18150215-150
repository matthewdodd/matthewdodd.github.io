               <p>Q. Did you lose a pair of salts any time - A. Yes, yesterday afternoon, about four o'clock; they were on a table in the shop; they were worth four shillings. I was backwards, and a person in court came running, and telling me that the salts were gone; I went, and found the prisoner up a gateway; the prisoner was putting the salts down his pantaloons, he had got one down to his ancle; he appeared as a working man then, as he does now; I should not have had any suspicion of him; he pleaded so much distress, if he had delivered them up, I should have forgive him, but he swore he had not the other so many oaths, that I would not forgive him; he never was out of the constable's sight I believe.</p>
               <p>JESSE PHILLIPS. I am a constable. I was going by the prosecutor's house on the opposite side of the way; I saw the prisoner take the salts off the table; I called Wyman out, and told him he was robbed; Wyman followed the prisoner across the street up a gateway, and took the salts from him one at a time; the prisoner denied that he had taken the other; he gave up one, and kept the other; Wyman found the other at the bottom of his pantaloons. These are the salts.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my salts.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Walford-street, Old St. Pancras-road. I was in the tap-room at the Two Brewers public-house on the 2nd of July, in George-street, St. Giles—I saw the prisoner and the prosecutrix there, with several others—after I had been there five minutes, the prisoner got into con<lb></lb>versation with the prosecutrix, and after they had been in conversation some time, she went to sleep—in five minutes the prisoner shuffled from her right hand round to her left side—he then deliberately took a knife from his pocket, and turned up her clothes—I saw him take a bag out—he tipped the silver out of the bag into his hand, doubled this bag up, and put it back—I went out, and called a policeman—one shilling was found on the prisoner at the station—three or four shillings appeared to come out of the bag.</p>

                  </hi>.

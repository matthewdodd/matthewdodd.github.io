On the 7th of November, at a quarter after one o'clock, I went in to dinner - I came out again in about two minutes, and missed a piece of beef; a person said two men had run down Pimlico with it; I ran, and overtook the prisoner about a mile off, with it on his shoulder; he said it was given to him to carry - there were 35lbs. of it.</p>

            . I live near Mr. Weaver. I saw the prisoner and another person carrying a piece of beef, about one hundred yards from his shop; they walked slowly, and stared at me; I think the prisoner had the beef. The prosecutor came up in about four minutes, and I assisted in pursuing the prisoner - he was secured; the other got away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had lived with Mr. Haddon, and had been up to Sloane-square, to see a young man; as I was coming back a young man was walking with this beef, and he asked me to hold it while he went into a house: we walked on, and the prosecutor came and took me - I started when I heard it was stolen. The other man stood talking with them. I had time to get away if I had chosen.</p>

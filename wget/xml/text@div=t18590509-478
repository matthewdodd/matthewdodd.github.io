                  </hi>. I keep the Anchor-and-Hope beer-shop, Bethnal-green. On 31st March the prisoner came to my house a little after 2 o'clock—he called for a pint of beer, and tendered in payment a shilling—my son-in-law was standing by me, and I said to him, "This is a bad one I think"—he looked at it, and gave it me back, and said, "I think it is a good one"—I gave the prisoner change, he drank the beer and left—and when he was gone I felt the shilling again, and said, "No, I am sure it is a bad one"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090036"></xptr>
               <p>my son felt it, and ran after the prisoner and brought him back—I said, "the shilling you gave me was bad, give me back the change"—he gave it me—I asked him where he got it—he told me he helped a man to load a load of dung, and he gave him the shilling for his work—I said, "Who was the man?"—he said he did not know—I said, "Well, if you don't know the man, don't you know where you loaded the dung up from"—he said yes, he could show me that—and my son went with him, but after going about fifty yards he returned, and said he could not tell—at that time two men passed by in a cart, and they said to him, <hi rend="italic">"Holla,</hi> old <hi rend="italic">chap,</hi> how did you get on with your bad half-crown?" I asked my son to go after the men and ask them what they meant, and they said they had just come out of the Rising-Sun, where the man came in with the bad half-crown, and they pitied him, and said, "Poor fellow, let him go and see if he can find the man." By this time a policeman had come up, and I gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

I am the son-in-law of the last witness—I was at his house on 31st March, when the prisoner came in—I saw my father receive a shilling from the prisoner—in the first instance I thought it was good—my father-in-law gave change, and the prisoner left—I took the shilling from my father-in-law's hand, tried it, and found it was bad—I ran after the prisoner—he was walking, not very fast—after calling to him six or seven times he turned and saw me close to him—I brought him back to the beer-shop, a little conversation passed between us, and we said we would send for a policeman—he said a man gave him the shilling for loading a load of dung—we asked where he loaded the dung, and he said he would show us—I went out with him for the purpose of being shown the place, and after we got about sixty yards he made a stop, he seemed to be confused and said, "I don't think it was this way, I am a stranger about London, I don't think I can find it." We went back, and two men passed in a cart and called out, <hi rend="italic">"Holla,</hi> old fellow, how did you get on with your bad half-crown?—I fetched a constable, and the prisoner was given into custody—we took him to the Rising Sun—the shilling was given to the policeman in my presence.</p>

               <p>FREDERICK SUTTER. I live in Poland-street Oxford-road. On the 9th of April I was at the Royal Exchange, about o'clock in the day, I came round to the Bank in Bartholomew-lane; I saw the prisoner, he was selling oranges there; I bought six penny worth of oranges of him; I gave him a three-shilling piece, and in change he gave me two bad shillings and a good six-pence; I put them in my pocket. I afterwards saw the prisoner where he first accosted me; he was taken in custody by the constable; I gave the constable the two shillings.</p>
               <p>HENRY MILLER. I am clerk at the Bank. On Friday the 9th of April, Mr. Sutter came to my house, he was there when I came home from the Bank. In the course of conversation it came out that I was going to London-road. He said he had some little business to do, and I could do it is well; among the other money he tended to me were these two shillings. I said they were bad; he said he should like to trace the jew that gave them to him. We went out and called on Sapwell, and when we went to apprehend him he put his hand behind him; Mr. Sapwell picked up another bad shilling. Take notice, the prisoner then said, I have not stirred from the place.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Miller. I apprehended the prisoner; I found eight shillings and six-pence good money upon him, which I returned him at the Mansion House; behind him on the stones there lay a shilling, it was a base one. This is it; and these are the two shillings delivered to me by the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 375, Oxford-street. In consequence of some circumstance I marked four half-crowns, and gave them to Mr. Howard to go to a shop, No. 147, Edgware-road, to purchase goods—this is one of the half-crowns I gave him—the prisoner was then in the service of Mr. William John Martin, for whom I was then managing.</p>

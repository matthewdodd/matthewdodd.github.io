                  </hi>. I live with my father, Jireh Humphreys, at Chingford, in Essex—I lost a saddle form a chaise-house on Monday, the 1st of Feb.—the last time I saw it there was on the Thursday before—the groom had seen it on the Saturday—I have seen it since—this is it—it is my property.</p>

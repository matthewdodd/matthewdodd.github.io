            . I am a patrol of St. Paul, Shadwell; I was on duty, the 24th of January, near Miss Jacks's house, about one hundred and fifty yards from it; as I was calling the hour of three, she called out of her window to me - I went to see what was the matter; I then went to the place where I thought the persons must have got in, I placed myself there, and called to

             to come to my assistance - He came, and I placed him at the other corner; he called to me, and said, there was a man who would assist us; I went up to him, and saw the prisoner, Ferguson, just by Blake, I told him to secure him, and he did. Before he was taken away I searched him on the spot, and took a pair of scissars from his jacket pocket, I delivered them to Morris on the Monday following, I kept them safe untill I gave them to him. We went to look at the premises, and searched Miss Jacks's house, and found the tiles taken off, and the laths cut away, leaving room for a man to get in. We found a hole leading to the privy of the adjoining house, I went down the hole and found the prisoner, Cotton, in the adjoining house-it was not Taverner's house. I endeavoured to take him to the watch-house, but on the road he slipped his arms out of his jacket, and ran away, leaving his jacket in my hands, I called out stop thief! Tuck found him and brought him to the watch-house; I searched his jacket, and found a tinder-box and steel, a candle, some halfpence and farthings. I found nothing more in his other clothes. The place where I first saw Cotton was about sixty yards from Taverner's, there are several houses between, we traced them from Jacks's premises to Taverner's house. We found a stocking, and another pair of scissars, in the place where we found Cotton, in the shed, which is above the hole that leads into the privy; and in another part of the shed where we found him, there was a shirt and a stockings, which appeared to be the fellow stocking to that which I had found. We went to look at Taverner's premises the next day, he was with me at the back part of his premises; the tiling was broken through large enough for a man to get through, it leads into a room adjoining his bar. I delivered the scissars, stockings, and shirt to Morris. No person claimed the last pair of scissars. I found copper upon both of them.</p>

I went to bed about half-past twelve o'clock on the 26th of January, and got up at half-past six, came down and found the stone bottle removed, and the cork taken out-it was empty, it was not empty the overnight. There were three pints of gin in a green bottle gone; I missed a pair of scissars out of the kitchen, which I had seen safe the overnight; I also missed a pair of worsted stockings off the horse by the kitchen fire, and a quartern loaf off the table in the kitchen, it was there the night before I am sure, I missed it about ten minutes after I came down; six tiles were removed from the washhouse roof, over the water butt, there appeared room enough for a man to get through, the laths were cut at one end and broken at the other, I am sure it was safe the overnight. The wash-house joins my dwelling-house, the tap-room door comes into it; there is a street behind the wash-house, a person could get to the top of the washhouse from the back street, the roof is about seven feet from the ground. Stephens looked at it with me afterwards. I saw my things on the Monday after the Saturday that I was robbed. I saw a pair of stockings and a pair of scissars, they are my property. I knew the scissars as well as the stockings. I found my green bottle under the water butt, the gin was in it; I am sure it was in my bar when I went to bed. I also lost a candle and some farthings, which were in a till in the bar, which I keep on purpose for them.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any lambs on the 28th of January. - A. Yes, I had seventeen.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them last. - A. On the 29th of January last, I saw them about ten o'clock in the day. I missed them on Friday the 30th of January, about ten or eleven o'clock; one was six weeks old, and this, I think, was about five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you put any ochre marks on them. - A. I had; the ram lambs were red upon the head, and the ewe lambs upon the head and loins. They were both ewe lambs that I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of any suspicion that you had, go to Groves's house. - A. I went to Groves's house on Monday morning about ten o'clock; Groves lives at Mill Hill, it is within two miles of my house. I only saw the woman when I went into the house. I saw two lambs dash out of the cupboard, one of my two lambs were behind them; as soon as I saw it, I knew them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What lamb was that. - A. An ewe lamb, that I took to Hatton Garden. I put it to its mother, and the mother took it, they both maa'd together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark to it. - A. The same as this, it was marked on the head and loins.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was one of your lambs. - A. I know it is; because I put it to suckle to a blind sheep, its mother. The mother knew it directly, they both bleated together as soon as I put it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else at Groves's house. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Groves there. - A. No, he was not there. I went and fetched Mr. Stratton; the gardener shewed us where he was loading of hay. That was the Monday following after he stole the lambs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same Monday that you found the lambs. A. Yes, the same Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what you took him for. - A. Yes. He wanted to know what we wanted him for; we told him it was for stealing of lambs. He said he had no lambs but what he had bought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of any information take Groves into custody. - A. Yes, we took Groves into custody; Groves told us where this black-legged lamb was.</p>
               <p>Q. Before any thing was said by Groves, did not you say you did not want to hurt him. - A. Not before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of information search Groves's house again. - A. Yes. I found a young lamb that belonged to Mr. Shepherd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other lamb there. - A. No, this was in the cupboard that we had missed when we looked there. We went to Holmes's at Highgate hill, and there we met the father-in-law and his wife; Holmes was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told Holmes it would be better for him to confess. - A. No, not then. His wife came and said, if you can settle it, Mr. Mallard, I will tell you where the black-legged ram is, she says, if you will let Holmes go and make it up, and not hurt him. I said, very likely I may.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what she said, did you find the lamb. - A. I went home with the woman; she pulled it from underneath the bed, the flesh was warm, it was black in the fore legs, and it had the ochre mark on the back and loins. I am sure it is my lamb.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Should you have been sure of it, if you had not been told by the woman. - A. As for the blind ewe's lamb, I should have known it if I had been turned into it blindfold.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the day that you searched Holmes's house. - A. On Monday, about nine o'clock on the same day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. These lambs were not of an age to sell in the market. - A. No, they were not of age to take away from the mother; they were not old enough to sell in the market.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did the prisoners live to one another. A. They lived close together, both houses joined.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Camden-cottages—On Tuesday, 19th Jan., I saw the prisoner pass my wharf, carrying a copper—when he had got a little way I went behind him, and asked him where he had got it from—he told me he brought it from his father's buildings—I told him I knew better—I suspected the prisoner, and told him to come along with me—he said he would—he put the copper down, and ran away—I ran and caught him—I brought him back, and took him and the copper to the counting-house—I sent for the policeman—the prisoner told him he had found the copper.</p>

I live at No. 13, Sussex-terrace, Camden-town, and am a milkman—I have the care of the house No. 12 there—I saw a copper there all right on the 18th of Jan.—I cannot swear that this is the same copper that was there—this copper was fitted in the brickwork—I never had any mark on the copper—I never used it—the policeman can speak as to how it fitted.</p>

I live at No. 42, Easton-street, Clerkenwell, the house No 12, Sussex-terrace, belongs to Mr. Francis Arandale, of Brighton—I know nothing of this copper, but I saw the copper there on the 29th Dec.—the copper, and the bells. And leaden pipes were all perfect—the copper was set in work—I have seen the work since—I cannot say whether this copper came out of that vacancy—a copper was taken out, but I cannot say this is the copper—I have no mark on it.</p>

I went on the following night to ascertain if this copper came out of that vacancy—it fitted in quite well—I judged the copper had been in there before, by the black mark on the copper where the fluc had been—the bolts fitted in.</p>

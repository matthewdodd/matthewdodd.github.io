                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Upon its being afterwards examined by an assayer the proportion of gold was found to be so small that the chain was said to be worth no more than</hi> 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">workmanship included.</hi>,</p>

                  </hi> inquired whether there was any evidence if know ledge on the part of the defendant. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi> did not consider that sufficient; if any one was to blame it was the master; it had been held in Rex v. Bower, that exposure for sale where the article was sold by the shopman was exposure by the master; and that seemed precisely this case; besides, here there was no active pretence by the defendant, the prosecutor was the person seeking the purchase, and this was in his opinion the distinction between this case and others, which were referred to by Mr. Parry in argument.</p>

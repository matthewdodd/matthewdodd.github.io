                  </hi>. I keep the Prince William Henry public-house, Bermondsey Street, and on 26th June about 12 o'clock I was the last person to go to bed, and saw the house safely shut—I fastened and barred the front door—the prisoner is a fellmonger, and was secretary to a society which met in my house, and he was often there—he was there on 26th June till near the time I shut up—I went to bed soon after 12 o'clock, and was roused by the police just after 3 a.m., and told the front door was open—I found standing close to the door ready to be taken away a picture, "Ramsgate Sands," which had been hanging up in the public parlour; another picture of Constantinople had gone altogether, which ad been hanging in the room where the society's meetings were held—I also missed a decanter of port wine, eleven half ounces of tobacco, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, and a small money-box—they were all safe when I went to bed—the value of the goods was from 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I examined the premises and found some one had come through the public parlour window, which was left open—the fastening was defective, but it had been closed—nobody could get into the back yard except through the house—these articles produced are all mine.</p>

I was on duty in Bermondsey Street at 3 a.m on 27th June, and saw the prisoner carrying this picture, "Constantinople"—he knocked at the door of a coffee-shop, and I stopped him, and said "How did you come by that?"—he said "I am a picture dealer, and have been going about trying to sell it since 9 o'clock last night"—I asked where he lived, and first he said New Church Street, Jamaica Row, and afterwards at a coffee-shop—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him eleven half ounces of tobacco, a pocket-book, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. silver, and a penny, two pawn-tickets, a key, and this bowl—I searched his lodgings, 153, Bermondsey Street, and found a tankard of port wine and two bottles of shrub.</p>

                  </hi>. I am wife of John Russell, of 153, Bermondsey Street, coffee-shop, and prisoner came there on 21st June, and slept there four nights—on the morning of the 27th he knocked at the door and I let him in—he said he had some bottles of colours, and asked me to take them—I said "No; put them down," and he put them down—I was in my night-dress with a waterproof round me—I did not look at them—I saw the policeman search his room—the prisoner had take them from there and put them down in my room—the goods I saw on him were those the policeman has.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a veterinary surgeon, and live at Lay ton, in Essex. On 25th June, about 12 o'clock in the day, I was out in my pony chaise, at Forest-gate, in the parish of West Ham—I tied my pony up to the iron gates of a gentleman's premises, within two yards of some cottages; it is a much frequented road, there are houses on each side of the gates—I returned in about a quarter of an hour, and missed the horse and chaise—I walked to Layton, which is about two miles, and then drove to Woodford, which is three miles, in another vehicle, then to Leytonstone, and then to Wanstead, where I found the prisoner in the chaise with two officers—I had given information to the police.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 78). I received information, and went on horseback to the Green Man, at Leytonstone, and got there between I and 2 o'clock, and saw the prisoner driving a pony in a gig at a furious rate, of eight or ten miles an hour; but just before I got up to him he was going slower, about four miles an hour—I do not suppose he knew I was following him—as the pony got tired I got up to him, but he drove as fast as he could, and as long as he could—I called to a party who is not here to stop him, and he did so—I took him in charge, and took him back to Mr. Skelton—Forest-gate is not more than two miles from where I stopped him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Surgeon of Newgate</hi>). I have seen the prisoner from the time of his committal—he is of a flighty disposition decidedly—he is in an unsettled condition; a flighty state—from the conversation I have had with him I think he thought he was doing a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—he would not admit any wilful taking of the horse and chaise—I think he is capable of distinguishing between right and wrong.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had come out of Ilford gaol that morning, there were two or three horses and carts round the gaol; I did not know what they were there for: I took a walk round Forest-gate, and had a pint of beer and a screw of tobacco; I saw the horse and chaise, and took a fancy to have a ride; I had a ride round the forest in the horse and chaise, a man came up and followed me, and I said, "You had better get up and have a ride," two policemen got in alongside of me, took me to the station house, and I was taken to Ilford gaol and committed for trial.</p>

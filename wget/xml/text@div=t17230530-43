             depos'd, That hearing his Neighbour Ransum's Wound would prove mortal, he went to the Savoy, to get the Prisoner's Name; and there asking how he could be so barbarous as to strike the Man with the Butt End of his Musket. The Prisoner answered him, he did not strike him with the Butt-End, but with the Barrel. And Mr. Johnson depos'd, That he talking with him as to the Provocation given him, the Prisoner said, the Deceased press'd hard upon him in his Rank, and gave him a Wipe over his Cheek with his Fingers. Mr. Harris the Surgeon depos'd, That he being with the Deceased about twelve a-Clock, he was speechless, and he found a large Wound on the right Side of his Head, three Inches long, and his Skull broken. That he made a Crucial Incision to discharge the Blood, while he got Instruments proper to trepan him, which he did about two Hours after and the Piece of the Skull he took out was broken, and he found about an Ounce and 2 Quarter of Blood, from the Blood Vessels of the Meninges of the Brain, which were broken , and that there was no Pulsation of the Brain. That the Man died about Nine a Clock that Night, and the Wound was the Cause of his Death. Several Neighbours spoke to the Deceased's Character, that he was a very good humour'd, peaceable, and quiet Man, and one whose Death was very much lamented by his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172305300008"></xptr> Neighbours. This being the Substance of the Evidence for the King, the Prisoner said in this Defence, That the Deceased jostled him against the Wall, and said, What a Stir is here with King George's Soldiers? and that he never stir'd out of his Rank, and did not strike the Deceased with the Butt End but the Barrel of his Musket: And he call'd the following Evidences.

             depos'd, That as they were marching from the Prince's Guard, the Soldier shoving against the Deceased, he gave him a back Wipe with his Hand, and the Soldier knock'd him down, not with the Butt-End, but with the Barrel of his Gon, and the Deceased fell between his Feet; and gave this Reason, that it was with the Muzzle End of his Piece, because the Ram-Rod was broken.

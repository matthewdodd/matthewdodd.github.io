On the 17th of December, in the evening, about half past six, I was in my back parlour, I heard the shop door open by the ring of the bell; the door I fastened by a common lock-latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a door that any one might open by turning the latch outside - A. Just so. I heard the bell ring, I came out of the parlour; I saw the prisoners, and the door was open; one of them asked for a yard of fustian. I went towards the door; I thought some one had run away. When I returned I fastened both the prisoners in the shop. I called for assistance from the back premises. My man came. I asked what laid in the window, nearest the door; my foreman said, he had laid a great coat; there was no great coat there. I charged the watch with them for taking the coat, and they were taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SENIOR. Q. Did you work for Mr. Stacey - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the night when the prisoners were taken - A. Yes; on that morning I put a great coat in the window. I saw the coat in the window half an hour before the prisoners came in; in the evening I was called from the back premises, and when I came in the shop the coat was gone; no one had been in the shop that evening. No person could open the shop door without the bell ringing.</p>

            . Q. On the 17th of December did you see the prisoners, or either of them, in your neighbourhood - A. I saw them about two minutes before Mr. Stacey took them in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you see - A. I saw three. I saw them two prisoners at Mr. Stacey's; they were loitering about two doors from Mr. Stacey. I heard one of them say, move; that attracted my attention, therefore I suspected them; I proceeded a little further, and returned back, and then Mr. Stacey had got two of them in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Reynolds. Do you know me to be one of them three persons - A. It was too dark to distinguish your features, by your dress I think you were.</p>
               <p>Reynolds's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, suspicion only has brought me here; I had given a coat to a tailor near my prosecutor to turn. I was directed there to purchase fustian for the pockets; the door was open a small space. On my entrance a bell rang; I asked for what I wanted; a man ran to the door; he returned, and said he would give us pepper; he said he lost a black coat and waistcoat, these however were found, and whether he has since found the great coat he best knows. I never attempted to run away.</p>
               <p>Shirley's Defence. I knew nothing of the property I am charged with; I went into the prosecutor's after a man that owed my brother for soaling and repairing a pair of boots, which he had obtained without paying for them; when the light came I found he was not the man.</p>

                  </hi> I am single, and live in New-street, Deptford. On Monday night, 12th May, I was at the Centurion public-house, and on return<lb></lb>ing, between twelve and one o'clock, down High-street, the prisoner overtook me—I had known him before, by sight—this is the seventh time he has served me in this way—he did not say anything, but kicked me—I turned round to see who it was, and he struck me several times in the face with his fist—I asked him what he did it for, when he kicked me again—I fell, and in falling he took my shawl from my back; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I asked him for it several times—he said he would not give it me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 191). I heard a disturbance, went to the spot, and found the prosecutrix lying on the ground, apparently insensible, supported by Fairway, and the prisoner standing close by—on the prosecutrix recovering herself in about ten minutes, she told me she had been very much ill-used, and her shawl taken from her by the prisoner, and she asked him for it—he refused to give it her—I requested him to deliver it up to her—he refused, and on the charge being pressed by the prosecutrix, I took him into custody—at the station I found the shawl secreted in his bosom—the prose<lb></lb>cutrix seemed very much hurt—there was blood on her face—she was perfectly sober, and so was the prisoner—he is a labourer, and a very troublesome character—nothing was said to explain what this was about.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read</hi>)—"I did knock the young woman down, but not to steal the shawl—a young woman gave the shawl to me."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence</hi> That is true—a young woman gave it me, and I put it in my bosom—the policeman asked me for it, and I refused giving it him, because I have known her for the last three years, and I was in the habit of going with her, and have been in a private place by herself.</p>

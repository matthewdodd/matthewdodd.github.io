I gave Mr. Bellshaw a two-pound note, and he put down a one-pound note in change, and the rest in silver. The prisoner was quite close to me, and all on a sudden I missed my purse and the note; and the prisoner had then gone into the market: I went and asked her if she had seen it, and she denied it. I went for an officer, and he searched her; he found it for me, but I do not know whether he took it from her person.</p>

The woman abused the prisoner for saying she gave it to her, and the prisoner said, you know you have it. I then searched this woman, and found the note concealed in the top of one of her stockings.

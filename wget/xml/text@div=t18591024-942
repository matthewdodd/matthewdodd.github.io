               <p>—we have been married nearly 21 years—on 23d September last, about 2 o'clock, I was up in my own room; my husband came home at that time; he called me names when he came in—he had been drinking—he then took hold of a table-knife, which he got out of a drawer, and said he would run it in my inside—he attempted to do so—I screamed out, and the old lady down stairs came up and made me go out of the room—I went into her room, down stairs, for an hour—about 3 o'clock I went up stairs again, thinking his passion might be over, but he began in the same way—I then went down again into the shop to another person, where I was ironing—while I was there I heard a noise up in my husband's room, as if he was breaking my things—I went up stairs to the room, the door was locked—I asked him what he was breaking up the things for, and asked him to open the door—he opened the door, and I took the rail of a chair that he had broken, and struck him—he then took the leg of the chair and beat me on my arm and fingers and cut my head open—I bled very much—I screamed for the old lady to fetch an officer, and an officer came—I was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I was attended upon by a surgeon—these wounds were inflicted by my husband with the leg of the chair.</p>

                  </hi>. On 23d September I was one of the house surgeons of St. Bartholomew's Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought there—I examined her; she had a lacerated wound on the scalp, and a dislocation of the last joint of the forefinger of the right hand—I also found a fracture of one of the bones near the left wrist—there were no bruises—such an in<lb></lb>strument as this would produce the wound on the head—I can't say whether it would produce the wound on the wrist; that might be produced by a fall—I left her on 3d October; she was under my care till that time.</p>

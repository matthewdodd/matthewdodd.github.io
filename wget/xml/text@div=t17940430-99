The very Saturday evening that these things were found, I received five shillings from my mistress and three shillings I had in my pocket, I purposed going after them, and I had not power when I was asked for them on Saturday night; on Sunday I was asked for them again, and was abused very much, I could not get them, I then went out to see if I could redeem the things, but I could not.</p>

            . I am brother to John Larke. I was left in charge of the shop on Sunday, the 5th of July; I had suspicion something would happen, and placed myself in the kitchen with Mr. Archer - my brother had fastened the shop door before he went out; I heard a voice in the parlour say, "It is all right; bolt the door;" I ran into the parlour, and the first person I met was Smith - I collared him, and took the canvas bag with the money out of his hand; I do not know where the bag was taken from - I had not seen it; I held Smith, and led him to the door - the street-keeper then came; we took him to the watch-house, with the bag, which was examined there, and the copper found in it; Smith had also a paper in his hand, with money in it - I had not seen that paper before; I took it to the watch-house with the bag; I did not see any body else in the parlour, but I saw a man running through the shop - Archer ran after him; when I collared Smith, he tried to put his hand into his pocket - he made several attempts to get from me; I examined, and found in his pocket four skeleton-keys - I tried one of them to the shop door, and it opened it; when I got Smith out he tried to get out of my hands, but finding me the strongest, he became quiet; I did not see the face of the one who ran through the shop - three more skeleton keys were taken from Smith's pocket at the watch-house.</p>

            . On Sunday, the 5th of July, I was left in care of the shop; I was in the kitchen with Thomas Larke: I went into the parlour, and saw Smith there - I had heard him say, "Bolt the door;" I immediately went into the shop, and saw Saunders up close to the door, looking towards me - he was inside the shop, about two feet from the door; as soon as he saw me he turned round, opened the door, and run out - I followed him for more than half a mile; I did not overtake him myself - he was taken; I lost sight of him six or seven times when he was turning the corners, and when I turned I saw him still running; the shop shutters were closed, but there was a fan-light over the door - I had an opportunity of seeing his face when it was turned towards me, and have no doubt of his person whatever; I was very near him when he was taken - he turned the corner of a street which was no thoroughfare, and when I saw him again he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.From the time you first saw him till he ran out, how long might it be? A. About a minute; I did not see him till I got into the parlour - he was not more than a minute in my view in the shop, and during part of that minute I was looking at Larke and Smith; there was a light from the fan-light, which is about two feet by three - it has no bars to darken it; there was also a light from the parlour into the shop - I do not think I saw him for more than a minute; my attention was directed to the shop immediately I came out of the kitchen door - I did not meet many persons as I pursued - there were a great many people in Whitechapel-road, but not in the back streets; none of them joined in the pursuit, till at last I cried Stop thief! and about half a dozen persons followed - some were behind me, and some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160022"></xptr>before; they ran before me, and two of them caught him - he was searched at the watch-house, and two common small knives were found on him.</p>

             was among them; when he got opposite my door, my wife cried out to him, "There is no thoroughfare;" he then turned the corner of Buttress-street, and did not go any further in that direction - he seemed very much exhausted, and threw himself against the wall, and at that time threw down this crow-bar into the kennel; I picked it up, and have had it ever since, except for half an hour, when the officer came to me - I am positive it is the same; he then delivered himself to two men, and was taken away - Archer followed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What do you mean by delivering himself? A.He threw himself against a wall completely exhausted, and when he saw the two men he went in between them, and gave himself up: I might be fifty or sixty yards off - I live about half a mile from Larke's; he was coming apparently in a direction from there - there might be twenty persons running; ours is a populous street - I had been at my door, in and out, some time; I did not go inside from the time I heard the cry of Stop thief! till I saw him deliver himself up - I took particular notice of a mark at the end of the instrument.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did Archer come by your house? A. No; he was in Underwood-street when I saw him; he would lose sight of him at the place he was taken - I could see that place from my door, but Archer could not; he was running about forty yards behind.</p>

             re-examined. When I went out in the afternoon, I locked the shop door; the shop window was quite secure - there was no other means of getting to the shop without opening the door; the door had been unlocked two Sundays before, and that caused my suspicion; I fastened the shop window on the Saturday night - all the back of the house was well secured: I had fastened it myself - besides the money in the bag, I had some money in a paper - it turned out to be 6 1/2d. at the watch-house; when I saw it opened I knew it to be the same paper - it was left in the same cupboard with the bag; it was produced to me by my brother, with the bag, and was safe in the cupboard on the Saturday.PTHOMAS LARKE.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you been talking to any body about the evidence you were to give? A. No - I have not talked to my father about it, I am sure- I only told him of it when it broke out that I had done it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason you took the three sovereigns out of the till, for the prisoner? A. He had a summons - I began to rob my father three months ago; he flogged me about nine months ago, but that was my own money - that is since Christmas; it was my own money I had spent - my father thought it was his; I spent 1d. at a time; my father afterwards questioned the servant, and found I had drawn it from him; I had money given me by several people - my father said I had stolen his money, but never said how much; he accused me of stealing silver, but he flogged me after I had spent 1d. of my own; I have not spent half a crown at a time in peaches or fruit - I know Burt, a fruiterer, next door to the Eagle tavern, City-road- I did spend money with him two years ago, which I had taken; I do not recollect his threatening to inquire of my father how I got it - I will not swear he did not; I know I left off dealing with him, but cannot say it was about that- I stole all the money I laid out with him; I have given him a shilling at a time, but do not recollect a half-crown; I will not swear I did not show him one.</p>

            . I am a journeyman baker. About a month or five weeks ago, I met Swainson in the street, and had a conversation with him; I afterwards saw the prisoner, and told him Swainson said that he (Smith) had robbed him of two sovereigns - Smith said a great many people had been telling him about that, and if he heard any more about it he would spoil him; I asked what he meant- he said the money Swainson had, he had had from young

            ; he said he (Swainson) had a summons against young Harnor, about some fowls, and that the amount summons was 10l.; he said he had seen the summons, and William Harnor was to pay the money, or the officer would fetch him in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not young Harnor deny to you that he had ever given money to Smith or Swainson? A. He did.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. On the 18th of June I apprehended Smith and Swainson at the corner of the City-road - as I took them to the watch-house Smith said."I know nothing of any summons; I cannot write or read; but you have not got all - there are more in it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you have been to Newgate since the prisoner has been there? A. Yes - I only asked him when he last came out of prison.</p>

               <p>of the prisoner—he laid hold of me, threw me down, kicked me on the mouth, the back, and the legs, and abused me—I afterwards found that I was wounded on the left hand, it bled a great deal, and I was under the surgeon's care nearly a week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I examined the prosecutor's wounds; they were incised wounds, and must have been cut by some sharp instr-ument—they could not have been done by his falling down on a stone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Essex-place, Blackheath-hill. I recollect the night of this disturbance—there was something between us and the landlord of the public-house—the first officer that came up was West-brook—lie came up when the landlord called "Police," and laid hold of Norris, and chucked him down seven or eight times—that was before Norn's bad committed any violence—Norris had no knife, and I think it was impossible for him to have one—Cottington then came up, and they both had hold of Norris's arms, and chucked him down seven or eight times—I went and said to the policemen, "You ought to be ashamed of yourselves—you ought to take him quietly"—there were flint stones down by there—I was taken, and fined 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the oath of Westbrook, for trying to rescue.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Dowling-street, Dept-ford. I was with Norris that night—when Westbrook first came up he seized Norris and threw him down several times—Norris had not then committed any violence on him—we were all sober—I had been to my club—I said, "Do not ill-use that man, if you are going to take him, take him in a fair way"—as soon as I said that, I was knocked down—I do not know by who, but I expect by a policeman—Norris then said to me, "Mind my hat"—it was knocked off and lost.</p>

On the 4th of this month, coming down stairs in the morning to open the street door, I saw the prisoner sitting in the tap room; I opened the door and took down the shutters, then he walked out; I looked after him, having a suspicion that he had robbed me; I saw a large bundle concealed under his coat behind him; he turned up a court, and attempted to make water; he came out, there was another court, he went into that court and tried to make water; I said my friend come back and pay for your lodging; he said I will pay you before twelve o'clock; I insisted upon his coming back; he came back and sat down in the tap room; my servant said the man has got a bundle behind him; I said I know he has, I will search him; I went to him, I said what have you got here; he says a small bundle, it is my own; he would not produce it; I took it away, I found it to be feathers; he said he bought them. I got him secured while I went for an officer; the officer came and went up stairs and examined the bed; we found the corner of the bed had been cut open and partly sewed up again; before he came to lodge in the room the room was perfectly clean, and after this was done the room was covered with feathers; the officer and I examined the feathers, the feathers proved to be the same in his bag as was in my bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. You do not mean to swear to the feathers. - A. To the quality.</p>
               <p>Q. There are ten thousand feathers alike. - A. The feathers in the bed were exactly like the feathers in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Court. What business was the prisoner. - A. I never asked him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was it that you came down and saw him coming out. - A. A little before seven in the morning; the bundle was concealed under his coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He saw no feathers at all, it is all spite against me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

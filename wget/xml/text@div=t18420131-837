                  </hi>. I keep the Goat's-head public-house in the Wands<lb></lb>worth-road—the prisoner was my cook for about three months. On going into my cellar on the 11th of January, I discovered a quantity of gin on the floor under a vat, and found the key of that vat on the top of an ad<lb></lb>joining vat, with the handle wet, as if just laid down by a wet hand—I went into the kitchen, and found two bottles of gin in the meat-screen—I placed them in the same situation in which I found them, and with Trim<lb></lb>mings, my son-in-law, retired into a little dairy adjoining the kitchen, to watch—Trimmings got on a chair, so as to look over the top of the door, where there is a blind—in a short time the prisoner came into the kitchen, opened the door of the meat-screen, took out the two bottles of gin, placed them under her apron, and was about to take them out of the kitchen-door into the yard—she went across the kitchen to go out—I then came out of the dairy, stopped her at the door, and said, "Mary, these two bottles of gin belong to me"—I took them from her, sent for a policeman, and she was taken into custody—her room was searched, but nothing of mine found.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Alfred-place, Battersea. On 22nd Aug., at twenty-five minutes before five in the morning, I left my room to go to work, leaving in the table-drawer two bags containing the money stated—I double locked the door—I returned about eight in the evening, and my money was gone, also some bread and butter and sugar—I have known the prisoner from her infancy—she was born in the same yard, but was never in my room—one of my half-crowns had a mark on it by which I know it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I told the policeman the mark that was on it before I ex<lb></lb>amined it (<hi rend="italic">pointing out the mark</hi>)—the staple of the door had been forced away, as if by a chisel.</p>

             sworn. - I keep a shop in Monmouth-street: Five weeks ago last Monday, the prisoner came in to buy a bed-gown of me; she said the must sell the gown she had on; she asked me three shillings for it; she pulled it off, and I gave her my bed-gown, which was one shilling and sixpence, and one shilling and sixpence more in money; she came again last Tuesday to sell a bedgown not made up; I told her I did not think it was her own; I did not recollect her till she had got out at the door, and then I followed her, and took her into custody; I delivered up this gown, and paid her half-a-guinea besides; the gentlemen at Bow-street said I must do it, to pay her for her trouble, or else I must go to prison; and I borrowed half a guinea in Court.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Parker.) Where are the stays? - A. I have left them at home; I am sure they are mine; I am sure this gown is my own; she herself at Bow-street said that she had got my stays on, and pulled them off.</p>

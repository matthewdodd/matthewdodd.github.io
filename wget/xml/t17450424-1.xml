               <p>Charity Young. I am servant to Mr. Kirby , I used the spoon the 17th of March at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I looked for it at 9 o'clock at night, and it was gone. I suspected it was taken away by a black man who came accidentally that day, and dined with a fellow servant of mine.</p>

             came to me the 18th of March last, and brought a silver spoon to sell. I asked him how he came by it; he said his master gave it to him: said I, you have a very good master, what is your master's name, he said, Colonel

            : I asked him where he lived, he said by Red Lion Square in Holborn. I sent a person to enquire, and he told me there was no such person lived there: I said, friend you have certainly stole this spoon, so I took him into custody, and then he owned he stole it from Esq; Kirby's; it was broke then as it is now.</p>
               <p>- a Black. I am servant to Mr. Kirby, I have known the prisoner 20 years, he came over from Antegoa at the same time as I came over with my master; I asked him to dine with me, and it is a very hard thing if a man asks a person to eat a bit of victuals, that he must steal a silver spoon. I had a great deal of anger about it, for I have all my master's plate under my care. <rs id="t17450424-1-verdict5" type="verdictDescription">

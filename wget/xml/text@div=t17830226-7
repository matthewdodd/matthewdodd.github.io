               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Phillips, the brewer; on the 14th of September last, about eight in the evening, as I was going between the Ship and Sun Tavern Fields, being a vacant space, where there are no houses; I heard in Stepney Fields a most melancholy cry of Murder! murder! O do not kill me! I hesitated a few minutes what to do; I looked round and saw no person, I ran down the lane alone; but considering it would be dangerous and foolhardy, I ran back again, and I went into the Ship for assistance, I saw no person in the tap room, but I called out, For God's sake, is there nobody in the house, I believe there is a woman murdering in the fields; I heard some voices in the other room, there were three men smoaking their pipes; they followed me: here I must observe, my Lord, that when they got out of the door, the cry of murder was over, and the men heard nothing of it, and when they had got about half way through the lane, they returned; I begged them to follow me; near the bottom of the lane, I met the prisoner and one Thompson, they attempted to shun me by going close up the bank, this immediately made me suspect them; I collared Thompson with my right hand, and with my left I pushed the prisoner against the bank; in this situation the people behind came up; I observed something under his right arm, and put my hand to it, one of the other persons did the same, it was a woman's gown; he then began to make resistance, and attempted to get away, but we overpowered him, and with some difficulty got him into the Ship; there he was secured; then I begged somebody to go with me and look after the woman, we found the woman without her gown, her apron off, and her breast open.</p>

               <p>As for the gown, I had been at work on the Saturday, and had received my wages, and I found the gown in the pathway; it was dark, and I put my foot against the gown, and it had like to have thrown me down; I have no witnesses.</p>

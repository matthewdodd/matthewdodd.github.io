            , Mrs. Clayton, Clayton's daughter, the prisoner, and I, were all dining together - the prisoner sat at the head of the table, and said, "Why don't you take your victuals?" I said, "When they have all done I will take mine;" she then jumped up, went down stairs, and sang two songs to herself - she then ran up, and said, "If you please Thomas come down stairs for five minutes, for I want to speak to you;" she repeated this fifty or a hundred times - and at last, with a good deal of persuasion, I went down into the room; I saw her pull a pen-knife out of her bosom and open it - she seemed in a great passion, and I caught hold of her wrist, and took the knife from her - I shut it and gave it to Mrs. Poole. Mrs. Poole said, "See how the blood runs!" I did not know till then that I was cut - I then found I was wounded in my right hand; I did not take the knife from her till I found the blood running, and cannot say whether she meant to injure me or herself; she had said nothing to me - she said she was very sorry for it, that she did not mean it for me, but for herself - she had been jealous of me for some time. <rs id="t18270712-40-verdict231" type="verdictDescription">

            ; we live in the same house: on the 18th of December, about one in the morning, I was disturbed out of my sleep by knocking and ringing; I saw a parcel of people in the street from the window, and understood my shop was broke open.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - I found a pane of glass broke, one shutter down, two hanging, and five or six candlesticks gone off the window.</p>
               <p>How was it broke, by wrenching the shutters down of the shop? - One quite down, two more hanging.</p>
               <p>It must require a degree of force to do this? - It must be force.</p>
               <p>Have you a locking-bar that goes across? - Yes, there is a bar that goes across, and these shutters had no bearing upon that bar, so they slipt it down, and broke the glass, and stripped the shelf as far on each side as they could reach.</p>
               <p>Was there more than one pane broke? - No more than one.</p>
               <p>What was taken out? - About seven pair of candlesticks; I cannot exactly say; there may be five or six pair of brass candlesticks, and a Prince's-metal candlestick, which is brass and copper with the metal; I inquired if they had taken any body; they said Mr. Hill, the constable, had taken one.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the shutters that night? - I did not go outside, but I had seen that it was safe.</p>
               <p>Was a pane of glass broke? - No; the pane of glass was whole.</p>
               <p>What hour was it you saw it last? - About ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>The window was not broke at ten o'clock, and the shutters to all appearance were up clear and right? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the shutters could not fall by accident? - They could not.</p>
               <p>You did not observe whether there was any mark of a crow, or any thing that had wrenched it? - I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. I understand your partner's name is Macgauran, hath no one got any share in the business besides? - None.</p>
               <p>You live in the house? - There are two houses, one lease; the one I live in, and he lives in the other.</p>
               <p>Are your houses so circumstanced, that only one house has an opening into the shop? - Both have it; there is a party-wall between both houses, but there is an entrance from each house into the shop.</p>
               <p>Do you pay your rent separately? - No, we do not.</p>
               <p>Where was Mr. Macgauran at that time? - He sometimes sleeps at a lodging he has in the country; he has not good health.</p>
               <p>Who arranged the goods in the window that day? - I do not know that any were put in that day; but they are cleaned once a week, and when there is a pair sold, they are replaced.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120048"></xptr>Will you take upon yourself to say, that there were candlesticks in the reach of this pane of glass? - There certainly were.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Macgauran's servants sleep in that part of the house? - Yes, they do.</p>
               <p>He sometimes sleeps in the country, and sometimes in town there? - Yes, he does.</p>

               <p>Did you observe whether the shutters were forced by a crow or chissel? - I did not examine the shutters after I had got him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you search this lad? - Yes, at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>You found no crow, or any thing of that sort? - No.</p>
               <p>You said you saw the shutter taken out, and put on the ground; you did not see this man do it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>There was some person gone by that excited your suspicion? - There was.</p>
               <p>You did not see the window broke? - I did not.</p>
               <p>This man was taking the opportunity of that circumstance, of the window being down, and the glass being broke? - He was, certainly.</p>
               <p>You did not find any instrument about him that would enable him to do this? - I did not.</p>

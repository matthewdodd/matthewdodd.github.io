                  <hi rend="largeCaps">GIDEON CROCKER</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, C</hi> 9). On 29th June, I was on duty in Rupert Street, St. James's, about midnight, I saw three men coming up Oxendon Street together, Jones and Griffiths are two of them—Jones fell rather behind the other two, and went to the door of No. 33, Oxenden Street—he put one hand at the top, and the other at the bottom of the door, and forced it, as if testing whether it was bolted or not—Griffiths and the other man walked to the corner of Coventry Street, turned round on their heels, and looked round—Jones then joined them, and went back to the side door of No. 27, Coventry Street, which is in Oxenden Street, and is Mr. Stocker's, where he did the same to the door—I crossed over, Griffiths and the other man walked away, and Jones followed close behind—I said to Jones, "What did you do at that door in Oxendon Street?" he said, "Me?" I said, "Yes;" he said, "I was not at any door in Oxenden Street"—the other two separated, one went into a public house, and Griffiths stepped off the kerb into the carriage way, I then observed something under his coat, under his arm—I went up to him, touched his coat, and said, "What have you got here?" he said, "I have got a bag"—I said, "What are you going to do with a bag at this time of night?" he said, "I am going to take it home"—I took it from under his coat, and it was this sack (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I touched him on the breast pocket, and heard the <hi rend="italic">jink</hi> of a key—I said, "What</p>

               <p>have you got here?" he said, "That is my latch key"—I put my hand into his pocket, and took out these nine keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), two of which are skeletons, two door keys, and a common box key—Jones was then walking off in the direction of Princes Street, and I called on Joy, a policeman, to seize him—the man who went into the public house I believe to be Tarry, by his dress and appearance, but am not positive—I went to the station with the prisoners—Griffiths said that he was a locksmith, which was the reason he had the keys—I asked him whose employ he was in, or where he served his time; he said, "Oh, I picked it up"—I asked his address, he said, "No. 9, Wilson Street, Long Acre"—I went there, but there was no such number—Jones gave his address No. 6, Duke's Court, I went there and ascertained that Jones and Griffiths are brothers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jones. Q.</hi> You say that I tried two doors; how was I to do it with nothing about me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was nothing on you, but close to where you were apprehended three or four skeleton keys were found.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 338). I took Jones—I can swear to Griffiths also—I saw them with a third person, whom I believe to be Tarry—I took Tarry, about 1 o'clock in the morning, at the corner of Cranbourne Street—I told him I took him for being concerned, with two others, in attempting to enter a house in Oxendon Street—he said, that he had not been in Oxendon Street during the night; he had been in Coventry Street, and had just left a public house, at the corner of Princes Street and Coventry Street, that is a public house into which I saw the third person go—he said, that he had not been in any man's company the whole evening, only a female's—when I took Jones, he had passed a door where some keys were afterwards found.</p>

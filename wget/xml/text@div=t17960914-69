               <p>Q. Have you any mark at all upon it? - A. There is no mark upon it, but it is doubled in three; I am confident it is the handkerchief.</p>


               <p>Q. There are many muslin handkerchiefs like it? - A. No doubt of it; when it was pinned up, it was doubled in three at one corner, the corner that is pinned up; the pin went through the three doubles.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a common way I suppose, if it was not doubled it would tear; the doubling makes it stronger? - A. Yes.</p>

On the 14th of July, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was going to Whitechapel-market, and had to pass through <placeName id="t18260914-74-crimeloc446">Fleet-street-hill</placeName>

When I had passed them ten or twelve yards I heard a voice say, "Here goes the bl - y beadle;" I then thought I was in danger, and walked on quickly, but presently I felt a quantity of stones, dirt, and mud, coming from behind me; they were thrown at me. I turned round a corner, where I was obliged to turn, and turned shortly round to see if I knew any of the men who were throwing the stones, and saw the prisoner Robinson very active in throwing stones - I staid for a little while. and six persons came from the rest - both the prisoners were among those six; King came and said to me, "I say they say you legged some of our chaps;" I understand legging means transporting, or convicting for different crimes; I am not certain whether they said chaps or palls - I made no answer; King then came and tapped me on the shoulder, looked quite close at me, and said,"Have you got any money for us?" I said, "None for you;" Robinson was close at his elbow; King said,"We shall soon have it all you b - r" - as soon as the words were out of his mouth he knocked me down with something which he held in his hand (it is a thing called a dumb-bell - a lump of lead with a nob at each end); an effusion of blood came running down the front of my face; I have the mark across my nose, and shall carry it to the grave; I did not fall from the blow, but stooped down, being in extreme pain, but sensible. I stooped down to let the blood run from me, and the pain was so great I put my hand to my face - I immediately felt King with his hand in my right-hand waistcoat pocket, where I had three half-crowns; this was while I was stooping - some of the half-crowns were out of my pocket directly; a kind of tussle took place between Robinson and King, and some of the money fell on the stones - I heard it jingle, and saw Robinson with some silver in his hand, but whether that was mine or not I cannot say - he said, "Look at this, you b - r?" he opened his hand, and I saw some half-crowns in it; I said, "What have I done to deserve this punishment?" they said, "That is the chap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140057"></xptr>that has legged some of our coves" - both the prisoners said so - they left me and dispersed. The whole six were round while this took place; I know the other four, but have not seen them since - I should know them again; I knew both the prisoners as well as I know myself - I had seen them several times. When they left me several inhabitants came round - I spoke to a woman, who is not here, first; I described their persons. King was taken next day, and Robinson the day after, but I did not see him till several days - as sure as I stand here they are the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see a person named Wood after this happened? A. Yes - I applied to him for some vinegar a few minutes after - I did not know him before; I pointed out to him, and others two persons who were running - they were not a great distance from me. I am not a Jew. I mentioned to Wood about losing money - I swear that I complained of being both robbed and ill-used. I was rather afraid, having no one to assist me; I was in a state of fear, but not so much as to make a mistake in their persons. Robinson threw stones at me - King gave me the blows; his hand was in my pocket - I generally keep silver in my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after his hand was in your pocket did you see Robinson? A. Not a minute; it was between six and seven o'clock, for when I was crossing Hare-street-fields I heard the clock strike six. I know Robinson's brother, but cannot say whether I saw him there, or spoke to him; I saw several persons, and spoke to them - I noticed particularly who the persons were who I spoke to; I should know the persons I spoke to if I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to any person that you had not been robbed, only ill-used? A. I did not - I said to several"What I have lost is of no value, but I do not like to be ill-used" - 7s. 6d. is of value to me, but I would rather lose three times that than be ill-used. I was asked if I was robbed while Wood was gone for the vinegar, but did not say I had not been robbed; I told some of them I had only lost three-half-crowns - I do not know Denower, an undertaker, not by name; nor Tow or Low; these persons might have met me in the street after I was robbed. I told every body I had been robbed - I always said I was robbed of three half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Are you a foreigner? A. A native of Saxony; I always spoke of being robbed; Norris was the first person I desired to assist me in apprehending them; it was about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour after I left Hare-street-fields - it was about twenty minutes past six o'clock.</p>

            . I am inspector of the dismounted patrol. My district is about Bethnal-green. I saw Myerson about nine o'clock on this night - I was on duty with a party of men, to prevent bullock hunting; Myerson had a cut across the nose and the cheek bone, and his eye greatly swollen, in a shocking state; I could hardly see whether he had an eye - it had been washed with vinegar - he described the persons to me; I apprehended both the prisoners from his description. I took King the next night in brick-lane, coming up Spicer-street, about twelve o'clock- I took Robinson on the Thursday morning following, it of bed at his mother's house. I knew them from Myerson's account - he saw King in the watch-house the same night as I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to Robinson's mother's before? A. No - he was in bed; I had a difficulty to get in, being pelted with bricks and stones by a mob.</p>

            . I live in Ram-alley, Fleet-street, Bethnal-green. I am a weaver, but at the time this happened I kept a coal-shed in Weaver-street. After the prosecutor was robbed he came up to me - I went to the public-house close by, got a halfpenny-worth of vinegar and brought it to him in a basin - the side of his face was cut - it did not appear swollen then - I was standing at my gate when he came up to me; just before he came up I saw two young men run by - he pointed them out to me- just after he got off the ground he said, "See how I have been ill-used by them young rascals, or them young villains;" I will not be certain which.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said that did he point to anybody? A. He put his arms out. I have known Robinson nearly two years, and used to see him frequently - I know both the prisoners; I am positive the men he pointed out were neither of them. I never heard him say a word of being robbed, nor did he inquire for an officer or anybody, to assist in apprehending them - he said he had been ill-used by them villains or rascals, and that he had done nothing to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Were you the only person by at the time? A. Another young man stood talking to me in the yard at the time they ran by - that was Abraham Robinson, the prisoner's brother; we both went out after these young men, to see what they were running after. Robinson is not related to me - I have known his family two years, and he has worked for a master whom I worked for; I had not seen John Robinson that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Mind what you are about? A. I saw him that afternoon come home to his mother's house, just after this happened, about ten minutes after the affair happened - that was as near five o'clock as could be; I stood at my gate at that time - his mother lives close on the spot where it happened, not a dozen yards from where the beadle was ill-used - it was near five o'clock, to the best of my recollection; I had not seen King that afternoon, I am certain-I was in Weaver-street that day, backwards and forwards about my business - I saw nobody gambling there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Robinson send to you to come to the Old<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140058"></xptr>Bailey? A. About a fornight ago - his brother Tom came to me, not Abraham; he did not send to me before that. I did not go before the Magistrate - I was never before one in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Myerson, in company with either of the prisoner's brothers, to offer him 10l. to throw out this bill before the Grand Jury? A. No, I did not; I went to him before the prisoners' second hearing - the mother asked me to be kind enough to go down - Thomas Robinson went with me; I went to tell him I thought him under wrong notions - he had taken up the wrong parties; I told him so, and that is all. I did not offer him 10l. to get the bill thrown out - no such thing was mentioned - I will swear the offer was not made by either me or the prisoner's brother; I never heard it made by anybody. I merely went out of friendship to the old woman, she being a neighbour.</p>

            . I am the prisoner Robinson's eldest brother. I am a weaver, but now keep a green-grocer's shop. I was with Wood in his coal-shed when this happened; we went out to the end of the yard, to the gate, together, and saw two persons running, and then saw Myerson picking his hat up; I did not hear him say any thing; he was twenty or thirty yards from me - neither of the prisoner are either of the two persons who were running - I did not see them in the street. Myerson made up to Wood, and while Wood was gone for the vinegar I asked him what they had been doing to him; he said he had been terribly ill-used; I asked if he knew either of them - he said No - he said he knew one who was in his shirt sleeves. I asked if he had been robbed; he said No, he was not robbed, but terribly ill-used, and he asked no one to assist to take them.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Where is your brother Tom? A. Outside.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this? A. What day? it was about five o'clock in the afternoon - I think it was on Thursday, between four and five o'clock; I had come from my home to Mr. Wood's - I lived in King-street, Spitalfields then; I have moved since; I was going to see my mother, but, Wood being an acquaintance, I called in to see him first. I saw nobody about gambling in the way I came - I came into Weaver-street; I did not come over Fleet-street-hill - I was not holyday-making - I had but little work, and my wife looks after that. When I left Wood's I went home to my own house; I stopped at Wood's three quarters of an hour, and it might be seven o'clock when I got home - I was not in Wood's company all that time; I sometimes chop wood for him; I was in the yard, but he was not with me; his wife and children might be there for what I know. I had seen nobody gambling that afternoon, nor had been with any - I never keep such company - I swear I had not; I did not know Myerson, the beadle, then; I did not know he was a beadle for six or seven days after. I went with my brother Tom to Myerson's, to ask him about the case - it might be six or seven days after, but I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to go? A. I went of my own free will, to ask him how he meant to manage the case, and acquaint him he had got the wrong person; I never mentioned a word about bribing him to throw out the bill, nor did my brother - I swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. As you did not see Myerson robbed, why did you go to tell him he had got the wrong men? A. Because I knew it was not the two people he had taken whom I saw run away.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Do you speak of time as far as you recollect? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>LEWIS MYERSON re-examined. Wood is the person who brought me the vinegar, but I did not see this man there.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoners were in custody did any body come to make you an offer? A. Yes, Wood, Abraham Robinson, and a third man; they came and asked if I was Myerson, and if I was beadle of the Episcopal-chapel; they asked if I would go and take any thing to drink; I thanked them, and said I would rather not; Wood said,"Now, you know me?" I said "Yes, I know you are the person who brought me the vinegar;" he said "Yes, now you know the proverb, 'If one hand washes the other, they will both be clean;" "Yes," said I, "but give me an explanation thereof;" he said, "Now, it is a serious case of this young man - you have got a family, and so have I, and I am an acquaintance of this person's, and you don't know what your children may come to." -</p>
               <p>Q. Without stating all this did they offer you any bribe of 10l., by any means you could, to throw out the bill? - A. They did - ten sovereigns. I mentioned nothing about shirt sleeves when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Who was present when any thing was said about ten sovereigns? A. My wife was at the door, but did not hear it; they came three times - Wood and a person not here came the first time, Abraham Robinson came the second, with Wood, and the third time they came to the chapel on a Wednesday - Wood came then with another person; it was only the second time that Wood and Abraham Robinson came together; there was another man standing a dozen yards or so off.</p>
               <p>Q. Now where was this? A. At my house, one evening - I think about three weeks after the prisoners were apprehended - ten sovereigns was mentioned when they were both present. I have heard them both deny this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any offer made to you the first time? A. Ten sovereigns, if I would make a flaw in the indictment, and throw it out - they said the second time 10l. was at my service - they had before said sovereigns, and at the chapel they offered me ten sovereigns, and some thing handsome besides. I knew the prisoners by name before the robbery, and I mentioned their names to the officers when I described them.</p>

            . I am an undertaker, and live at No. 18, Princes-street, Mile-end New-town. I was passing at the time the prosecutor was ill-used, and saw the persons who ill-used him - I was about one hundred yards off, and could see perfectly the persons who did - I am confident neither of the prisoners were present - I have known them from their cradles.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. As they did not do it, perhaps you can tell who did? A. No - I do not know the two, but can safely say it was not the prisoners, although the two men who did it ran by me; I should know them if I saw them; I was afraid they would serve me the same if I stopped them; I was going up to help Myerson, but be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140059"></xptr>fore I could reach him they came running by me - I only saw two - I know Robinson's mother; I did not see her that evening. I happened to call on her two or three days after he was taken; I heard they were taken, and of course, thought it my duty to right them as well as I could; I did not ask when they were to be examined, being an undertaker I am so much engaged; they had been examined when I was at Robinson's mother's; I do not know what day they were taken up, but think it was Saturday; I cannot say whether they had had their last examination. I told her I would come here with the greatest pleasure; I did not go before the Justice. I was going, on the 14th of July, to my brother's, about a bill he was answerable for - he lives in Fox-street, Pott-street, Bethnal-green-road - his name is Elias Denower - it is above half a mile from Fleet-street-hill, but that is the nearest way to it; I was endeavouring to get to my brother's about five o'clock; I went through Weaver-street - I saw nobody playing at cards or tossing; there were a few people at the top, but only two were near Myerson - I only saw two near him - they both had long coats on - neither of them was in his shirt sleeves. I saw Wood give Myerson some vinegar - I saw nobody go into Mrs. Robinson's house - if Robinson had turned into his mother's house while I was there, I must have seen him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you go on to your brother's? A. Yes. As I went along I saw Robinson talking with a young man at his own house - that, of course, convinced me that it was not him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know who that young man was? A. Yes, Robert Wilkinson - it was at Wilkinson's uncle's house.</p>

               <p>Q. Two persons were ill-using Myerson - how far off were any other persons? A. Sixty and seventy yards - at the top of the street; only these two were about him - there was no other person within sixty or seventy yards of him at the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far was Wood's house from him? - A. As near as I can guess sixty or seventy yards; it was done opposite Mrs. Robinson's door - they were both taken when I heard of it - they had had their hearing; I did not notice the date - it was the second or third day after they were taken that I heard of it; I cannot say how long it was after it happened - I cannot say whether it was a week or ten days after.</p>

            . My uncle lives on Fleet-street-hill - his name is Burdett. I was inside my uncle's room on this day; I heard a great noise, and came out to ask what it was - I did not see it begin, but I saw a mob at the corner of Weaver-street, and while I stood there Robinson came up to me from quite a different way - he was coming towards the crowd; he came to me as I stood at the door; I asked how he was, and if he had any work, and then he asked me what was the matter at the corner of the street - I advised him to stop with me till the crowd was gone away; he did so, and then went home.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Did you see the man ill-used? A. No. I know Denower, and saw him pass my uncle's door, going towards where Mrs. Robinson lived - he was ear the house, but had to turn a corner before he could to her door.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if the man was robbed opposite Mrs. Robinson's door he could not see it? A. He might see it after he turned the corner; he could not see her door when I saw him, but could directly he turned the corner. I am a weaver, and work for Mr. Huxtable - I live in Church-street; I was holyday-making that afternoon; nobody was with me - I had just come from home. After seeing Denower I went into my uncle's; I left Robinson to go home - it was on Friday, the 14th of July. I do not know when the prisoners were examined; I did not attend as a witness - I said I would attend here; I should have gone if I had been asked. I never saw Myerson before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you say you would come here? A. About three weeks ago - it was after the examination; I do not know where Wood lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Wood when the prosecutor was there? A. Yes - he asked for a little vinegar, and Wood got it - the vinegar was there when I first went up; the prosecutor was asked if he had been robbed, and replied, No; he complained of being ill-used; I have known Robinson from his cradle, and always heard a good character of him; king was a carpenter, and has a good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. In what employ was Robinson when he was apprehended? A. A weaver; he manufactured lusterings for his brother, at his brother's house, which is a quarter of a mile from his mother's; I have seen King working at his father's; the prosecutor was ten or twelve yards from Mrs. Robinson's door, on the opposite side.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw it going on? A. I was going by at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know Robinson was taken up on a charge of robbery, six months ago? A. I know nothing of it - it was not for robbery; I did hear he was taken up, but what for I did not hear, whether it was for interrupting any body in the street, or what - I never asked.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see him at large afterwards? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ROBINSON. I was taken for assulting Wood, and officer.</p>
               <p>COURT to NORRIS. Q. What time on Friday evening did the prosecutor describe the persons to you? A. As near nine o'clock as possible - he gave me both their names; I did not know where they lived - I found out where Robinson's mother lived on Tuesday, but understood he never lived at home, and did not go to disturb his mother till Thursday, at half-past six o'clock in the morning, when I took him; King had been taken before the Magistrates on Monday, when I took him, and both were finally committed on the following Monday.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave King a good character.</p>

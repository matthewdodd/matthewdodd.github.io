The prisoner came there on the 18th of June; he went into the cigarshop for three cigars, which came to 2d. each - he gave me a half-crown, which I put into the till, and gave him change; there was no other half-crown in the till - he came again between two and three o'clock for half an ounce of Oronoko tobacco, which came to 3d.; he then gave me this other half-crown - I knew him again, and instead of taking the half-crown which he brought then, I went round and shut the door and sent one of the waiters for an officer - I had before that discovered that the first half-crown was bad; Mr. Ries had opened the till, and said it was bad, and showed it to me - I wrapt it up in paper, and put it into the till again - when the officer came, I gave him both the half-crowns - the prisoner first came between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

I saw the bad half-crown in the till - the witness wrapped it in paper, and put it in the till again - I was there when the next half-crown was brought in, I sent for the officer and gave him the two half-crowns - I believe I had seen the prisoner there in the morning, but cannot swear to him.</p>

               <p>JOHN UNDERHILL. I am a <rs id="t18250407-22-viclabel114" type="occupation">schoolmaster</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18250407-22-victim213 t18250407-22-viclabel114"></join>, and live in South Molton-street. I left home about nine o'clock in the evening, on the 21st of February - the prisoner and another female, took hold of my arms in <placeName id="t18250407-22-crimeloc115">Oxford-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18250407-22-crimeloc115" type="placeName" value="Oxford-street"></interp>

I went down a short distance and at the corner of a court she pointed out two houses, each of them having a light in the passage - she asked if I would go to one of them, and said they were very respectable; I told her if that was her business I had nothing more to do with her; she still kept hold of my arm, and endeavoured to persuade me to go. I told her she need use no arguments, as I would have nothing to do with her. I turned round to go away, and she clasped her arms round my waist and begged I would excuse her - I then walked a few paces away, she still walking by my side - she then called some female by name, and I perceived her put her hand over my shoulder to that female - I put my hand to my breeches pocket and found my purse and money were gone; I have never got it again; I then took hold of the prisoner and said</p>
               <p>"You have picked my pocket;" she said</p>
               <p>"Oh, you naughty man, how can you say so? - I have not any thing about me." I said</p>
               <p>"If you have not, the person to whom you just now handed something, most likely has." She then stooped down, as if to look on the ground, and then ran away - I pursued her - she dodged me through several courts and got into Oxford-street, crossed over and fell down, but she got up and ran down Mary-le-bone-lane; I called Watch! several times - I could have taken her but did not know that I had a right.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were afraid to touch her at all without an officer? A. Yes - I was going to Mary-le-bone-street to supper. It was the tone of distress that she assumed which took my attention - I had no suspicion of what she was - she put her two arms round my waist - she was before me, and her two hands were behind my back - it was immediately after that I missed my purse. It was in Woodstock-street that she asked me to go into the house; we had not spoken together in Oxford-street; the other person went from me in a great hurry, but I did not miss my purse till after the prisoner put her arms round me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not told this young woman again and again that you had not a farthing of money about you? A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you no suspicion of what she was? A. No, not in the least - I was perfectly sober.</p>

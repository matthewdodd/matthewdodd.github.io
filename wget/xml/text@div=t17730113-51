            . I am a ticket porter: I ply at the corner of Castle-alley by the Exchange. On the latter end of last November, about the 27th, about three in the afternoon, a person came to me, and asked me if I was a ticket porter; he handled my ticket, and said, can you read? I said, yes; he asked me whether I knew Mr. Child's shop; he then put a 40 l. note into my hand, and bid me go and get the money for it and bring it back and leave it at Hazard's lottery office; I was told by a friend, I was not safe in leaving it there; the person that directed me to leave it there, not being there to receive it, but it was better for me to go and fetch it back; I went in an hour and a half after, and fetched it back: as I saw nothing of the person that gave me the note; I kept it at the stand till eight o'clock that night, and then took it home with me; the next morning, at a quarter or half after nine, I was crossing the way, and the person was enquiring for me; he spoke to one Farmer; he had forgot my name, and asked for Parker instead of Palmer; at last seeing me, he asked me if I had carried a draft for him, I said, yes, and left the money at Hazard's office expecting him there, but not finding him, I had kept the money for him, and I would go to the office and pay the money to him; I went to the office, and there gave it to him; he asked me what would satis'y me for taking the note; he said I had had more trouble than usual, and asked me if 5 s. would satisfy me; I said 5 s. would; (The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177301130031"></xptr> note shown him) I know that to be the note by a blot on the four, and I made a remark on the name

               <p>Palmer. I have not; I am poor sighted; I saw the person four times, but having lost one eye, and having very bad sight, I could not make such observation upon the person, at the time I saw him, as would give me such idea of his person as would enable me on recollection to swear he is the man; I am rather inclined to believe him to be the man: the appearance of the prisoner corresponds with the appearance of the man: I cannot with safety swear he is the person.</p>

I have known the prisoner from an infant; he is a very modest ingenious young man; he always behaved exceeding well; he lived at home; he has lived the life of a recluse till within these last few months, and great pains has been taken with his education, and he has made a good use of it till this affair; I believe he is a very good scholar.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. There is some alteration; he had his hair powdered and was paler than he is now; he is altered in his hair, his colour, and his cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you always declare that? I am as tender as any body on cases of this sort: did not you swear positively to the knowledge of this young man?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I did believe him to be the person at Sir John's, but his colour, hair and cloaths are altered that I cannot swear to him.</p>

               <p>Tracelove. I did believe it then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe him to be so now?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I cannot in my conscience be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your opinion there?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. It was my opinion then that he was the person, his cloaths, and his hair, was different, and powdered then, which makes a great alteration.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a doubt?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I told them I believed him to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you express any doubt at Mr. Child's shop?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I told them I believed him to be the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak of any doubt then?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person you apprehended at the coffee-house the person you saw afterwards?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I do not know he was any more than I heard say so.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not at the coffee house?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the person you saw afterwards you cannot say was the same as you saw the time before?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I believed him then to be the person but cannot positively say he is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him the day after he was apprehended?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. Yes, the self-same day.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your opinion?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I told them I believed him to be the person that gave me the draught.</p>
               <p>Q. Your doubt is with regard to his appearance now not then?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. With regard to his appearance now.</p>
               <p>Q. You porter for any body with regard to carrying draughts?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. The last draught I had was the 30th of December; I called at the Chapter Coffee-house, and a person, that I took to be the person that I saw at Sir

            's, and then they let me go with a bag of halfpence to Anderton's coffee-house; after they had detained me for some time, the master of the Coffee-house said he knew me to be an honest man; then they thought it proper for me to go to Tobit's Dog again, in case I should be sent for by the person that gave me the draught, and desired me not to go out of the way all the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go that day?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I did a job for Mr. Johnson, a bookseller; I staid in the way all the afternoon as they desired me; one of Justice Fielding's people came to me, and asked me several questions, and I thought it most prudent to go to the Coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before the magistrate?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I went with Sir John's man to the Crown, Mr. Montague's, a public house in an alley in Ludgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present there?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. Only Justice Fielding's clerk and I; I cannot tell his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Shall you know him again when you see him?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you declare to that man?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I told him as near as I could the description of him.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Strictly speaking the conversation is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Very true; what pased next?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I went to the Tobit's Dog, and from thence home. I went on a little job; when I returned, they told me at the Tobit's Dog that the man was taken: I went to Sir John's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to Sir John?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I told him I believed him to be the person at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do you know the person that gave you the draught at the coffee-house?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. Not in my conscience and heart: I would not say it for all the world.</p>

               <p>Tracelove. I told them I believed the person I had seen at Sir John's to be the person.</p>

               <p>Q. It puts me under the disageeable necessity of appearing cruel when I mean just the reverse: What did you say on Saturday night?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I told them to the best of my knowledge I believed him to be the person; I did not sa positive: I will not speak against my conscience for the world; I neither desire see nor reward.</p>

               <p>Warmhall. I was not sent, but there were people sent from the house to Anderton's Coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of day?</p>
               <p>Warmhall. To the best of my recollection between twelve and one; I understood the porter to say he came from the Chapter Coffee-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you are sure that the order was brought you by Tracelove the porter.</p>
               <p>Edgar. I am certain of it, because here is the mark upon the back of it, that I am sure of it by; it was not made by me.</p>

               <p>Wormhall. The principle reason for my stopping the porter was the name

               <p>Q. You have been saying the reason why you swear so positively to this draught was because you took particular notice of the name

               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Price. I believe he is the person that came to the coffee-house on the 31st of December in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning?</p>
               <p>Price. I believe between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he apply himself to?</p>
               <p>Price. He applied to the bar; Mrs. Price was in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what he said?</p>
               <p>Price. No; the waiter called me; when I came down, the words to the best of my recollection were, pray sir, is there any money left here for me?</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt the prisoner is the person?</p>
               <p>Price. To the best of my judgment I believe it is the same person, but I will not take upon me positively to swear he is, one may be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that person apprehended at your house?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes, he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that man that took him into custody?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes; when I see him; the man took hold of him, and said you are my prisoner, sir; the note is a forged note. The man searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. What said he?</p>
               <p>Price. The man attempted to put his hands across him; he said he need not be rude with him, he would go with him. I heard him ask him to send for Mr. Nedham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to the charge?</p>
               <p>Price. I do not recollect that he said any thing more; they sent for a coach and the man and he went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. He desired him to send for Mr. Nedham?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes; the person said it was improper to send for him there, he might send for him at Sir John's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the name Nedham been mentioned before that?</p>
               <p>Price. Not that I heard of.</p>

               <p>Price. Yes, I believe he is the person; the person who was there asked to send for Mr. Nedham.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Do you know what he said to him upon which he desired Mr. Nedham might be sent for; what expressions were made use of just before?</p>
               <p>Price. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the discourse between at the time the prisoner desired Mr. Nedham might be sent for?</p>
               <p>Price. He said that to the man who took him?</p>
               <p>Q. What that discourse was you cannot tell?</p>

            's clerk, in the evening between eight and nine o'clock; I believe on the 30th of December, to Anderton's coffee-house; I waited till past twelve at night; nobody came that I saw to apply for any thing; I went back in the morning, betwen nine and ten, the prisoner came and said something to the waiter; Mr. Price was sent for; he came down stairs in some few minutes; when he came down I went up pretty close to them to hear what passed between them; I heard them say something about money; I said young man you are my prisoner; that note is a forged note; I was going to tie his hands; he said behave civil I will go with you; I sent the porter for a coach; he wanted to send for Mr. Nedham; who Mr. Nedham was I did not know; I did not know it was forged in Mr. Nedham's name: the coach came; I took him into custody, and took him up to Sir John's; I called at Mr. Child's shop to tell them I had him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it you took to Sir John's?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find about him?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. Only a pocket book (producing it) an ass skin book in it; there was a little bit of writing, I believe of no consequence; there is nothing in the pocket book that relates to this.</p>
               <p>Q. to Tracelove. Look at that pocket book?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. The person that gave me the draught gave it me out of such a pocket book as this.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. This is a common almanack case; I suppose you have seen a 100 of them in a stationer's shop?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I do not believe that to be the same pocket book; I said so before the Justice, because I saw an ivory leaf in that, which is not in this.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. It is not very usual for a person that forged a draught to send for the person in whose name it was forged.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. There is nothing meant in this prosecution but public justice; if you force me to it, I can give a very sufficient answer to that.</p>

               <p>Burt. I know between the christian and sir name he always makes a dot and a dash.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular?</p>
               <p>Burt. The s is turned different from what Mr. Nedham does in joining the N; this is turned round to the right, Mr. Nedham turns it over and joins it to the end.</p>

               <p>Q. You have often seen Mr. Nedham write?</p>
               <p>Burt. Yes; I have seen him write his name upon the backs of briefs, and he signs his name there the same as when he signs pleadings or the bottom of letters.</p>
               <p>Q. You are no way acquainted with Mr. Nedham's hand writing but from a knowledge of his signing briefs and pleadings: don't you know most gentlemen sign briefs and pleadings in a different manner from what they do in common writing when they sign securities; I know I do; it is the only way of security, when a gentleman writes his name so many hundred times; I believe people are not pretty accurate when they write their names on pleadings.</p>

               <p>Q. What are the differences that strike you?</p>
               <p>Strong. The joining of the s to the N; it is turned down instead of over, as Mr. Nedham always writes.</p>
               <p>Q. What judgment do you form of that as to its being Mr. Nedham's hand or no?</p>
               <p>Strong. The letters seem to be cut different, particularly the N, and I think there is a variance as to the T.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you seen him subscribe his name to?</p>

               <p>Strong. I generally write one way, I do not know what other gentlemen may do.</p>
               <p>Q. This draught seems to me to be the whole of one hand writing.</p>
               <p>Strong. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Wormhall. Have you seen Mr. Nedham write?</p>
               <p>Wormhall. Yes; I saw him write his name in our book when he first opened an account with us. (Produces the book.)</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was that wrote?</p>
               <p>Wormhall. Three or four months I believe; when he first opened account with us.</p>

               <p>Strong. Mr. Nedham pointed out a case that was not his drawing.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you see me now write, not having seen me write before, and never see the paper after, would you venture to think you had acquired such a judgment and knowledge of my writing as to be able to know it afterwards?</p>
               <p>Strong. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Since the peace you have been pretty much at home?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Yes, since the year 1763.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the young man at the bar?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. About eighteen years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. He must have been at that time about eight or nine?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. From that time to the present what has been his general character?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. His general character has been irreproachable; he is a very sober, virtuous young man, never out of the house: I was amazed to hear this of him at Portsmouth, where I have a ship, upon which I came up to town</p>

               <p>Q. He has been well educated?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was pretty much at home with his father?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Always at home; I never knew him go out without leave; he was never absent above two or three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. He always acted dutifully to his father?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And has had a good education?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. His father has the misfortune to be blind, and this young man has always been his amanuensis, read and writ to him.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was much at home?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Always at home.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a clergyman?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Jekyll?</p>
               <p>Davis. About five or six years in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his general character?</p>
               <p>Davis. A very honest-sober good sort of a lad as can be: I have known his father twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to be pretty much at home?</p>
               <p>Davis. Always at home with his father.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a dutiful young man?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes, and very diligent and sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of any complaint or crime or misbehaviour?</p>
               <p>Davis. Never in the least.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Jekyll. I have known him from his infancy.</p>
               <p>Q. You are related to his father?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his behaviour?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Always a very decent dutiful boy.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he been from school?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. I do not recollect; he has been very diligent and dutiful, very attentive to his books, and I have seen a great many of his own observations in manuscript.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep at home and close with his father?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. He always kept with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear till the present charge the least imputation in the world upon this young man's character?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. What character does the young man bear?</p>
               <p>French. As good a character as ever I heard of a young man in all my life, ever since I knew him till within these four or five months; I knew him from a month old; he always bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. You say a good character till within these four or five months: I believe he has been in the country with his father for some time?</p>

            , but I will not be positive. Grandi says you have robbed me, he addressed himself to Broad, and the stick was thrown down again by Broad, they kept scuffling (Broad and Grandi) till they got into the middle of the street; I remained on the pavement, I turned round and saw Nardi by my side, he was on the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. And can you swear that at that moment Grandi and Broad were in the middle of the street scuffling. - A. I can; Nardi had a bundle in his left hand, he had a mixture coloured coat on, his hat was decorated with feathers, and an election bill of Paul stuck in his hat, and the drawing of Mr. Fox; I think it was done on with ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the prisoners appear to you to be in liquor. - A Nardi did not, Grandi appeared rather so.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you looked at Nardi as he stood by your side on the pavement; what did you observe him do. - A. I observed him put his hand to his side, whether to his breeches, coat, or waistcoat pocket, I cannot say, he put it down low; I see him draw something up, he held it up, I perceived the blade of a naked knife, the other part was covered with his hand, the blade appeared as long as my finger; the crowd had increased, there was a small opening in the crowd, he ran from the pavement into the street, where Broad was fighting with Grandi; I followed him as close as I could. I saw him give the young man a stab two or three times; Broad was in a posture of defence with Grandi.</p>
               <p>Q. When he stabbed at Broad was Broad's face or back towards Nardi. - A. He was what they call half face; I saw Nardi aim at his right arm, that was at that moment extended. I immediately called out he has got a knife; I saw him stab him in the arm, but I could not see him stab him in any other place particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now young man, I would wish you to be very particular in this case as you have described; can you take upon you to say that Broad never struck him. - A. I can take upon me to say that Broad nor any one else struck at him to my knowledge; if Broad had struck him I must have seen it. I called out that he had a knife, and others called out when they saw that he had a knife, and several began to press upon him; he retreated, the people followed him till he came to the other side of the way, to the door of a cheesemonger's shop nearly opposite of the sadler's, and there I got close up to him. I seized his right arm, he changed the knife from his right hand into his left hand, where the bundle was; (he had the bundle in his hand all the while). A young man caught hold of the other arm, he passed the knife totally away, and I saw nothing of it. He went into the cheese-monger's shop. I and the young man got him back in the shop; somebody came to the door and said secure the man, the young man is stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Grandi then. - A. He was out of the door. The master of the shop was rather alarmed seeing us all press in at the moment, the prisoner Nardi was at liberty; then he pulled off his coat as he sat upon some butter tubs or cheeses, doubled it up and put it between his legs, and he pulled off a light waistcoat, and stuffed it in the bundle. Somebody after that came and said the man is a dying, I will go and fetch an officer from Bow-street. The officer came in a little time; silence was called, I took the coat from between his legs, and gave it to one of the officers; there was another officer which took his bundle, they searched the coat pockets and found two knives, they tied his hands and conveyed him to Bow street; when Nardi came into the outer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030026"></xptr> office they untied his hands, he folded his arms; one of the officers asked him which was the knife that he had done it with, the prisoner pointed to the one with the green handle, it was a clasped knife; we went before the magistrate; then he was secured.</p>

               <p>Q. This you say was on the 5th of November. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And one of the days of the Westminster election. - A. Yes, and very near Covent Garden.</p>

               <p>Q. He had a box under his arm. - A. I did not see that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing a silver medal about his breast. - A. I saw that.</p>
               <p>Q. His dress and appearance was very odd, and the mob were jeering of him, were not they. - A. I never heard any one speak only the words I have told his lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. Broad began speaking to him as if he was a woman. - A. He asked him if he was a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. After Broad took the stick from him - you believe it was Broad that took the stick from him, but you are not sure - they were fighting with their fists A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. When Nardi came out and said if you do not be gone, I will shoot you, had he any fire arms. - A. He put his hand to his side, I never saw any, he had a small whip.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you saw Nardi take out the knife your particular attention was taken to Broad and Grandi. A. I was particularly looking at them.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you were particularly looking at them, you do not mean to speak with accuracy what was done by Nardi, you had not been watching Nardi till you returned and saw him that moment. A. Not till I saw him at that moment.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, living in Abingdon street. On the night of the 5th of November, I was going down Long Acre between seven and eight in the evening, I observed the prisoner Grandi fantastically dressed, with flowers and feathers in his hat, and a sergeant's sash across his shoulder, he had a common mop stick in his hand and something like a medal hanging at his button hole; presently another, dressed in the same fantastical manner (Nardi) passed me, and passed Grandi, he went into a sadler's shop, I was pretty close upon his heels, I stopped a moment and looked into the shop, I saw Nardi in the shop with a paper with the name of Paul printed on it on his hat, and an election bill of Paul in his hand; I believe I was the only person looking in the shop at the time, I believe Grandi was then standing at the shop door; Grandi said to me you had better go about your business, or else the gentleman in the shop when he comes out perhaps will hit you a thump of the head; I immediately made answer it is devilish civil, and then walked off; I went to Gardener's worm shop, I think it is the next door to the sadler's, I looked in the worm shop window for a minute or two; when I turned my head towards the sadler's I observed several people, there might be nine or ten people, collected about Grandi, I think I heard somebody say, are you a woman; but I was so far I will not swear to it, when Grandi called out loud something in Italian, or I supposed it to be so, it was in a foreign language; when Nardi came to the door and said, G - d d - n you all, what the devil are you all about, my brother is a soldier, I am a soldier, will you enlist; he came down the steps, and a scuffle ensued I could not then see what they were doing, I was the outermost person. I heard a voice in the crowd say, you are a thief, you stole my stick; I believe the whole of the crowd was on the pavement at that time, because I heard the stick fall upon the pavement. I kept aloof from the crowd, I could not particularly say where Nardi or Grandi was; upon the opening of the crowd I saw a young man fall, by whom he was knocked down I cannot say, this was in the high street. The scuffle continued again, when the crowd opened completely; I saw the prisoner Nardi, he knocked the young man down again.</p>
               <p>Q. The same young man. - A. I suppose it to be so, Nardi struck him a back-handed blow and struck him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you perceive at that moment any body else engaged fighting with this young man. - A. I could not; Nardi retreated three or four paces after he knocked him down, I saw him put his right hand into his right hand breeches pocket and take out something, to which he used his left hand to do a something with. Thinking it was a pistol, from his having said he would shoot the man, I retreated still further; when he had done what he wanted with his left hand, he took it up in his right hand and brandished it; conceiving it to be a pistol, my face being towards his back, I could not see what he had in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he retreated back and held something up, was any body pressing upon him or attempting to strike him. - A. Not that I saw. After having brandished this about, he rushed into the crowd almost immediately, I retreated further back, the crowd closed upon him and parted him from me. I then heard a voice cry out, he has got a knife, and the crowd pursued, but from the crowd and the scuffle altogether I cannot say who they pursued, they were altogether then opposite to the cheesemonger's shop; upon following of the crowd into the main street I saw two young men standing, I went up to them, one had hold of his companion, who was tottering this kind of a way (the witness describing it), not standing steady at all, and coming close to him I heard a violent rushing, I thought the man was making water, but hearing him say, Oh my thigh, I thought instantly that he had been wounded in the seminal artery, or what is commonly called the pope's eye; I did not see the wound, the blood was all over his thigh, I conjectured from the noise that I heard that he was wounded in the seminal artery; I immediately seized him firm by the right arm and brushed my finger with force into his groin, in order to brace the artery; in that way, one hand round his arm and the other on his groin, I led him to the light of a shop window, I saw no cut in the breeches in the course of the artery, and therefore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030027"></xptr> seeing the blood run down his fingers, I found that he had a wound in his arm, I took him to a shop in Long Acre, where they refused him admittance, I led him to a surgeon's shop, and he fainted the moment we could get the door open. With my hand firmly pressed upon his artery, I got some one to turn the coat sleeve up, I thought he was cut on the wrist, I observed a cut in his coat. I observed that he had a severe wound just above the bend of the arm, it was completely across the arm, about three inches in length, and the depth was to the bone.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure the artery was cut through. A. Yes, I was sure of that, because I tied it up above the large artery and the regular nerve, it had bled profusely, but I kept my hand upon the artery above it; I suppose he must have bled to death had not I accidentally gone up to him at the time that I did. After I discovered the wound I did the best I possibly could in the way I was placed, I wished him to go to the hospital, I told him I would go with him, I saw him in the coach to go to his uncle's.</p>
               <p>Q. Your care being particularly called to the arm you did not make any observations any where else. A. No, I did not, because the bleeding came from the arm alone; he complained of his thigh, I examined his breeches, I could not see any cut there, it was a pair of striped breeches, and I imagine the knife might go through the cord, being a thin knife; I did not examine particular. Upon passing my finger down his thigh he said it hurt him there, and there were no large blood vessels there, I paid no attention to it.</p>

               <p>Q. I understand you sir, at the time Grandi cried out to Nardi, the mob became to congregate, and Nardi came out and made use of those expressions for the purpose of frightening them away. - A. I could not fancy that the man had any idea of shooting him at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no offensive weapon with him. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the scuffle began before Nardi came down the steps. - A. The whole transaction from the first it began was not more than fifteen minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in Long Acre on the 5th of November last. - A. Yes; about a quarter before eight I was passing along, I saw a mob of people, there might be an hundred or upwards, I saw two men in the attitude of boxing; the prisoner Nardi was one, that was the first I saw, and a young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any blows struck. - A. I saw their hands go on both sides, I saw Nardi's hat knocked off; instantly he retreated across the road on the pavement, I followed him, the people called out take care of him he has got a knife, he has killed the man; there was a quantity of people collected about him, he went into a cheesemonger's shop, he pulled off his coat, I followed him, I says you have killed the man; he sat down upon some cheeses, I says where are your knives, he says I have none; the officer came and searched him, and two knives were found upon him; he said he was in danger of being killed. I said you have stabbed the man, which knife did you do it with. Nardi said that was the knife (pointing to the green handled one) that I did it with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the young man who was boxing with Nardi was the deceased. - A. I cannot say, he had a brown coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Mr. Holt) Could you observe the colour of the man's coat. - A. It was a dark mixture, a kind of Bath coating.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Manley) How long did it appear to you that the person in the brown coat and the prisoner Nardi were fighting with their fists. - A. Not above a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing in Nardi's hand at that time. - A. No, I was on the contrary side, Nardi's face was towards me, and the man that was fighting with him was between us; I saw both their hands go, he might have had a knife in his hand for what I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw their fists going, there was no cry of a knife in the mob at that time. - A. No, some person in the mob said d - n his eyes, give it him, learn him to shoot.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that Nardi's hat was knocked off, did it appear to be done by the man in the brown coat. A. I cannot say, his hat fell, and he lost it for a time; it appeared to have fallen during the scuffle; there was a large mob, and the mob were again Nardi, for what I could see in general, because he made use of that threat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep sight of Nardi from the time that his hat fell off till the time that he went into the cheesemonger's shop. - A. Yes, it was but four or five minutes, there was a great crowd about him, I cannot say whether he gave any more blows after his hat was knocked off.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that Nardi and the man in the brown boat was fighting as you have described, where was Grandi. - A. He was about three or four yards off in the mob, I did not see any violence done to him.</p>

            . I am a cabinet maker. About eight o'clock on the 5th of November in Long Acre, I saw a quantity of people assembled together, there might be fifty, they were just by the cheesemonger's door, some person cried out in the crowd the man has got a knife; then I perceived the prisoner Nardi had a knife in his right hand, he was retreating backwards, and the mob was following of him, I immediately seized him by the right arm with both my hands, his back was towards me, a person in the front of him endeavoured to get the knife from the same hand, he put the knife from his right hand into his left. I did not quit my hold of him till he got into the cheesemonger's shop, I then let him go, and stopped at the door to prevent too much of the crowd going in.</p>

Yes, I saw the prisoner in the sadler's shop, with a paper of Paul on his hat, I believe it was Nardi; this was between seven and eight o'clock. There were about twelve people standing there, I was informed it was something about the election, I went into the shop opposite<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030028"></xptr> where I live. In a minute or two afterwards I heard a great noise, and the cry of shoot him, shoot him, repeatedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the cry of the people in the street, or the cry of the man in the shop. - A. The cry of the people in the street; there was then a scuffle and fight in the crowd, the people then began to gather round our door, the cheesemonger's door, in which I live, I heard the cry he has got a knife repeated, I ran into my own shop and looked through the window, I saw Nardi with a knife in his hand; as he was moving it about some person said take it from him. He came into the shop, whether he was forced to come in to escape the crowd I could not learn. When he was in our shop I saw him shut the knife, I did not see him searched, I was more particular in minding the shop.</p>

            . I am a journeyman coachmaker, I live in Long Acre. On the 5th of November, about eight o'clock, I was standing at the sadler's shop, I saw the deceased and another young man looking in the shop window, the prisoner Grandi was outside of the shop, he told them they had betrer go about their business or the gentleman in the shop would shoot them; Nardi and Grandi were very fantastically dressed with feathers. Nardi came out; and said if they would not go he would shoot them; the deceased said shoot away, one that was with him said shoot and be d - d, then Grandi with a mopstick in his hand pushed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he push him with the mopstick or with his hand. - A. With his hand. The deceased returned it and pushed him again, Grandi then with the stick struck him across the shins, a scuffle ensued between Grandi and the deceased, the deceased endeavoured to get the stick from him, he got it from him and put it of one side; the deceased fell as he got the stick, and I picked him up. Then he went from me to fight with Grandi again, he fell a second time and I picked him up again; he went from me and I lost him for a few minutes in the crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not return to scuffle with Grandi did he. - A. I do not know, I lost him for a few minutes. I saw the prisoner Nardi over the way at a cheesemonger's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any thing of Nardi till you saw him at the cheesemonger's shop. - A. No, not after he left the steps, I heard several cry out take care, he has got a knife in his hand, and several pushed him into the cheesemonger's shop. I picked up the stick that Grandi had; in Bow street I delivered it to one of the officers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. After you saw Grandi fighting with the deceased, you lost the deceased for a few minutes in the crowd. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then the first time that you saw Nardi after that was in the cheesemonger's shop. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. During those few minutes that you lost the deceased among the crowd, there was a scuffling going on among among the crowd. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How long might that time be. - A. Five minutes, perhaps not quite so much.</p>
               <p>- BRIDGEMAN. I am a printer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a relation of the unhappy young man. - A. No, only an acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. You and he were coming along Long Acre on the 5th of November last. - A. Yes, about a quarter before eight. When we came out of Charles street into Long Acre we saw a mob on the opposite side, upon which we immediately went over. We saw the prisoner Grandi, he was dancing with a mopstick in his hand, he struck the deceased across the shins.</p>
               <p>Q. He was dressed whimsical was not he. - A. He and the prisoner Nardi were both very odd dressed, with feathers in their hats.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us take the matter up from the beginning, you say he struck the deceased across the shins, what passed between them. - A. I heard nothing pass from the deceased to Grandi. Grandi hit him across the shins, the deceased said I beg you will desist; then Grandi said I have a friend in the shop, pointing to Nardi, who was in the sadler's shop. Nardi came immediately out of the shop to the door and presented, as I thought, a pistol, and said, I will shoot you. The deceased said shoot, I answered and said, shoot and be d - d; a person standing by said take care, he has got a knife, upon which Grandi seemed rejoiced, and began again to flourish his stick, and danced and struck the deceased the second time across the shins, with that the deceased struck him with his fist.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Nardi then. - A. At the shop door. Nardi then run from the shop door and stabbed him in the scuffle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any scuffle between the deceased and Nardi. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite clear about that. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then according to your account, while the deceased and Grandi were scuffling, Nardi did what. A. Nardi ran and stabbed him in his right thigh. Nardi ran from the door immediately after the scuffle began, I saw only that one blow, the deceased cried out immediately I am wounded in the thigh. Nardi then immediately attempted to run towards Drury lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You were a friend and companion of the deceased. - A. I have known him from the latter end of July or the beginning of 
               <persName id="t18061203-32-person342">August. We</persName>
             were shop-mates.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Grandi was flourishing the stick, was not Grandi accosted by your friend before he struck him, in this way - are you a woman or are you a man. - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not your friend make use of that expression the moment he came up to Grandi. A. I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him take the stick out of Grandi's hand and throw it on the pavement. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear Grandi cry out that he had been robbed of his stick. - A. No, nor did I see the stick in the deceased's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober at this time. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said some time ago, that some man cried out he has got a knife, Grandi you say seemed rejoiced at it; I have taken it down so. It was dark at this time was it not (witness paused); I can see your disposition very well, was it not dark. - A<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030029"></xptr> Almost.</p>
               <p>Q. In the dark you could see the man's countenance, by which joy could be observed. - A. He began to dance.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was fighting between the deceased and Grandi, was there not fighting betwixt Nardi and the deceased. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you see Nardi and the deceased towards each other with their arms extended, as though they were in the act of fighting. - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not see all that passed. - A. I was pretty near them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in court at the time the other witnesses were examined. - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. I am now confining my question to Nardi and the deceased, you say you saw nothing pass between Nardi and the deceased except one blow, did not you see them in the attitude of fighting. - A. I did not, I saw him fighting of Grandi. I have got the deceased's clothes.</p>
               <p>Court. The jury do not want a description of that sort; the surgeon who was examined has described the situation of the deceased. Gentlemen, there is no occasion of distressing ourselves with the sight of bloody clothes.</p>
               <p>- BACON. I am one of the officers of Bow street. On the 5th of November, I, with some other officers, went to the cheesemonger's shop, I there asked who the man was, he was pointed out; he said to me, are you an officer, I told him I was, he got up and came towards me, his coat and hat were off, I told him I must take him into custody, I felt about him, I could find no knife, and to prevent any further mischief I tied his hands. I gave him into my brother officer's hands, I asked some gentlemen in the shop whether there was any more, some gentlemen pointed out Grandi, I took hold of him, he resisted very much, I took a handkerchief to tie his hands, he was very strong and powerful, I could not easily tie him; by the assistance of some gentlemen I took them to Bow street; the knife was afterwards found by

             met Mr. 
               <persName id="t18061203-32-person348">Ramsden</persName>
             the man was dying from weakness.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand that weakness to be occasioned by. - A. By the loss of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt upon that subject. - A. None in the least, and in about an hour afterwards he died, about half past twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine his arm after he died. - A. Yes, the incision of the wound was down to the bone, the main artery was completely divided, and two of the principal nerves were divided likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you, young man, from your observations of all the symptoms, have you any doubt in your own mind that the wound in the arm was the cause of his death. - A. The wound in the arm was the cause of his bleeding, and the bleeding of course was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt upon that subject. - A. None in the least.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the night before he died he bled through the bed, did you find there the next morning that he had bled through the bed on the floor. - A. The sheets had been removed when I came.</p>
               <p>Q. Could all that bleeding have taken place if the artery had been secured. - A. Not if it had been tied above and below, except the ligature had given way.</p>
               <p>Q. If that had been done would not the man have lived. - A. Yes, provided the ligatures had not given way.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean that if the ligatures had not given way, and attention had been paid to him, then you believe the man would have lived. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. On Friday when you came there you believed the artery was divided. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever examine the wound after the man was dead to see whether the artery was divided or not. - A. Of course not, the man's arm going on so well, and he was so much better.</p>

             never saw the wound at all, Mr. Abernethy saw him on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from Wednesday night till the Monday he was left under your care, a young gentleman not out of his time. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Court. The only reason for you not examining the wound to see whether the artery was divided, was you not perceiving any symptom inducing you to believe so, was that your reason. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose if you had examined the wound you might have caused a greater effusion of blood. - A. The man was so faint and weak no bleeding could take place; if I had examined it I should have been obliged to have dressed it up again.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason that you did not. - A. He was dressed and done up properly, of course I did not think it was right to take it off.</p>
               <p>Nardi's Defence. When I came up Long Acre I was quite steady and civil and did not offend any body, I bought a whip and gave five and sixpence for it, there was a great mob about the shop to look at me; when I came out there was five of them, they asked me who I was for, I had a paper sticked in my hat; three Englishmen at a tavern took my hat off my head and put the paper of Paul upon it, I could not read English, so I did not know whether I was for Paul or any body else, and coming out of the shop, I said to the mob if you do not go about your business I will shoot you; directly one of the young men said, I will teach you how to shoot, and struck me very violently on the temples, upon which my eyes struck fire; he gave me a blow on my side, which knocked me down in the gutter in the middle of the street, and there while I was down he gave me a very severe blow in my back, which brought me almost out of my senses.</p>
               <p>Court. Who. - A. I do not know; the blow was rather between my back and my ribs, then I called to my countryman, he was within ten of me, I was almost killed, he did not hear me; one, on my calling my countryman, gave me a severe blow on my brain just within the middle of my scull; when I found I was nearly killed the young man that is dead kept striking me, when I was not able to stand upon my legs. His partner said, you Italian, and used a word of very low expression, I am very glad you have met of your match, we'll teach you to shoot us. Then when I found myself so violently beat that I could not resist it, I unfortunately let the knife out of my coat pocket. The knife that I then cut with belonged to a figure maker, because I never carry a knife in my pocket. I have been twenty four years in this kingdom, I never had a knife in my pocket. When the young man came and gave me a violent blow after I had been struck by several of them, I struck him with the knife towards his hand; then not to hurt any body I ran towards the cheesemonger's shop; the master of the cheesemonger's shop he gave me a push of the back, he said d - n you, go about your business, you shall not stay here, he said that I had pistols, I immediately pulled my coat off and my waistcoat, and throwed it in the middle of the shop, he gave me another push, than I sat down on some of the cheeses, I said if I go out into the mob I shall be killed, I will stay here. In two minutes after some of the officers of Bow street came in, one took me by the collar and shook me very violently, I was as quiet as a lamb, I said nothing to him, he took one of my white handkerchiefs and tied my hands, I did not say a word. From there he took me to Bow street office, and then I was as quiet as a lamb, not saying a word. When the magistrate asked me questions, I told him every thing, as I have your lordship.</p>
               <p>Grandi's Defence. At two o'clock I was in Argyle street, all alone. I went to Mr. Norcot's house, I met with this gentleman, he told me that he was going to get a box containing some wearing apparel, I went with him to a clothes shop in Little Marylebone lane; this gentleman had a feather in his hat, he asked me if I would wear it I should have it, then the gentleman of the shop said, call tomorrow morning, Mr. Nardi, then you and I will settle, you shall have your property; from there we went to Marylebone street, to an image shop, this gentleman began to change his linen; from there he took two bundles of dirty linen. I had a bundle of my own, that consisted of about twenty pound weight of colour, he gave me one of his bundles,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030031"></xptr> and he had one, we went into Greek-street to Mr. Tournallies Mr. Nardi took this mopstick in a joke; he says to me, lay hold of this stick, we were going to a public house, where all the Italians meet together, we came through the market, and we bought some things to go and cook it for dinner; coming up Long Acre some of the people began to say there's two Frenchmen. This gentleman went into a sadler's shop; I staid outside, ten yards from the shop door, a part of the mob came up to me and said who are you, what are you, a man or woman; I spoke to the mob, pray let me alone, I do not want to have any thing to say to any body. I retired myself very quietly with my big bundle, behind the mob, after Mr. Nardi had been attacked by the mob: I was then ten yards from the place. The mob laid hold of me, my great coat was pulled all to pieces, I do not know who it was done by, they gave me a blow and knocked my hat off, I had a quantity of the mob about me, because I had a feather in my hat; they took the feather away, I halloed out you rob me, you rob me, but I could not speak, five or six of them got hold of my collar and tore it all to pieces; I had a silver medal under my great coat, it was taken from me, I was attacked by the whole mob. Then I was taken to the Police office. This is my box, I had it in my hand, this way.</p>

               <p>Nardi. I had a great bundle of clothes, the magistrates desired the man to give it me; that gentleman holds it now.</p>
               <p>Baker. I deny it. Pickering the goaler holds it.</p>

            . Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a shoemaker, I live at No. 20, Duke's court, St Martin's. On Wednesday evening the 5th of November, I was in Long Acre about eight o'clock; I saw the two prisoners, Nardi and Grandi, they were fantastically dressed; one of them had a sergeant's sash, and both of them with feathers in their hats; a great many people crowded round them; I saw them first at a colour shop, and then I saw them go to the sadler's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you saw them both, or only one in the sadler's shop. - A. Only one. Nardi was in the sadler's shop, and Grandi waited outside, he had a mopstick in his hand and a bundle under his arm; (the size of that which is before him,) I then saw the deceased and his companion; I saw the deceased address himself to Grandi, I could not distinguish the words, I saw him wrench the stick out of Grandi's hand, and Grandi drew back out into the middle of the road, for fear he should strike him with the stick as I supposed. The deceased and his companion then went to the shop window, when Nardi came out with a whip in his hand and expressed these words, take care, I will shoot you; the deceased and his companion took hold of these words; repeating them saying d - n you, you shoot a man; both of them repeated these words. Nardi then made a shop, he said something what I cannot tell, though I was close to him; there was not a moment elapsed from that, when the deceased gave him two or three violent blows upon the head and face, and knocked him two or three yards; off his hat went one way, and he another, he could hardly keep his feet from falling; the deceased then pushed upon him, seconded by this man or companion of his, into the middle of the road to Nardi; when they went into the middle of the street the mob gathered round them. I staid outside, I could not see then who gave or who received blows; I turned my head round, I saw Grandi standing at the cheesemonger's shop, about fifteen or sixteen yards off the people.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the fighting continue. - A. About two minutes I dare say was the outside. I saw Nardi creep out of the crowd, I think he had been down in the mud, and one of the crowd was exclaiming, he has got a knife; he then got of the opposite side of the way, and stood on the pavement, without his hat, alone; and the deceased, with five or six people round him; we retired to the other side; the deceased's companion had missed him in the scuffle, he halloed out Will, where are you; I believe the deceased then answered, it seemed a faint voice. However in a few minutes he brought the deceased into the road where he then stood, facing of Nardi, and the companion of the deceased, as soon as he brought him up, cried out here is your man, pointing to Nardi, who was then standing on the payment. As soon as Nardi saw him he made a retreat into the cheesemonger's shop, and Grandi who was standing at the door, he went in with him; they had not been in this shop above a minute or a very short space of time, before the companion of the deceased came into the middle of the road, and cried they have stabbed the man, take care of him.</p>

            . Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You keep a sadler's shop in Long Acre. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the night we have been speaking of, seeing the two prisoners at your house. - A. One, the prisoner Nardi, I did not observe the other, he was on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you first observed Nardi. - A. Between seven and eight in the evening, he came in, said he wanted to buy a whip, he bought one and gave five and sixpence for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in his appearance. - A. There was, he had a feather in his hat and a piece of paper, but what was written on it I do not recollect. He told me that he was an Italian, that he had nineteen brothers all in his Majesty's service; after, he said that his brother Robert was at the door, he was a very fine man, and he said I am a very fine man myself. He stepped towards the door, he had the whip in his hand; he said if you hurt my brother Robert me will shoot you.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time there was a great many people about the door. - A. A great many.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing the demenour of those people collected about the door. - A. They did not behave very well, one of them called out, d - n him he his going to shoot us, he had nothing in his hand but the whip, which he held out so; (witness describing it); after Nardi went off the stop of the door, I went out, he said will you enlist, he was surrounded by the people, and they got fighting; one of them was knocked down but I do not know by whom.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see Grandi then. - A. I did not see Grandi then; after he got up they fought across the street; one of them called out are you going to rob me, he called out twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030032"></xptr> Q. Was that after they had been some time fighting. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see who was fighting. - A. No. In about a minute after that they got fighting across the street again, there were some very hard blows, but by whom I cannot tell, I saw several arms up, some one fell, I do not know who it was. After that they ceased fighting.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, sir, if I understand, your evidence is, that this scuffling began after Nardi got out on the pavement, you did not see any body strike Nardi, nor Nardi strike any body. - A. No, nor did I observe what was the cause of this disturbance; he was as pleased as any man in the world when he was in the shop.</p>

            ; examined by Mr. Gurney. What countryman are you. - A. An Irishman, a coachsmith, I work for Mr. Chamberlain and Williams in Long Acre, and lodge at a figure maker's in Drury lane. On the 5th of November, about a quarter to eight o'clock, I was coming along Long Acre, I saw Nardi standing in the door way of the sadler's shop, halfway in and halfway out. Grandi was standing outside, to the left of Nardi.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mob assembled about the door. A. There might be an hundred or more. Nardi had a feather in his hat; I rushed through the crowd and stood on the curb stone of the sadler's door, there were three men standing between me and the door way; I heard this man express a great deal of ill language to Nardi, he had a whip in his hand, Nardi said if you do not go about your business I will shoot you, he immediately pointed the whip towards him. One of these young men that stood before me said to Nardi, d - n your eyes if I had you out, I'd let you know whether you would shoot a man or not; another of the three men that stood with the young man, said, d - n his eyes, pull him out directly; then Grandi, as he stood outside the sadler's shop, the other side the door, he had a stick in his hand, he waved it in this way (holding it up), he said to these people, why do you not let this man go about his business, do you want to rob him, or do you want to make a property of him; then immediately Grandi was shoved off the path into the street. One of these young men rushed from this place, followed Grandi, and wrenched the stick out of his hands and chucked it into the street, they shoved Grandi through the crowd, this young man followed him, he made different blows at Grandi as he retreated through the crowd. Then the crowd rushed towards the sadler's shop again; on my getting there I saw Nardi standing in the street, about three paces from the curb stone, I immediately saw this young man that struck at Grandi, he faced towards Nardi in a position to fight; there were two men stood on each side of this young man, the tallest of them said, go along my good fellow, give it him, I heard other voices exclaiming in the same manner, give it him; the young man struck Nardi, and Nardi made his defence with his hands extended.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether the man struck at Nardi once or twice. - A. It appeared to me as if he made four blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the blows appear to reach him. - A. I saw him stagger, his hat was hanging of one side, this young man still following him. I saw him make another blow at him while Nardi was putting his hand to his hat, I saw Nardi fall down, then the crowd closed; it did not enable me to see how he was taken up; the crowd opened in the course of a minute and a half, I saw Nardi come up towards the shop and this young man stood before him. Nardi faced, then they immediately fell to fighting again, they fought nearly into the middle of the street, the crowd then was partly of the other side of the way, and as I came into the middle of the street I happened to shove my hand against a man that was stooping, immediately the man raised he had got Nardi's hat in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you saw the blows struck, the three or four blows, were these blows struck by the man that was hurt. - A. That I cannot say, he had a dark coloured coat, apparently to me it was a dark brown.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you examined by the coroner. - A. I was not, I was there at the time, I attended while the commission was -</p>
               <p>MR. SHELTON. After the jury gave their verdict, several came forward, they did not give their names in nor were they called.</p>
               <p>DR. SIMMONS. Q. I believe you are a physician. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of knowing the prisoners at the bar. - A. The prisoner Nardi came to me about a year and a half ago, on the 1st of May in that year, he was then in a very depressed state of mind; after seeing him a few times, I saw no more of him till about the month of July in the present year, he was then extremely dangerous; in July his wife told me he had made a great many attempts upon himself. I made her an offer of getting him into St. Luke's hospital, believing him to be a proper object of it. On the 2nd of October I was desired to call at the public office, Marlborough street, to see a poor man that was brought there in a very riotous state; I then saw him again, I told the clerk that I had recommended this poor man's wife to have him taken care of, that I thought him a proper object for the hospital, if they would write to the parish.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Your opinion of him is that he is a deranged man. - A. That he is a deranged man.</p>
               <p>Court. You thought him a deranged man then. - A. Yes.</p>

            . Examined by Mr. Alley. I live at No. 39, Wigmore street, I am a hair dresser. I have known Nardi about four years, he has lived in my house two years and three quarters, he left it about a fortnight before he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he in the course of last year been afflicted with any mental derangement in your opinion. - A. I think for the last ten weeks, from his mode of going on, he has been out of his mind; he has passed my house almost every day since he has left it, and from his gestures and odd antics that he played, I think that he must be out of his mind. In one respect, to point out his insanity, he was always particularly careful of offending those ladies that employed him; he was a <rs id="t18061203-32-deflabel180" type="occupation">flower and feather manufacturer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18061203-32-defend326 t18061203-32-deflabel180"></join>. He began to dress himself in a fantastic manner, hired horses, rode furiously about the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030033"></xptr> streets, went to several of the ladies that used to employ him, knocked at the door of their houses on horseback, and I have known instances, where the servants did not give him answers that he liked, he used to strike them, which used to alarm the ladies, and those ladies he never would offend if he had not been deranged. In his natural state of mind, before he was afflicted, he was quite the reverse. Within these last two months a vast number of boys used to follow him in the street; as a proof I thought him deranged, about a month before he committed this rash act, he rode furiously up and down the street for a long time, he stopped the horse at a public house to let him drink; two or three neighbours thinking it was a charity to stop him, got an order from the overseer to send him to the Marybone Infirmary; he had the strait jacket put on him, was there several hours, from nine to three, till some that were called his friends hearing of it, somehow or other had him set at liberty that day. The next day I saw him dressed with expensive flowers about his hat. The last time that I saw him and spoke to him was in Vere street on the Sunday before he committed this rash act; he had a tamboreen in his hand, a number of boys were following him. When he saw me he run across the street to me, I endeavoured to persuade him to go with me to where he slept; he said he had just come from there, he had left four hundred people behind him, and none of them could hold him. He gave the tamboreen a blow and away he was off.</p>
               <p>Court. Then from this information of his character and conduct, you have no doubt but that he was insane. - A. I have not the least doubt of it.</p>

            . Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a publican in Wigmore street. Nardi lived at the next door at Mr. Marshall's.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you observed any thing particular in his conduct during the last few weeks that he lodged with Mr. Marshall. - A. The first part of his conduct was outrage, and the other part was by dressing himself fantastically with bird of Paradise feathers and artificial flowers; he varied his dress almost every day, and on the day he was taken up I saw him opposite our door dressed up in bird of Paradise feathers, they are worth two or three guineas a-piece. There was another person with him, I cannot say whether it is the other prisoner or no.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his character before for humanity. A. I never heard any thing to reproach his character.</p>

            . Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a bookseller, I live in Wigmore street, close by where the prisoner lived. I have known him very near three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing him previous to his being taken up. - A. I saw him about four o'clock that afternoon; Grandi at that time was with him dressed in a red sash. Nardi's appearance was singular; he desired me to read him a letter, I desired him to come in the shop, I said, see what a mob your conduct attracts; he put his foot on the step, instantly returned, took up a little boy and held him up in his arms and let him down again. He then came in the shop, and requested that I would read the letter; the letter was from a cousin of his who lived in Kilkenny that Nardi had got me to write to, it was from a poor man, he wanted him to come to town, that he had got some money for him. Before I had read half the letter, he puts up his hands, why, says he, I have got an hundred pound for him; he seized the letter from me, went out of the shop, and presented it to Grandi, down on one knee, and took off his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What really was your opinion of him. - A. That he was in a deranged state, from my knowing him before, and always seeing him conduct himself steady till latterly.</p>
               <p>Grandi called seven respectable gentlemen, who gave him the character of a humane, honest, simple, easy, and inoffensive man.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury. This is an indictment against the two prisoners at the bar, John Andrew Nardi and 
               <persName id="t18061203-32-person357">
                  Sebastian

            , and the indictment charges them with an offence, the particulars you have already heard, therefore it is not necessary for me to trouble you with it again. It charges them with the joint commission of murder, and the manner in which that wilful murder was committed, was by giving that unhappy man who has lost his life a mortal wound in his arm, of which wound for some time he languished, and then he died. - Gentlemen, if no other grand question presented itself to us for our consideration, and when I state to you I cannot help congratulating both myself and you, that we may spare, in the first instance, that part which is the contradiction of evidence; for with all the pains that we might take, it might illude our utmost pains and sagacity. But, gentlemen, it has turned out in the result of this case, a question has presented itself, which, I think, I may fairly, and without injuring justice, present to you as a first and a preliminary consideration, that before I go into the detail of the evidence, I may dismiss from your minds the charge against 
               <persName id="t18061203-32-person358">
                  Sebastian

            . He is charged in the indictment with the same offence as Nardi, and though you should be of opinion that there is no doubt that Nardi has committed this fact, namely, of stabbing the deceased, and if you are perfectly satisfied that he, having so committed that offence, and that the other prisoner was present and in the language of the law aiding and abetting him in the design, then, whatever effect this fatal stroke by the hand of Nardi produced, would be equally ascribed to Grandi; but the circumstance appears to me, and I think I see my way clear, when I state to you that the whole of the evidence goes near to the exculpation of Grandi; and here I cannot help paying my attention to that part of the evidence, namely, the testimony that is borne of the general good character of this man by some of the most respectable characters that are known in society, and when I give him and them the benefit of that evidence, I will repeat what they have said, because they with one mouth have borne this testimony, that his conduct was marked by familiar honesty, the most humane, the most inoffensive of all men. Although we cannot in any degree approve of him lending himself to the fantastical conduct of the man with whom on that day he was companion, yet from the begining to the end, I think you will accompany me with the evidence, that there is no circumstance relating to Grandi that goes to this act of Nardi's; we can make no more of it than he was too easily duped to do this, to dress himself in this fantastical way in which he did. You will recollect from the evidence that somebody did call out in Italian, yet no man has said what that call was; it is reasonable to suppose that when he called in that language, he meaned no more than to call his friend to his assistance. There seems to be an agreement in the evidence of one side and on the other, that this violence was done by Nardi, from his own conception of the moment, either suggested by insanity or passion, or from the malignity of the human heart. - Gentlemen, it would strain the matter too hard if you were to bring this act<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030034"></xptr> upon the part of Nardi, and at the same time to conceive that it would extend to the part which Grandi took upon that occasion, there was nothing that would lead them originally into this mischief beyond this, that so many persons were gathered together around them.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, If you are of opinion, that this blow was given by Nardi, it cannot be considered under these circumstances of his being connected, as it were, with Grandi; that he was privy to it, or that he countenanced it first or last, then the consequence will be upon this indictment, neither the crime of murder nor manslaughter can be brought upon him, whatever the result of your verdict may be to Nardi. If he is guilty of manslaughter, then the law says there shall be no accomplice in manslaughter.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, From whatever motive it was done, it appears from the evidence that the prisoner Nardi did inflict this wound in the arm, and that wound was the cause of his death; but the question arises here, whether upon the full and natural examination of evidence, whether you are perfectly sure that this man committed this act out of a deliberate state of mind, without that sufficient provocation that the law would allow, or whether he did it under the pressure of danger. Under these circumstances, not only a foreigner like him, but even an Englishman, under the apprehension of his own danger, we may suppose would do as we suppose him to have done - to have used that fatal instrument.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, If you should be clearly of opinion at the time this fatal stroke was given by Nardi by this instrument, which you have seen, if you are perfectly satisfied that he was under mental derangement, then the law cannot make it the crime of murder. Therefore, gentlemen, this is a most important question to weigh within yourselves, how far the evidence of the prisoner Nardi goes to prove that he was under a derangement of mind: with regard to that, the evidence has so impressed it on our memory, that I consider myself under no sort of necessity in reading it, and the very words of the first witness who is called to speak on the subject, is a man whom every body knows to be a gentleman high in eminence in the medical line - Dr. Simmons.</p>
               <p>[The learned judge here went through the evidence on the part of the prisoner.]</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, You will give me your verdict whether you are perfectly satisfied that Nardi was deranged in his mind at the time he committed this act or not; you will say whether the prisoner Nardi did this act of murder or no, or whether the prisoner Nardi was insane at the time he did this act. If you are of that opinion you will say so.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you apprehend he had any other habitation? - A. None whatever; he left me this day week; last Thursday I went into the country; on the 20th I had missed several things but did not suspect him; after some time I had occasion to suspect him, and I applied for a warrant to go to No. 10, Artillery-street, the house of Mrs. Barry, he went there by the name of Fish, two Police-officers went with me; I found a large trunk of things, all of which came out of my shop, and some of which, I can positively swear to be my property; I found also, between eighty and ninety pounds, in money and Bank-notes; and I know, when he came to me, he was not worth a groat; he was in great distress, and was recommended to me as an object of charity; the things are here.</p>
               <p>EDWARD SMITH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a Police-officer: I went with Mr. Bulmer to execute a search-warrant at the house of Mrs. Barry, No. 10, Artillery-street, I went up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, during the time you staid there, see the prisoner at all? - A. I did; when I went up stairs, Mrs. Penti was sitting by the fire; when I communicated to her our business, she seemed very much alarmed, indeed; this trunk was standing by the window, I asked her for the key; she said her husband had got the key, and he was out, and desired us to wait till he returned, before we searched the room; I took the poker, and by force, broke open this trunk, and in it was most of those things that are here.</p>
               <p>Q. How many articles have you put in since? - A.This gown, and a gown that Mrs. Penn had on her back; this gown, I believe, lay on the bed; I put all the property into the trunk; Mr. Penn then came home, and I took hold of him, and secured him; she exclaimed, my dear Mr. Penn, what shall I do; he was then taken to the office for examination.</p>
               <p>Q.Coomes was the other officer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He knows nothing more than you do? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You say this young man seemed very much alarmed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not at all unlikely that any person may be alarmed at two Police-officers coming with a search-warrant? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060038"></xptr>Balmer. This piece of linen I can swear positively to, there is my own hand-writing upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that? - A. Two pounds sixteen shillings it cost me; I left London on the 20th of last month, and I then had seen this piece, it is a remarkable piece, it is much cheaper than any of the others; on my return, on the 27th, I missed this along with some others; here are some handkerchiefs that have got my shop-mark upon them; and a piece of nankeen which has my shop-mark in my own hand; and the fag-end of this gown has my own mark upon it; and the neck-cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you permit him, while he was with you, to deal in any thing of this sort? - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you keep one shop in Margate, and another in London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A considerable part of the summer you were at Margate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All you know about these things are, that they were in your shop at some time or other? - A. I swear that this piece of Irish has been stolen out of my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that was not stolen out of your shop in your absence? - A. I will; I have examined my books.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear, that in you absence, it has been the uniform conduct to put down every article in the hurry of business? - A. We do not put down every quarter of a yard, but they are put down sundries; and I have looked, and there is not twenty shillings in sundries put down.</p>
               <p>FRANCES BARRY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I live at No. 10, Artillery street: The prisoner came to lodge with me about the beginning of August; the young woman took the lodgings, I did not see the young man for two days; she took them in the name of Fish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring any goods with her, or any property? - A.Nothing but what she brought in an handkerchief; the trunk had been about six or seven weeks in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was full or empty? - A. I have reason to think it came from the trunk-maker's shop to our house; after that, this young man frequently came of an evening, and at two, three, and four o'clock, on Sunday mornings; she made up this gown while she was in my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You believed them to be man and wife; they cohabited together as man and wife? - A. Yes.</p>

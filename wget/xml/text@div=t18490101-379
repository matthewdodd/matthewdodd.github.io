                  </hi>. I reside at Edmonton, and carry on business in London, as a stock-broker—the prisoner was in my service about seventeen months. In Aug. last I was indebted to Charles Adams 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for gardening and shrubs—I gave the prisoner a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note to take to Adams, as I was going out of town, and thought he might want money—I gave the prisoner no authority to change it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, occasionally employed by Mr. Tyrie.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It is false what he says about Mrs. Tyrie borrowing the money; no such words passed; I told him I had laid out 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for things, and when he came to work I would ask mistress for the money, and would pay him; he said, "Never mind, give it me any time;" I said I could not ask my mistress for it then, as she was unwell. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He did not say he had laid out the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for things; he said his mistress had had it.</p>

I did not borrow 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the prisoner on or before 7th Aug.—I heard, in the course of the day, that he had been to pay the gardener; but I did not know the amount till I heard it afterwards from Mr. Tyrie—the prisoner did not lay out 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by my orders—he has laid out money for little things, which he entered in a book, which he says he has lost—if he had done so there would be no reason for concealing it from Mr. Tyrie—the prisoner left us full ten weeks ago, while we were at Brighton—he left without notice, and took his book with him—he said at the examination he had laid out some small sums for the house, which I thought was incorrect—I think it was under 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had no recol<lb></lb>lection of the items—the prisoner said he could not specify the items, as he had lost his book—no wages were due to him when he left—he was paid on Saturday evening, and left on Sunday morning—the servants knew he was going.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder, living in Crown-street, West<lb></lb>minster—M'Carthy was my servant of all work for fifteen months. On the 4th of April I missed two Venetian and one red Turkey morocco skins from the back room where the apprentice-boys sleep—I received some information, in consequence of which I accompanied George Cheeseman, a leather-seller, about three days after I missed my pro<lb></lb>perty, to a shop in Little Earl-street, Seven-dials, kept by Collins—we found three of the skins I had lost—these produced are them—they are mine—when I went in they were on the counter—she deals in what are called pieces of skins, of various colours and all descriptions—I examined the skins, and knew them perfectly—Collins was not there when we went in—she came in afterwards, and we accused her of buying the skins know<lb></lb>ing them to be stolen—she was asked who she bought them of—she said she bought them of an Irish woman—she was asked if she knew her—she said she did not, she never saw her before—she first of all said she had given 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—her son contradicted her, and said, "No, mother, you gave 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them"—she then recollected herself, and said we were wel<lb></lb>come to take the skins away, or something of that kind—the officer asked her if she had entered them in a book—she said no, she had not—the officer afterwards came to my house, and made a little inquiry—the next morning Collins's son came down and identified M'Carthy as the person that had sold the skins—she denied it—search was made in my presence in the kitchen, and two skins were found under a box at the bottom of a standing-press against the kitchen wall—they were my skins which I had missed—the skins now produced are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Bermondsey. On the night of 29th Nov., I was going along, and saw the prisoner and some other boys—the prisoner called me a lousy thief—I came back and told him I was neither lousy, nor a thief—I hit him on the side of his head with my open hand—there was a boy standing by, and he asked him for a knife, and he gave him one—the prisoner opened it, and stabbed me in the side—I did not think I was stabbed at the moment, but I put my hand inside, and my hand was all blood—I ran to the doctor.</p>

               <p>ROBERT HOPKINS I am a lighterman employed by Messrs. Browning's. They had ten floats of Swedish timber, each float, containing eighteen pieces. It was under my care.</p>
               <p>Q. On Thursday the 4th of this month, did you examine the timber - A. I did, about eight o'clock in the morning. At that time it was all safe in there, at Sandy Dock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine it the next day - A. No, I did not. I was passing and repassing the wharf on the next day; I did not miss any of it. On the next morning, I missed six pieces from the outside. That was about eight o'clock. On the Friday, they were fastened with four ropes, three single ropes and one double. The ropes were cut. I have no hesitation in saying they were cut; it plainly appeared so. In the forenoon I enquired about London. In the afternoon, I went towards Brentford. In my passage up, I received information that a barge had passed by early in the morning, belonging to Mr. Watkins, with some timber a stern, which answered the description of that stolen. I got that information about half after four o'clock on the Friday. In consequence of that information I went up to Robinson's wharf, on the Brentford cut. On his wharf, I found five pieces of timber that I had lost, fastened to a ring on the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that the timber that you found at Mr. Robinson's wharf, was the timber that you lost from your master's premises - A. Yes, I am perfectly sure it was. I went to Mr. Watkins's house, and there I found the prisoner was his <rs id="t18130217-88-deflabel524" type="occupation">bargeman</rs>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, when he was charged with this, say where he got the five pieces of timber - A. Before the magistrate he stated that a man had brought him the timber, within Battersea reach, about three o'clock on the morning of the Friday. The magistrate told him it was an unsatisfactory account; be should commit him. He said that the man told him to take it to Mr. Robinson's wharf, Brentford-cut, and leave it there for Pool's boats. Pool is the owner of boats employed for the inland navigation.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 5th of February, did the barge arrive at your wharf - A. He arrived at my wharf on Friday, about nine o'clock. On Friday, in the morning, he had nothing in the barge, nor to the barge. When he came to my wharf, he told me that he had some timber for me. I understood him that it came from Bow-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not at that time employed him to bring any timber had you - A. No, I had not. The raft was five pieces; the boy was upon the five pieces. He brought it along side of my wharf, and made it fast. He said it was for Pool's boats. I asked him for a note. He said he had none, but the person that gave him the timber would be at my wharf about the time that the barge arrived.</p>

The timber was brought to the barge at White-friers, about ten o'clock on the Thursday morning. It was brought by a small boat. I don't know the man that brought it. At that time there was not water enough to bring it up to the barge; it was fastened to some coal barges that lay outside.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces were they - A. Five pieces. I saw it in the morning, at day-light. Between five and six in the evening, we came out of White-friers. We took the timber astern, and went to the Temple, and there lay for the tide turning. On Friday morning, we went up to Brentford with the timber.</p>

               <p>Q. to John Browing. What is the value of these five pieces of timber - A. About forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man brought this timber to me in Whitefriars, to my barge. He asked me whether I worked for Mr. Robinson. I told him, I did. I asked him, whether he had got a note with the timber. He said, he had not, but a note would be there as soon as the barge. I took the timber in the barge to Brentford, to Mr. Robinson's wharf. He asked me whether I had got a note. I said. I had not. I am innocent of this felony you may depend upon it. I did not know of the timber being stolen. I took it up as carriage.</p>

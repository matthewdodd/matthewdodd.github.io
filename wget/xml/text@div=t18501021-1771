                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. Gurney, of the Clarendon, Oxford-street. I have known the prisoners eight weeks—Simons used to leave parcels, and said he would call for them himself, but if the female called she was to have them; but she never did—sometimes he took them away when she was with him, and sometimes he used to take them away alone—he went by the name of Mr. Harris, and she Mrs. Harris—the female called on Saturday, 28th Sept., about eight o'clock, and asked if Mr. Harris had been there—she left again, and I followed her to Mr. Lawson's, 211, Oxford-street—she waited by the door a few minutes, and Simons came out of the shop to her—they spoke to each other, and he went in again—a few minutes after he came out and spoke to her again, and a third time also—she was then three or four doors from the shop, and he appeared to put his hand to his coat-pocket and to put his hand towards her, I cannot say exactly, as I was on the opposite side of the way—he then went into the shop again, and she went to Mr. Gurney's—I got back first, and was in the house before her—when she came she had a small parcel—I then served her with something—my master sent to Mr. Lawson, and he came himself—there were then two parcels at our house, which Simons had left, one on the Thursday and one on the Friday, and which he was to call for that night—Mr. Lawson examined those—about the fourth time Simons came, he told me he was going to com<lb></lb>mence housekeeping—the female prisoner never brought any parcels but the one that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, in partnership with John Palmer——Simons was in our service six months—on Saturday night, 28th Sept. about nine o'clock, I received information, called a policeman, and went with him to Mr. Gurney's, where I found three parcels of our goods—this is a list I made of them at the station (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"23 muslin collars, 18 pairs of gloves, 9 cuffs, 30 postage stamps, 2 lengths of blonde, 6 cambric handkerchiefs, 7 lengths of ribbon, 1 length of lace, 23 handkerchiefs, 1 paper of pins, 4 bunches of flowers, 1 cap front, 12 shop tickets, 1 knife and fork, and half-a-yard of lace insertion)—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are our property—I know them by the private marks on them—I gave the female prisoner into custody, and went to 19, Cooper-street, Finsbury, which address she gave as her lodging, and there found other things—I examined Simons's boxes, and found 2 lengths of cloth and some silk—he lived at our house, and slept there, except on Saturday and Sunday nights—he told me that on those nights he slept at his uncle's.</p>

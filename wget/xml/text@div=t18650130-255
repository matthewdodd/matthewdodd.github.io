I keep a boarding-house on Tower-hill—Walter and the prisoner came to my house, and after they got into the bed-room Walter accused the prisoner of having a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the prisoner denied having it—he said that if there had been a note in the purse it would be there then—Walter still said that he had lost it—the cabman had to be paid, and a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece was tendered to him to pay it—he returned 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6d—when I got down stairs I saw the prisoner with 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a handful of coin, which he took out of his pocket—I saw the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note found, and heard the cabman remark that he had made a fine day of it—the prisoner said, "Yes, he is a fore-cabin passenger, and goes away to-morrow."</p>

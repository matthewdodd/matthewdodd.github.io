            . I am in the employ of Mr. Bradley. I took the Eliza up to Chelsea on the 9th, which was Saturday, and on the Sunday morning I moored her and left her safe, between eleven and twelve o'clock - I went to her again about the same time on Monday morning; she had then been unmoored, and fifteen quarters of oats had been taken out of her, and thirty sacks which had contained it - I suppose that was seven miles from Horselydown; I saw the prisoner about dinner time on Sunday, and he asked if I had taken my punt up-to Chelsea - I said Yes.</p>
               <p>JAMES EDWARDS. I am a lighterman and live in Freeman's-lane. I have known the prisoner for years - on that Sunday, between twelve and one o'clock, he came to Horselydown stairs, and asked if I knew where Bumstead was - I said I had not seen him, but he might find him at home; he went away, and returned with him - he said they were going to hire a barge, and asked if I would go with them; I said No - in the afternoon they asked if I would lend them my boat; I said I did not mind - they took it, and were away all the afternoon; in the evening the prisoner came and told me he had hired a barge - I and the prisoner went on board it, and went below-Bumstead was on it; it then went up on the other side of Chelsea College, and they stopped her at the piles - I found the Eliza there, laden with corn; the prisoner and Bumstead unmoored her, and shoved her down to the barge; they then fastened her, and took out of her fifteen quarters of oats - the prisoner said, "Now I shall pay myself;" I understood he had worked for the prosecutor, who had not paid him - the oats were shot out of the sacks, loose, into the barge; the Eliza was left against the dead wall, by the piles; we then came down the river- the sacks were thrown overboard somewhere off the Red House, and sunk; we went down to Pickle Herring tier - I then took the prisoner on shore, and left Bumstead on board; I do not know what became of them afterwards.</p>

            . I live at Deptford. I sold fifteen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170080"></xptr>quarters and a half of oats, on commission, for the prisoner I think it was on the 12th of October - here is the order I gave for the delivery of them; but it appears there were only fifteen quarters.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it; Edwards is a reputed thief - he has been in custody for a robbery on the Thames; he swore at the Thames Police that I hired a barge of Mr. Bostock, which I had not - I worked fifteen quarters and a half of oats of a gentleman, and landed them at Mr. Holland's - they are what Taylor sold.</p>

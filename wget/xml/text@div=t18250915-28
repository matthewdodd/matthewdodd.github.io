On the 5th of August I went out of my room, about nine o'clock in the evening, and left my articles there; I returned in about half an hour and did not then miss them; some friends came with me; I went out again about eleven o'clock, and returned again at near twelve; I then sat down in my chair and fell asleep; my landlady awoke me afterwards and said some of my property was gone: I saw the articles again the same night in the custody of the watchman.</p>

            . I live at this house. On the morning of the 6th of August my wife alarmed me, and said there was some person in the house: I listened and heard some person say that the b - y watchman had locked them into the house. I went out of my room and found the prisoner in the passage, with two of these articles in her possession; I put on my clothes and got the watchman; the street door was locked, and bolted top and bottom, so that no person could have put her in; she afterwards said that the man had brought her in and had no money to give her, and she had taken these articles to pay herself.</p>

I met the prosecutor about twelve o'clock at night - he took me to a watering-house, and then to his lodgings; he gave me two shillings and a half-crown piece, which I thought not enough, and I was joking with him about taking these little things towards housekeeping, and he said I might take them if I liked.</p>

               <p>Was you sensible when she put her hand into your pocket, and took them? - I did not feel her. She ran down stairs, and then I felt in my pocket and missed them directly.</p>
               <p>You are positive that she took them? - I am.</p>
               <p>You never found your things again? - No, she was taken up on a Tuesday, about eleven o'clock, that was about a month after. She kept out of the way three weeks.</p>

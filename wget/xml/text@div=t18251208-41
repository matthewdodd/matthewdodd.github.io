On the 21st of November, about six o'clock in the evening, (the lamps had been lighted some time; I had had a light in my window for an hour; it was dark) I was in my shop; my watches hung in the window, behind a wire guard; there had been a bullock hunt: I heard a shouting in the street, and thought the mob was returning with the bullock; upon hearing this noise I was going to the window to clear it, and at that instant the window was smashed - I was about three yards from the window; my lamp was extinguished. I saw hands thrust through the glass, and caught hold of them in strugglidg with them, or the window would have been cleared. I got out what I could, but lost a gold and a silver watch. I found the silver one at Worship-street next morning, when the prisoner was in custody.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Chester-place, nearly opposite to the prosecutor. On the 21st of November, about half-past five o'clock (it was dark - candles were lighted - my lamp hung outside the shop.) I heard the mob returning with the bullock - I was in my back parlour. I got up, and the moment I arose, I heard the smash of a window - I came to my door, and saw several people round Mr. Stevenson's window - two of them were busily employed in taking watches from his window; one of them was dressed in a white jacket, and that one I particularly kept my eye upon - the other was dressed in dark clothes. I immediately jumped out of my shop and pursued them - they ran away. I collared the one in the white jacket, and held him for nearly five minutes, calling loudly for assistance - nobody came - he struggled with me and got away; six or seven of them stopped and said, "Stand hard against the b-r, down with him," and for my own safety I pursued him no further - or I dare say they would have knocked my brains out. I have not seen the man in the white jacket since - I can swear to none but him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. There was a croud with them? A. Yes; it was the mob with the bullock that did it - some of them were dressed in blue coats and gilt buttons.</p>

            . I live in Chester-place, opposite to the prosecutor, and am a tmman. I was at my door, about half-past five o'clock, as the bullock passed Mr. Stevenson's window - I heard glass break immediately - looked over and saw two persons at the window - their hands were in the window very busy apparently - one had a white flannel jacket, and the other a dark coat on - it was too dark to see the colour - candles had been lighted three-quarters of an hour. I stood at my own door to protect my property - the shop light went out, and I could not see the one in the dark coat any more - but saw the one in the light jacket - he ran about thirty-five yards from the window - Harris laid hold of him; the mob came back and hit Harris, who let him go. I was sixteen or eighteen yards from them. I think the person in the dark coat, was taller than the prisoner - but that side of the way is higher than where I was.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HARRIS re-examined. I was not struck, but they had sticks with them.</p>

            . I have been an officer twenty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080023"></xptr>years. On the 22d of November, a little after eleven o'clock in the morning, in consequence of information, I went with Garton to different houses round Bethnalgreen - and on going into the tap-room of the King and Queen, public-house, in Air-street, Bethnal-green, I observed the prisoner sitting alone, smoking his pipe. I saw his left hand move, towards his left hand trousers' pocket, immediately as I entered. He must have known me, and what I was; I immediately laid hold of his hand, and asked, "If all the property he had got about him was his own." He said Yes. I put my hand into his left hand trousers' pocket, and there found this watch. I found nothing else on him; I asked how he came by the watch. He said he had found it; I asked if he had shown it to any body - he said No. On going to the office, I asked where he was last night - he said he was at work until five, and after that was at a house in St. John-street - there is a St. John-street, Bethnal-green. I asked at whose house; he did not tell me; he was dressed in a blue coat; the watch was quite clean, and did not appear to have been in the dirt at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He put his left hand into his pocket? A. To his pocket, not into it. Air-street-fields is full half a mile from the prosecutor's house.</p>

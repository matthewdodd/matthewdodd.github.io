                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Stephen Evan, of Knightrider Street, and Mr. J. Winterbotham is one of the partners—I have charge of a portion of the mantle department—I sit by myself at a desk at one end of a room and can see part of the other end of the room, but there is a pile of cloth up to the ceiling which prevents my seeing part of the other end—on 27th May, about 10 o'clock, I saw Stiles come into the room—the <hi rend="italic">employes</hi> of the establishment pass through that room to go to an urinal—Stiles was in the habit of coming there two or three times a week—he was in the service of Mrs. Andre who does business with the firm, and he brought things from her—he would know the premises pretty well—I saw him again about 1 o'clock, and he went to the other side of the pile of cloth—I then went there and saw him going into the urinal and close the door—I did not miss any mantles then—I went back to my place, sat down, and heard the urinal door open; I then heard paper rustling and went to look, and saw him passing into the urinal again—I went back to my seat, remained three minutes, and when he came out I noticed that he was rather bulky and that he had a bundle under his coat on the left side—I then searched and missed thirteen mantles from a parcel of twenty-one—they were about 2 yards from the urinal door—thirteen mantles would not make a greater bulk than would go under his coat; they were very thin.</p>

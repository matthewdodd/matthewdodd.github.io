                  </hi>. I live at 41, Wellington-road, Bethnal-green, and am a tailor—I was in the Victoria beer-shop on 13th October—Mr. James Clarke, a cab proprietor, was there, and the prisoner—the landlord asked me to write out a receipt for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the prisoner—the prisoner told me it was for a bay mare or a horse—I objected first of all to write it out, not being much of a writer—I had never seen them before—the prisoner did not exactly say that he had sold it to Mr. Clarke, but it appeared so—the price of the mare was 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the receipt I wrote—it was read over to the prisoner and he put his mark to it—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "October 13th, 1859.

From some information I received, I went on the morning of 7th November with Puffett to the Victoria beer-shop in the Wellington-road; and found the bay mare in question in a stable—as soon as it was turned out of the stable, Puffett identified it as his master's property—in consequence of something that passed, I waited for the witness Clarke—he came about 11 o'clock, two hours afterwards; and we two went together to the station, in Spital-square, where the prisoner was in custody—I stated the case to the inspector, and the prisoner was conveyed to the West Ham station, in custody of another policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 613). On the morning of 7th November, the prisoner was given into my custody by the witness Clarke—I took him to the Spital-square station—I told him what he was charged with—when he was asked how he came in possession of the horse, he said, "I bought the horse from a man named Ward, in Smithfield for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—in a few minutes he said, "I did not buy it from a man of the name of Ward; but I was authorized to sell it for a man of the name of Ward; I was to have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, but only had 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>receive more than 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I did not ask for more. I told him I would have no more to do with it. Clarke went with me from his house to the stable, I led the horse by the head, and he showed me the way to the London fields. I left him on the way from the held after leaving the horse there. I did not know from the Monday night to the next Sunday morning but what the owner had the horse; Clarke told me that he had fetched the horse up. I said I would have no more to do with it. He said I should not get into any trouble about it. Several times we have had words about the horse, but he would not give the horse up again. On Saturday last we had words, and I threatened to hit him in the eye, because he would not give the horse up. He laughed at me, and said he had got what would clear him. I told him he should be with me if I got into any trouble through the horse. I left him and went away, and did not see him any more until yesterday morning, when he gave me into custody. He perfectly knows I have no stable."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was sent with the horse to Mr. Clarke, and I did not know at the time but that it was honestly come by. He asked me to make a receipt out I could not write, and I refused to do so the first night; I came to his wishes the next night; I did not know then whose the horse was. When I knew it was a stolen horse I wished to turn it out. On the Monday night following I assisted in turning it out. I went to his house, and asked him to let me turn it out, and he refused. He went with me to the stable. I did not know the way to the London fields; he showed me the way, and I left the horse on the field; and the Sunday following I was by his house, and I asked him if he had seen anything more of that horse. He said he had got it up in the stable then. I told him I would have nothing more to do with it, as it was a stolen horse. He told me he did not get me into any trouble with the horse. I heard of it being lost several times; I wished to let it go, so that the owner should find it, but he refused. We had great words about it. Before the receipt was made out, he cut some part of the horse's tail. I asked him what it was for, and he said it was because it should not be known. I believe Mr. Prothero found that part of the tail had been cut off.</p>

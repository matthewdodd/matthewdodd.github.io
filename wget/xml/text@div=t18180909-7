            . I am servant to Mrs. Bourchier. On the 3d of August, I was going to prepare the tray for supper. I was going into the parlour for some glasses, as soon as I got to the top of the kitchen stairs, opposite the street door, I saw the prisoner in the passage, as if coming out of the parlour, and going out at the street door. The street door was bolted inside at the time. He could not have got in at the door. He had some silver spoons and forks, in one hand, and the cruet stand and cruets in the other. I went quietly up to him, and asked what he was going to do with those things. He told me the house was being robbed, for he saw a man and a boy, get out of the parlour window. I wished him to return to the parlour, until I called the gentleman who was going to sup with my mistress, down. The parlour window was open, it being very hot weather. He gave the things to me, and went into the parlour. I went in with him, and gave the the alarm. The plate was kept in the parlour cupboard. I had not taken it out. A gentleman came down with my mistress immediately that I called out. The gentleman got a watchman, who took the prisoner and property.</p>

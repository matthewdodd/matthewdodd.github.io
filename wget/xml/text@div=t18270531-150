            . I am a watchman of Shoreditch. On the 16th of May, about a quarter-past five o'clock in the morning, I went to look after some of my pigeons; I turned round, and saw the prisoner on the top of a house, with a piece of lead in his hand; I went out after him - he got through a hole in the roof; I took the lead home, and kept it till he was taken; I am certain of his person. I afterwards saw it fitted to the top of the house, and it matched exactly. I have known him two years - the lead was rolled up in three pieces.</p>

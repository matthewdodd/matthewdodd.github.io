                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Samuel Light<lb></lb>foot—we are merchants and foreign banking agents. I know the house of Glaster and Co.—they are exchange-brokers—Mr. Daniel Glas<lb></lb>ter Foster is the only person in the firm to my knowledge—the prisoner Foster has latterly been the managing person in the business—Mr. Glaster Foster has been in infirm health for the last eighteen months—the prisoner is his nephew—we have had extensive bill transactions with that house, for many years—it is the business of exchange-brokers to negociate bill transactions between one house and another, receiving a com<lb></lb>mission from both houses—it is the custom, on those occasions, to state the particulars of the instrument, and as soon as the contract is passed, the seller sends the bill to the buyer, indorsed—in December last we had taken several bills, with the name of "B. Chesterman" as the indorser—I placed one in the prisoner's hand, which was returned from Dublin, protested in Feb<lb></lb>ruary, this year; the amount was 790<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Q.</hi> What passed further on that interrview? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He stated that there was no doubt as to his respectability, and if I would allow him to take the bill, he would fetch me the amount and charges—I placed the bill and protest in his hands for that purpose—he then left me—I think this was on the 14th of February—the repre<lb></lb>sentations that he had made of Chesterman were, that he was a man of the highest respectability, of property to a considerable amount, and was well known to his uncle and himself for many years—that his uncle had done business for him formerly, and he knew him to be worth at least 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that he was in the wine and spirit trade, and carried on business in Lincoln's inn-fields, and he believed he had a house at Brixton; and, finally, to induce me to take the bill, that he considered him of equal respectability to any house in London—this conversation was when he first presented the 790<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill; and he confirmed it when the bill was re<lb></lb>turned in February. I perceive by a contract I have in my hand, dated the "13th of December, 1834," in the prisoner's hand-writing, that I took from him a bill of Thomas Wilson, of London, on Belfast, for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; three bills on Dublin, of Messrs.

Chestermain for 880<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this memorandum was written by Foster, at the time of the transaction—it is his hand-writing, and is signed by the firm of Glaster and Co.—deducting the charges, 1 had to pay 858<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. fbr the bill—I paid it by a cheque on Willis and Co., my bankers—the signature to this cheque is my hand-writing—I gave 1t to the person who repre<lb></lb>sented himself as the clerk of B. Chesterman—the custom in London is to take the bills on one post-day, and pay for them on the next—Foster after<lb></lb>wards presented other bills with "B. Chesterman" on them, but we refused to take them—this was the last bill I took of him with the name of "Chesterman"—I had made some inquiries, and told him, from the in<lb></lb>quires I had made, no such person, as the acceptor was living at Sligo—he said there must be some mistake in that information, as he had been assured that Murphy had extensive dealings with Chetterman, and he stated that I might be perfectly satisfied; the bills I had ranning were perfectly safe, and any others I chose to take would be equally so—I told him I thought Mr. Chesterman had not exercised proper caution in trust<lb></lb>ing Murphy—he replied, that was his affair; Mr. Chesterman was perfectly safe, if the amount had been as many thousands as it was hundreds—he stated, that I might take it with as much safety as I could the indorse<lb></lb>ment of Harman and Co.: that house, is one of the first respectability in the City of London—whenhe came in February to ask me for the 790<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill to take to the indorser, he was gone about an hour and a half—he then returned, and paid me the amount and charges—the 880<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill would be due on the 14th of March—it should be paid in Dublin on that day—I received this note that day—it came by the Twopenny-post—it was after<lb></lb>wards shewn to Foster in my presence (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Messrs. Trye and Light-foot, Crosby-square, Bishopsgate-street—Sir, The bill for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and up<lb></lb>wards, is a forgery—due to-morrow, in Dublin—Foster is going; see to it"—I read the note "Foster is going to see to it"—I did not suppose but</p>

               <p>what he was going to look after it, and it did not excite my suspicion—I had occasion to go to Grosvenor-place shortly afterwards; I was gone nearly three hours—during my absence Mr. Lightfoot had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of seeing Foster—on my return, Foster followed me as I went up stairs to the counting-house—Mr. Lightfoot read the note, and said to Foster, "Why, Foster, this is as much as to say you are going;" and that directed my attention more particularly to the note—Mr. Lightfoot bantered him about it—neither of us had any suspicion whatever—I told him it looked rather suspicious—he stated that it did; and requested that I would preserve the note, in order to show it to his uncle—when we bantered him as to his running away, he said, it was perfectly safe—I thought so to, seeing the other bills were paid—I ex<lb></lb>pected the 880<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill from Dublin on the Monday—that is, the account of the bill, if it had been paid—this was on Saturday—I required that Foster would call on Monday to learn its fate—he agreed to do so—the bill did not arrive till Wednesday—Foster did not call on Monday—Tuesday was foreign post day—it was his custom always to call on that day—I did not see him that day; he did not come—I was not on Change myself, but my partner was—the bill arrived on Wednesday protested—it is a promissory note—this if it—I never saw Foster after that, till he was in custody, about the 1st or 2nd of April—the indorsement is, "Pay to Messrs. Trye and Lightfoot, or order, value of them; London, 13th of December, 1834. B. Chesterman"—I have frequently seen Foster write, and had consi<lb></lb>derable means of ascertaining the character of his hand-writing—I believe the words "Pay Messrs. Trye and Lightfoot" to be his hand-writing—I have no doubt of it, and I believe the signature "B. Chesterman" to be his, by a comparison of the letters and the way I have seen him write—I do believe it to be his.</p>

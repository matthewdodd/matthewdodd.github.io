               <p>I was at the station door, King's Cross Road, and saw the prisoners pass together—I knew Morton by sight—I watched them into a beershop in Kind's Cross Road and into the opposite bar and cautioned the landlord—I was in uniform—they left and went up Great Percy Street—Mr. Lloyd came up and I told him I should probably want assistance—they stopped opposite the Percy Arms, put their hands together, as if passing something from one to the other, and Boyce went into the Percy Arms—I entered just as the landlady was taking his money, and not to excite Boyce's suspi<lb></lb>cion I asked for the landlady and followed her to the back and called her attention to the money which was in her hand—she returned to the bar and said to the prisoner "This is a bad 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—he said "Is it?"—I took hold of him and said "I shall take you in custody"—I handed him over to the landlord and went out and seized Morton—he said "What is it, sir?" I said "I shall take you in custody for being concerned with another in passing bad money"—he became very violent—I dragged him across the street—his left hand was closed—he put his right hand to his left and dropped something, saying "I have got nothing"—I said "You have dropped something"—I was unable to pick it up, owing to his violence—I dragged him into the public-house where he pointed to Boyce and said "I don't know that man, he is a strauger to me, I have never seen him before"—no one bad made any reference to Boyce—Boyce turned round and Morton said "I don't know you, do 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>"—Boyce said "No"—a volunteer in uni<lb></lb>form came up, named Towers, and I pointed to the place where something was dropped and told him something—he went there and brought back a packet containing four counterfeit florins with paper between each—Morton tried to induce me to let him walk by himself—he then became very violent and tried to get away, but assistance came—I searched him at the station and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money, and on Boyce sis duplicates and 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze.</p>

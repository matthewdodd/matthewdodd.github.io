                  </hi>. I am a salesman in the Metropolitan Meat Market—I have known the prisoner three or four years—he has consigned pigs to me for sale, and I have paid him for them at the time—I had never lent him money previous to 20th April—on that day, he came to my place about 10 o'clock in the morning—after a little conversation ho said "By the bye, Broome, I have bought two horses, and I have not enough to pay for them with me, will you lend me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till I get home?"—I said "Yes, I don't mind, if you send me the money as soon as you <hi rend="italic">get</hi> back?"—he said "The fact is I am buying a third horse, and if I buy that I shall want more, and I will lot you know how much in an hour or two"—it was distinctly understood that he was to send me the money as soon as he got home—he went away, and returned about one o'clock in the day—he then said he had bought the third horse, and had not enough to pay for it by 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., would I lend him that—I said "Upon condition that the money comes back;" to which he consented—he said he was going to send the horses to Belfast—I drew this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) cheque for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which has been returned to me by my bankers—this is his endorsement on the back—when he got the cheque he went away—I wrote for and obtained his I 0 U for the amount—he said "There is no necessity for that, you will have the money as soon as I get home"—I said "Well, accidents may happen on the way home, and then your wife would not know you had ever had the money"—he then gave me this I 0 U (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my knowledge of him in business, and what he said, induced me to lend him the money—I should not, have lent him the money as a mere loan, it was his statement about the horses caused me to do so—the next communication I had from him was this circular notice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to creditors—in cones<lb></lb>quence of a letter I received I sent over Mr. Gore to Belfast, and, on his return to London, Mr. Gore applied for a warrant on my behalf.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There may have been forty or fifty transactions in the way of consignment of pigs between the prisoner and myself, during the three years—on the advance of this money there was no mention of pigs being sent over for it—he was asking how the trade was, and said he was sur<lb></lb>prised there were none, for he had written to his people at Belfast to send over some—I never enquired what he was to pay for the horses, nor their value—I made no further enquiries about the horses—when he came back the second time and spoke of the third horse, he did not say he was about buying some horses, and wanted money to pay for them; he said he <hi rend="italic">had</hi> bought—I sent Mr. Gore over to see whether it was not a case that would justify me in applying for a warrant—I think a week had expired before I made application for the money—I did not look upon that loan of money as a loan to a customer on his I 0 U—of course I should not lend £95 to a total stranger.</p>

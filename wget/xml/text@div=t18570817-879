                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I have pleaded guilty to this charge—I have known Whale some two years, or more—some time ago I was in the service of Messrs. Barnard and Rosenthal—I knew Whale at that time—I then left that service, and went into the service of Messrs. Hutton—I was still acquainted with Whale whilst at Hutton's—I then went back from Hutton's to Messrs. Barnard's again—I think I have been at Barnard's this last time nearly a year—my duty was in the top floor—I knew Whale while I was in the service of Barnards the last time—I have had trans<lb></lb>actions with him—they commenced about five months since—the first transaction was that of selling a parcel of silk—on that occasion I met him in Cheapside—we were talking together, and the conversation turned on business matters, matters concerning the silk trade—we were talking of the price of silk, and I asked him if he was open to buy a parcel; he said he was—about two or three weeks after that, I took him a parcel of silk—I cannot call to mind the quantity—I should imagine it was about a pound—I took it to his warehouse—I saw him, and asked if he would buy it—he said, "Yes"—he did not ask where I got it from, or anything about it—I got it from Messrs. Barnard's—I took it from them without their knowledge; I stole it—I believe Whale did not at that time know where I was living—I never said anything about being a traveller for a house in Spitalfields, or about coming from Spitalfields—he paid me at the rate of 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound for it—it was sewing silk, in skeins—I do not think there was an invoice made out for the first transaction—I went to him again, I think, about a week after, within a day or so, more or less—I took another parcel of silk, precisely the same kind as before, and stolen in the same way—I should imagine it was about the same quantity as before, or more—he bought it, and paid the same price for it, 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound—he paid me for it at the time—I think there was an invoice then given—Whale first men<lb></lb>tioned the invoice—I think his remark was, "You had better give me an invoice of this," which I did—it was made out in my own name—he said the price that was to be inserted was 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I put—all these invoices (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), are in my handwriting—they are all made out at 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believe there is no date on any one of these—these all relate to the earlier transactions with him—I had nine other transactions with him, after the first two, making eleven in all, for which I gave invoices without dates, and put in the price as 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the price always paid to me—all these other invoices (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in my handwriting, and have dates—I do not know how many there are—they are all priced at 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for all those—it was quite an oversight not putting the dates to these; Whale mentioned it—I went to him on each of these dates—I had thirty</p>

               <p>transactions with him during the five months—there was not a transaction so frequently as every two or three days, sometimes it would be ten or twelve days—I always went to him at dinner time, between 1 and 2 o'clock—I never said anything to him about dinner time—I have made the remark that I wanted to get back at 2 o'clock—I did not state any reason why—I never told him where I got the silk from—I have many times been with him to a public house when I have been about the silk—it was only to one public house—I do not know the sign of it; it is kept by a Mr. Phillips, in the Old Bailey—I have known Whale dine there three times, and I have been to see him there—we used to go back to the warehouse to transact business—he never talked about the business at all before the persons in the public house—I carried the silk to him in parcels and papers—it was done up in a piece of ordinary brown paper, or newspaper, or any waste paper—I believe Whale employs many workpeople—there has been one or two of them in the warehouse at the time I have gone there, but he has dismissed them when I went in to have the transactions—he is a fringe maker by trade—I remember being followed by the officer on 29th July, and being given into custody—I had been at Whale's on the Monday pre<lb></lb>viously—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the last invoice I ever gave him—I am quite sure I went on Monday, July 27th—I took him on that day the packet of silk represented by this invoice.</p>

Barnard—I also sent a note to Mr. Wontner, stating that I wished to see him—I afterwards saw him, and made a state<lb></lb>ment—I have never sold things that I have stolen to any one else but Whale—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the silk—they are all silks that I have taken to Whale, just in that state, and in skeins like that—the silk is manufactured, I believe, in Coventry—it is used by tons, I might say, in Spitalfields.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the detective officers of the City of London. Messrs. Barnard called in the assistance of myself and another officer—I watched their premises for some time—on 29th July, about 1 o'clock in the day, I saw Norris leave the premises; I and my brother officer followed him—he went into Aldersgate Street, into Newgate Street, and into the doorway of the Queen's Arms; when he came out of the door<lb></lb>way, he had this parcel under his arm—he then went into a butcher's shop in Newgate Street, then to a stationer's, and then to Bishop's Court, Old Bailey, where Whale resided—when he went into the stationer's, he pro<lb></lb>cured a newspaper, in which he wrapped his parcel—I did not see where he got the parcel from—I did not see it when he came out of the premises—when he bought the newspaper, he went into the passage of the Queen's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185708170072"></xptr>
               <p>Arms, and into a door way in the passage, and when he came out he had this parcel under his arm, wrapped up in the newspaper—he then went to Bishop's Court; that turns out of the Old Bailey—he went into No. 4 there—I did not then know it as the premises of Mr. Whale, I do now—when he got there, I heard him call Whale—a boy came to him in the passage, and told him Mr. Whale was not at home—I then went up to Norris, and after asking him some questions I took him into custody—I have here the parcel that I found in his possession; it contains sewing silk—as we were coming out of the door, we met Whale—Norris said, "This is Mr. Whale"—I said, "Do you know this young man?" pointing to Norris—he said, "Yes"—"Do you know what firm he represents, or where he is employed?"—he said, "I know him as a traveller from Spitalfields"—"Did you expect him to bring a parcel to you?"—"No"—"Have you done any business with him, or bought any silk of him?"—he stopped for a moment or two, he appeared to be thinking, and then he said, "Two or three times"—that was all that passed then—I took Norris to the station house—he was searched there, but no other property was found upon him but that which he had in the parcel—that weighs 2 lbs. 4 ozs.—after he was locked up, I accompanied Mr. Barnard to Whale's place again—I asked Whale to show me his books of the transactions he had had with Norris—he said he kept no books, but he had got invoices—I asked him to show me the last invoice of the last transaction he had had with Norris, and he gave me one of 30th June—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "June 30, 1857. Mr. Whale, bought of W. Norris, one coloured SS, 32, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Paid, W. Norris")—I then said, "Oh, you have done no business with him in July?)"—he said, "No, I have not seen him—he called on Monday, and left his name, but I did not see him"—I then asked him to let me see the whole of the invoices that he had got, and he pulled out about thirty or thirty-one invoices—these are them—one of these was found in his pocket book, the rest were on the file—Funnell found this one of 27th July at the warehouse—it was produced, and I called Whale's attention to it—he said, "Oh, yes, I quite forgot that"—the 27th July would be the Monday Whale had stated that Norris called, and he did not see him—Funnell had asked him if those were all the invoices, and he said, "If you are not satisfied, you had better look and see for yourself;" he did so, and found this—we found 35 lbs. of silk on the premises, that was claimed by Mr. Barnard—this produced is it—a parcel of 2 lbs. was found by Funnell, and kept separate; Funnell will speak as to that—I found on the file these other invoices—40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound is the price charged there—it was in consequence of finding those invoices on the file that Mr. Barnard gave Whale into custody—after this property was found, I heard Whale beg Mr. Barnard not to lock him up, he might take anything he liked.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business in partnership with Mr. Rosen<lb></lb>thal, at No. 134, Cheapside—our business is very extensive—the number of persons we employ varies according to the season of the year, sometimes from 400 to 500 persons—we are silk manufacturers—Norris has been in our employment twice—he has been with us about thirteen months I think the last time—he was a giver out of silk—he was stationed in the upper floor of our warehouse, our silk room—for some reasons I had I made a communication to the police, and obtained the assistance of the two detec<lb></lb>tives who have been here to-day—on 29th July they showed me some silk which they had found on Norris—it would be worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is worth 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound; some of it is worth more; some of the silks are more expensive—the pink is worth 46<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in consequence of the extra value of the dye—except that, the whole of that parcel, to the best of my belief, is of the same quality—after that communication had been made to me, I went with the officers to Bishop's Court—Whale is a small trimming manufacturer in the same kind of business as our own, a maker of fringe—we make fringe, and this silk is the character of silk used for fringe purposes—I saw Whale on that occasion—I said to him, "You have been buying silk of a person of the name of Norris?"—he said, "I have"—I then said, "Have you had many transactions with him?"—he replied, "Two or three"—I then said, "At this moment I believe you to be a respectable man, and I shall treat you accordingly; presuming you to be such, show me your cash book"—his reply was, "I do not keep a cash book"—I expressed considerable surprise at his not doing so, and told him that that was the first element requisite in a house of business, and I considered it highly irregular; his answer to which was, "Being in a small way of business, I did not think it so very necessary," or words, to that effect—I then said, "In the absence of your cash book, the next thing I shall require to see will be your invoice files; show me your invoices?" which he did—I looked over those files, and in the course of my examination I found a number of invoices, some with dates, others without; I then said to him, "You appear to have had not only two or three transactions with this man, but many, and doubtless are doing a largish sort of trade, and you sell cheap;" his reply to which was, "Yes, I do as well as I can, and I am obliged to buy cheap to sell cheap"—I then</p>

               <p>expressed some surprise that no address of the seller was given on these invoices, and asked him if he knew where he lived—he said, "No, I do not"—while looking over those invoices, I discovered several other invoices of other houses, which sets forth the value of the silk as very much more than the price on the other invoices—Whale was asked when he had seen Norris last, and when he had had the last transaction with him, and he answered, "I have not had any transactions with him in July"—I cannot say that I recollect anything being said about the last invoice or the last transaction, in my hearing—he was asked when he had last seen Norris, and he said he had not seen him, but he believed he had called on Saturday—I think this was Wednesday—I think Monday was the day he named—I then claimed the whole of this silk as mine—there was a very small quantity that I did not claim—he had a number of remnants and odd<lb></lb>ments, but he had very little else besides this in that form; he had some of that kind of silk, not so much as you have on the table there—there is 37 lbs. or 39 lbs. there I think altogether—I do not know the weight of what he had besides this, and I did not weigh it—(<hi rend="italic">George Scott.</hi> I weighed it; there was 10 lbs. left)—After I had found the invoices, I went round the shop, or room, or warehouse, whatever it is called, and I immediately saw this silk; it was covered with a wrapper—I said, "This silk is mine"—he said, "Yes, this is the silk I bought of Norris; you may take it away, only don't give me into custody"—I afterwards found the parcel that lies before me—I said, "Why, here is another parcel of the silk"—he said, "Oh, yes, this is what I bought last Monday, and I had forgotten it"—I have gone through the invoices that were found—they amount in quantity to 63 lbs. 13 ozs.; that includes the whole number of invoices found by myself—the value of it is about 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound at least; some of it is worth 46<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know the weight of that—there is none of less value than 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am now speaking of the ordinary market value.</p>

Q.</hi> You are in a very large way of business, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Moderately so—I should say we were in a much larger way than Whale—we never sell silk; we buy silk, and manufacture it into goods, and sell them, not only fringe, but anything else—we buy our silk in the raw state occasionally; sometimes we buy it thrown—raw silk is silk which has undergone no process, and has simply been wound from the coomb—silk in the gum is silk which has undergone the process of throwing; that is, two or three ends of fine silk are thrown together, and form a thread, from which we weave—we buy our silk raw, in the gum, and dyed—we do not dye our<lb></lb>selves—there is no process of gumming; it is throwing—we are not throw<lb></lb>sters—we only buy occasionally in the raw state—the great bulk is bought in the gum—occasionally, when out of a special colour, we buy it ready dyed; that is rather an exception—I should not think there was silk to the amount of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Whale's premises—I did not know before this that there was such a man in being—there was not the slightest concealment of the silk—the invoices were given up to me after some hesitation—I should say there was only a fair amount of hesitation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Any man might hesitate before he showed his invoices? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite so—I occasionally buy silk myself—the value of this is 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the state in which it now is—if I wanted to buy it, I should have to pay 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a lb. for it in any quantity—if I wanted 1 cwt. of it, I should pay the same price as for 1 lb.—the price in the gum depends on the year, and the quantity of silk in the market—silk will vary forty per cent sometimes—it is dearer now than ever it was—it has varied forty per cent, during the last</p>

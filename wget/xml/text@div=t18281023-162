               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who was he talking to in the Curtain-road? A. To a tall man,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230070"></xptr>who turned away, said Good bye, and went to Chapel-street.</p>

            . On Saturday, the 11th of October, the little boy came to my house to fetch a pair of trousers and a waistcoat - I gave them to him in a silk handkerchief; in about an hour he returned, and said I had given him a wrong bundle - I said, "No such thing;" he said,"You must come to my father" - I went, and in going back he said there stood a man just like the man who took his parcel; I said, "If you think it is him, go and fetch your father" - he fetched him, and he took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the prisoner when the boy said, "That is like the man who took my parcel?" A. Twenty or thirty yards perhaps - he stood then talking to another tall man.</p>

            . I am eight years old. I was coming down the Curtain-road with David Simeon; the prisoner called him, and said "What have you got there?" he said"My brother's trousers and waistcoat;" the prisoner said"Where did you come from?" he said "From Mr. Pratt, in Henrietta-street;" the prisoner said "Mrs. Pratt sent me to say she gave you the wrong parcel, and to give you this;" he took that parcel, and gave him another; he then ran away with it; this was about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know the time? A. I heard the beer-man going along - it was near the corner public-house that the prisoner took the bundle; I am sure he ran away; I have been talking with my father and mother about this business, and to David - I had never seen the prisoner before - it was about thirty yards from the public-house; he ran straight along, so fast that I could not see him; I saw him again about twenty-five minutes past one o'clock.</p>
               <p>DAVID SIMEON. My mother gave me a silk-handkerchief - I went to Mrs. Pratt's for a bundle with

            , and as we were coming back, the prisoner said"Stop! what have you got there?" I told him, and he said"Mrs. Pratt gave you the wrong parcel, and you must take this;" he took that one from my arm - I took the one he gave me home to my mother; she opened it, and sent me back with it to Mrs. Pratt; as I was coming back, I saw the prisoner with another man - I described him; in the parcel I took home there were five pieces of tiles, some handkerchiefs, and some old stockings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say the man ran away with it? A. Yes - this was near the public-house; it was near the same place that I saw the prisoner afterwards - that was the reason why I charged him as being the man; there was a crowd round.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for and took the prisoner; he denied it, but the boys said he was the man - some woman came up, and said she had been in his company till very near the time they charged him with it; I think she said till within ten minutes, or something like that, of two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear that the hour of two was mentioned? A. That did not take my attention at the time; I would not be bound to swear it; it is my belief that she did say so.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What took place? A. The prosecutor came up, collared him, and charged him with taking a bundle from his son; the prisoner said "I am not the man; I took no bundle;" I went away.</p>

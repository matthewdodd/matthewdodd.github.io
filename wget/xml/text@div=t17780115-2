My master went into Yorkshire on the 15th of June, and returned on the 20th of November. When I went out of town, I put the cloaths up in the cloaths-press: when I came to town, I went to the press and missed the cloaths mentioned in the indictment. After I had made all the enquiry I could in the house, I advertised them.</p>

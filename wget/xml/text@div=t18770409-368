                  </hi>. I have been for some time living with the prisoner as his wife at Crown Court, Spitalfields—on the morning of 29th March we were in bed, and I asked him to get up to go to his work—he said "God bless you," and wished me good morning, and I wished him the same and dozed off to sleep again—I was awakened by a blow, and found the prisoner by me with this chopper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand—I took it from him—I was cut and bleeding—I caught hold of his hand and said "What do you mean to kill me?"—he said "Yes I do, you will lock me up"—I said "I will not lock you up if you will get me some water"—I said that to get him out-" side the door—he went out and I never saw him afterwards till I saw him at the station—he was quite sober, he does not drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. You did not ask me the night before what you were to do with your things to go to sea with, nor did I say that I did not care—you did not ask me in the morning where you were to get four breakfast from, nor did I tell you you might steal it, we never had a word—there was no quarrel between us.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. I have lived with him just over two years—he was always saying that he had got a ship and asking me to borrow money to get food for him—the chopper was kept in the cupboard in our bedroom.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 201). On 29th March, about 7.30 a.m., the prisoner came to the station in a very excited state and wanted to see the inspector—I took him to the inspector, and he said that he had done some<lb></lb>thing—the inspector asked him what he had done—he said "I believe I have killed a woman at 6, Crown Court, I wish you would send somebody there directly"—I went there and found the prosecutrix standing against the door bleeding very much from her ear and head—she gave me this chopper and said that her husband struck her on the head with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am divisional surgeon—I examined the prosecutrix at the station—she had a lacerated wound through her ear, and a wound exposing the temporal bone—the same blow probably inflicted both they—they were not dangerous of themselves—this chopper would inflict them—it is not very sharp, which accounts for the jagged nature of the wounds—it was not into the bone, but it exposed the covering of the bone—not much violence had been used, but it is a very heavy instrument and any blow with it would be serious—the temporal bone is very strong and would resist a good deal of force—I saw the prisoner at the station, but my attention was not specially called to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. H. E. and M. Moses, of cannon-street, man Chester warehousemen—the prisoner was in their employ, in the branch establishment in Bow-lane, as a tailor—our work-room is over a gateway—there are two entrances to the workshop—I lock them up at night, at 8 o'clock, sometimes a few minutes past, because if they are busy, we must wait till they are all off—we open about 8 o'clock in the morning—I recollect having locked the gates on 27th February, at about twenty-five minutes past—I should say there was no one in the premises at that time—it is my duty to look round every night and see whether there is any one on the premises—there is in that room a compound, that is, a part of the room railed off; a dock—in that compound there is a desk, and this drawer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the night in question there was in that drawer 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. In the first compartment, the part nearest to the lock, all in silver; 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Odd, in the second compartment, in gold; and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Odd, in gold, in the third—I locked up that drawer and desk and the com<lb></lb>pound that night, before I left—I saw the prisoner on the premises as late as twenty minutes past 8 o'clock that night—I returned next morning at a few minutes before—two men, one of whom was daily, came in with me—I found no difficulty in opening the gate; there was no violence to that lock—about 9 o'clock I went to the drawer in which the money was, and I found it in the condition in which it now is—close to the drawer there was a pair of tailor's scissors, which I had not seen before—I do not think the drawer could have been opened with them, but there were other tools—the silver was gone—there was a chair upon a table outside the partition, so that anybody could get over into the compound—the chair was not on the table when I left, the night before—upon discovering it I had a com<lb></lb>munication with a boy named levy, from which I gave directions to a constable to go after the prisoner—it was the prisoner's duty to be on the premises at 8 o'clock, as well as the other men—I did not see him at all that day.</p>

            . I received the money from this lady. I went to the shop and purchased 1 lb. of arrow root, and a pot of golden ointment, for which I paid the money she gave me to the prisoner; he gave me sixpence in charge out of the till - I should know the money again.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES. I went to my till about a quarter before nine o'clock on that Saturday morning, (the purchase was made at eight;) I found only one of the half-crowns and the shilling - I afterwards, with the assistance of Clements, searched the prisoner's box; I found the half-crown in it - this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Have you any other shopman? A. No; there were other shillings and sixpences in the till, about the same money I had seen in at seven o'clock, when we opened the shop - we generally take from two to five shillings in the morning; I never knew him to go to the till and take change for any money- it is not usual in my shop, though I do not know that I should have objected to it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you a drawer from which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280061"></xptr>you gave change? A. Yes; but he had no access to that.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CLEMENTS. I am an officer. I went to Mr. Jones', and searched the prisoner's box; I found in it this small box, containing three half-crowns, twelve sixpences, and nine shillings - I think there were two sovereigns in it, which the prisoner had; this is the half-crown which the prosecutor identified - it is marked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner there? A. Yes; it was in his bed-room - he pointed it out to me; I took the key out of his pocket and opened the box.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES. This is the half-crown - here is a sort of a J. under the head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had he been in your service? A. About five years - I went for his character, but did not see the gentleman; he had conducted himself with propriety up to this time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you say what money had been paid him that morning? A. No; there might have been 2s. 6d. substituted.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 242, Burdett Road—prior to 18761 had some transactions with the defendant—at the time he filed his petition he owed me 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd; I proved that against him in liquidation—when the arrangement was made 1 received five promissory notes, each for half-a-crown in the pound, making a total of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound, which were to be payable from 28th December, 1876, at three, six, nine, twelve, and fifteen mouths—two of them were due when I instituted these proceedings and were dishonoured—two became due subsequently and were dis<lb></lb>honoured, and one is not due yet—before I received those notes, on 18th October, 1876, I gave the prisoner 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on this I O U—that was not paid and I commenced proceedings in the Bow County Court.</p>

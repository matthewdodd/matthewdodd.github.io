                  </hi>. I am a matting manufacturer, Three Colt Lane, Lime-house—on 14th July, about 6 o'clock, I was in New Road, Limehouse and saw two men near the bridge apparently looking for something—the prisoner is one of them—he seized me by my throat—I got from his grasp, and as soon as I did so the other got hold of my arms from behind and nearly broke one arm. We went over and over, and the prisoner kept mauling me and catching hold of my hair, and my hair came out, and then he kicked me on top of my head and on my back—I felt his hands in my pockets and they were turned inside out—I said, "Are you men? Do you want to murder, me?" and I had no sooner said so than the prisoner held me by my throat and smashed my head against the wall—the other one was holding me—I saw my watch in his hand and Made a snatch at it; it had a braid guard to it, and then the other one fan—we had a desperate struggle for it, but I got it back—the guard was broken and the bow—he made a sharp run for three or four steps, but Mr. Waller stopped him, and I did not lose sight of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bridge House, Hope Lane—on 14th july I was standing outside my house about 6 p.m. and saw Watts coming towards me, and the prisoner and a man who escaped, following</p>

               <p>him—they walked across to Watts, and hustled him up against the wall about 100 yards from me—they had a struggle, and one man ran up the New Road—the prisoner walked towards me, and I said, "I shall knot you again, old <hi rend="italic">chap.</hi> when I see you again." He said, "What for?" I said, "Because you have been stopping that gentleman coming over the bridge and attempting to rob him"—Watts was doing up his clothes. He came up and said, "That is the scoundrel who has been trying to rob me," and showed me his watch, and said, "He has been trying to get it, but could not"—the prisoner said it was all false; he knew nothing about it; he was passing by—I said, "It is a lie; I can trust my eyes"—I had never lost sight of him from the time he was struggling with Watts—he had had a little to drink.</p>

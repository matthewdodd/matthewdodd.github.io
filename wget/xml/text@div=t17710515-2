            . I live in Parliament-Court, Artillery-Lane, Bishopsgate-street; on the twenty-fourth of April, about twelve o'clock in the evening, as I was coming home, between Webb's Square and a bun house, called Union Row House, in Shoreditch, I saw a man and woman standing at the end of Webb Square as I passed by it; I went on a little further; I thought I heard somebody behind me; I turned back and saw five people; I turned my head again, and walked on; a man came up to my right side, and put his other hand over my eyes, he told me if I made a noise he would blow my brains out; he lifted his hand a little off my eyes, and I saw a man at my left side with a pistol, I believe; I felt something under my car which I believed to be a pistol; he then closed his hand fast to my eyes again; so that I could not see; then somebody came behind me and pinioned my arms; and then another came and rifled my pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they keep the pistol at your head all the time?</p>
               <p>Garrat. I could not tell, as they nded my eyes; they took to the value of six guineas in cash, my watch and ring, and they took my pocket book from me which had in it a note of 5 l. and another of 50 l. I begged for it again; I bade them go under a lamp and they would see there was nothing in it of value; they gave it to me again; one of them came up to me and brought my cane back;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150004"></xptr> while he gave it me he held his head back that I might not see him; they tell me that he has cut his hair off since, if so, it is Suttle: but he used me very well for a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all men you saw behind you, when you turned your head?</p>
               <p>Garrat. There was but one tall as I observed then; the person that first came up with the pistol seemed to have dark hair, but his hand was upon my eyes immediately. I I never got any of the things again; the evidence says my things were sold to one Lyons a Jew, who is gone off.</p>

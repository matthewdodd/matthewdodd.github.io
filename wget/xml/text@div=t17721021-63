            's at times; I have known the prisoner about two years and a half; he was convicted last October sessions, I think, for picking a gentleman's pocket in St. Paul's Church Yard, of a silk handkerchief; I was in court at the time of his trial; he was found guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him receive sentence?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No; I was not present at the passing sentence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his being at large since that time?</p>
               <p>Clarke. The first time I saw him, after he returned, was in Wood-street Compter.</p>

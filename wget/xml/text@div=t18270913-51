On the 22d of August, the prisoner came into my shop with another person, having the appearance of a foreigner; the prisoner entered first, and asked to see some gold bracelets and ear-rings, which I showed him; the bracelets were not handsome enough, and he asked to see the ear-rings, which I showed him - they were gold; he selected five or six pairs of gold ear-rings, and requested I would take them up to No. 37, Baker-street, Portman-square; he gave me the name of James Butler, and said he would undertake to say one pair would be kept, as he wanted to make a pre<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130056"></xptr>sent to a lady; he told me to be there between nine and eleven o'clock next morning - I had told him the prices - he liked the handsomest pair best.

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor - I saw the prisoner in the shop on the 22d of August; he had been there about a minute when I came in; a person, having the appearance of a foreigner, was with him - they were looking at gold ear-rings, which my husband had taken out of the case to show them; the prisoner was the only one who spoke; a tray laid on the glass case, close to the prisoner, but not close to the foreigner; the tray had been drawn out, and laid on the glass case - I had put that tray to rights not half an hour before, and had seen a gold watch in it, set with turquoise on both sides - it cost my husband ten guineas - the selling price was fourteen guineas, which mark was on it; as soon as I came into the shop, the prisoner said, "Give me a piece of paper, and I will write my address," which he did; he then said,"You will be with me to-morrow morning between nine and ten o'clock, and I will promise you that one pair of the ear-rings I will keep:" they went out of the shop - the pair he thought he should keep was 10l. or ten guineas; he said he was going to make a present of them to a young lady; I suspected them, and within a minute of their leaving the shop, I missed the gold watch I before mentioned; the prisoner stood near the case - the other, I do not think, was within reach of the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. McDOWELL. Q. How long had the prisoner been in the shop before you entered? A. About a minute, because I was in the parlour with the door open when they came in. I heard what passed, and could see what was done in the shop. I always observe if a second person is in the shop, but being engaged in stringing coral, I could not immediately go into the shop - I was noticing them all the time, and could see who was nearest the counter. I could not see what he was doing with his hands certainly. I left off stringing the coral the moment they came in. I could see that the other man did not move from the place he stood in, and it is my firm belief, that he was not near enough to the case to touch the watch - the prisoner was close to the case - our shop is a large one - it has been a parlour, it is on the south side of the square, next door but one to the Bazaar; there is only one counter, which continues down the shop, and then turns the corner. I have a full view of the counter as I sit at work - the parlour is large. I sit at a table close to the door, in order to have a view of the shop. I rose from my seat immediately they came in, but it was a minute before I entered the shop. I had my suspicions when they came in.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner stood near the tray, of course you observed his movements very narrowly? A. I could not see his hands - I could see his face - he had been in the shop before, and raised my suspicions before. I could not see his hands move - he was too clever to let me do that. I endeavoured to get into the shop as soon as I could. I did not see him remove any thing from the tray. I discovered the loss immediately they left the shop, and mentioned it to my husband - he did not follow them - he did not suspect them before, or he might have caught them. I looked at the ear-rings first, then looked at the tray, and missed the watch, and told my husband; he immediately went to Baker-street, to see if such a person lived there; the prisoner had looked at the bracelets before I entered the shop; he never spoke to the foreigner - he entered the shop first, and the foreigner close at his heels - they were together; my attention was not directed to one more than the other - I had a full view of both of them; if half a dozen persons were in the shop they could not get out of my view - the foreigner might be a yard from the prisoner; he stood out in the shop, not at the counter; he only looked at one pair of ear-rings, but did not touch them - the prisoner showed them to him, and he merely nodded.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course he stood close to the foreigner when he showed him the ear-rings? A. No - he did not; he held them up to him. I do not believe he spoke to the foreigner at all, if he did, it was something very quiet.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 92, St. Martin's-lane. On the 22d of August, (I think it was towards the evening) the prisoner came to our shop, and offered to pawn this gold watch - there was a Frenchman outside the door, on the steps, he wanted 5l. on it. I offered him 3l.; he said he was afraid that would not do, he would inquire; he went to the door, spoke to the person who was waiting, then came back and took the 3l.; he gave me the name of

            , No. 18, Castle-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the value of the watch, in your opinion? A. I should think about 6l.; I should think that the extent at this present time; there has been no particular alteration in the value lately; it is a common French watch; it is set with turquoise, which is a common stone; 6l. is the outside value, I supposed the other man to be a foreigner.</p>
               <p>MR. ELY re-examined. I went to the house in Baker-street, and found no such person as Butler lived there. I paid ten guineas for the watch; they would not make the cases in this country for the money - there is a great deal of work in them - it is mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. How do you know it? A. As well as I should know you, if I saw you to-morrow. I have had it eight years, and then paid ten guineas for it; I think now it might be bought for eight guineas; the works are very good. I would give eight guineas for it now, if I wanted it to sell again; the prisoner stood close to the tray; the foreigner was as far off as I am from that lamp (about a yard and a half) - I do not think he was nearer; he did not move but once, I believe. I did not see the watch in either of their hands; I never said I had - there were seven on the tray, but I did not see them touch one; they did not ask to see watches. I did not hear any conversation between the prisoner and the foreigner; it was about three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Your Lordship must have remarked on the former trial, that I did not seek, in the least degree, to question the testimony of the witnesses; but, I declare to God, there is such wilful and corrupt perjury in this case, that it cannot pass without remark. I declare positively that Mr. Ely, before the Magistrate,(though not exactly under examination at the time) stated that he saw the watch in the hands of the foreigner; that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130057"></xptr>I was near the window, and the case was about the middle of the counter, and the foreigner, being in the middle of the shop, it was impossible for me to have touched the watch. I declare he stated this to the Magistrate, though it is not in his deposition. On my former trial these persons were in Court, and as they found the Jury acquitted me, supposing I was only the interpreter, they have judged it necessary to charge their statement. The lady particularly expressed her intention of prosecuting me, and hanging me. I understand, from good authority, that the gentleman himself said he would prosecute me, and showed the most decided intention of making me his victim. When I went into the shop I spoke French from beginning to end. The prosecutor says he showed me several pairs of ear-rings and bracelets, and the lady says I was not a minute in the shop before she saw me. I trust you will consider these circumstances, and make allowance for my accomplice (as it is supposed), being absent. I shall call Norman, the pawnbroker, who will state how I appeared when he accused me of having gone to several shops; that I appeared totally innocent from my manner, and went immediately before the Magistrate; it was my own proposition; he insisted on my going out of the shop myself, while he made inquiry. I was prepared to answer this charge, but being now unprepared by this wilful perjury on the part of this gentleman and his wife, I am deprived of the means of rebutting it immediately.</p>
               <p>MR. ELY re-examined. Q. Did you, before the Magistrate, say the watch was in the hands of the foreigner? A. I did not; I do not believe a word was said but what was taken down in writing; my deposition was not taken before the Magistrate, but by a clerk in an office; the prisoner was not present at my conversation; I did not at any time state the watch had been in the hands of the foreigner, and have no idea of its ever being in his hands. I have taken great pains to find the foreigner, thinking him the worst, he being old enough to be the prisoner's father. I should suppose him about forty-five years old, but he took my attention very little, as he took no part in the business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner (reading.) At the latter end of June, on my return from France, I came by Dieppe to Brighton, on board the steam-packet. I entered into conversation with a Frenchman, who had all the appearance of a gentleman, with whom an intimacy was soon established; he told me he had already visited England, and had some acquaintances in London, but had no knowledge whatever of the English language. I immediately offered my services, and we came to London together; on our arrival we put up at the same hotel, from whence he requested me to accompany him to Giraudier's hotel, in the Haymarket, where he said he had lodged before; he then inquired for Mrs. Giraudier's brother, who had served him as an interpreter during his former stay in England, but was told that, from a situation he now occupied, he was prevented from acting in the same capacity; then, and not till then, did he propose to me to act as his interpreter, promising to remunerate me for my loss of time; I acceded to his request, and then he confided to me that he was by profession a jeweller - that his object in coming to England was to inform himself of the price of every article in that line; after which he intended to have a large quantity of French jewellery brought to England if the prices suited - thus we went about to different jewellers, where he always contrived to employ me in writing what he dictated, which prevented me from observing his proceedings: he now and then begged me to act as if for myself alleging as his reason, that a Frenchman asking the price of English jewellery, might excite suspicion, as every article was much cheaper in France than in England; and his being a foreigner would induce them to ask a larger price; this was so plausible, I did not hesitate to do as I was told. In the course of a fortnight he gave me a ring to pawn; and on expressing my astonishment at his being obliged to resort to those means, he replied, that not receiving remittances as he expected, he found himself short of money; in a word, he accounted for every thing in so natural and plausible a manner, that I am convinced any person in Court would have been deceived as I was. I shall now proceed to the cause of my apprehension. I went to Mr. Norman's with the Frenchman to pledge a diamond pin. Mr. Norman informed me he had received positive information that two persons, answering our description, had committed robberies to a large amount, and that he was obliged to ask me how I became possessed of the diamond pin. I translated what he said to my companion, who immediately took flight, while I remained astonished at his sudden departure. Mr. Norman begged me to give my name and address, which I immediately did - and said he would make inquiry if I returned in a quarter of an hour. I offered to remain while he made these inquiries; but he told me it was not necessary. I returned in a quarter of an hour, and he said, in consequence of information he had received, he felt it his duty to give me in charge of a constable; but on seeing my companion was absent, he told me to bring him with me. I went to three houses where he was in the habit of going; and not finding him there, I was going home, and, near my own door, I met Mr. Ely and another man, who called upon me to go before a Magistrate. I accompanied them without the least hesitation, and have not since seen the Frenchman.</p>
               <p>MR. ELY. I reached a pair or two of ear-rings out of the window, and most likely the watch was taken then, as my back was turned to him during that time.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Norman, a pawnbroker, of Princes-street, Soho. I know the prisoner - I was present when he came to our shop, accompanied by a foreigner; the last time he came was when Perren brought a diamond brooch; I believe that is about three weeks ago, it was the day the prisoner was apprehended - he came to the shop, accompanied by Perren, before he was taken into custody - Mr. Norman communicated to him his suspicions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner return to your shop in a quarter of an hour after those suspicions were communicated? A. Yes - he returned with me; Mr. Norman sent me to inquire if he lived in Pulteney-street; I went to his lodging, to inquire, while he remained at the shop - he heard me sent to his lodgings, and just as I was returning the prisoner came up to me; Mr. Norman had let him go out of the shop - he returned with me to our shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the charge against him at that time? A. Mr. Norman suspected him of having stolen a brooch. I heard no charge made about this watch at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is a French watch, and if I had had any suspicion that would have driven it away - I was led to suppose it belonged to him.</p>

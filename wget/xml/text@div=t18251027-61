            . I am a carpenter - I work for Mr. John Kirby. On the 10th of October I left a basket of tools with a plane and a square in it, while I went to get a pot or two of porter; I stopped there till between ten and eleven o'clock; I was not the worse for liquor; when I went away I met the prisoner in Ball's-pond-road; he asked where I was going - I said home; he said "Don't go home - it is late - you can't get in:" we went up to the house out of which I came - he knocked down some boards, and we laid down and went to sleep. I awoke before day-light - I had put the tools under the floor, close by my side; when I first awoke he was there - I went to sleep, and when I awoke again he was gone - the square and saws were missing, which had been in my basket the night before, when I left the public-house - I afterwards found the tools at some pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. How many friends had you at the public-house? A. Only one; we had drank but three pots of beer - the basket had been by my side - there might have been a dozen people in the public-house. I did not keep my eye on my basket all the time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you take the prisoner? A. To the watch-house, and searched him. I left him alone before he was searched, while I got a pen and ink, but I do not think he had time to have destroyed any thing.</p>

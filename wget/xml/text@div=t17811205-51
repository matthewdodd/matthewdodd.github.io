My master sent for an officer, and we sent him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Where had he got the firkin from? - I know I left two firkins with that mark at the door when I went away, it had a mark J M in chalk upon it, it was going to Stratford, I saw my masters' cut mark, besides the chalk mark; living many years with him, I knew the mark; I said it is a wrong thing of you to take such a thing away, at such a time of day; he said he did it through necessity.</p>

If I had stole it, I would hardly have carried it back to the shop with him.</p>

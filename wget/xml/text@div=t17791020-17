On the 7th of September, I missed some olive coloured lustring, about two or three and twenty yards, and a sattin petticoat; I made an enquiry, but could get no intelligence of them.</p>
               <p>When had you seen those things? - Not for some time before. I had been in the country; the petticoat had not been made, to my knowledge, above a week. On the 25th of September I missed the black silk; I suspected the prisoner; I had no suspicion of her before that; she was servant to Mr. Hughes.</p>
               <p>Did you miss any thing else that day? - I did not, because it was late in the evening and I had no opportunity of making application to the books.</p>
               <p>Where was the silk that morning that it led you to suspect her? - It lay on a compter close to the stairs that she went down to go into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Do the stairs come down into the shop? - They do; I advised with Mrs. Hughes, Mr. Hughes was out of town.</p>
               <p>When did you last see that silk in the shop? - On Thursday evening I shewed it to a customer; it lay upon that compter; they are locked within shutters in the night; I missed it on Saturday afternoon about four or five o'clock; I asked the two apprentices if they had seen it; they could give no account of it; I communicated it to my mistress, and insisted on having a constable to search the house as I suspected it was in the house, but upon enquiry, I thought it not necessary as I found the prisoner had no large boxes to keep clothes in; my mistress examined every where in the house that she could think of but could not find it; I enquired if the prisoner had been out that day or the day before; I found she had not, and imagined she would take the silk out that night if she had it, and I was determined to watch her; I found she was going out between eight and nine o'clock; I went out before her, and crossed the way to watch the door; I saw her coming out, it happened to be very light that night.</p>
               <p>Was it moon-light? - I believe it was; but there are many lamps about Charing-cross; when I first went out I saw a woman standing near the door; it struck me then that the woman who stood there was an accomplice of her's; when the prisoner came out she pressed this woman, made a stop, and looked at her and she seemed to call to her.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her? - No; I was too far off; She passed the woman; of a sudden she stopped and went back a little, and she peeped as if looking for this woman; then she proceeded, and stopped again a little below Northumberland-house; I stood still to observe what might pass between the woman and she; the woman did not come after her; somebody came out of our house, whether she was aware of them or me I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did she speak to that woman afterwards? - She did not; I crossed the way and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177910200039"></xptr> intercepted the prisoner, and asked her where she was going; when I came up to her, I saw she had a large bundle in her apron; she made me several trivial answers, which I cannot remember; I think she said the bundle contained foul linen, but I am not certain to the answer she made; I took hold of her and said Sally, I am afraid you have got some of Mr. Hughes's property here; she said, indeed I have, I beg your pardon; I took her in doors and opened the bundle, in which I found about eighteen yards and a half of black silk, a stuff petticoat, and a piece of stuff (producing them) the silk was cut and doubled up in small quantities.</p>
               <p>What is the value of this silk? - About 4 l. she was conducted up stairs, and asked why she had done so, and in the mean time, I sent for a constable to search her pockets; I asked her about the other silks she said she did not know any thing of them.</p>
               <p>Did you make use of any threats when you said you thought she had Mr. Hughes's property? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor promises if she would make a discovery? - No; I said when she was taken up stairs, if she expected any kind of mercy she had better confess where the other things were, for I thought she must know; she said she did not know any thing of them.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing of that sort before? - Not a syllable; the constable took charge of her and examined her pockets, and found a number of keys, which she said belonged to some boxes she had out of doors, and two of them to a tea-chest and small box below stairs; I desired they might be brought up and in the tea-chest under the cannister were found a number of pawn brokers duplicates; which led to the discovery of the other goods we had missed, and some that were not missed; she said that now, as every thing was come to light, she would confess the whole.</p>
               <p>(The duplicates were produced in court and road.)</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing in the box? - Nothing at all; she was that evening sent to the watch-house; she gave me information who the pawnbrokers were that the duplicates belonged to; I went the same night to the different pawnbrokers, and found the things; their names are Richards, Weston, and Smith, they are here.</p>

            , my master, rents the house. I keep my box up in the workshop. On the 23d of December I missed all this property - it was safe the day before; the prisoner worked in the shop; he came to work at six o'clock, knocked at my door, and I gave him the key of the shop. I heard him go out in about a quarter of an hour. I went to my box about ten o'clock, and missed all this property; the prisoner never returned; he was apprehended on the 29th of May. He came to me three times that morning for a light.</p>

            . I work in the same shop. On this morning I went into the shop about a quarter after six o'clock, the prisoner was then standing by the side of the prosecutrix's box; he appeared flurried, and went out directly. I asked him where he was going - he said into the yard, but I heard him go out at the street-door; he did not return.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had quarrelled about not coming sooner to work, and went this morning at half-past six o'clock. I told them I was working for 1 s. less than others, and should suit myself as soon as I could. I was rather poorly that day, and went to take a walk. I bought some oranges, and have been selling them about Spitalfields ever since. The lady said she had been robbed, that she did not know it was me, but she would take me up for my d - d impudence, and would have me hung or transported.</p>

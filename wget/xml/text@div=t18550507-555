                  </hi>. I carry on business with my father, Solomon Harris, at No. 195, St. George-street, St. George's, as outfitters—we keep a good many men—last Saturday week the prisoner purchased a pair of trowsers for 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a waistcoat for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was to pay for them when he was paid off at Green's home, in three or four days—that is one of the usual places to pay sailors—before the day on which he was to be paid off, we lent him sums of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a time, amounting to 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him a bill of the 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the price of the clothes—I saw him before he went to Green's home to receive his money, and he said, "I have not got any money," and he borrowed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay his expenses down, it being at Blackwall, and about three miles off by railway—I saw him down to Green's home, but did not get my money—I was present, and saw him pay some money to a girl, and to Mr. Pike—I afterwards went with him to our shop, into the back room—I asked him to pay for my clothes—he said that he had no money—then he said he had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Wells-street Sailors' Home—I did not believe him, and persuaded him to pull off the trowsers and waistcoat—he said first that he would, then he said that he would not—I asked him whether he had any money—he said that he had none about him, and said, "You can search me, but I have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Wells-street Sailors' Home"—I then called the foreman, and saw him put his hands down him—he threw his arms up, and said, "You can search me if you like"—I persuaded him to pull off the trowsers, supplied him with an old pair of canvass ones, and then went out to attend to my horse in the street—when I came back the trowsers were off and the other ones were on—the waistcoat was on the table—I saw that taken off, but not the trowsers—I heard no money when the waistcoat was</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Wilkinson and Co., timber merchants, Hatcham Road—Simmons came to our place about the end of February or beginning of March—I knew him as the supposed foreman of Mr. Manning, a builder—he said, "I want some timber. I am going to build at Leytonstone, and shall want a large quantity, but I want 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth to begin with"—he said he was going to build on Mr. Sambell's ground—I said I could not offer him the timber unless he brought me a guarantee from the ground landlord—he said it rather interfered with his character; he could not very well do it, but would try—I told him about his having been bankrupt, and that it was our rule to hare a guarantee from the man who was granting the leases—I asked him, and he said Mr. Sambell was granting the leases—I did not know Mr. Sambell—a few days after we got from Simmons this letter of 11th March, "I have seen the gentleman, Mr. Sambell, respecting the timber I ordered of you, and he informs me that he will write you to-night, which I think will be satis<lb></lb>factory. If so, please to send me the battens first, and please to send them down tomorrow, as they have the carpenter waiting," and enclosed, or in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150128"></xptr>
               <p>another letter, was this guarantee from Sambell: "I will guarantee pay ment for your timber to the extent of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for your timber merchants"—I then supplied him with the timber, believing Sambell was the ground landlord—after a couple of months I found that Simmons was nothing more than a foreman of Sambell—I sent the timber to the premises Mornington Road, Leytonstone—I received this letter from Simmons, dated May 3rd: "I have not had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Sambell till to-day, in consequence of his being ill, but on mentioning your account he informed me that you had written to him not to pay any more money on account of my bill; but I have promised to pay him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to-day, so he told me he would see you Monday or Tuesday. I am sorry I have not known of your writing to him last Monday when I made the promise to you; to it is not my fault this time." On 5th May I received from Sambell this letter: "I regret not having answered your favour before this, haying been laid up. I find on going over the works that Mr. Simmons is entitled to a certain amount of money more than he has received. Please forward me account now owing, and I will give you the money to pay as far as the work extends." I sent the timber after the first letter of March—this other letter from Sambell was also sent to me by Simmons before I advanced the timber: "With respect to the guarantee of timber, I have no objection to do so, but of course I shall not pay you the full amount of your advance as the work proceeds, but stop the amount out of your timber bill"—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid on account before I let the timber go, and he said it was all right for the balance—I have supplied goods at different times to about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he is still indebted 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MORICE</hi>. I knew Simmons, and he told me he had been a foreman—I did not know what he was at this time—I knew he had liquidated, and was without means—it is customary for foremen to undertake separate parts of a building contract on their own account—it is very often piece work—knowing he had liquidated, I asked for a guarantee, and having got that I supplied the timber—I knew nothing of Sambell, and made no inquiries at the time as to his position—I have been paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I have not taken civil proceedings to recover the balance.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLES</hi>. I knew Simmons when he was in Mr. Manning's employment—I supplied Manning with timber on a guarantee from the solicitors—I cannot remember to whom I have spoken about this interview with Simmons—I never attended any meeting about prosecuting them—I believe there is a dispute between Mr. Marsden and Sambell in regard to this property—Sambell was summoned to Ilford Petty Sessions for stealing, and Simmons was subpœnaed as a witness against him, but I did not know he was taken into custody there—I knew Simmons had liquidated, and I said to him "How much do you expect me to trust you in the face of that?"—and he said, "Well, Sir, because a man is down is he to be kept down?"—he may have said, "If this little job turns out all right, it will be the making of me"—I said, "Well, Mr. Simmons, I will see what can be done for you. If we can assist you we will"—I said, "Who is this Mr. Sambell? Is he all right?" and he said, "I think so. Somebody has died, he has come into a considerable amount of money, and he is a man of property at Leytonstone"—I said, "All right, Mr. Simmons, I will let you know to—morrow morning"—I took the order, and next morning I wrote, asking him to get Sambell as a guarantee—I did not take the trouble to inquire who Sambell was, or into the truth of Simmons's statement—I simply believed</p>

               <p>his statement to be correct—he sent me a letter with the guarantee, and enclosed the letter that Sambell had written him about the transaction—I did not believe in Simmons, and should not have supplied him, but that I thought Sambell was going to grant him leases and have something to do with the ground—I parted with the goods on the faith of the guarantee—I asked him when we should have some money, and he said, "I will get you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Saturday or Monday," and he paid it, but not till about six weeks after—I do not know if Sambell paid it—I made inquiries, because I could not understand the affair, and two or three months afterwards I heard that he was only Sambells foreman, but I did not hear he had been doing piece-work for him—I believed he was building on Sambells ground—he told me had made an arrangement with his creditors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I supplied the timber on the faith of the guarantee and of his representations—I knew nothing about Sambell—if I had known Sam<lb></lb>bell was building the houses and was not the owner I should not have let him have the timber.</p>

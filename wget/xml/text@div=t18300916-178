These writing-desks were at our door on the 14th of September; I was standing behind the counter about three yards from them at work; a gentleman told me that a person had taken four desks, and gone up the lane; the desks had been tied together, and I heard the string snap just before the gentleman spoke - the prisoner was brought back with them in about two minutes; I had desired the gentleman to follow him.</p>

            . I live in Finch-lane. I was sitting in my shop, and saw the prisoner go by with the four desks; a gentleman was pursuing him; he was about twelve yards from the prosecutor - I followed the gentleman, who stopped the prisoner in my presence; the desks were on the pavement then, but I had seen them in the prisoner's arms.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is that gentleman here? A. No; it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - there are many lights there; the desks were by the side of the prisoner - I asked how he came by them: he said a man gave him 6d. to take them to Whitechapel; he had not run more than ten yards.</p>

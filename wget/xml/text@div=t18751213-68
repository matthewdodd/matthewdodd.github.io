                  </hi>. I am a grocer at Notting Hill—on the 13th November, about 12.15 p.m, the prisoner came to my shop for a biscuit and cheese, and tendered to my wife a bad half-crown—I went out of the shop after the prisoner, told him he had given me a bad half-crown, and he said "I havn't another farthing on me," and said "I must give you the goods"—he returned me the change and I gave him the half-crown—a constable came up and took him into custody.</p>

I saw the prisoner handing over the change to the last witness—when the prisoner showed me the half-crown I saw it was bad and took him to the station—on the way there he said "I took it in the market this morning for a box of herrings"—another time he said "I got it about dinner time," and nearer the station he said "I hadn't it in my hands only about half an hour"—at the station I saw a coin in his mouth when searching him—Sergeant Bonner put his two fingers in while I squeezed his jaw, but the coin passed down—the prisoner became very ill, and a doctor was sent for, who made an examination—the prisoner got better—I found some more money upon him.</p>

I was at the station when the prisoner was up—from the manner in which he spoke I told him to open his mouth, I saw the edge of a white coin and said "You have got something in your mouth"—I caught hold of him to stop him swallowing it and he bit my finger—he became very bad and I said I thought he would not get over it—a doctor was sent for, but it passed down before he came.</p>

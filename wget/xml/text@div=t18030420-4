               <p>THOMAS BUTT sworn. - On Monday the 14th of March, about half past eight o'clock in the evening, as I was going to my house, I observed the prisoner close by the shop-door; he looked round, and saw there was no person in the shop,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200021"></xptr>he immediately put his hand in at the window, and took a tongue, which he concealed under his coat; I went up to him, and took him by the collar; I asked him what he had got there; he replied, he would pay me for it; I then took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not take it away; I saw a man standing at the end of the shop-board, and I was going to ask him the price.</p>

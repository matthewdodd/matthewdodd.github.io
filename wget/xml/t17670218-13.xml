            . I was informed there was such an ax at the prisoner's lodgings; there I found it; I am partner to the person that lent it to Gifford; the prisoner owned he had thrown it down into an area at his lodgings; he said he found it in the frame that Saturday night it was lost, but at that time it was frosty weather, and they could not work in the frame.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor's mother lives at Wapping; he desired me to look up his tools while he went there; I did, and carried them to the place we put our tools in; then I went and drank at the Northumberland Arms, and got much in liquor; going home by the place where we worked, the moon shone very bright; I seeing the ax lie, took it up, and carried it home; I knocked twice, no body heard me; I threw the ax over into the area, and went and slept in the watch-house all night, and never thought any more of it till I saw it at the Justice's.</p>

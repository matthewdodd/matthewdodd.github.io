               <p>What day of the week was it? - On a Wednesday. My wife and maid fastened the windows after I was gone to bed. I got up first, a little before seven, when I came down stairs, I found the staircase window sash a little up, and I came to the parlour door and found that open, on the ground floor; and the yard door was open likewise backwards, that door goes only into the yard, there is no communication through that door into the street. There is a side door has a communication into the street, I found not locked but latched. There is a side door that goes to the black horse yard, but that don't belong to the back yard. I apprehend the person came in at the staircase window.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How high is that above the ground? - I fancy about thirteen foot, but it is only about three foot from the top of the wall leading to the black horse yard, the wall I take to be about nine or ten foot.</p>
               <p>Is the wall close adjoining? - It is upon a straight line from the window to the end of the house, about two feet and an half.</p>
               <p>Is the wall so near the window any man might easily reach it, so as to get to the sash? - Very easily.</p>
               <p>How high was the sash up? - About an inch and an half. Not high enough for a man to go out. The sash joins to the common staircase.</p>
               <p>Was the sash fastened by any means? - There is a screw pin sometimes it is fastened with, but whether it was or not fastened I cannot tell, I did not particularly mind.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050008"></xptr> When I came into the parlour, I missed the glass first, the looking glass hung over the fire place in the parlour, in a mahogany frame; then I missed two great coats, one mine, and one my lodger Exell's, then the china, I missed a cheque window curtain, a china tea-pot with many cups and saucers, I did not count them, I don't know how many there were, from the corner cupboard, and a pair of steel snuffers very small ones. I had seen most of the things before I went to bed, there were the marks of feet upon two chairs.</p>
               <p>Were they obliged to get up in chairs to get to the cupboard? - No; but there were the marks of mens feet upon the chairs. Upon the table lay a poker and some parts of the beads of the window that were broke to pieces. I never saw them again till the things were in the constable's possession, one Wier.</p>
               <p>Mrs. DOE sworn.</p>
               <p>My maid and I went to bed last at night about one o'clock, it might be rather past. I fastened the doors, my maid was with me. I went up the public stair case where the sash was, with a candle in my hand going to bed.</p>
               <p>You did not mind the sash as you went up? - Yes; I found the sash was quite close; I had my hand upon it: it was quite fast.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell whether it was screwed or not? - No; I got up the next morning about nine.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Was the looking-glass, the cheque window curtain, the two great coats, the china tea-pot, and cups and saucers gone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can they reach it without a chair? - I could reach them without a chair.</p>

Seeing him with something under his left arm, I followed him to the corner of Charlotte-street; he was alone. I asked him what he had got?

               <p>What are you? - I attend Mr. Triquet's office; I remember the prisoner being brought before him on the Thursday morning about ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>Wier. He had both on when brought to the office; he had one upon his arm, and one upon his back, when brought to the round house.</p>
               <p>Mr. EXELL called, deposes to his great coat.</p>

            . All this is false, is it child? - Yes, my lord.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Doe. Your own character is called in question; had you any character with her? - No; there is a person worked with me recommended her to me, a person that lived in the city. She has lived with me two months, and behaved exceeding well.</p>
               <p>You never saw that soldier, nor any person come to her? - No.</p>
               <p>How near does she lay to you? - Up two-pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. After he was taken he told this story, and then told a different story?</p>
               <p>Court. Mrs. Doe says the fash was down and fast, the windows fastened, and sash down. The lifting up a latch, if a door is latched, is burglary, whoever lifts it up and enters. So it a window is down, if a man pulls up the sash it is sufficient in law to constitute the crime. With regard to the fact of stealing, the goods were found upon him, that is clear as to the felony.</p>

               <p>DANIEL EDEN. When I was taken from the Cross Keys to the workhouse, on the 6th of May, I asked the prisoner to deposit four sovereigns in Mr. Burroughs' hands, that I might have a few shillings at a time; he said he would, and so help him God! he would come and see me on the Tuesday, but I never saw him any more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Was any one present when you gave him the sovereigns? A. There were two or three people in the room, but they are not here; I was in the hospital two months - when I sent to inquire for the prisoner, they said he was gone to Brighton; I did not know where he was - I went to the Magistrate, and got a warrant; he was taken in Exmouth-street on the 25th of November - I took the officer to inquire about him; I had been twice to his former lodging at Pentonville, and found he had moved to Whitecross-street; I have been in a gentleman's service, but I lost the use of my limbs, and am forced to get my bread as I can- I was in the service of Captain Thorpe, of the Blues, nine years ago, and I have been in business in the public line seven or eight years ago; I got this money by my industry and my friends.</p>

            . I received the warrant in June or July, but could not find the prisoner till November; I told him I took him for the four sovereigns - he acknowledged in the office having received the money, but he had some little trouble in his house, and he gave 2l. for his wife to get it away.</p>

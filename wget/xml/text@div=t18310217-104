            . In the course of last autumn I came to London from Cheltenham, where I reside; Mrs. Loyd and my children accompanied me - I came to town in September; the first time I saw the prisoner was when I paid an evening visit to a gentleman in Ulster-place, in the early part of the year.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember attending an inquest held upon Miss Cashin, in the Hampstead-road, at any time when the prisoner was there? A. Yes, I saw the prisoner there four or five days - it was as long as the inquest lasted; Mrs. Loyd was not with me the two first days - she was not acquainted with him previously; we became well acquainted with him in consequence of seeing him at that inquest; Mrs. Loyd afterwards consulted him professionally on account of her child, but occasionally mentioned to him a complaint she herself was subject to, which was an occasional choking in her throat when she caught cold, or any thing excited her - I have accompanied her to Mr. Long's house to consult him about it; the first time I went there was about a fortnight before she put herself under his care - she became his patient on the 5th of October, but did not inhale till the 6th; she was then in very good health, otherwise than this occasional choking - she had caught a slight cold a few months before that, and a little before the 6th of October she applied a small blister to her throat, about the size of half a dollar; this was on the Sunday night or Monday morning before the 6th - I have a memorandum here in her own hand writing.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY (the prisoner's Counsel.) I make no objection to that being used with respect to the dates.</p>
               <p>Q. Then tell us the date that a blister was applied? A. Sunday, the 3rd, she found herself unwell, and put the blister on during the night; it was nearly well on the 6th - she had frequently applied that blister when this affection was coming on; she became Mr. Long's patient on the 6th, and went again on the 7th, 8th, and 9th; I was not with her on the 9th - she was rubbed that day across the chest; I did not see it done - I did not see her breast till Sunday evening, the 10th; she had been to Mr. Long's on the 10th, and in the evening complained of a violent burning across her chest, and I examined her chest and breast - there was a great redness across the breast or bosom, and it was darker in the middle than in other parts; she complained that evening of great chilliness, shivering with cold, but a burning heat across the breast - she passed a very restless uncomfortable night; she was very unwell all the next day, and complained of great thirst - she was up for some time, and then laid on the bed again; she did not go down stairs - she complained of sickness at the stomach, and being very thirsty continually; she was feverish all day - I saw her breast and chest on Monday; the redness got more vivid - it got stronger, and the spot in the centre darker; it was white round the edges, and much puffed up - it discharged from the centre a dirty whitish thick kind of substance, and the cabbage-leaves which were taken off appeared slimy; I understood the cabbage-leaves were applied by Mr. Long - they were kept on by his direction; I believe they were first applied on the Saturday, but not seeing the breast I cannot say; I first knew of a cabbage-leaf being there on Sunday, the 10th - on Monday Mrs. Loyd felt an odd sensation, as she had felt the evening before, a sickness, and was very uncomfortable every way; Mr. Long did not call to see her on Monday - I am not aware that he knew where we lived; she passed a very uncomfortable night, indeed, on Monday - I saw her breast and chest again on Tuesday morning; the redness was, if any thing, greater - the spot in the centre of the breast more puffed up, and darker; the redness spread considerably more, and round the edges where it stopped there were blisters, the same as when a common blister is applied - they were in the skin, from the discharge which had gone over the bosom, and appeared to me only to have stopped where the bed-clothes might have touched and absorbed it; the inner part of the arms were very red, from the discharge which had gone down on each side; wherever the discharge had gone, the skin was very much irritated, and red; and in the end, wherever that discharge had gone, the flesh mortified, and was taken off afterwards - I mean many days after during her illness; but the smell began to be very bad in about a week or ten days; she felt very unwell on Tuesday the 12th, very hot, feverish, restless, and had no appetite, in consequence of which I went to Mr. Long about the middle of that day - I saw him; he expressed his surprise - he asked me why Mrs. Loyd had not come to inhale, and go on with her rubbing; I told him it was impossible, she was so very ill - that she had been constantly unwell from the Sunday night, and was suffering a great deal of pain - he said he dare say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170068"></xptr>that would soon go off; that it was generally the case - I told him of the chilliness and shivering she had on the Sunday night, and that we had given her some hot wine and water to relieve her when she was going to bed - he said hot brandy and water would have been a better thing, and to have put her head under the bed-clothes -I said her breast and chest looked very red and very bad, but did not describe it perhaps so minutely as I have to-day; he said that generally was the case in the first instance, but it would go off in a very short time; there was no fear or danger, and I need not be uneasy about it - I requested him to come in the evening, and described where we lived - he came that evening; I do not know at what time; I was in the room - (while I had been with him in the day, Mrs. Loyd, from excessive pain, had thrown aside the cabbage-leaves, and put on a little blister-dressing to allay the heat; and when he came into the room,) he said he was sorry to see her so unwell; she was in bed - he said she ought rather to have got up, and endeavoured to have come to him, and he would have endeavoured to relieve her; she said it was impossible, she was in such pain and suffering, and with her breast open in that way it might be dangerous - he then asked to look at it, and did; he said those greasy plaisters had no business there (they were what she had put on herself), and that she ought to have continued the cabbage-leaf - she said she could not bear the pain of keeping it on; he then took off his great coat, and said he would rub it out, which would give her relief - he turned up the cuff of his coat, apparently preparing to rub it; she exclaimed very much at the idea of such a thing, and said she wondered at his thinking of rubbing, in the state her breast was in, and asked if there was no way he could give her relief without touching her breast, for she could not bear to be touched - he asked what she wished; she said, "To be healed;" he said it would never heal with those greasy plaisters; that was not the way he healed sores or wounds; (I do not know which he called it) - he called for a towel, which I gave him; he began dabbing it on the breast and across the bosom, but particularly in the centre where the discharge was oozing from; the discharge proceeded only from the centre; whenever that discharge came, it took off the skin ultimately; the skin was all discoloured and red wherever it reached, and ultimately brought it off.</p>

               <p>Q. Having dabbed it with a towel, what did he do? A. He said old linen was the best thing to heal a thing of that kind with; but she said she had always been in the habit of healing any thing of that kind with the simple dressing she had used - that her skin and flesh were very healthy, and healed immediately; she had been in the habit of using that simple dressing when she put a small blister on her throat - he said old linen was preferable, but she might use that if she liked, he saw no objection to it, and when it skinned over he would rub it again - she said No, she thought she never could submit to rubbing again, from what she was then suffering; I assisted him on with his coat, and he took his leave.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any observation he made when you first stated the appearance of the breast and chest? A. He spoke in his usual manner, "Oh, that is nothing; it is the case generally in the first instance" - he called again next evening, Wednesday, the 13th; Mrs. Loyd was then suffering a deal from pain, and was in a very low state from low spirits, pain, agitation, and fever, and dreaded any thing touching her breast - we made a little kind of cradle to keep the clothes from touching her- the prisoner did not see her that evening; she was alarmed on hearing of his arrival, and begged I would not allow him to come up, and he never saw her again - Mr.

            Campbell had seen her on the Tuesday evening, the 12th, and saw her several times a day after that - I do not recollect whether he saw her more than once on the Tuesday, but after that he saw her several times a day; he lives close by, and was very attentive - Mr. Vance was called in some days after, and Mr. Brodie came as a friend of Mr. Vance's; she died on the 8th of November; I believe it was exactly a mouth and a day after she had been to Mr. Long's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Mrs. Loyd was on a visit at Kensington, at Mr. Campbell's mother's house? A. Yes; we intended to take her apartments, but wished to remove her nearer to Mr. Long's - Mr. Campbell is a medical man; we were at Mrs. Campbell's when Mrs. Loyd began to attend Mr. Long, and continued there till her death - Mr. Campbell saw her on the Tuesday evening before the prisoner saw her; he is a young man, but has been several years in practice, I believe - I believe she had applied the plaister herself, which Mr. Long complained of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Long say it was the most likely thing in the world to counteract the proper application of his treatment? A. Not that I recollect - he said it was not what he was in the habit of using; it was a common blister-dressing, a common healing plaister after a blister - he said it would not heal it; it was not the grease he talked of rubbing out; none of that had come off the plaister; it had been merely put on lint, and put on the breast - I considered he meant to rub out the application which had been formerly rubbed in; he had not found fault with the effect of the greasy plaister, but with the application of it; he said the cabbage-leaves ought to have been kept on - I think Mr. Vance was called in on the Thursday after Mr. Campbell began to attend her; he at that time was her only medical attendant.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner was refused permission to attend her, did not he send a medical gentleman, named Rawlings, requesting he might be allowed to see her? A. There was some extraordinary character called to see her; I do not know when it was - he said he came from the prisoner; I referred him to Mr. Vance and Mr. Campbell, and did not allow him to see her - Mrs. Loyd had been occasionally afflicted with this complaint in her throat for some years; Mr. Vance attended her for it two years ago - my son had attended the prisoner for some time before Mrs. Loyd; he had been about a fortnight inhaling before she went - her going with him led to the conversation about her throat - he attended some days after his mother's illness; I had told Mr. Long if he allowed my boy to attend him (it did not then suit my convenience, but) after Christmas I would pay him - this was before my boy went to him; this was in consequence of an unexpected curtailment of my income - he said I could send him, and he would attend to him; my son was desired to tell the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170069"></xptr>prisoner he need not come any longer to see his mamma, as she was better.</p>
               <p>MR. WHATELEY. Q. Was it after Mrs. Loyd had declined to see the prisoner that this message was sent? A. Yes; Mrs. Loyd paid the prisoner's fees - I have it here in her own hand-writing, and I gave her the money to pay it - she states here, "6th, Began inhaling at Mr. Long's, paid him 1l.," and on the 9th here is 1l. paid him - she was with him on the 10th; I do not know whether he fixed for her to come on the 11th; the plaister she had on when he came on the 12th, was a preparation of lard, spread on lint - it might have been on two hours, but I was not there when it was put on.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in St. George's-place, Knightsbridge. I was well acquainted with the late Mrs. Loyd from her marriage, about fourteen years, and have known Captain Loyd from a boy - they generally lived at Cheltenham; I always considered Mrs. Loyd a very healthy woman - she and Captain Loyd came to visit me on the 28th of September; Mrs. Loyd appeared in very good health, but her throat was sometimes troublesome, a sort of stoppage in it when swallowing - I never accompanied her to Mr. Long. On Sunday evening, the 10th of October, she was sitting with me on the sofa, and was taken with a shivering fit; that was the first symptom of her illness that I perceived, except the irritation in her throat - her bed was immediately warmed; she was carried up to bed, and warm water bottles applied, but the shivering continued, and was very violent - I left her about two o'clock in the morning, to go to bed, and saw her next morning about nine or half-past nine; she complained very much of a soreness in her bosom, and I saw it then for the first time - it was very much inflamed all over the chest, from shoulder to shoulder, very red, and extended from the throat down about six inches - the skin did not appear to be broken then; she did not leave her bed that day, to my knowledge - I saw her frequently, but did not stay with her all day; she changed her bed room once, but never came down stairs again, and never left her bed, except to go from one room to the other; I remember Mr. Long coming one Tuesday evening - I went into the room and he was using a cloth, wiping the discharge from her chest; I saw her breast - it was very much inflamed, and the wound in the centre more marked than when I first saw it; the inflammation was more extensive - the wound in the centre was about the size of the top of a large tea-cup; not quite so large as a breakfast-cup - it was larger than a dollar; she was in very great pain in the forenoon, before Mr. Long came - Mr. Campbell, my son, had applied a simple dressing of spermaceti-ointment, and removed the cabbage-leaf; it was the same plaister as Mrs. Loyd had used before to a blister on her throat - my son is a surgeon, and has been in practice about seven years; I was not in the room when Mr. Long first came - I heard Mrs. Loyd complain of the pain in her chest; Mr. Long asked if she wished him to rub it out - I think that was the expression; she said she would not have it rubbed any more; she would not endure it again - he then asked what she wished to have done; she said she wished it to be dried up and healed - he objected to the ointment which had been applied, and said she should apply nothing but dry linen; she said she had often had blisters, and healed them with that ointment without any trouble: he said, if that was the case, he saw no objection to her using it again - he, after that, went away; he gave her no direction as to diet, nor prescribed any medicine that I heard - he called next day. and was not admitted; I saw Mrs. Loyd frequently - she remained at my house till she died; she at one time appeared a little better - we had once a hope of her recovery; she was in a dreadful state - in a perfect torture.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean that she was in perfect torture during the whole time after Mr. Long left her? A. She was, till the mortification took place - her sufferings were most acute; my son attended her till her death, and Mr. Vance and Mr. Brodie saw her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you ever in company with the deceased when she went to the inquest held on Miss Cashin? A. No; they were not at our house then - I know it was after that inquest that she went to Mr. Long.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Sunday she had the shivering fit, had she been out any where? A. She had been to Mr. Long's, and been rubbed a second time, as she told me - he lives in Harley-street, which may be two miles from my house; I cannot say whether she walked there and back - she was a good walker; I have no reason to suppose she did not walk - she went no where else to my knowledge: she went out about twelve o'clock, and returned some time before dinner, which was about five o'clock; she had complained of her throat several times - it could scarcely be called an illness; I never knew her under any body's care for it but Mr. Vance's - when I saw Mr. Long in her room Captain Loyd had fetched him; the wound had then broken, and water was oozing from it - Mr. Long disapproved of the greasy plaister; my son has had seven years' practice - I have not another son a chemist; he died, but the shop is kept on under the same name - my son first attended Mrs. Loyd on Tuesday, the 12th; nobody attended her on Monday, but the cabbage-leaf was applied according to Mr. Long's order - she was not out of bed at all.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You did not know till she was taken with the shivering fit that she had been to Mr. Long? A. She told me that day at dinner time that she had been; I knew she had been and inhaled, but did not know she had been that day - I saw her breast on the Monday.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Wilton-place, which is a little more than one hundred yards from my mother's. I knew Mrs. Loyd shortly after she was married - she appeared quite a healthy person; I saw her first about her breast on Tuesday, the 12th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, at my mother's request; she was suffering very great pain, and told me she was in perfect agony - the appearances of her breast were such as to make it probable she was suffering great pain; I found a very extensive wound, covering the whole interior part of the chest - I think any strong acid would produce such a wound; the skin was destroyed and laying in folds on the chest, completely suppurated and the cellular membrane, which is under the skin, was partly destroyed - there was a considerable discharge from the whole of the wound, which extended nearly from one arm-pit to the other, and from the throat down to the stomach; the skin was off both breasts - the centre of the wound was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170070"></xptr>a higher state of inflammation, darker in colour; I think I removed the cabbage-leaves - it would take several cabbage-leaves to cover the wound; I applied a simple dressing of spermaceti-ointment - I only saw her once that day; I saw her on the Wednesday. and daily, till her death, generally two or three times a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consider the wound dangerous to life when you first saw it? A. Very much so; I continued to apply that ointment - it was the only dressing I applied till I saw Mr. Vance; he continued to apply the same dressing, with some addition of calamine powder, and the second or third day he applied a bread and water poultice; nothing that we applied could possibly increase the danger - Mr. Vance was called in on the 21st; I described accurately to him the treatment I had adopted - there was once some slight hopes of her recovery; I was always very fearful it would terminate fatally - I gave her at first some saline aperient medicine, and after that she had bark, mineral acids, and quinine, to prevent mortification as much as we could, to support nature - as soon as mortification took place, she took the bark and mineral acids; the spot became gangrenous about a week after I attended her - she died of that wound decidedly.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, would it be necessary or proper to produce such a wound for the purpose of correcting any difficulty in swallowing? A. No; I know of no disease whatever in which it would be necessary or proper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been a surgeon? A. I have been in practice six or seven years; it has been a fair practice - a common blister will often produce effects which the person who prescribed it never contemplated; it has assumed an unhealthy appearance sometimes, and had an injurious effect; it was after Mr. Vance was called in that there were slight hopes of her recovery, and before I thought there might be hope -Mr. Long had no opportunity of applying any thing after I was called in.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said that for a pain in the throat such a wound ought not to be produced - must not the remedy applied depend not on the external appearance alone, but very often on the symptoms the patient relates? A. Upon that he must guide his treatment, of course - I was not present when Mrs. Loyd stated her symptoms to Mr. Long -I thought the wound dangerous from the first, but it was not desired by Mrs. Loyd that any body else should be called in; I do not recollect that I proposed it to her, and I did not think it necessary - I thought as long as her friends were satisfied it was enough; the general practice is to state our opinion, and leave to the friends to act - immediately after mortification took place another medical practitioner was called in; I had no wish for additional assistance before - I think gangrene came on seven or eight days after she was under my care; I cannot tell the day of the week - I thought it not unlikely from the beginning that she might sink under the effects of the wounds; I feared gangrene from the beginning - I stated the danger I apprehended to Mrs. Higgins, Mrs. Loyd's sister - I also stated it in the house; this was previous to Mr. Vance attending - I should think it was three or four days after my attending her, that I stated I was afraid it would be dangerous - I attended her nearly a month; Mr. Long had no opportunity of prescribing for her during that time.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Though you apprehended danger from the first, did you consider it a case of difficulty in the treatment? A. No, I did not - I considered that I understood it perfectly; I saw the body after death, and have no reason to think I was mistaken - I never saw a blister of that size applied; in cases where unexpected results have followed the application of a blister there has generally been afterwards appearances to account for those results.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not use any application to reduce the inflammation? A. I think the simple dressing would reduce it - I never tried a poppy poultice, and do not think that would reduce it; in the state it was in on Tuesday, I should have thought that rubbing would have increased the inflammation - it could not have been in the least beneficial; I think I told Captain Loyd immediately on my seeing the wound, that I thought it was dangerous - I do not recollect the expression I used; I have not a doubt that I told him it was dangerous; and I told my mother the first day I saw her, that I was afraid Mrs. Loyd would never recover.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Sackville-street. I first saw Mrs. Loyd on the 21st of October - she was in bed; Mr. Campbell was present - she complained of extreme soreness at her mouth and throat, and ascribed the complaint to having inhaled through a tube at Mr. Long's, in Harley-street; on examining her chest, I found a sloughing ulcer of great extent, where, by her own account, she had been rubbed by a liniment, which might produce mortification - if she had been rubbed by a corrosive liniment, or a violent application, it might have that effect; it extended from one arm to the other, and from the upper part of the breast-bone, to, I suppose, a little below the nipples - it was stated to me, by a person who measured it, to be seventeen inches long, and ten or eleven broad, and in my judgment that was about the size; the centre of the wound was dark and in a state of mortification, and towards the circumference there was a little appearance of health - the dead parts were separating from the living; in a day or two a more unfavourable change took place, the parts assumed a flabby condition, mortification became extensive, and I imparted to her friends the certainty of her death - nothing that I applied materially arrested the progress of the disease; she gradually grew weaker, and died on the 8th of November; a few days after I first visited her Mr. Campbell and I, and both distinctly, at different times removed dead flesh from the breast, and found the breast-bone bare; Mr. Campbell stated to me, when I was first called in, the treatment he had adopted, and he conformed to my suggestions subsequently - I certainly approved of the mode of treatment he had adopted; I had attended Mrs. Loyd about three years before for an affection of the throat - I was at first under an impression that she might have a narrow orifice into the stomach, but having passed a pretty long sponge several times, I was satisfied that was not the disease; and that it was a complaint called globus hystericus, which is a nervous affection, an inverted motion of the cesophagus; it is a very common complaint, particularly with women in early life - I never knew a woman die of it; I have seen some thousands in it - in my opinion, a wound on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170071"></xptr>the chest would not relieve such a disease; I afterwards attended the opening of the body, by desire of the Coroner - the whole body, both internal and external, was in a very healthy state; it was externally very fat, but all in a healthy state, with two exceptions - one was the disease of the gland, and the inflammatory effect of the lining of the windpipe, occasioned by their contiguity to the upper part of the ulcer; I am certain of that- it is my opinion, that before the ulcer was occasioned those two parts were free from disease; there was a little narrowness at the entrance of the oesophagus, which I believe to be congenital, as there was no thickening of the part; I believe the mortification to be the cause of her death, and that to be caused by high inflammation, which was produced by some powerful application.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was there any period at which you gave the deceased's friend's hopes of her recovery? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose a liniment, or liquid, to have been applied on Sunday, the 10th, to have been rubbed in then, and spread so as to produce the appearance of inflammation on Tuesday evening from arm to arm, was that such a case as might have produced the effect you observed? A. Certainly; I should suppose the body was pre-disposed to inflammation, as it was a very fat and healthy body, indeed, it would be evident to any man of common judgment.</p>
               <p>Q. Would a man of common prodence, or skill, have applied what would have produced such an inflammation as has been described to have taken place two days after the application? A. I think not - all irritating external applications sometimes exceed our expectations; I would add, that they are generally kept within control - it certainly would be an act of great rashness to use an application that could have produced such an inflammation, and would certainly be ignorance.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If you had been called in, say on the 12th, could you have prevented her death? A. That is a very difficult question to reply to - I should like to be excused giving an opinion beyond my own knowledge of facts; I should think it was not likely that I could - I think it was a case of great peril from the commencement; I have admitted, from Mr. Campbell's account, the propriety of his treatment, and therefore I do not conceive I could have improved it.</p>
               <p>Q. You approved of Mr. Campbell's treatment? A. The account he gave me satisfied me of the propriety of his management - his account to day corresponds with the account he gave me; "simple" applied to ointment, means it is not of an irritating quality.</p>

            , ESQ. I was requested by Mr. Vance to see the deceased, on Friday, the 29th of October - I found her in a very dangerous state; a large sloughing ulcer in her breast and chest, the appearance of which led me to believe that in all probability it would be the cause of her death - I believe that ulcer might be produced by rubbing a corrosive liniment on the part on the 10th.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any state of disease which would render it necessary to apply a liniment capable of producing such an ulcer? A. No, I do not know of any disease which could induce a person to use a liniment with the intention of producing such an effect; I have heard Mr. Campbell examined - I was present at the examination after death, and from the evidence given, I should not think that other medical assistance would have been likely to produce any other result - it does not appear to me that any different treatment would produce a different effect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. I believe it is quite a common practice now to use counter-irritation? A. Yes, it always has been.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not the same application that on one subject will produce beneficial effect, often produced an injurious one, going beyond what was intended? A. Certainly; it of course depends on the habit and constitution; the effects of application of external liniments certainly sometime go beyond what was intended.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the most scientific practitioner may be deceived in his application? A. Certainly; he cannot always calculate to a nicety - I do not recollect an instance of death having been produced by a blister, but I suppose such a thing may have been - I should suppose a patient, walking five or six miles with a blister on her breast, would add to the irritation - I should not treat all wounds alike; I should inquire the cause of the wound, and the state of the patient.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose an ulcer from a blister to be caused by an application unknown to the medical adviser, would not the application of any substance, not congenial, tend to increase the wound? A. I think it would be desirable to know the nature of the application, but do not think it would lead to a different treatment - we do not always apply the same antidore in cases of poison, especially in poisons taken into the stomach.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not an incompatible substance, applied to a wound in the breast, be likely to produce mischief instead of good? A. I suppose that some substances might be better than others; with respect to the external treatment, I do not know that the surgeon would judge much from the nature of the application that produced it - he would not certainly judge so much from that as from the appearances.</p>
               <p>Q. A medical man, I presume, when he sets about a cure, pretty well arranges, in his own mind, the course he intends to adopt; now if a stranger, without consulting with the person who originally made the application, applies something which the person who originally made the application did not, do not you think it would be attended with destructive effects? A. I should like to know the application, certainly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is your answer? A. That certainly it would be so sometimes.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When a particular line is intended to be pursued, a stranger coming in, not knowing the course intended, and adopting a different one, would not that be likely to produce mischief? A. Of course such a circumstance might occur.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Supposing you had seen a wound in the state Mr. Campbell has described it to be on the 12th of October, should you have thought it necessary to resort to the person whose treatment had produced the wound? A. I should not have thought it necessary absolutely; and indeed, in the case I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170072"></xptr>heard described, I doubt whether it could have led to any useful consequence; still I should have got the information if I could, in case it might throw light on the patient's condition - when I say it might be dangerous to deviate from the original plan, I mean the plan of a man of science - I should certainly not think spermacetiointment could have increased the danger; I never saw such an effect produced by any ordinary medical application.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you impute such an effect to the constitution of the patient, unless a dangerous remedy had been used? A. There are some constitutions in which very slight remedies will produce very serious consequences; I have known one person die from the bite of a leach - another from the sting of a bee - that must refer to the state of the constitution; I had no means of knowing any thing of the state of this lady's constitution; from the evidence I have heard in Court I should believe, from the way the inflammation made progress, that it depended more on the nature of the application, than the patient's constitution - it may have depended partly on each.</p>
               <p>Q. When a thing in some instances may be beneficial, and in others injurious, is it not usual to judge of the constitution before you make the application? A. It is; we cannot always form an accurate judgment; but in using a violent potent remedy, we proceed with great caution - I can form no positive opinion whether from the effect produced, the person acted with undue caution, rashness, or ignorance - a liniment of this nature ought to have been used with great caution; the impression on my mind is, that it was not used with sufficient caution, though I do not form a positive opinion; it was used with rashness I should think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever, in the course of your whole practice,(which I believe is very extensive) know an instance of such inflammation being produced by an external application? A. No, I cannot say I ever did - I have known blisters and other liniments produce mischief greater than was intended, but have not seen such extensive mischief as was produced in this instance; I should think the effect of such an irritating application would be rapid.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased once, about a week before her death, and was present at the examination after death; I observed nothing to lead me to suppose there was any peculiarity of constitution to to account for the violent effect produced - she was apparently very healthy indeed, except where the injury was done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I think I can prove if there was any thing poisonous at the time I saw Mrs. Loyd, that effect must have produced death in two or three days - eight days elapsed according to the evidence of Mr. Campbell, before any injury took place; he says there was a discharge of matter, and that the part appeared red - that proved the parts were healthy; if it was not so bright and red, it must be inflamed, and poison must have been applied, but the parts were red and healthy, and that lasted eight days, which goes to prove no injury was done on Tuesday - when I called on Mrs. Loyd, I inquired who did the injury which produced the blisters; I produced no blisters - I know nothing of it; when Captain Loyd called on me; I inquired why she had not come to inhale - he said she was ill; I went to see her, and said, "This is bad practice, who has produced these blisters?" Mrs. Loyd said herself, and Mrs. Campbell confirmed it, and afterwards acknowledged that her son did it, and that she desired her son to attend Mrs. Loyd - it is in evidence before the Coroner, that Mrs. Loyd - consulted Mr. Campbell without consulting me; Mr. Campbell said she should not do so, and Captain Loyd and Mrs. Campbell say nothing about the blisters on Monday, but on Tuesday, after Mr. Campbell commenced his practice, I saw it, and condemned it; these are the words of Mrs. Campbell at the inquest, as to what I said, "You are using a wrong dressing, it should be only old linen to absorb it;" I offered to wipe it, but was prevented - Mrs. Campbell seemed exceedingly angry because I condemned the practice of her son; I called next day, and Miss Loyd told me her mother was so much better and asleep - her son called next day, and said his mamma was so much better, I need not trouble to go to Kensington; we kept up that sort of conversation for a week, and I concluded she was well - when on my trial here before I expected her as a witness; I knew nothing of her illness till Mr. Wontner told me I should soon be in Newgate again - I did not know what for, but it seems it was mentioned among medical gentlemen here, and an inquest was held; about a week after I left here, I sent Mr. Rawlings to see Mrs. Loyd - Captain Loyd would not admit him to the post mortem examination; when the lady was opened, the head was not examined, nor the spine, yet it is in evidence that Mrs. Loyd had head-aches - it will also be proved she had copious expectorations - Mr. Vance says the mouth was corroded by inhaling, if so the whole body must be affected, and the lungs appeared perfectly sound, this is inconsistent - I had nothing to do with it; I knew nothing of the circumstances till Captain Loyd told me; and Mr. Campbell admitted here to-day, that eight days had elapsed before mortification took place; he made no change in the application, which was wrong - a greasy plaister, if discharge was produced, must produce mischief; he should have applied exciting plasters - no medical man will say they ever cured mortification yet with a spermaceti-plaister; there is nothing in it to excite - the evidence will prove as far as my practice goes, that inhaling never produced any injury; it will be proved, by my extensive practice, that a blister was never known to be produced by my applications, or that my means ever produced any injury - some of my patients had my application home with them, and used it. Gentlemen, on these grounds you cannot find fault with me; if you had commenced business yourselves, or any kind of work, and it was taken from you, and got into other hands, and it was afterwards injured or spoiled, do you think you would be answerable? is there any man alive who can say if she had continued under my care, I should not have cured her? my conviction is she would have been alive to-day; and if Mr. Vance could have encouraging hopes of her doing well after mortification, and if he had been called in four days before, when no mortification took place, he must have saved her; it was given in evidence that the skin was not broken, and no evidence can show it was broken for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170073"></xptr>eight days after - if there was any corrosive substance applied on the Tuesday, or at any other time, it must not only have destroyed the skin, but the parts under it, and if a corrosive substance was applied, no discharge could have taken place. It is evident the vitality was not injured - if it was, it must have become as if dead, and mortified at once; if there was corrosive substance applied on the Tuesday, that must have destroyed the parts immediately - the application I make use, of my patients even gargle with, and wash their face and teeth, and no injury occurs; at the last trial Dr. Brodie said there was mortification - Dr. Thompson said, in direct contradiction to him, there was no mortification, "For by mortification," said he, "we mean the coming away of the parts" - now the charge against me is for doing what no man alive can do; if my patient was under my care I would have saved her - she died under the hands of others. Why was I singled out to be prosecuted? why was not I put into the witness-box as well as Mr. Campbell? why is not Mr. Campbell put here instead of me, for allowing mortification to come on? - and Mr. Vance approved of his practice when he did not know what he did; yet he approved of what brought on mortification - I took medical gentlemen to see the case; they were not admitted; why should I be responsible for what was done by Mr. Campbell, who is young and inexperienced? his mother desired him to attend Mrs. Loyd, and if there was any thing wrong in me, why did Mrs. Loyd send for me? Mrs. Campbell forced her son to attend - he says, in evidence, "My mother desired me to attend her;" and he desired I should not attend her; and was it not very natural for him to try to get a patient entirely under his care? When I sent to the house Mrs. Campbell told Mr. Sayer that Mrs. Loyd would be well enough in four days to undertake a journey to Cheltenham - Mrs. McDougal, when she went to enquire, heard Dr. Frankum say that I was making 12,000l. a year, and he could scarcely make any thing; they then told her Mrs. Loyd was likely to die from suffocation, yet the lungs were perfectly sound. Where did it come from? I wish to know these points? I merely point out to you that I had nothing to do with Mrs. Loyd - she came to me and inhaled - she left me, and went under other persons' care; if she died under my hands I should be accountable, but I condemned the practice the moment I saw it - is there a medical man will say mortification can be cured by spermaceti-plaisters? - they have not accounted satisfactorily for what they have done. Now, gentlemen, the argument against me is that I am ignorant and unacquainted with medicine - I am willing to stand any examination; one gentleman is here who conversed with me last night on the nervous system and the human frame - he says, "Well, I am willing to state on oath that you are acquainted with the human frame;" Dr. E - will prove I have dissected; before I began on serious cases, I practised on small cases - the witnesses coming here are the incurables of these very gentlemen; Mr. Vance had a patient who will be here - I have placed into the hip-bone a socket, which Mr. Vance and Mr. Brodie said could not be done; again, I have evidence that I cured mortification, since this prosecution against me - if this verdict is against me there is not a medical gentleman who is not liable; I am not aware that I am doing wrong; but, Mr. Brodie attended Mr. Buller, of Gloucester-place, four or five weeks ago, for a cancer on the lip - the gentleman had had it ten or twelve years; he was in no kind of danger - he consulted, I believe, Mr. Brodie and Mr. Vance; they cut it off, and he died in three days - there was no prosecution there; medical men are not going to be thier own witnesses, though they condemn me to-day - if Captain Loyd was the only witness against me who would condemn me? you might as well condemn Mr. Campbell - he brought on the mortification; but my patients are here, the incurables of the faculty; I have cured consumption, which they acknowledge they never cured - I must understand anatomy; it may be said I only cure particular diseases, which quacks do - I have cured every disease, even derangement - cancers - diseases of the lungs, and the patients consulting me are those who do not get relief from the faculty; you will hear that medicine could do them no good, but they are cured - I say Mr. Campbell's treatment was unskilful, and if Mr. Vance had had the case at the begining, he would have restored her; there was a discharge, which proves health - why should he have checked it? - he should have put a poultice on - in a case like the small-pox, humours are driven to the surface; well then, a bile comes on the wound, that should be drawn off - would any medical man try to heal up an abcess, and drive it in? the spermaceti-plaister checked the discharge, filled the vessels, and the parts mortified, because the matter was not drawn off, and death followed - but here I do not know whether death should have followed, as they say Mrs. Loyd was a healthy subject; but I say she had disease when she consulted me - why did she trouble to come all the way to Harley-street if she was not ill? she knew some of my patients - they were connexions of hers; she had ample opportunities of knowing my practice - I never lost one patient that was not first a failure of the faculty; I challenge the world to produce a single patient, who died under my hands, who was not decided to be incurable by medical men before - I have cured many who I gave no hopes to; I have spent more money in my education than any ten physicians - look at the expences I have been at in Harley-street - and see the machinery there; I have cured by it, and that is all I want - I am charged with not curing a patient who was not under my care; they took her away from me - they prosecute me; and my sentence, as far as I have heard, is, that I should be here again, because I got off the last time - I leave my case in the hands of a British Judge and Jury; how many medical men might be brought here if answerable in this way? who would attend you, gentlemen, if ill to-morrow? I am told I stand here on the same footing as a member of the College of Physicians - I have as much liberty to practice as they have, provided I have done no harm; this is nothing but a persecution against me, because I have discovered a remedy for the cure of consumptions - the prevention of the small pox - the removal of the gout - and of insanity - the prosecution is by the medical gentlemen; and the last prosecution against me was paid by the medical gentlemen - I have practised among you, and do all the good I can; I had no interested motives with Mrs. Loyd - I only received 1l. 10s. from her, and I took her son for nothing; I have many patients that never pay me a farthing - that will do away with my being influenced by mercenary motives; I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170074"></xptr>spent a fortune in the search of medicine - I dissected fourteen years ago, and made a discovery, or I did not intead to follow medicine.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MRS. CAMPBELL? Q. Did you ever say to any body, while your son had the care of Mrs. Loyd, that you had the best means of knowing how she was, as your son attended her, and she would be well enough to be removed to Cheltenham in four days? A. I said to Captain 
               <persName id="t18310217-104-person1086">Sayer</persName>
            , who was in our house, that Mrs. Loyd was better, and we were in hopes she would be able to be removed in four days - I did not say where to; I had no idea of her going; I will not swear I did not say I had the best means of knowing, as my son attended her - I cannot tell when I said this; Captain 
               <persName id="t18310217-104-person1087">Sayer</persName>
             was in our house, and asked me the question - it very likely might be on Wednesday, the 13th, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GRNERAL. Q. Had Captain and Mrs. Loyd come on a visit to you? A. Yes, on the 28th of September - they had only come on a visit for a week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did your son tell you at any time that he thought Mrs. Loyd would not get over it? A. He told me so very early, perhaps the second day - it was before I spoke to Captain 
               <persName id="t18310217-104-person1088">Sayer</persName>
            ; I did not feel myself justified in giving my son's opinion for any thing - he did not desire me to keep it a secret; I mentioned it to Captain Loyd as soon as my son stated it - that was on the Thursday; I told him my son was fearful she would not get over it.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN LOYD re-examined. When Mr. Campbell first saw the wound he said it was an extraordinary wound, and a very dangerous one, and that he had rarely seen so large a wound - Mrs. Campbell said she thought it looked very dangerous on the Sunday night, after Mrs. Loyd complained of chilliness, and that it was very alarming, because it was generally the forerunner of mortification.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it that you did not call in additional assistance earlier? A. Mrs. Loyd's general good health led me to hope she would get over it without additional assistance; and I judged, from the very large practice Mr. Campbell had, he must be clever, and I continued satisfied till the wound remained open so much longer than I expected - what confirmed me in that was the spot, where she originally applied the blister, was getting much smaller.</p>

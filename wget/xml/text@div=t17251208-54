He made 2 or 3 Payments and then neglected for several Weeks. I dunn'd him often, but he put me off with one Pretence or other; and at last, about the Middle of October, he told me that a Friend in Hertfordshire had left him 50 l. and he was to go early next Morning to fetch it, and therefore beg'd me to lend him my great Coat, and half a Guines, which I did, and told him I'd bear him Company; but when I came in the Morning he was gone. In 2 or 3 Days, his Wife shew'd me a Letter without Date or Superscription; the Contents of it was that her Husband had met with two Highwaymen upon the Road, who had almost killed him, so that it would be some Weeks before he would be able to come Home. She told me however, that I should be sure to have my Money; I call'd upon her several Times, and once or twice I did get a small Matter of her; but she commonly made Excuses, and appointed me to call another Time. I went to her again on the 5th of November, and she desir'd me to come again about 10 o'Clock at Night; for she said, she was going out, and should hardly come in again before that Time. And, Mr. Hill, says she, You have often promis'd me a Glass of Wine when I paid you any Money, but you never gave it me yet; I wish you would bring it with you to Night, for now my Husband is out of Town I have most need of it, and therefore it would be a Deed of Charity. I left her, and at the Time appointed return'd with a Bottle of Wine. I knockt at the Door, and she look'd out of the Window. What, says I, are you going to Bed? If you are, I'll come to Morrow. She answer'd, No, no, stay a Minute, and I'll open the Door. I thought I heard her Husband's Voice, but I was not certain; however she came down and let me in; Now, Says she, I see you are as good as your Word, but I cannot drink except I eat a Bit first; I wish you'd step to the Chandler's Shop and fetch a Roll and Cheese. I went and turning back, I saw the glimpse of Somebody go from her Door. When I came in, we sat down in the Kitchin, and drank a Glass or two. Now, says she, suppose my Husband should come and catch us, - Why what if he should, says I, it would not be the first Time that he has seen me in this House, - I know that, says she, but yet he'd certainly Murder as both. I told her, then I would stay no longer, and got up to go, when presently Somebody knock'd at the Door. O, says she, 'tis my Sister Molly, step up Stairs a Minute, and I'll send her away again presently; for I dont know what she may think, to see us here together at this Time of Night. I went to the Stair-head, she open'd the Door, and hearing that it was her Husband, I came down again, and bade him welcome Home; G - D - ye, says he. What Business have ye with my Wife? And so knock'd me down with his Cane, and beat me unmercifully, and in the mean while his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172512080005"></xptr> Wife took a Couple of Spike Nails, and nail'd the Door with them. - Then he swore that he would have my Rings; upon which I pull'd then off, and gave them to him, and rising up, I then clos'd with him, and threw him, upon which his Wife catch'd up a knife and swore she'd Murder me; but I got the Knife from her, and threw it into the Fire. The Prisoner fell upon me again, What do you mean, says I, by abusing me thus? Do you intend to murder me? If I have done you any wrong, send for an Officer, and I'll surrender my self peaceably. By G - says he, I'll be your butcher, if you don't immediately give me a Note for 50 l. I told him I'd never do that. Why then look ye, says he, I'll make but one Word with you; if you wont return me my Note for 12 l. 10 s. and give me another Note for 5 l. You shall never go out of this House alive.</p>
               <p>I told him, I had not got that Note about me. He swore he would search me; and thrusting his Hand into my Pocket, he took out a French Six-pence, which was all I had about me then. And then they let me out.</p>
               <p>The Constable thus depos'd. When I went to the Prisoner's House in <placeName id="t17251208-54-crimeloc259">White-Horse-Alley in Cow-Cross</placeName>

               <p>The Prisoner thus made his Defence. I had been about 3 Weeks in the Country, and returning on the 5th of November, about 10 at Night to my Habitation, I saw a Light below, and knock'd at the Door, but No-body answering, I thought my Wife had been asleep; upon which I knock'd harder, and then she came to the Door with only one Petticoat on, and her Gown wrapt. loosely about her; I was surprised to see a Bottle, a Glass, and Watch upon the Table. I ask'd her who those Things belong'd to, she told me to Mr. Hill. Where is he? says I: Above says she And what Business has he there with you in the Dark? says I, and so I ran up Stairs, and found him standing in his Shirt; for I suppose he was just got out of Bed, and could not really find his Cloaths in the Dark. I was very much surpriz'd, for before this Accident, I thought I had got as virtuous a Wife as any in England But having a Cane in my Hand, I told him if he was so hot, I'd cool his Courage for him; and to giving him 3 or 4 Strokes across the Shoulders, I bid him get out of my House; however, I let him put on his Cloths, and then came down with him, and was going to fetch a Constable; but he cry'd and beg'd of me not to do it; for he should be ruin'd, if ever it came to his Father-in-law's Ear; and therefore, if I would but make it up, he'd give me any Satisfaction; I told him, I desir'd nothing of him, but a Bond never to come into my Wife's Company again; and then he gave me his Rings for a Pledge, till he gave me such a Bond. As for the French Six-pence, he gave it me to fetch a Mug of Beer, that we might drink and be Friends at parting.</p>

I keep the post-office at 42, Curzon Street, Mayfair—on 30th April or 1st May, 1874, a man named Wilding came to my shop and asked my clerk in ray hearing for change for a cheque—this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the clerk declined to cash it and I stepped forward and said I had not got sufficient to cash it for him—Wilding said "You will very much oblige Mr. Warren if you will let him have the change"—Mr. Warren is a publican round the corner—I have cashed cheques for him before—I said "I have not got sufficient"—the prisoner came in at that time and said "I want a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. order and then you can oblige your friend"—the clerk gave two orders of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each and I gave the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more for the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque to Wilding and let him go—I afterwards saw Wilding at Mr. Lewis's office in Marlborough Street.</p>

I am single and reside at 40, Hertford Street, Mayfair—I have known a man named Wilding for fourteen years—I have met the prisoner at Mr. Wilding's once, that was on the 28th or 29th April—Wilding lived in Davies Street—I saw the prisoner there with a cheque<lb></lb>book and I saw him write in it, but I don't know what he was writing—he asked me if could change a cheque for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I could not, but I would go and ask one of the tradespeople—I took it to Mr. Devereux and asked him to change it—he said "I have changed two before this, I can't change any more," and the prisoner came up and said it was good for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "You may be honest and upright and the cheque might be bad"—I gave the prisoner the cheque in Mr. Devereux's presence and said I' would have nothing to do with it—he followed me to several places and asked them, but they would not have anything to do with it—Wilding was not there then—I afterwards saw some money pass between Wilding and Wilson—Wilson came and demanded some money from Wilding, I don't know what it, was—Wilding gave him money, it was over 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I could not say how much for 1 did not take any notice not knowing there was anything wrong going on—I was sober—Mr. Wilding and Mr. Wilding's sister were present and also the house, keeper who used to live with Mr. Wilding and the children.</p>

Lewis &amp; Lewis, solicitors, Ely Place, Holborn, they will be instructed to pay each of you the full amount, which I think will certainly be only what is quite right, and will be more satis<lb></lb>factory to you than the loss of the money you have sustained; excuse pencil as I have got no ink—I remain your humble servant Edward Wilson."</p>

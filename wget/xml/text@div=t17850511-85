               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. That is part of the charge - He told me he was to see that nothing was moved off the premises. This agreement is a true copy of Mr. Smith's, there is his own hand writing for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How many people came there? - I saw Mr. Griswell upon the premises; I spoke to him that night, but the next morning I saw Griswell there again, I did not see Mr. Smith upon my premises; but on Monday the 3d of January, Mr. Smith, and the Jew Keys, and another Jew also apparently, met me at the door in the street, and this Keys demanded my rent; I did not then know his name, I told him I did not owe him any; I says to Smith, I will pay you immediately; says Smith, I have let the house to this gentleman Keys; he was very mean in appearance, I assure you; they went over the way to the Golden Lion, and I went after them, and I tendered my rent to Mr. Smith, and not thinking myself safe, I returned a second time, and tendered my rent to Mr. Smith before a witness, which is here; the same day Mr. Smith came down stairs and shut the street door, I opened it, he returned and attempted to shut the door again, and said the house was his, and the door was his, and should be shut; and I told him the door was mine, and it should be kept open; he pushed me several times, and then he swore that the Jew should swear me in a day or two.</p>
               <p>What rent did they pretend was due from you to Keys? - One pound fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you tried and convicted here? - I was tried in that other place.</p>
               <p>What fine did the Court impose upon you? - A shilling.</p>

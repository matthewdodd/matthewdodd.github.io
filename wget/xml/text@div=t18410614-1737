                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old, and am servant to Ellen Turner, of Claremont<lb></lb>place, Hackney-road. In the evening of the 22nd of May, Miss Archer knocked at the street-door—in consequence of what she said I looked into the front parlour, and missed a time-piece—I had</p>

                  </hi>. I am seventeen years old, and live in Claremont-terrace, Hackney-road. On the 22nd of May, I was standing at my door—I saw a man with a flannel jacket come out of the prosecutor's window with a time-piece in his hand—he went down Claremont-street —I went and knocked at the door, told Miss Turner, and she called the servant.</p>

On the 22nd of May, I saw two men standing at the top of Temple-street—one was in a flannel jacket, dark trowsers, and cap—the other in a black coat and round hat—that is about 200 yards from the prosecutrix's—I saw the roan in the black coat, cover a time-piece with a blue handkerchief—before he had crossed the road, Perkins came up in the same direction, and spoke to me—I told her what I had seen, and she went after the two men.</p>

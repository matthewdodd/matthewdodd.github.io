            . I was servant to Sir Henry Watson in February, 1826; this silver mustard-pot was in my charge, and was usually kept in the plate-chest, or locked up in the pantry, in my possession; I missed it at half-past two o'clock on, (I think,) the 26th of February; I had seen it before one in my bed-room - Lee, one of my fellow-servants had access to my bed-room, but nobody else; I have no knowledge how the mustard-pot went: I made inquiry for it as soon as I missed it, but it was not found; my fellow-servant is in the country. I never saw the prisoner about the house; my bed-room is in front of the house, on the basement; there was no appearance of any one having been into the room.</p>

            . I know it by the pattern - we have the other in stock, which matches with it; there were only two made of this pattern; I sold it for 6l. 18s. in December, 1821; the crest which was on it is now taken off: I would have given five guineas for it before the crest was taken off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean that at this time you would give five guineas for it? A. Yes - it is as good as it ever was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought it in the trade, and gave a very fair price for it; I bought it for my own use about five months ago, and gave 9s. an ounce. I bought it at a house of fair trade, and a mustard-spoon with it.</p>

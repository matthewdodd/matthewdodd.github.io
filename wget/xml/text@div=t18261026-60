On the 18th of October, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, as I sat in the shop, I heard a pane of glass break; I sprang to the door, and saw the prisoner go away from the spot; he was a yard or a yard and a half from the door, when I first went out; I pursued him up the street, as he ran away directly it was done; I never lost sight of him; I saw him secured, and am sure he is the same person. As I came back, I picked up a pair of shoes, which I knew to be ours - they had been taken from a window just by the broken pane of glass, and could not be got at without breaking it, and he must have put his hand or some instrument in to take them - his hand was bloody at the watch-house. It was quite dark, but by the reflection of the gas I could see him plainly - I am certain of his person, for I never lost sight of him - the glass was whole before - nothing was found on him - I dare say he was in distress.</p>

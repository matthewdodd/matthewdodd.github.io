                  </hi>. I am head attendant at the Brookwood County Lunatic Asylum, Woking—on 31st January I saw Kirk at Brookwood station, standing on the platform—I saw a parcel like a basket on the weighing machine—I saw "W. Kirk, 218, Cable Street, St. George's-in-the-East" on it—I saw the porter put it into the van—I heard the prisoner say "Is my parcel gone?"—I made a note in this book at the time.</p>

Dr. Bushfield sent me to the station—it was about 5.30—a patient named Charles Harris carried the parcel to the station—the patient would not be allowed to do so without the permission of the medical attendant—Plumley has been at the asylum eight years, and Kirk nine years.</p>

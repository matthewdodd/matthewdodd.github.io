On the 29th of August I was up two stories high on a scaffold in the City Road, just after breakfast, and saw the prisoner coming down the road by me; he had been working there, but was discharged; I said,</p>
               <p>"Where are you going?" He said, he was going up the City Road after a little job; I came down the ladder, went across, and said,</p>
               <p>"Why you have got a saw here?"</p>
               <p>"Yes;" said he,</p>
               <p>"it is one I have borrowed." I took it from under his arm, and said,</p>
               <p>"Why, it is mine, you good-for-nothing rascal, you have been and stolen it, let me see what else you have got." I felt round his coat, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got here?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I have got a smoothing plane," and pulled it out of his pocket; I said,</p>
               <p>"Now, ay'nt you a pretty fellow?" he made no answer. I secured him, he said,</p>
               <p>"Do not let us walk in this way, it looks so;" but I held him fast till I got to the Macclesfield Arms, public-house, and there sent for an officer. I had seen my tools safe that morning, or the day before, in Mr. Souter's yard; I went to a lime measure which they had been in, and missed them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I ask you for the loan of them - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard of a job, and having no tools, I said I would go to where I worked the week before, and borrow of my shopmate, and asked the prosecutor for them; I went to the yard, and saw nobody; I stopped a considerable time, at last a man came; I told him what I wanted; he said there were some tools in the lime measure. I took them; he said one of the men was working at a gentleman's house; I went with them under my arm to the prosecutor's; he called me; I stopped, and then he asked what I had got; I said, the plane and saw I had borrowed; he collared me, and swore he would do for me.</p>
               <p>JURY to WYATT. Q. Was the saw under his arm - A. It was in his hand, he said he had borrowed them, but did not say from whom; he did not know they were mine; we do borrow each others', tools, but he had been discharged.</p>

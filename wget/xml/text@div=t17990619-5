             sworn. - I am a watchman; I apprehended the prisoner; I found a gown and apron upon him; I heard a woman crying out, stop thief, and he was running along the street; nobody was in the street but him and me; he did not give any account of himself.(The gown and apron were sworn to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been up Oxford-road along with my father-in-law, to have a pint of beer or two, and when I had lost him, I came down Oxford-street, and stopped at the corner of Dyot-street to make water; there were three or four men standing, one of whom pushed me, and I meant to push him again, but instead of pushing him, I pushed that young woman, and she called out, watch; I ran to avoid the watchman, and was taken; she said, I pushed her down with intent to rob her.</p>

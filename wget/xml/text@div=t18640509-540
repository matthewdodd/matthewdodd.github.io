                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Robert Putney, of Ashford—on the night of 28th December, about 10 o'clock, I saw the two Turners and another, who I could not swear to, on the high-road to Staines—I walked half a mile with them, and left them about five minutes' walk from Mr. Clacey's—they talked about fighting and picking pockets at Windsor on Christmas-day, and I gave information to the police.</p>

On 11th January, I was with Inspector Lovelace, and apprehended William Turner, and the inspector apprehended Henry Turner—William lived at 2, Creek-street, Battersea, and Henry, at Garden-cottage, Battersea, a short distance from each other—Evans lived in the same house as Henry Turner—after taking Henry in custody I searched the house, and found this cleaning-rod in the room in which Henry Turner lived—it is a two-roomed cottage, and Henry Turner pointed out the bed he slept on—I also found this pistol, loaded with ball, and this steel in a table-drawer.</p>

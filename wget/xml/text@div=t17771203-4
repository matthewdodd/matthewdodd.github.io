I saw that particular half guinea on Wednesday at about nine in the morning; I went then up stairs in order to count my money, and in the chamber there were twenty-four guineas and eight half guineas, this was before the Bank Note was changed; I came home between five and six in the evening, and saw this money at about seven or eight at night.</p>

Mr. Macdonald told me, before I shewed it him, that one of the half guineas was very remarkable. I found a key in Gahagan's passage, which upon trial opened the door of the prosecutor's room; I tried it; I asked Mrs. Gahagan how she came by this money.</p>

               <p>I am the husband of - York, who has been examined. Gahagan worked for me ever since I took task work, which has been these last three or four months. I have paid him sometimes 30, sometimes 27 or 25 s. per week, for himself and his son. I paid him a guinea and some silver on the 2d of November at Mr. M'Donald's house.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether you did not pay me three half guineas and some silver on the Saturday before this affair. - I don't remember that.</p>

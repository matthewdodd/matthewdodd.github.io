                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and appraiser, and live at No. 5, High-street, Marylebone. In Oct. last I was engaged by a gentleman named White to distrain for rent at the house of Mr. French, No. 8, Robert-street, Chel<lb></lb>sea—up to the 8th of Nov. I had not succeeded in effecting the distress—on that day the prisoner called upon me—he told me if I would give him a warrant, something to hold, to show, he could probably get in—he had prior to that, called upon my employer, and he would not employ him—I gave him a copy of the warrant—I objected to give it him at first—he again asked me if I would give him one—I said, "On condition you do not move or do anything, but leave the man in possession, till you let me know"—if he had had to remove the goods he would have had my inventory—I did not give it him—I had not taken one at that time—I had not then seen the goods—if he</p>

               <p>had been empowered to distrain or move he would have had my inventory, but I never empower my men to do so—I saw him again on the 10th—he drove over to me in a chaise, with a person who acts as potman to Stephen<lb></lb>son, and who was chiefly with him—the prisoner then told me that he had got possession, and that he had moved everything out—I said, "Oh dear! I am sorry for that, I wish you had not done so, why did you do so?"—he said it would not have been safe to have left them there, the woman (meaning Mrs. French) was such a devil she would have broken them to pieces—he said he had done everything correct—I said, "I am sorry you removed them"—he told me they were at his, or at a warehouse—he drove me to the Bee Hive beer-shop, kept by Stephenson—I did not go in then—I did about an hour after, after having been to Mrs. French to come to some arrangement—when he took me to Stephenson's he said, "The goods are impounded in this room"—it is a room a little below the stable-yard, one step—he had not showed them to me before I went to Mrs. French's—French's is a quarter of a mile from the beer-shop—I saw Mrs. French, and an agreement was come to between me and Mrs. French—it was in the prisoner's presence, and was made in his own handwriting—I had not received any key previous to making this arrangement—Stephenson did not at any time give me any key—I received the keys of Mrs. French's house after the arrangement—I did not receive the key of the place where the furniture was—I could not get it—Stephenson was not present when the arrangement was written—he was after<lb></lb>wards—I produce the arrangement—prior to that, the arrangement was all settled, and an order made out and signed by me for Mrs. French to have the things given up to her, except a part—the arrangement was witnessed by me, by a man who was present, and by Mrs. King—Spicer wrote the top of it, and my man wrote the bottom, and it was all read over in the presence of four persons at Mrs. French's house (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Eight chairs, mahogany japanned chest of drawers, a wash-hand table, a feather-bed, two French bedsteads, and a night convenience, to be retained by Mr. Doggett, Nov. 10, 1845")—they were to be retained for the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the trifling expenses incurred that day—this arrangement referred to the things then at Stephenson's—I had seen the things at Stephenson's before this was written, whilst waiting for Mr. King, a friend of Mr. French's—I went with Spicer and his man to show me the goods—I then returned with Spicer to Mrs. French's, and made this arrange<lb></lb>ment—Stephenson was present when I saw the goods—I waited for him to come with the key—Spicer could not open the door, nor his man, or Mrs. Stephenson, and after waiting a few minutes Stephenson came and opened it, and I saw the goods in their presence—I saw Stephenson after the arrange<lb></lb>ment was come to—I showed him the arrangement in the presence of Mr. King, Spicer, and his man, and told him the arrangement that was come to—he said, "I am very glad to hear it; that is all right"—they were to send the goods up to me in a cart—I asked Stephenson and Spicer who would send them to me—Spicer said he would send them up next morning—Stephenson said, "Ah, that you can soon do in the morning"—Mrs. French was to have the other goods—I had given an order, which Stephenson took—the goods were to be delivered up to Mr. French—both understood that—they said in the presence of Mr. King and myself, that when Mrs. French brought the order signed by me in Spicer's presence, she was to remove the remaining part of the goods, except the eight articles which were to be sent to me next day—that was quite understood at the time—nothing was said at that time by Stephenson of his having any claim on Spicer, nor was anything said about it by Spicer himself—the goods were not sent back to me the following morn<lb></lb>ing—I sent a man after them in the afternoon, and on the following day,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184601050007"></xptr>
               <p>and on the 13th I went myself—I saw Stephenson, and told him I had been look<lb></lb>ing for Spicer—he said he did not know anything of him—I said, "Why did not you send those goods up, as was arranged?"—he said, "Me send them up! what have I to do with sending them up? he has borrowed money of me, and I shall not let them go without 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I then went to look after Spicer—I did not succeed in finding him—on the 15th, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I went to Stephenson's—I saw Stephenson inside the bar—I said, "I have come down again about these things, to know the reason why you have not sent them"—he said, "The things were all condemned and sold yesterday, and I have bought them," and he said if I did not get out of his house he would come and kick me out—I then saw Spicer coming in at the door—I said I should apply to a Magistrate, and said, "Why did not you deliver up the remaining part of the things to Mrs. French that I gave the order for?"—Spicer said they were all right, and I was in his debt—I said, "Well, you say I am in your debt, give me a bill"—he sat down in the tap-room and wrote this bill—after writing it he went and showed it to Stephenson, who was dressing in the place where the furniture was impounded—I did not owe him anything, and I said so—Stephen<lb></lb>son said I should have the goods for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is the bill Spicer de<lb></lb>livered to me—it amounts to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I did not consider I owed him anything more than for the men in possession, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and the moving—neither Stephenson nor Spicer said anything about this demand until that occa<lb></lb>sion—Stephenson had asked 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 13th, and then it was increased to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have never been able to find the goods—I have never seen them since, nor has Mrs. French ever got the remaining part of hers—I have a list which was forwarded to me by Mrs. French.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been an auc<lb></lb>tioneer and appraiser? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About sixteen years, in the same neighbourhood—Mr. French had held over this house it might be six or eight months, I can<lb></lb>not exactly say—I have latterly made frequent applications, to get into the house; one day in particular I found the house closed against all appli<lb></lb>cants, and I kept a man waiting—I could not get admittance, because I did not attend to it every day—I went frequently, and never got in—I knocked and rang—I was answered, but the door was not opened—I did not try to get in at the back at all—I contented myself with knocking and being refused admittance—I was anxious to get the thing arranged—the parties left on the 10th—they agreed to give up then—Spicer had been to the house when I had called for rent prior to that—I had had the warrant for a length of time, and had never been able to get in—he came to me on the 10th, I employed him on the 10th, and he got in on the 10th—I do not recollect his saying, "This will be rather a tough job, Mr. Doggett; you must pay me for it"—I will swear no such words passed—he was to be paid for his trouble—I do not know that he employed two or three men to get in, or how he got in—I have kept men watching the premises in the day-time—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I spoke of was to be paid instead of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rent—we forgave the remainder—it was on their giving up possession and paying 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which certain goods were to be security that the mat<lb></lb>ter was arranged—I gave up my claim prior to any arrangement taking place—I did not say to Spicer, when he told me he had got in and removed the goods, "I am so pleased with you for this that I will pay you handsomely, and you shall have another job of mine at Old Brompton"—nothing of the kind—I was not pleased with him on account of his moving the property away—he came to me on the 10th, the same day he took possession—I had instructed him on the 8th—he told me the reason he took the goods away was because of the violent behaviour of Mrs. French—I went with Spicer to Stephenson's,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184601050008"></xptr>
               <p>and, after waiting there some time, saw the goods in a bed-room of Stephen<lb></lb>son's man, after returning from No. 8, Robert-street—we had nothing on the road—I had to wait half an hour at Stephenson's, and I had some cigars, a pot of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale, and a little bit of steak, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—I did not pay—I said I would pay—I have not paid for it—I have not paid Spicer a farthing for what he did on this occasion, not when I was charged 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told he would not give up the goods till I had paid him—Stephenson did not say to me that Spicer would not give up the goods till I had paid him—I will swear he said nothing of the kind—I do not know whether this was rather a difficult job—if it was anything extra, and I chose to make him a compliment for his trouble, that would be a different thing—I do not tell my men I am going to give them two, three, or five guineas, when my employer would not allow me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had no understanding with Spicer—I did not tell him to take such measures as he thought fit to get into the house—I gave him the warrant to hold, to show, as he wanted something—I told him to levy, if he could, in a legal way—I know there are such things as having to get into the houses of refractory tenants by stratagem—I have heard of such—it is sometimes a difficult and hazardous thing—I had not any spirits and water with Stephenson and Spicer, nor did I go away intoxicated—I had only 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy and water—the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pot of ale was between four of us—I had the brandy and water nearly three hours after everything was settled and ar<lb></lb>ranged.</p>

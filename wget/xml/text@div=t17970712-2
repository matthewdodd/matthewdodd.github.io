             sworn. - I am a patrol of St. Andrew's, Holborn, and St. George the Martye: On the night of the 20th of June, I saw the prisoner at the bar and Mr. Sherborne, and two other men, I was about two yards from them, the other two men went on the other side of Dean-street, the prisoner and Mr. Sherborne turned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120006"></xptr>round the corner on the left hand, into Dean-street, the prisoner up with his fist, and knocked Mr. Sherborne down.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you off then? - 
               <persName id="t17970712-2-person76">

            About two yards; and directly as he knocked him down, he snatched his hat from under his head, and ran away; Mr. Sherborne called out, watch; I followed him across Holborn, there was a watchman came out of a court, and the prisoner turned back, I was not three yards from him all the time; I thought, by his returning back, that it was only a bit of a frolic, I went a little further and met Mr. Sherborne, and he said, it was very odd, that neither watchman nor patrol were to be seen; why, says I, I saw you knocked down, and your hat taken away; I sent the watchman home with Mr. Sherborne, and went down Holborn myself; I had not got above forty yards, before I saw the prisoner whistling, I let him go past two lamps, that I might be positive to the man; I laid hold of him by the collar, and told him I wanted him; he said, what for, I said, the hat that he had taken from the man in Dean-street; he said, he had no hat but his own, I put my hand up to his hat, and found this hat upon his own, (produces it); I then took him to the watch-house with this hat in my hand.</p>
               <p>Sherborne. This is my hat, I have had it ever since the latter end of last summer, I know it by this greasy part at the back of it, and the stamp I cut myself, it is neither round, nor square, nor oval.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Do you ever wear your hair tied? - A. No.</p>

            Was the prosecutor sober? - A. Not quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner sober? - A. Yes, as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been drinking, and I was coming down Holborn, I saw two or three men; Mr. Sherborne ran up against me, and two other men hustled him against me, and we both fell together into the mud; after I had gone away from them, I found I had got a wrong hat, and I was going back to see if I could find Mr. Sherborne to change it again, when the watchman took me, and said, he had seen me knock down Mr. Sherborne.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

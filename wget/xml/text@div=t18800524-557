I told Rose to come in and go to bed He came to the door and said 'Old man, I don't deserve it.' I said 'ne more you didn't I saw blood and cuts on his face. Prisoner did not ay anything about it then or at any time. I heard of the inquest. Prisons went away on 9th April; he did not tell me he was going. The not morning after this I said 'You ought to be ashamed of yourself to serve the old man as you did.' Prisoner said 'If you've got much more to say I'll serve you the same.' The "old man was drunk at the time; he was drunk nearly every night Prisoner had no instructions from me as to ad<lb></lb>mitting drunken people.

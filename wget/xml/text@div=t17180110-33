             having complained to him that the Prisoner owed him Money, and that he could not get it of him: he told him, that, if he pleased, he would get it for him, and it should not cost him a Farthing: To which he consented. Whereupon he wrote a Letter to the Prisoner, and sent it to him to Newington, about it. Upon which he came to him, and was very full of Reflections upon Mr. Biddle's, and took some notice of Mr. Biddle's charging him with the Expressious mentioned in the Indictment, and owned that he did say, That if Pretender, as he was called, was King James's Son, and was not a Bastard, then King George was an Usurper : To which he replied, That if he persisted in such Talk it might perchance lead him into ill Conveniencies . The Prisoner answered, He did say so, and should say so as long he breathed: To which he replied, That if he did, perhaps he might not breath long. But however his Business with him was not in relation to any thing of that Nature, but that he would pay Biddle his Money. That they then parted. And some Time after he went to Biddle, and demanded the Note, which was 36 s. and taking the Note, laid him down 30 s. and tore the Note. Upon this Mr. Biddle came to him again, and complained of the tearing the Note. That thereupon they went to Justice Hill, and got a Warrant to take him up for rearing the Note, and went to him to go to Mr. Biddle and make it up. But he not going, but keeping out of the way; but meeting accidentally with him at the Castle-Inn in Wood-street, got him apprehended. In some Discourse he remembered him of the Words he had said. To which he replied, That if the Pretender, so called, was not a Bastard , both Queen Ann and King George were Usurpers . This was confirmed by the Constable. And he being apprehended and carried before Sir

            , only on Account of tearing the Note. The Matter being composed as to that, he enquired of the Persons if they would Prosecute him upon those Expressions but they declining it, he was discharged. But Sir John considering afterwards that such Expressions were of ill Consequence to be tolerated, sends for him again, and binds the Evidence to prosecute. The Prisoner, in his Defence, recriminated upon Biddle, saying that he was enquiring of him what News: He answered, All you Jacobite Rogues are spoiled now, and the Bastard the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171801100005"></xptr> Pretender was fled beyond the Alps. That thereupon he replied, it was well if the Pretender was a Bastard, or else King George was an Usurper. He likewise objected against the manner of his Commitment, in that Sir John Fryer, when he had been carried before him on the Account of the Note, and the Matter being agreed, and he discharged, and the other Persons, as Mr. Biddle and Mr. Tull, had declined prosecuting him on the Account of these Expressions, that Sir John should send for him again, and oblige them to prosecute him As to that he was answered by the Court,( in Sir John Fryer's hearing, he being on the Bench) that their Opinion did differ from his in that Matter: for as he thought he had done very well, and but what was his Duty to do, for as much as the tolerating Persons to talk after that seditious manner would be of very pernicious Consequence: And that King George's Title to the Crown did not depend upon the Pretender's being a Bastard, for that he had a very good and legal Title to that, whether the Pretender was the Son of King James, or not. He called three Persons one of which had known him six Weeks, another six Months, and another a Year, which indeed did not say much to the purpose. One said he had heard him pray for the King (as he thought) another had known him drink the King's Health: But this had little avail, the Jury thought the Fact plain enough to find him <rs id="t17180110-33-verdict172" type="verdictDescription">

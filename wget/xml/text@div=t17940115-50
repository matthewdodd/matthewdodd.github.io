               <p>Q. Did you lose any sugar at any time? - On the 14th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day of the week was it? - On Saturday about one o'clock in the day, about that time in the day I saw George Jenks, Brewer, says he, run up Ralph's Key for there are some boys plundering some hogsheads of sugar, in Young's Key-gateway; I ran up directly and stopped the prisoner at the bar in Young's Key-gateway, he was in the gateway when I stopped him, just at the top, I found some sugar concealed in his hat, and his hat concealed in his apron; I said what have you got there? He said nothing, and he dropped his hat on the ground; then we took him to the Dice at Dice Key, and sent for a constable and delivered him to the constable, we took the sugar with us and gave it to the constable, he has kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain at all to whom the sugar belongs? - It belongs to us while we have it in our charge.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you prove it is from this cask? -  Because there is a stave out of the middle of the outside cask.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this outside cask? - In Young's Key-gateway, part of the stave was out, not the whole of the stave, the mark of the cask was R. R. P. No 7, I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any gone from the cask? - Yes, a quarter of a hundred, or more gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you take it back to the cask? - Directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there more missing than what you found on the prisoner? - Yes, there were more boys.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any on any of the other boys? - I did not stop any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this sugar appear like the sugar in the cask? - I went afterwards and took a sample out of the same cask.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the cask? - Yes, it appeared to be the same sort; I have brought a sample of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Brewer. How far might the boy be from the barrel when you saw him? - About twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When this gentleman came and took me I had not a bit of sugar about me, a gentleman asked me to go down for his horse and he would give me a penny, I went down for the gentleman's horse and this person came and took hold of me, he takes me to a public house and puts the sugar before me and said I had stole it; I know no more about the sugar than a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Court to Brewer. Did all the sugar belong to your gang in that key? - If<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150131"></xptr>any we are to answer for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the value of it be? - About four shillings.</p>

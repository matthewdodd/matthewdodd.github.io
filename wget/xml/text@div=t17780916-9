On Saturday was se'nninght, the prisoner, whom I had seen twice or thrice before, came to enquire how I did; he stood in my shop some time, then he asked me to give him some table beer; I went to draw it, and left him in the shop; when I returned, the prisoner was standing at the parlour door, having drank a little; he had told me that he came from Bristol the day before; I thought he might be weary, and asked him to sit down; my servant maid came to lay the cloth; the spoon and the salt-cellar were put on the table; I went backwards; I was presently called by my servant, when I came, I found the prisoner gone and the spoon and the salt-cellar were missing; he was taken on the Tuesday following, but I have not recovered either the spoon or salt-cellar. Except my own people, there was no one in the shop when I went out, and left the prisoner there; I believe I was not gone out of the shop half a minute when I was called by my maid.</p>

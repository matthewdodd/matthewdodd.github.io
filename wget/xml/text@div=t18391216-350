                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live in Mill Dock, South Shields. About ten o'clock on the 14th of December, I went to the White Swan public-house, Ratcliff Highway—I met the prisoner, but did not know him—we got in conversation—he said he came from the Baltic, and had no money—I called for something to drink and eat—I fell asleep—I had two sovereigns, I changed one, and put the silver in my trowsers pocket—the other sovereign was in my waistcoat pocket—I cannot tell how long I slept, but when I got up I went out to the comer of Union-street, and missed my money—I came back and asked about it—it was produced afterwards.</p>

I was in the Swan public-house, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner sitting by the prosecutor's side, trying to awake him—I asked what business he had with him—he said he was a shipmate of his—I said he had better be off and let him sleep to make him sober—not long after that I was at another bench, and the prisoner crossed over to me and offered to toss for a quartern of gin, which I won—he went down, and brought up half-a-pint of gin, and offered to treat the girls that were with me to brandy or anything—the prosecutor afterwards came back and said he had lost a sovereign.</p>

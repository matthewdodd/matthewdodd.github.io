                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Sexton—he keeps a tailor's shop in Compton-street. On the night of the 26th of Nov., the prisoner came home with my husband, who was in liquor—the prisoner appeared to be sober—he wished to have some clothes—I begged him to come at another time, and have dealings with my husband, as he was then in liquor—he said he had ten sovereigns in his pocket, and he wished to have some clothes that night—he said he had become a neighbour, and had taken the house next door—I asked if it was Mr. Bradbury's—he said it was—he again said he wished to have the clothes that night—I took a satin waistcoat out of the drawer, and put it on the counter—he took the waistcoat up—I then said, "Have you taken possession of the house?"—he said, "No, I live at No. 30, Compton-street, and I have lately come from Bexley, in Kent"—I was then afraid that he was the person who had duped us out of a suit of clothes some months ago, and I laid the waistcoat in the window—our present landlord's son then came in, and knowing that the suit of clothes which we were duped out of was tried on in his house, I ordered him away—I went to the door to order him out, and my husband took the coat off the block—he laid it on the counter, and it was on the prisoner's back, and he was off with the coat and waistcoat in a moment—he had put the waistcoat on over his own waistcoat, and put the coat on, and left his velveteen jacket behind him in the fright.</p>

                  </hi>. I came home a little the worse for liquor—I took a coat off the block, and put it on the counter—I had no sooner done that than the prisoner had it on his back like lightning, and was off with it—the house next to me belongs to the same landlord as my house does—it is not let to the prisoner—there is another person in possession of it, a much taller man than he is—I recollect the prisoner wanted to try the clothes on, he said he was come to be a neighbour next door, that he had got ten or eleven sovereigns in his pocket, and wished to lay it out with me.</p>

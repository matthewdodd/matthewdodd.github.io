                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Wood, a haberdasher, in Bel<lb></lb>videre-buildings, Lambeth; I keep a stall in the bazaar, Westminster-bridge-road. On the evening of the 30th of Dec, a young man came to my stall—I saw him deliberately draw some mouseline-de-laine towards him from the place it was in, and place it under his jacket or coat—I went up to him, and took it from him—I said if there was a policeman there I would give him in charge—he walked away—my neighbour, Mr. Abraham, went after him—I have every reason to believe the prisoner is the person who took it—I have a re<lb></lb>collection of the person—I believe firmly he is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I have a stall next to Mrs. Wood's. On the 30th of Dec., about nine o'clock in the evening, I was at my stall—Mrs. Wood ad<lb></lb>dressed a person who walked away from her stall—I am sure the prisoner is the person—he had a young female with him—they both went into a show in the bazaar together—about an hour afterwards Mr. Field came and asked if I should know the prisoner if he should catch him—I said yes, I should know him very well, because I had watched him up to the show, to see if he attempted anything else, but he did not—I have every reason to believe that the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 16th of June I was on duty in the passage of the pit; the prisoner came there just as the crowd were going in. I had seen him once or twice before when the people were going in. I saw him come out, wiping his face with his handkerchief, and walking gently away - he was going out at the entrance from Covent-garden - I stopped him, and said I believed he came there for no good purpose. On searching him I found the watch in his fob, with the ribbon tucked over inside his waistband. I asked him how he came by it? he said he bought it that morning of a young man in Cloth-fair, but he did not know who the young man was. I asked him if he knew the maker's name or the number? he said No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did he say he said that in order to keep it and get the reward - A. No; at the second examination he said he found it in the pit.</p>

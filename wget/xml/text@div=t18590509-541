               <p>in the plaint book in a case of Parkes <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Hogan, under the seal of the Court t—the amount claimed is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a summons was issued, and the plaintiff and defendant appeared on 15th April—the plaintiff and his brother were examined—they produced this document, and I placed it in the prisoner's hand—he was sworn, and I asked him if his name was William Hogan; he said "Yes"—I said, "Look at that document, is that your writing; he said "I did not write that"—the prosecutor or his brother said "I saw him write it"—I said, "Never mind the body, look at the signature, "William Hogan," and say whether that is your writing?" he positively swore that it was not; I think his words were, "It is not my signature" (the documents are handed up to me, and I put the questions for the Judge)—I said, look at it again," and say whether it is your writing, and he most positively said "No"—I handed the I. O. U. up to the Judge; he looked at the signature, and re<lb></lb>quested me again to hand it to the prisoner; and again the Judge asked "Is that your signature?" and he said "No"—the Judge asked him whether he could write, he said "Yes"—the Judge requested me to give him a pen and ink; I did so, and said "Now write your name;" that paper has been mislaid, and I cannot find it; but he wrote "William" or "Wiltam;" how-ever, the Christian name was spelt wrong—I handed it up to the Judge, who said, "Can you spell your name?"—he said, "Yes;" and spelt "William" correctly—the Judge then cautioned him, and asked him again whether it was his signature—he said, "No"—on that the prosecutor and his brother were examined again, and they swore positively that they saw him sign it and an order was made that he should be committed.</p>

Hogan,' is your writing;" and he said "No; it is not;" he stuck to the "No" all through—a man that was not sober might think he could deceive by signing his name wrong; I think so now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve, and reside temporarily at Hanover-park, Peckham—on 9th November, about half-past 1 o'clock, I was at the corner of Cannon-street and King William-street—I felt a pull at my watch-guard, turned round, and caught one of the prisoners attempting to escape—in the excitement of the moment I could not say which of the two I grasped first—I seized hold of one of them, and then saw the other hustling against him as if to get something from him—I caught hold of the other one, and an officer came up, and I gave them both in charge—just afterwards a female gave me my watch—the bow was broken off—I did not observe the prisoners till I felt the tug, and when I turned round they were close to me.</p>

I am a widow, and live at 4, Fraser-street, Lower-marsh, Lambeth—I saw the prisoners standing close to the prosecutor, and heard him say he had lost his watch, and I then saw one of the prisoners throw it down—I could not say which—I am quite positive it was one of them—I picked it up—it came open, and the glass was broken in throwing it down—a man came to me, and said, "Give me the watch"—I said, "No, I shall not give you the watch, because you are not the owner of it; I shall give it to the gentleman himself," which I did.</p>

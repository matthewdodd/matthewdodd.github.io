I had a box of clothes in a shed, in his or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210130"></xptr>chard - I kept the key of it; I put the things into it about noon, on the Thursday, while I was working in the garden. On Saturday, the 9th of February, the prisoner, whom I knew, came to me, and asked if I had lost anything; I said No; he said, "I think you have, look in your box, and see if you have lost any clothes;" I went to look, and the box was gone: he then said he had found the box open, in a ditch, as he was coming to work; there was a pair of black breeches and a waistcoat in it; I said, "There was a pair of corded breeches in it, have you seen them?" he said No, he had not; I have since seen a pair of corded breeches, which I believe are mine - I had bought them the week before of Mrs. Parker, and had only worn them on the Sunday.</p>

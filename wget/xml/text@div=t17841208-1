               <p>Court. Had you information of him? - Yes; the prisoner at that time, with one of the other men was sitting without his coat, and they had a goose for supper; he says to me, Sir, I hope you will let me put on my coat; if you please, Sir, says I; says he, I shall go into the other room, my partner went with him, in a minute I heard a scuffle, and I went in directly, and saw a pistol at my partner's head, I immediately turned round; my partner's name is Beamish, and he turned round and clapped the pistol to my head, and pulled the cock, and

               <p>Court. Where did he get the hanger? - He got it in a moment, he must have got it off the bed; we got that from him, and the candles were knocked out, I immediately took the pistol and cut him over the head, we got him out of that room and brought him into the other room, and I says to my partners, Crosby and one Lebar, good God! what is become of the other man? says he, he is gone; says I, what did you let him go for? The other man escaped; the woman prisoner put the candles out.</p>

               <p>Did you see any other coloured coat he had there? - No; I brought him away immediately as fast as I could; I did not search for any thing.</p>

               <p>I know it from the particular buttons and stile of making, if you observe, it is peculiar half lappelled, and the sleeves a size peculiar to myself, neither lady's nor man's size; these are stockings with my mark, T. R. here are five pair, here is a silver salt spoon, the fellow of which I have brought.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, upon your oath, what do you take to be the value of those things? - The six pair of stockings cost me six shillings a pair, I think I might say one pound one shilling for them and the coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you state the whole at a guinea? - I state the whole at a guinea, the six pair of stockings and the coat, the coat cost me three guineas.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. When had you left them there? - The 30th of July last.</p>
               <p>Then from July to the 13th of September, you do not know whether they were there or no? - I do not, I was abroad at the German Spa.</p>

               <p>What room was that in? - In the front room up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Court to Falkner. Do you know the escrutoir that Mr. Read speaks of, in which the things were, in the front room up one pair of stairs? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Before these people came in, was the door of that room safe? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Willes. How soon after they went away did you find the door broke? - When the people came to my assistance, they searched the house.</p>
               <p>How soon did you yourself see the door open? - After the people came into the house to my assistance I saw it.</p>
               <p>Did you see it open at the time when they first came into the house? - I did.</p>

               <p>Dickson. This petticoat and gown were brought here, because the girl said the woman prisoner had it on at the time she came to the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Read. Here are five pair more.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did the people come first to you, or did they go up stairs before they carried you? - They came first to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I have always understood, that to constitute this particular offence, there must be an actual breaking into the house, not afterwards a breaking when in the house, and that is the distinction between this and burglary, because in burglary they may first get in by fraud.</p>

               <p>Court to Read. You have swore to the value of these things that were found, you have sworn very tenderly as to the value; you have lost a great many other things, can you name any of the other things? - Yes, I lost sixteen callico shirts, and about twelve or more linen ones, I lost several coats, and nine silver spoons; the callico shirts I value at eight guineas, four coats at a guinea a piece, and divers other things.</p>
               <p>Court. Who had the key of this room? - An acquaintance of mine in York-street.</p>
               <p>Court. You need not call any people to the woman's character, there seems to be sufficient evidence before you to induce you to believe she is the man's wife.</p>

               <p>This handkerchief I am sure of, I have had it so many years, and I have only one of that sort which I lost that night, I have had it ever since the year 1776. It is a muslin handkerchief, I lost another, it has my mark upon it, and I have little doubt of it; I have obtained no other part of my property, the instruments they made use of in breaking open the place were taken on them, and a cutlass, a pistol, and an iron crow, they were taken afterwards.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I have nothing particular to say, these handkerchiefs that were found, belonged to the man that made his escape without his coat, one of these handkerchiefs<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080009"></xptr> was round his neck, and the other was found in the inner room, which has been attributed to me, and the stockings, and all the things that were mentioned in the former prosecution he brought to me, being a shipmate of mine; I leave it entirely to your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. In respect of the burglary, it was between seven and eight in the evening, on the 8th of August, when you know it is by no means dark: as for the woman, though the law does certainly protect her, yet as she was so principal an actress in these robberies, if her husband is executed, probably if she has any sort of feeling for him, she will recollect that she has been very instrumental in having his life taken away.</p>

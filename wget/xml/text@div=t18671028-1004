                  </hi> I am the wife of Charles Roker, a printer, of 13, Queen Street, Walworth Common—on the afternoon of 17th September I was in Newington Causeway—I saw the prisoner there, carrying a baby—she threw the baby into some slake lime, which was wet and smoking, and then threw herself in—they were repairing the pavement—I thought at first that she had slipped over the stones—I did not think for the moment that she threw the baby in—I ran as quick as I could and picked the baby up, and said to the men, "Pray pick the woman up"—the baby was in the lime—one part of it was covered—it was on its left side when it was lying down—there was a very great deal of lime on the prisoner—I went to the police-station with her—I stopped with her for over three or four hours</p>

               <p>after it occurred—I begged of her not to be guilty of such a thing again, a great many people had trouble—I said that she ought not take the trouble so much to heart—before that she said she had a very unkind husband, and I believe she has, from what I have heard—she said her husband had been very unkind to her, and she had been driven to it—she said nothing to me about slipping.</p>

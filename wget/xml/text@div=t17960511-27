               <p>Q. Be so good as look at that paper; are you acquainted with the hand-writing of Mr. Weston? - A. I have seen his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Weston's writing to say whether the body of that instrument is filled up by him? - A. It appears to me as such.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at the signature of Patrick Tonyn, which purports to be your's, is that written by you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sign, seal, or deliver, that instrument which you have now in your hand? - A. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that you did not? - A. I am certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at the signatures of the witnesses; there is a person of the name of Bowser; do you know a person of that name? - A. Yes; he is my regimental clerk, and a servant with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the manner in which your clerk, Bowser, writes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be his signature? - A. I don't know; it has a resemblance.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 21st of January last, were you residing in Park-street, or in the country? - A. I was in the country, at Ipswich.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, at any time in the month of January, or any other time, by writing, or otherwise, authorize Mr. Weston to fell your 16,000l. stock? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, in the month of April, you had given some directions with respect to your stock? - A. Yes; to Mr. Aldridge, my solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what passed between you and him, did you see Mr. Weston? - A. I did; accidentally.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110091"></xptr>Q. What day was it you saw Mr. Weston upon that occasion? - A. On Friday the 8th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that you saw him? - A. I went by appointment, and saw him at Mr. Aldridge's.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not expect to see him there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what passed between you and Mr. Weston, or between you and Mr. Aldridge in the prisoner's presence? - A. I was to have come from Mr. Aldridge's to the Bank, to make the transfer; but I was told, either by Mr. Weston or Mr. Aldridge, that it was a very busy day at the Bank, that they were paying the dividends to the bankers, and that if I went to the Bank to make a transfer, I should be detained three or four hours, and, perhaps, not get it done at last; I then said, I must go some other day, and I could not go the next day, having some business upon my hands, and I fixed it for Monday; Mr. Weston had been out of the room, and came in again just at that time when I was talking to Mr. Aldridge, and said, that he would meet me at the Bank on the Monday. Mr. Aldridge said, you will have no objection for Mr. Weston to do the business for me, for I am obliged to go out of town on Sunday; I said, I could have no objection, if the business was done, that was all I wanted. I went to the Bank, about a quarter before twelve, and found that there was no stock in my name.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not seen the prisoner from that time till since he was in custody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a Mr. Cowan, of Ely-Place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lend him your stock at any time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever authorized Mr. Weston, or any body else, to receive your stock? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever applied to by Mr. Cowan to lend your stock? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Wood. Q. How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Weston? - A. Four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not take upon you to say whether the body of this is his hand-writing or not? - A. I can only say it resembles it.</p>

            's stock? - A. I went to the Bank on Thursday the 7th of April, and saw Mr. Weston there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you referred to any person, and who, in Mr. Weston's presence? - A. I told Mr. Weston,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110092"></xptr>that the General would attend at the Bank on the following day, the 8th, to transfer 16,000l. Bank-Annuities into the names of the executors under his brother's will.</p>
               <p>Q. What reply did he make to that? - A. Mr. Weston wished the appointment to be postponed, and requested me to get the General to attend at a future day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to Mr. Weston about a deficiency of stock? - A. I told him, I had just been told by Mr. Vickery, that the stock had been already sold, and Mr. Weston said it was true, it was sold, but it was in navy-bills, and the navy-bills would be sold to replace the stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say why it had been converted into navy-bills? - A. He said, the stock had been lent to Mr. Cowan, by General Tonyn, and that Mr. Cowan was to replace it previous to the time of the transfer taking place to the executors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any reason for its not having been replaced? - A. He said, the reason was, that the navy-bills had been low in price, and that there was an expectation of their getting higher; and therefore he wished the business to be postponed, that the navy-bills might be sold to the best advantage; I told Mr. Weston, that the appointment had been absolutely made with the General for the next day, and that I could not of myself put it off; Mr. Weston requested I would apply to the General to know if another day was convenient; I did not assent to it, but told him I would speak to the General upon the subject if I saw him, but not to rely upon the appointment being postponed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you to communicate the whole of the conversation to the General? - A. I said to Mr. Weston, I should suppose if this is the case, a few days will not be very material, and I had better tell the General the real circumstance of its being in navy-bills; Mr. Weston said, I must request you will not do that; the General, when he lent it to Mr. Cowan, desired it might be a secret, and did not wish that you might be made acquainted with it; and I believed what Mr. Weston said most implicitly.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that did any thing more pass between you and Mr. Weston? - A. He said, if the General was agreeable to attend another day, he begged I would let him know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inform him after you had spoken to the General? - A. I wrote a note to Mr. Weston, to inform him that I had called upon the General, and he was out, and requested he would be ready the next morning to have the business compleated.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him afterwards? - A. I saw him the next morning at my house, in the presence of General

            ; the General came to me at half past eleven, according to the appointment previously made, to go to have the stock transferred; Mr. Weston came at the time, and told the General, that if it could be postponed till the next day at twelve o'clock, it would be a great convenience, for he would be kept a very little time, whereas, if he went on that day, it being the first day of paying dividends, he would be detained, most likely, two or three hours, and the appointment was fixed for the next Monday, at twelve, to meet at Mr. Vickery's.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with Mr. Weston's handwriting? - A. I have seen Mr. Weston write.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the body of that, do you believe it to be his hand-writing? - A. I could not positively swear it to be his.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be his from your knowledge of his hand-writing? - A. I should have great difficulty in saying I was certain it was his.</p>
               <p>Q. But do you believe it; you must have your belief one way or the other? - A. My belief rather inclines that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe this to be his writing, (showing him a letter)? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is written upon two sheets of paper, addressed to Mr. Cowan, or Sir Hugh Palliser Walters, Bart.</p>
               <p>Witness. I have known Mr. Weston since the month of October, 1791, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. What has been his general character during that time? - A. Till the rumour of this unfortunate transaction, I believe Mr. Weston's character to have been pure, honourable and correct in every respect.</p>

               <p>Having, in order to avoid miserable, destructive reflections, made up my mind to commit an act, at which I shudder, it is necessary, briefly to give some account how I have so involved myself. Early in May 1792, Mr. Cowan gave me the management of his affairs, and a compleat controul over his money concerns. In the August following, Sir Hugh entrusted me with the management of near 700l. a year; I then engaged in stock speculations; I employed Messrs. Mackay and Forbes, and Mr. Salmon, to whom I have paid immense losses. Finding myself thus involved, I ensured to a considerable amount, with Nicholson and Day, to whom I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110094"></xptr>paid some thousands. In April 1794. I had a considerable speculation in stock with Mackay and Forbes, Mr. Vickery assisted me in paying it, expecting to be paid in due course; after that I lost 1300l. upon Irish debentures. Still finding myself followed by ill-luck, as the books of those gentlemen can show. I had recourse to the gaming-table, at Phillips's and Nelson's, in Past mall, and likewise Searle's, in Covent-Garden, at which place I lost 7000l. I was then tempted to do every thing that was dreadful; I sold out 2000l. standing in my name, and

            , by a false power of attorney, executed and witnessed, my hand-writing, for General Tonyn; I also forged a power of attorney, empowering Mr. Cowan and me, jointly to sell 11,000l. stock, which I made his servant witness, saying, it was for my aunt, before I signed the name of Pat. Tonyn. I likewise did the same with a subsequent power of attorney, and signed he name of

            , as witness there to, but made the servant sign it. In short, the ill-luck that has attended me through life, has induced me, in order to keep up appearances, to commit those neadful acts, and to impose on the credulity of Mr. Cowan, and Mr. Walters, gentlemen; whom I have grossly imposed on; but as my life and existence is a burden to me, I shall conclude in a few words. I have paid Mr. Salmon several thousand pounds losses, the greater part of which was occasioned by his not following my directions. I have paid Messrs. Mackay and Forbes, an immense sum also, for losses, and Mr. Oakley, and also a very large sum for insurance in the lottery; to Mr. Samuel Smith, to Mr. Nicholson, considerable sums for insurance, Mr. Day, ditto; Mr. Bannister, ditto, this lottery, 600l. I have lost immensely at pharo, and also at hazard; in short, every guinea of Mr. Cowan's and Mr. Walter's money that I have spent, is gone in that way, and I have basely injured them. The debts owing to me are as follows: Mr. Lacy, 1148l. 15s.; Mr. Toulmin, 481l.; Mr. Hume, 255l.; Captain

            , 131l. 5s. The above will give some insight into my affairs. At present, I am so deadly ill, that I cannot proceed further, and long before you receive this, I shall be no more; I have been a most unfortunate wretched young man, to involve so many people as I have done; but God forgive me. H. W.(Mr. Serjeant Shepherd took an objection, that the indictment ought to state the whole of the deed, whereas, in the indictment, the title, "Consolidated 3 per Cent Annuities" was omitted; but the Court were of opinion, that it made no part of the deed, and that it was a mere direction to the clerk, for him to see to which stock it applied, and therefore over-ruled the objection).</p>

                  </hi>. I am game-keeper to Mr. Anderton. I was employed at South Mimms on a manor belonging to the Marquis of Salisbury, but let to Mr. Anderton—I was at Furzefield-wood on the 4th of Nov.—I saw the prisoner cutting the underwood—there was a great quantity of it cut and lying on each side of where he was—it was worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Munns was with me—we came up to the prisoner—he ran into the wood—we ran after him—before I got up the prisoner struck Munns with a stick, and knocked his hat off—I came up and said, "Philip, is that you?"—he said yes, and he would rip me up with a knife—he struck at me—I fell back, and the knife ran up my waistcoat and jacket and touched my chin, but it did not enter my flesh, nor fetch blood—he then took up a brick and threw it at me—he made several attempts at us with hit knife, but we kept him off with our sticks—he said he would stab the first man that came near him; and as I knew him I thought it would be as well to let him go, and not to run any further danger.</p>

Munns went one way and I the other—it was all thin wood—we could see him all along—I had a stick in my hand—I struck him with my stick, to try to knock the knife out of his hand, after he had tried to stab me—he attempted to stab Munns, and then I ran up and tried to get the knife out of his hand—I did not strike him before he used the expression of ripping me up—we after<lb></lb>wards followed him on further—I asked where he lived; he said he had no home—I knew he lived in the village—he kept running one way and another, and swore he would rip us up—we were obliged to keep him off with sticks—the wood is composed of birch and oak—there might be acorns about, but no one has any right there—Mr. Warby rents the wood of the Marquis of Salisbury, and lets it to my master—it does not belong to Mr. White—his grounds are round the wood—a person passing through the wood might go to Mr. White's, but we allow no one to go through.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Furzefield-wood on the 4th of November with Gibbs—I saw a person, and in consequence of what Gibbs said, I ran after the person—he got out of the wood, but I did not lose sight of him—I over<lb></lb>took him—it was the prisoner—he had a stick in his hand—he struck at me—I put my arm up, and he knocked my hat off—I ran up to him, and got the stick out of his hand—I got behind him—he got a knife out of his pocket, and said, if I did not let go of him, he would run it into me—he struck at me six or seven times—I kept behind him, and got hold of his arm—Gibbs came up, and said, "Is it you, Philip?"—he said, "Yes," and then I let him go—he attempted to stab him, and I knocked him off—he said he would not be taken by anybody—he got out of the field over the hedge, took a brick and threw it at Gibbs—I saw Gibbs hit him on the arm in the field, and try to knock the knife out of his hand—after he got over the hedge, and threw the brick, I said to Gibbs, "It is not worth while to run the risk of our lives; you know him."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

The prisoner came in on the night of the 31st of July, and called for some porter; he asked if he could not sit down, and I directed him to the club-room; he stopped about half an hour. I saw him come along the passage, and go towards the door; my daughter cried out, "Mother, we are robbed;" I called Stop thief! he went out, and she followed him; he came back in a few minutes, with his hat in his hand, and said, "Are you the landlady?" I said, Yes. He then said, "I have got some property of your's, which I will give you;" I said, "My husband is not at home - I will not take it till an officer comes."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see him go out before your daughter cried Stop thief? A. Yes - I saw him come and put a glass down, and while he was doing it my daughter cried out, "Mother, we are robbed" - he was not at all in liquor.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner sitting in the club-room, with a glass of porter before him. I afterwards saw him in the little parlour adjoining the club-room - there was no one there but him. There is a little cupboard on the right-hand side, in which the china is kept - I am certain it was locked at four o'clock in the afternoon; I found it open - the lock had been picked. After the prisoner was gone I went into the parlour, and he came out; he said nothing to me, but went into the club-room again, and put down two punch bowls, which he had taken out of the cupboard. I asked him what he was going to do; he said he wanted to go to the bar to get a glass of ale - he went to the bar, put the glass down, and went out of the house, and I went after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say when you stopped him, "I am taking these things for a frolic?" A. No - he said, "What do you want with me? you have nothing to do with the house;" I said, "Have not I?" he then came back.</p>

I went into this house, and into the club-room, and there were many persons there - I went into the parlour, and saw the cupboard door open; I took the punch-bowls, and thought I would take them into the next room, and have a bit of fun, and have a pint of gin, or something of that, but I had no idea of stealing them.</p>

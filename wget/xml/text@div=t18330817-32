             (police-constable G 23). On Sunday morning, the 9th of June, the prosecutrix charged the prisoner with having taken her handkerchief - I thought they had both been drinking; I endeavoured to separate them - I did not believe the prisoner had taken her handkerchief, but after I had separated them, I saw the prisoner in the act of putting this handkerchief down out of his pocket, as he stood against some shutters.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell me that if you knew me, you would not have taken me on account of her character? A. Decidedly not.</p>

             (police-sergeant G 8). I was at the station-house when the charge was brought; I knew the prosecutrix - the prisoner said he knew nothing of it several times, but after hearing his charge at the office, he said she gave it him to hold - he had said at the station-house that some one must have put it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What was the reason you told her not to be alarmed, for you would protect her? A. Because she came to me, and said some of your friends had been to her, and threatened her.</p>
               <p>JOHANNA SULLIVAN re-examined. Q. Had you two handkerchiefs? A. Yes; but this one was used as a shawl - the prisoner took it out, and when I went after him, he said he would knock me down - he had it tight in his hand for about five minutes, and when I asked him for it, he put it into his shirt - he did not go out till I asked him for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How came your red handkerchief in my hat? A. I cannot say; I did not give him any thing to hold - I was not in liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I have already been tried and convicted on an indicted, but a witness named Flanagan, who was not present at the last trial (although subpoened), is here now to state the facts, that my prosecutrix and another woman were going to fight; that my prosecutrix asked me to take charge of her handkerchiefs, which I refused, and Flanagan saw my prosecutrix put the handkerchiefs into my pocket, or somewhere near my person, of which I was totally unconscious at the time (being in a state of intoxication). The prosecutrix and the woman fought, and were turned out of the public-house. They fought on in the street, and afterwards all of them went down Golden-lane together; the prosecutrix then, for the first time, thought of her handkerchiefs, and accused me with taking them, which I denied. She began to strike and scratch me, and gave me into custody. I was searched, but nothing was found on me and, strange to say, shortly after the handkerchief was observed hanging to my jacket. My prosecutrix was so drunk at the time, that she did not recollect any thing of the transaction; and, therefore, when she went to prefer the bill of indietment, she actually asked the policeman what she was to state. Mrs. Macque can prove that. The charge has been got up for the purposes of extortion, or why did the prosecutrix wish to make it "all right" for thirty shillings? When that was refused, she said she could make more of it at the sessions; that I should get a month or two, and she should get her expences. She also asked the witness Macque to give her a silk handkerchief and four shillings. Another witness can prove that the prosecutrix said, that if I employed counsel, she would not scruple to swear any thing, however false it might be, in order to insure a conviction.</p>

            . On the 9th of June, I was at the Cock public-house, about seven o'clock in the morning - I saw the prisoner and the prosecutrix there drinking, and both very tipsy - the prosecutrix began a row with another woman, and she put her handkerchief into the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to swear that you saw the prosecutrix take her own handkerchief, and put it into the prisoner's pocket? A. Yes; she wanted him to hold it while she fought the other woman - he refused it, and then she slipped it into his pocket, and said he was more capable of holding it than she was; it was a yellow handkerchief - I swear I saw this woman put her handkerchief either into his pocket, or some part of his coat; I did not see any flowers - they were turned out into the street, and fought three or four rounds in the street, and she fell into the kennel; I heard her ask the prisoner for her handkerchief, but I did not tell him to give it her, as I did not like to intermix with them - after she had asked him for the handkerchief she tore him, scratched his face, and threw dirt in his face; I knew the prisoner, I had worked with him about four years ago - it was an inside pocket that she put the handkerchief into - his jacket was not buttoned; she did not ask him for the handkerchief in the public-house - they had come out and fought for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before she asked for it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was going on home, and she came and caught hold of the skirts of my coat, and then came in front of me, and tore me down the face; she then went back to the Cock, where Falshaw and the other were, and then she and the officer came to me, and took hold of the skirts of my coat; I consider this only done to make a case against a drunken man, or else the prosecutrix would not go to extort four shillings from a witness.</p>

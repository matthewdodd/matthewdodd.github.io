                  </hi>. I live at 28, Little St. Andrew-street—On the evening of 26th June, about half-past 9, I was in Little St. An<lb></lb>drew-street, and when turning a corner to cross to St. Martin's-lane, I was suddenly surrounded by three young men—the prisoner seized my watch-chain, but having a safety-guard in my pocket, he could not get it out—in the struggle the chain broke, and I caught part of it in his hand—I called "Stop thief" and "Police"—the other two ran different ways—the prisoner ran down Castle-street, and I after him; it was just getting twilight—I lost sight of him once for about two seconds—when I came up he was in the hands of the officer—this is the part of the chain that I seized out of his hand.</p>

He was intoxicated. A lady wanted to come into the station to say she saw the robbery committed, and it was not me, and they would not let her in.</p>

               <p>(The witnesses withdrew.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury. Gentlemen this is an indictment against the prisoner, under an act of parliament that passed in the nineteenth year of the reign of the late King, and it is for an offence of which, if the prisoner is guilty, the legislature have very properly thought that he deserves a capital punishment, and with respect to that I believe when you come to hear the motives on which the act of parliament passed, you will be of opinion it was a very proper act; and certain I am, that if the prisoner is guilty of the fact imputed to him, it is a fact, which from the circumstances of the present times, not only calls, but loudly calls for a very severe and strict exemplary punishment: the grounds on which that act of parliament passed, and the reasons that induced the legislature more strictly to inforce the laws against persons committing the crimes attributed to the prisoner at the bar, if ever they did exist, exist in their full force now. The act begins with reciting that whereas dissolute persons have associated themselves, and entered into confederacies to support one another, and have appeared in great gangs in several parts of the kingdom, carrying fire arms and other offensive weapons, &amp;c. and whereas, several officers of the Customs and Excise, and their assistants, have been wounded, maimed, and some of them killed in the execution of their office, to the utter subversion of all civil authority; it is therefore enacted that if any persons to the number of three or more, armed with fire arms or other offensive weapons shall be assembled in order to be aiding and assisting, in the illegal exportation of goods to be exported, or in the running, landing, or carrying away prohibited or unaccustomed goods liable to pay any duty, which has not been paid, or secured from any of his Majesty's officers, such persons shall be guilty of felony, without the benefit of clergy. Gentlemen, it is for the offence contained in this act of parliament, that is, for being so assembled for the purpose of landing, running, and carrying away, and also for rescuing goods of this sort after seizure, that the prisoner is now indicted. Gentlemen, I should have taken no notice of another part of the act of parliament, or why the prisoner was called upon to answer for another offence, if the learned Gentleman had not mentioned it, but the act goes on, and declares, that if an information shall be exhibited against any person guilty of any of the offences in this act, and that shall be transmitted to one of the secretaries of state, and proclamation inserted in the Gazette for such person to take his trial, if within forty days after proclamation he shall not surrender, then he shall be guilty of felony, in the same manner as if he had not been guilty of any offence whatever. Gentlemen, the prisoner at the bar after this offence was imputed to him, was called upon by a proclamation to surrender; he did not surrender, and it was not till a very few months ago that he was apprehended; no matter for what cause; being apprehended, he appeared to be the same man, he was committed upon, and he might have been tried upon that; but the learned gentleman says, I know I could not have convicted him upon that; how the learned Gentleman comes to be so well informed, I do not know; he will tell you if he pleases any reasons he may have for thinking the prisoner could not have been convicted under that proclamation: this I know, that the reason of that proclamation is this, that if persons guilty of those violent offences shall withdraw themselves from Justice, and then return into this country, that they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110092"></xptr> shall be liable to be tried in this way, by shewing that they did not surrender; but whatsoever the learned gentleman may suppose, respecting me, if I did not believe the man guilty of the offence, I would scorn to prosecute him by that prosecution; and now, though it was in my power to prosecute him under that proclamation, I did not think my duty required it: but I assume no merit to myself on the occasion. Gentlemen, having before you now all the evidence that there could be on that original information, you will think with me that I do much better to prosecute him, as if he had not absconded. The offence I have stated to you from the act of parliament, whether the prisoner falls within that act, you, under the directions you will receive from the Court, are to decide: the learned Judge will state to you his opinion of the act of parliament; you will hear that, and then you will judge of the facts, and if you think those facts warranted, you will pronounce the prisoner Guilty. The prisoner is, I believe, originally a native of Hampshire, at least he has lived in that country for some years; and, until this offence was committed, I believe was continually there.

            , who is an officer in the excise, received information, that there was a great quantity of smuggled goods lodged in a house at Burley in Southampton, where they went and seized fifty bags of tea, and forty casks of Geneva; soon after a waggon belonging to one Shelly was coming by, and they desired he would permit them to take it to Ringwood; time enough had elapsed between the seizure and the time of conveying it to Ringwood, for a very considerable number of persons, of whom the prisoner is one, between thirty and forty, or some such number, that had concealed themselves behind the road to obstruct those by whom this seizure was to be conveyed to the Excise-Office; it will appear in the course of the trial, that some of them had the knowledge that the soldiers had no ammunition; and I believe the prisoner was bold enough, because he knew that fact, to take the part he did in this present business: as they were going along the road there rushed out from a wood not above three or four hundred yards from the place where the seizure was made, several persons, some of them with large sticks, and the prisoner was the most active man, crying out to the rest, damn it, come on, they shall not have a bit of tea; upon which they drove the officers away, and drove off the waggon full speed. Gentlemen, you will find these persons were as good as their words, for they got off the tea, drove it off, and no more was heard of that: this was not sufficient, which I should have thought might have satisfied these gentlemen, but they were determined to be guilty of another fact, which was one of the reasons that this act of parliament passed, which states that the officers were frequently maimed, and their lives sometimes taken away; the soldiers, as I understand, were young recruits, and they tempted them with an offer of some liquor, not to do their duty; the officers began to see that the smugglers and the soldiers were upon such terms on the road, that they thought it their best was to make off as fast as they could; accordingly all the officers endeavoured to make the best of their way; but when the smugglers found the officers were frightened and running off, they followed them, and beat them in such a manner that one of them was left almost dead. Gentlemen, this is the offence charged against the prisoner: it is necessary there should be three persons, or more, with fire-arms or other offensive weapons, that they should be assembled for the purpose either for the forcibly landing prohibited goods, or rescuing goods prohibited from the persons who by law were authorized to seize them; if they were so assembled with that view, they are guilty under this act of parliament, whether they do any thing or not; but in the present case there cannot be any doubt that the prisoner was one of them that assembled with that intent, the facts will leave no doubt of his guilt in that respect; the only question then will be whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110093"></xptr> there were three persons or more in company assembled with the same common intent, or armed with fire-arms, or other offensive weapons. My Lord, will state the law, I take the liberty of stating, that if the persons so assembled had with them, or about them, those things which were used, as probably and possibly they might be used, by them as weapons of offence, that is sufficient, and then the prisoner is guilty under this act of parliament, although the weapon is not strictly and properly speaking a fire-arm, for what is an offensive weapon is to depend as well on the use of the instrument; I may make use of a thing as an offensive weapon, that is not in its nature intended as such; but I submit with great confidence to my Lord's direction, that if it appears to you that the prisoner and his comrades had at this time those things which they used as offensive weapons, as for instance, if I was to snatch that candlestick, and go about with it to knock down excise officers, I submit it would be an offensive weapon; and under that direction, I am confident you will convict the prisoner; but if there should be any doubt in point of law; if my Lord should have any doubts, and you should entertain doubts likewise, I am sure, in that case, you will not be at all averse to state what facts you find, and leave the determination of the law to all the Judges of England. These things are in your power; it is in your power generally to acquit; and in your power generally to convict: but, if you should have any doubts, though I do not know that any will arise, I am sure you will not be averse to finding the prisoner guilty on the facts, as they appear to you, stating those facts, that they may be reserved for the opinion of the Judges: but if you find the prisoner is not guilty, it will be equally your duty to say so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding My Lord, I hope Mr. Attorney-General will satisfy the Jury, that the matter of the suggestion he mentioned is quite foreign to this inquiry, for I could have given a most satisfactory answer to that suggestion, and therefore this case is not to derive any assistance from that.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>How many officers were there all together? - About six.</p>
               <p>After you had made this seizure, what did you do? - We employed a waggon to carry the goods to Ringwood after we had seized it, and in going along from Burley to Ringwood, we were molested by a set of men, and they rescued the waggon, and the goods that were in it from us, and drove it away; we were about three or four hundred yards from Burley, there were about ten or twelve persons that stopped, that came as we apprehended, from behind the bushes; I saw them come down to the waggon, they were on horseback, they were on the left side as we were going to Ringwood.</p>
               <p>Where did you first see them? - When they came down immediately, to take the waggon from us.</p>
               <p>Was there a person of the name of Early there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he do? - He assisted with the rest in rescuing the waggon; after we had seized the goods and got them into the waggon, we came to Cassin's house, down a little hill, about three or four hundred yards; then Early rode by the waggon and came to me, he met me and spoke to me, he went by me, and presently returned back, and I saw the other persons come up, as I apprehended, from behind some bushes, then he said, damn your eyes, come out.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of these persons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110094"></xptr>Had those persons, or any, and which of them, any thing in their hands? - Several of them had something in their hands.</p>
               <p>What were they? - Sticks, such sticks as smugglers generally ride with, rather larger than riding sticks in general, larger than walking sticks a great deal, but I never measured any of them, and I cannot tell you particularly as to the size, they are such sticks as a person would walk with to defend themselves.</p>
               <p>What next happened? - They then went to beat the horses that were in the waggon, in order to drive it away from us, then they endeavoured to keep us back, and they stood before us, and would not let us go by; the sticks that I saw, I saw them beat the horses with, and drive the waggon.</p>
               <p>Did they make any use of their sticks with respect to you or the other officers? - Not just at that time, they drove them on.</p>
               <p>Did they at any time make use of those sticks as against you or the other officers, describe what passed after that? - They kept us back from pursuing the waggon, and in turning for us to go forward, there was one of them struck the collector.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What were the goods gone at this time? - They were gone on the road.</p>
               <p>How far were they gone? - I suppose at that time that they struck the collector they were gone a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Court. I think under this indictment after the offence is compleat we cannot hear what was done.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. What did they do at the time that the waggon was stopped? - Advancing the sticks and keeping us back.</p>
               <p>Court. Then they stopped you from coming up some of them holding up their sticks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor. Where was the prisoner at that time? - He was amongst them.</p>
               <p>What had the prisoner in his hand at this time? - I cannot be certain.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing in his hand? - I cannot say, I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Where were those persons placed at the time they made the rescue? - They were at the left of us when they came to the waggon; they seemed to come across on the waggon at once, I never saw anything of them before.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the prisoner at the bar say anything? - No, I do not remember I ever did.</p>
               <p>Was anything said by any of these persons? - There was a cry (we were all in confusion) damn me, keep back, but who spoke it I am not able to say.</p>
               <p>What was said by any of them, when the prisoner was among them? - I do not remember hearing any of them speak but Early, and that was when the waggon was gone on.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Early call out to anybody? - He did after he passed by me when he came down the hill again, I heard him plainly and distinctly say, damn your eyes come out, on saying these words, some rushed out from behind the bushes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of those? - I was at that time in confusion, I saw the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I understand that at this place they were on horseback, of course some breadth of road was necessary to admit them? - It was a common, what we call a heath, where there is furz bushes and trees.</p>
               <p>Whether the prisoner was an accidental passenger there or not you cannot say, you heard him say nothing, you saw him do nothing? - I cannot take upon myself to assert, how he came there, or for what purpose he came there, only that he was there; I saw him but once, which was when the waggon was driving away, after that I apprehended he went away with the waggon, but whether he did I do not know; he went that way with the waggon.</p>
               <p>You saw him among that number, but you say that he did nothing, that he said nothing, that you do not know whether he had a stick in his hand or not, and that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110095"></xptr> went away, and you saw nothing more? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Did the waggon turn off quick or slow? - As fast as it could.</p>
               <p>Did he follow the waggon? - He went on with it.</p>
               <p>Which way was it he came? - From one side of the road.</p>
               <p>Did he go with the rest after the waggon? - Yes, there were such a number of people, some went with it, and some staid to keep us back, there were more than twenty or thirty; I only came here to tell the truth, and what I know of the fact: I shall say no more one way than the other.</p>
               <p>Court. When you first saw the prisoner he was with the rest? - He was.</p>
               <p>When you last saw him, was he with those that went away with the waggon? - Yes, as far as I saw them.</p>
               <p>This was within three or four hundred yards of Burley? - It is called Burley, it is a long straggling village, four miles round.</p>
               <p>Were there any people whom curiosity brought upon this occasion? - If I must tell that, I believe there were, for there were a good many at the house; for in such a place as that, as soon as the officers go to seize goods, the country people do assemble.</p>
               <p>I will ask you freely, you seem to speak fairly, could you from any act of the prisoner's, discern whether he was among those people who came with the rest, to see what was going forward; or whether he was one of those that came to rescue the goods? - He was with them that rescued them; but with what purpose he came there, I cannot say, I never saw anything of him, till Mr. Early spoke; where they came from I did not immediately see, there were some bushes or trees, that took away my sight, whether they been concealed or whether they were coming up at that juncture I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they upon the Ringwood road when you first saw them? - There are a number of roads upon the heath, but whether they were on the road I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Is there any made road in this place? - There was a road where we were with the waggon, and they were to the left of that, and they crossed towards the waggon.</p>
               <p>Did the people that so crossed towards the waggon, come up in a compleat body, or did all the other people come with them? - It appeared to me they came all in a body.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of those that so came up? - He came up with them.</p>
               <p>Did you give information before the Justice of peace? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Before the others came? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was it? - He met the waggon, and came past us, he then came back again, and said, damn you, come on.</p>
               <p>Do you know who he spoke to? - He hallooed out as he rode along, Damn you come on; then many came round us, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110096"></xptr> came out from among the bushes, and almost every where from every quarter.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner among those that came at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he on foot or on horseback? - He was on horseback.</p>
               <p>Had those people or any of them anything in their hands? - Three or four had sticks, and I saw one with a whip, I could distinguish properly.</p>
               <p>What was it that they did when they came up after Early had said, damn you come on? - Some of them fell a beating the horses, and drove the waggon away, and there was a great noise and confusion just at that time, I was on horse back, and so were the rest of the officers.</p>
               <p>Why did not you follow the waggon then? - They prevented us.</p>
               <p>In what manner was it that they prevented you? - They said, damn you, keep back, keep back; and we were apprehensive that we should be beat or hurt.</p>
               <p>Why so? - Because one or two of them had sticks, and held them up, and said keep back, keep back.</p>
               <p>Was it in consequence of this, that you did keep back, and did not follow the waggon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know what number there might be of them? - I cannot say exactly, there were thirty or forty, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the prisoner had or had not anything in his hand? - I cannot say whether he had anything or no.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say anything? - No, Sir, I do not recollect I did.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do anything? - He was riding backwards and forwards with the rest, and there was a great confusion.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by riding backwards and forwards? - They kept in general riding backwards and forwards, and there was a great shouting and noise, they rode athwart and across the common, at first I did not take particular notice which way they rode, some of them took the waggon and horses, and drove it on.</p>
               <p>What became of the prisoner at the bar? - The waggon then kept driving on b those people beating the horses, and h went away with it as I believe, I never saw him afterwards, I am not clear that he went with the waggon, but he went away and I saw no more of him that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Smart, this was considerable seizure? - Yes.</p>

            , and he passed on to the house where the goods were seized, then he returned again, and he called out, come on my lads, and immediately rushed out a parcel of men from the bushes, I cannot tell just their number, they were all on horseback.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of them? - The prisoner was one of them.</p>
               <p>Immediately when they rushed out what did they do? - They came to the horses, some riding a gallop, others walking a trot, and all manners; I do not remember what they said, they began beating the horses that were in the waggon; I saw one Jumper strike Mr. Boyd the collector, that was after the waggon was at some distance; I imagine we were about forty yards from the waggon.</p>
               <p>Were you in pursuit of them? - In sight of them, there were a number of men, smugglers, between me and the waggon.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110097"></xptr>Was the prisoner there? - He was among the number.</p>

               <p>What a very great noise? - A very great noise.</p>
               <p>What did they do to the people that were following? - I saw one knock down one of the soldiers.</p>

               <p>Had he anything in his hand? - He had something; they brandished their sticks to keep me back, I imagine.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner among them? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How many might there be in all? - There were seventy or eighty, or more of them in all; we followed them forty or fifty yards, and they drove down the road to the right.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner? - He was among them.</p>
               <p>What did he do? - I never saw him do anything; I never saw him after Boyd was struck, but he was there at that time.</p>

               <p>If you cannot tell whether it was a stick or whip, of course you cannot tell what sort of stick it was? - It appeared to be largish, but I was in so much fright that I cannot recollect what sort of a one it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. His fear magnified it? - I did not see him strike any person.</p>
               <p>Did he brandish a stick? - He did nothing more.</p>
               <p>Did he do that? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I was in company with the other officer, at a seizure of thes teas and geneva.</p>
               <p>What was the first thing you saw? - I was the last that came from the house with the officer; before I came to the waggon the smugglers had possession of the waggon, and before I saw the prisoner; I cannot take upon me to say that he had anything in his hand; I saw him do nothing, but he was sitting on horseback, some persons ordered the soldiers to fire, and immediately I saw him turn his horse, and go the road the waggon went; I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. All that you saw him do was what I or anybody else would have done, that were drawn by curiosity, namely, to ride away when we heard an order for firing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. My Lord, I presume it will hardly be necessary for either of us to trouble your Lordship, on the law upon the present state of the evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. You will judge of that for your client.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Under the present state of the evidence, I feel myself perfectly confident that the Jury will acquit the prisoner at the bar, and I am convinced of your humanity, Mr. Attorney-General, that you will not agravate the law, as it now stands; the act of parliament says, if they assemble with fire-arms, or other offensive weapons; surely it does require consideration upon this subject, whether you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110098"></xptr> will call a common riding stick or whip, an offensive weapon? first of all they mention fire-arms, I should conceive the most reasonable construction is this, if they are fire-arms, or other offensive weapons, such as cutlasses, &amp;c. but they never meant to extend it to sticks or whips.</p>
               <p>Court. It is impossible for the law to draw a precise line which will hold in all cases, as to what shall or shall not be called an offensive weapon; it must greatly depend on the circumstances of the case, for it would be going a great deal too far to say that nothing but guns, pistols and daggers, and instruments of war should be considered offensive weapons; bludgeons properly so called, clubs, and many others that might be described, all these are clearly upon the face of them offensive weapons: In short, anything that is not in common use for any other purpose but a weapon, is clearly an offensive weapon; but there may be pokers, shovels, tongs, very large knotty sticks, which under particular circumstances may be offensive weapons; for instance, if twenty people, every one armed with a large kitchen poker, were to come and commit an offence of this kind: loaded whips, larger than those that people ordinarily ride with, very large walking sticks - but it becomes a question of facts for the Jury; for that which may be offensive at one time, and under one circumstance, may not be so at another; and the Jury must judge: a common walking stick may be an offensive weapon in some cases, therefore, it is a question for the Jury, whether the man had it to walk with, or to attack others. I hold it to be indispensably necessary that the individual who is tried should be himself armed with some offensive weapons, for I do not think it will satisfy the words of the act of parliament that he comes in concert; there must be at least three armed, and one of them the prisoner; and three of these witnesses have not been able to say whether he had anything in his hand; and as to the fourth witness, we cannot lay much stress upon his word large, because he cannot tell whether it was a stick or a whip.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am going to state a decision of this Court, and I should not have done it in such a case as this, if I had not done so before, but, in the last case of this kind, I had nothing more to do than to hand up to the Court the opinion delivered by themselves in the preceding case. * Mr. Justice Gould tried two cases; in the last case the evidence was, that persons were assembled, armed with very large sticks, with forks or prongs to them: a witness said the prisoner had a large stick, but that their countrymen in the county of Devon did walk with such sticks; the Judges held that it would be a most gross construction of the act of parliament, to say that that which the evidences for the crown endeavoured several times in their evidence to call a bludgeon, that it would be a very gross construction of the act of parliament, to say that that stick which is equivocal in its use, and is a stick for defence, should be converted instantly into a weapon described by this act of parliament, and they laid considerable stress on the words of the act of parliament, which say, fire-arms, or other offensive weapons; the Court held, that the act of parliament must have meant some weapons as offensive, and they held that there must be a premeditated assembling and arming; perfectly clear it is that the person who is tried must be so armed, and, must be so armed with that intent; otherwise he cannot come there on the common purpose: in the other cases the Court unanimously held twice, that sticks described to be large ones, and with forks of wood to them; the Judges would not hold them to be offensive weapons, and they would not let them go to the Jury.</p>

               <p>Court. I have some doubt whether the law absolutely put a negative upon anything being an offensive weapon, which may be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110099"></xptr> used to injure man, even if it is in common use, as I have cited in the case of an iron poker, if I were to draw any line at all, which I do not mean to do, I should say, that to be an offensive weapon, it must be a weapon which may injure the life or limb of man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney-General. My Lord, I hope I never shall feel a desire that this man may suffer, or that that man may suffer; I want to have it ascertained what this offence is; the different constructions are at present so vague and indeterminate; I submit, my Lord, the question to be left to the Jury is, whether this person was together with three others, he being one, armed at that time with a weapon, either with a stick or whip, of some sort, brought by him for effectuating that purpose for which they were so assembled; the question is whether, from the evidence of the manner in which he used it, the Jury are satisfied that this was an instrument in his hands used for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. I have no sort of objection upon it, for I think it would be of extremely dangerous consequence, it would be insnaring people as well as lessening the effect of the law, that people should go away with an idea that nothing but a gun or a sword is an offensive weapon; it will be the province of the Jury ultimately to decide whether the prisoner is guilty, when I have summed up the evidence with some observations on the nature of the charge. Gentlemen of the Jury, it has been truly stated to you, that the offences described in this act of parliament are of a very dangerous public tendency, and wherever they have been committed, and can be clearly proved, it is a duty to see that the law is properly carried into execution. but no considerations, of public policy or of the dangerous tendency of particular offences ought at all to operate in lessening the degree of certainty, in order to bring home the offence to the person charged with it; for the heavier the offence and the more certain the punishment, the stronger ought to be the evidence to affect the party with its consequences. (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and added.) it is clear under this act of Parliament the mere act of rescuing is not the offence, but it is the assembling for doing an illegal act; therefore the first question is, whether the persons who rescued these goods met the waggon accidentally, or whether you are satisfied that they were persons who had assembled together, and had armed themselves in someway or other for the express purpose: it is certain in point of fact, that the prisoner was amongst them.</p>

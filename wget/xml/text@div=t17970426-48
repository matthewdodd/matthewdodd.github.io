               <p>Q. Look at them, are they the two men that passed you? - A. They are; I then got on my horse, and saw them before me, one of them had got off his horse, and was going gently.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, had you any suspicion they were improper people? - A.None at all; when I overtook them, there was one about ten yards before the other; I overtook Chester first, and was going to speak to him, but when I saw their faces, they were not as I expected them, and then the other, who was about ten yards before, turned his horse round and met me, with a pistol in his hand, that was Perry, and then the other, Chester,came up behind me with a pistol, then Perry demanded my pocket-book, which I gave to him.</p>
               <p>Q. That contained nothing valuable? - A. No, nothing of any value; then the other prisoner, Chester, demanded my money, which I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was there? - A. Forty-two guineas and an half in gold, one dollar and some silver.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know how many guineas, or how many half-guineas? - A. No, I do not, there were a good many half-guineas; I know I begged for mercy, and hoped they would not misuse me.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not, however, ill-use you? - A. No; the prisoner, Perry, said, I was not to go off so; he gets from his horse, and cuts my girths, and likewise the bridle reins.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not make use of either bridle or saddle? - A. No; he then got on his horse, and they both rode off.</p>
               <p>Q. Having seen them on Finchley-Common, and passing you on the road, and at the time they were with you, had you an opportunity of observing both their countenances? - A. Yes; particularly at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any disguises over their faces? - A. Not that I perceived; only their faces were very dirty as if they had not washed them very lately.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no handkerchief put over them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You will recollect upon your oath, and the men's life depends on it, have you any doubt they are the men? - A. I never was so certain of any one thing in my life; Perry I looked very hard in the face, when he came round my horse's head.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you say that, did you speak to one or both? - A. Both; my horse is a very gentle horse, and I went to the Duke of York's-head, and from there I went in pursuit, but could not find them; I went to Bow-street the same day, about two o'clock in the afternoon, and gave information, and about eleven in the morning, on the next day, I saw them again, at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them, when you saw them? - A.Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they, at that time, standing by themselves, or with other persons? - A.They were standing by themselves, and I recollected them directly.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any money produced when you were at Bow-street? - A. Yes; there was a guinea among it, that I recollect being among mine, from the appearance of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Although you saw the two persons that robbed you, on Finchley-Common, you did not see their faces? - A. No, not at that time, when they were behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, the only opportunity you had of observing their countenances was during the time you were robbed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260041"></xptr>Q. You, I think, had been to town to Smithfield market? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps your business had kept you up all night? - A. No, I had been to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, when one person came up with a pistol before, and another behind you, you were under no inconsiderable degree of alarm? - A. I was frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. That alarm might prevent you from observing their countenances so accurately as if you had not been frightened? - A. I could perceive them perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Being frightened as you were, could you observe their countenances so perfectly as if you had not been? - A. Not quite so perfectly; but I am perfectly sure of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you more positive to the countenance of one than of the other, having more opportunity of seeing him? - A. Perry came up facing me, and I took particular notice of his face, and likewise at the time he was cutting my girths.</p>
               <p>Q. But you paid more attention to one than the other? - A. I am perfect in them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you had equal opportunity of observing both of them? - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said, that you should not know the persons of the men who robbed you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any talk of that kind? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure, that at Islington, you had no conversation of that sort? - A.Quite.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the officers of Bow-street; in consequence of an information from the prosecutor, on Tuesday the 11th of April, between two and three o'clock; I apprehended Perry and Chester the next morning, between seven and eight o'clock; I and my brother officers apprehended Perry in Onslow-street, Mutton-hill, and in Perry's lodgings, in a cradle, in some straw, I found this bag, which contains nineteen guineas and an half; upon turning the straw out, I found the bag.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the bag covered with straw? - A. Yes; there were nineteen guineas and an half in guineas and half guineas, (producing them); and likewise in the same cradle I found two loaded pistols, (produces them); we then took them away; I went in company with Macmanus and Pugent to the lodgings of Chester, in Pipe-maker's-alley, Cow-cross; I found him at home, and at the top of his bed I found a brace of pistols that were unloaded; upon searching him, I found in his pocket, four guineas, two half-guineas, and four shillings and sixpence, one of my brother officers found some more money, and then we took him away.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any of that money spoke to particularly by the prosecutor? - A. Yes, one guinea.</p>

I am an officer; I went with the last witness to Perry's lodgings, and apprehended him, from there we went to Chester's lodgings, and in searching his house, out of a bonnet-box, I took an old handkerchief, and in it were eleven guineas in guineas and half-guineas, and a dollar; I saw all the other things found.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys.

               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutor.) Look at that guinea that is in a paper; is that the guinea that was produced to you at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what belief or knowledge you have whether that was part of the money you lost? - A. I believe that was one of the guineas; but I don't pretend to swear to money.</p>
               <p>Perry's defence. I deal in horses to kill, and I likewise deal in pigs, that is the way I came by the money, and I will prove it by witnesses, and the way the money came to be found where it was, is, that there is never a lock to any door in the house, and I put the money there for safety, and the officers knew the same.</p>

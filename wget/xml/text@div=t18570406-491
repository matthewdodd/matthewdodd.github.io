                  </hi>. I am in the service of the East India Company. In and previous to 1834 I was in the shipping department of the Company—I was there at the time they discontinued their commercial undertakings—there were at that time a great many commanders and petty officers of their ships, and after a time an arrangement was made to compensate them, and also down as low as boatswains, gunners, and carpenters, but an ordinary seaman would not be entitled to a pension—the persons who had served in the lowest grades for ten years previous to 28th Aug., 1833, were to receive a pension of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, commencing from 22nd April, 1834—for the purpose of granting these pensions, forms of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185704060049"></xptr>
               <p>applications were prepared by the Company, and given to any person who applied; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—in or about 1836, I received the declaration in the form filled up, purporting to be from Lewis Evans, but at this distance of time I cannot say from whom—on the receipt of it, I referred to such lists of vessels referred to as would prove the eligibility of the party to the pension; ten years' service was sufficient to qualify him—in consequence of what I found in the wages' lists, and upon my recom<lb></lb>mendation, a pension was granted to him, which has been paid ever since—it would commence, I think, in 1834—unless I had believed that statement to have been true, it would not have been granted—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) came into the department, I will not say that it was in July, 1856—it was proposed to give some alms houses (which had been erected two centuries) to the old servants of the Company, and they took steps to make it known, by placards in the pay office—in consequence of this letter, I referred to the vessels <hi rend="italic">General Harriss</hi> and <hi rend="italic">General Hewitt</hi>, to ascertain the actual period that he served on board each, as it required a period of ten years' actual ser<lb></lb>vice to give him eligibility to the alms houses—I referred to all the vessels, and discovered something which induced me to make further inquiry as to the prisoner.</p>

I am clerk to Walters and Co., bankers, of Haverfordwest I know the prisoner, and have been in the habit of receiving his pension for him through the agency of Jones Loyd, and have paid it over to him half yearly, for fourteen years to my knowledge—he used to draw an order on the East India Company; this one of 22nd April, 1856 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), is his writing, and I believe this power of attorney (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be his also—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 19th Dec.</hi>, 1836 <hi rend="italic">, and signed Edward Lewis Evans, authorising George Bryant, of Leadenhall Street, to receive any sums for him from the Company</hi>)—these four signatures, Edward Lewis Evans, in this book, are in the pri<lb></lb>soner's writing, and so is this "Edward Lewis Evans" at the bottom of this paper—(<hi rend="italic">This was a statement of the prisoner's service on board the</hi> True Briton, <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Lord Castlereagh, <hi rend="italic">and the</hi> General Harriss, <hi rend="italic">to which was added:</hi> "Gentlemen, I, Edward Lewis Evans, do hereby declare, that I had not, previous to Aug., 1833, quitted the maritime service of the Company, and that if the Company had gone on, it was my intention to continue the mari<lb></lb>time profession in their service")—he told me that some years ago he had considerable difficulty to obtain the pension; that Captain Bollinson opposed it, but that he afterwards got it, through the intercession of Captain Baker—this application for the alms house is in his writing.</p>

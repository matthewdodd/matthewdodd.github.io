On the 13th of September I went into the street, and saw a truck, with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200036"></xptr>five bundles of canvas in it, weighing perhaps 20lbs. or 25lbs. each - the prisoner, who was in Mr. Soames' employ, had hold of the truck; I asked him what he was going to do- he said he had orders from Mr. Watson to make it up; I said, as I knew nothing of the circumstance, I must have it returned till I consulted Mr. Watson and Mr Soames; he came to me afterwards, crying, and in great distress - he said that the story he had told me was not true, that three parcels belonged to himself, and two to Mr. Soames; that he had taken them all back, and had put one into the place called the rag-hole, and the rest where he took them from, but he did not say where; I found one parcel in the rag-hole, as he said, but the other four, we never could discover.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were not the men in the habit of saving up rags for themselves? A. Not that I am aware of; there was no more in the raghole - the one that was there remained there a week or ten days; it is now here: I marked it with the letter 
               <persName id="t18311020-81-person645">S. </persName>
            - I cannot say which of the five I marked; many people go into the room, and might have taken bags; I never knew of bags being there before; there were ten or twelve persons in the employ of Mr. Soames - the prisoner appeared to be sober.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Soames. I did not give orders to the prisoner to make up any canvas; I do not know that he had any of his own - he was a workman there; I believe this canvas is Mr. Soames'- it is made up in the same way, and he had a quantity of this description on the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you know that the prisoner was in the habit of taking canvas home to work? A. Never old canvas; we allow the men to take home new canvrs, to make hammocks, and what I have given out has been returned; I do not know whether these rags have been-mixed; the firm is carried on in the name of Mr. Soames and his brother, but his brother is dead.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. The prisoner was brought to the station on the 26th of September; I asked what could induce him to rob his employer- he said it was the first time he had ever done any thing of the kind; I received this parcel from Kimber, in Mr. Soames' presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any-body else present when the prisoner said this? A. I do not know; I think Collins brought the prisoner, but I believe he was by the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never told you any thing of the kind; this bundle was not in my possession, but some rags that are not here now.</p>
               <p>MRS. HALLIDAY. The prisoner lodged in my house nearly two years; he brought home two old sails to repair, and he has brought home new hammocks to make.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had to remove, and I placed this property there unknown to any one; Mr. Kimber lent me the truck - I never told him that Mr. Watson desired me to remove them.</p>
               <p>MR. KIMBER. I went into the street, and asked what he was going to do with the canvas; he said he had orders from Mr. Watson - I said, as neither Mr. Watson nor Mr. Soames were there, I would have it removed back, and I called our porter to remove it; the prisoner came back in a few minutes, and told me what I have stated; he said he had some furniture to remove, but did not say it was any thing from our premises.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

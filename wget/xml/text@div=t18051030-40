On the 21st of September, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I observed the prisoner at the bar attempting to take a cloak that hung at the shop door, I watched her for near twenty minutes; she then perceived me, and she went away. I went and looked to see if all was safe, they were. I looked out to see if I could see the prisoner, I saw no one; I then went up stairs, and in about ten minutes, I was called down, one of my young women was bringing the prisoner in; she struggled a good deal, I went out and laid hold of her arm, and pulled her in; the cloak she had got under her gown; when we took it from her, she was trying to take this mark off it; I knew the cloak to be mine, it had my mark; I sent for a constable, and took her into custody.</p>

             sworn. - I was apprentice at that time to Mr. Buttenshaw. On the 21st of September, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting behind the counter at work, I heard a rustling among the cloaks, when I went round to the door, I missed the cloak, and saw the prisoner crossing the way; I went up to her, I said good woman you must come along with me, she gave me a push and endeavoured to get away; I said you must come along with me, she gave me a push, and endeavoured to get away, I said you must come with me, she returned back with me; in the mean time, Mrs. Buttenshaw was then called down; I then endeavoured to take the cloak from her.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the cloak, did you? - A. Yes, I perceived she had got it, and she was endeavouring to take the mark from it; I took it from her.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS KINNERSLEY sworn. - I am a constable, on the 21st of September, Mrs. Buttenshaw sent for me, she said she had been robbed; the prisoner was in the shop. I produce the property.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my cloak; the private mark is my own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Saturday morning that affair happened, I was met by a person that told me she was going to Walworth to her husband; she asked me if I would write her a line, I should have a glass of any thing to drink; it was very wet and very rainy; as I came from Whitechapel to the Minories, we there both of us went into a gin-shop; she called for a glass of peppermint; I wrote her there a few lines; we then each of us had a drop of gin; she told me to stop at the gin-shop door; I was very wet; she was not gone five minutes from me; she went across the street, and returned to me; she gave me this cloak, and said, get me half-a-guinea on it, and meet me at the Seven Stars in Rosemary-lane; I had not got into the middle of the street before a young woman took it from me; she says, mistress, what is this you have got? I told her I did not know; she says, it is our cloak, you must return; accordingly I returned into a house with this gentlewoman, into a house in the Minories; the woman went off that gave me the cloak; I could not see her again; and not making a practice of taking so much liquor, it got rather the better of me; indeed, if it had not, I should not have taken any thing from any body in the street.</p>

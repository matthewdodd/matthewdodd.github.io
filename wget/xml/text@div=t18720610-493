                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Wyman, of 19, Queen Street, Kenington—on Friday night, 10th May, I was sitting in my back parlour—about 10 o'clock I heard a noise which appeared to be in the front parlour—I listened and heard another noise, and while I was passing up the passage I heard it again, and saw my window open, and the table cover gone—I missed my writing-case, and a pot of musk was thrown down—my shutters were closed and the window fastened at 6 o'clock—it has the ordinary fastening—the table on which the things were, stood close under the window, and was the same height as the window—the upper sash was pulled down—I went outside the house and found my scissors, and two or three other things I had left on the table, outside—I saw a policeman and went with him—he ran down Milverton Street—I saw Beck with a hamper with something that looked like checkweed or groundsel—I found my table-cover inside his hamper, he dropped the basket, broke my hold, and ran away—I am sure he was the boy—I saw the constable take Higgs—these are my things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>a policeman coming up the court and ran away—the policeman ran after them, and Mrs. Wyman followed—she thought I had something to do with it—I said "That is one of them," and pointed to Beck—she put her hand in his basket and pulledout the table-cover—he ran away and I ran after him and caught him—he said "Leave go of me, you b—, for I have just come home from the country"—I took him back to Mrs. Wyman, and we gave him in charge—I saw the policeman take Higgs—he was one of the five I saw—I can't recognise Winter as one of them.</p>

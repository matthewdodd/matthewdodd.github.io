            . I am a coachman. On the 29th of November, I met Mr. Hall, the Police-officer, and two others, at nine o'clock in the morning, at the Wilmington Arms, John-street; I was searched by Mr. Reynolds, the officer - there was nothing on me; Hall gave me five shillings, which I expect were marked - I then went out, followed by the officers, to a private house in <placeName id="t18330103-79-crimeloc468">Catherine-wheel-alley, Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

I showed him, and told him I had them from the prisoner; I did not take notice of what the prisoner said.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been a coachman? A. All my life; I have been out of a situation better than two months - I have driven a cab and an omnibus; I have been a Police-constable and a porter - I never was charged with any offence in my life; it is a year since I drove a coach - the last two months I have got my living by going on messages, and have had the assistance of my wife's purse; she is a laundress - I have assisted officers occasionally, but that you know, you need not have asked me that; Hall, the officer, has employed me - I never was told what I was to have; I made no agreement about it, or ever asked; I have been employed by him since the 13th of November; I have borrowed money of him as a friend; I do not know but what I owe him money now - I have known him about three years, and have been employed in about three jobs for him; I never asked for any money, and it is an impossibility to tell what I expect - any thing will satisfy me, if they give me 5s.; I may have spent twenty days in these jobs - I have borrowed 5l. or 6l. of Hall; I have had no money at all for labour - I did not know there was any due to me; I did not know but what I was doing it for nothing - I believe I have been a witness for the Mint three times, twice in this Court, and once at Clerkenwell; I do not know when I began to borrow of Hall - I never borrowed any thing of any other officer - I left the Police force to join the West Middlesex regiment of militia, for which I was drawn - I was discharged from the Police for quarrelling with my serjeant; I did not think myself justly used, and instead of reporting him I swore at him; I never was in any gaol, nor accused of passing bad money - I had been to the prisoners on the 27th of November, but I did not see him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030046"></xptr>Q. Why did you not mention that before? A. Because the prisoner was indicted for what happened on the 29th, and if I had mentioned that, you would have said I prejudiced the minds of the Jury; I did not tell him I wanted five sixpences gilt to put them into punch-ladles - I did not see him; I had a shooting-jacket on then - I did not tell him I was a silversmith; I was at his house on the Monday, and purchased one of these sixpences - I did not say to him on the Tuesday, "Do these as well as you did the one yesterday, for that was done very well - I must have them on Thursday, and get the punch-ladle done on Saturday - don't disappoint me;" nor any thing like that -I saw a person there on Tuesday, who I expect was his wife; I did not see any man, nor did I say in the presence of any man, that the sixpences were intended for punchladles - I did not take down two of these on the Thursday, and say I had only two punch-ladles ready - he did not tell me they only came to 2s. - I said I had but 5s., and could take but two.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. In consequence of information I employed this witness to assist me in apprehending the prisoner; I sent him to his house on the 29th of November - we met at the Wilmington Arms; Daniel was searched by Reynolds - he had no money and I gave him five marked shillings - I then told him to go on; Reynolds followed him, and kept him in sight, and Lloyd followed me, and kept me in sight - when we got to the house I went up, in consequence of a signal; I went in, and when I got to the first floor landing-place, the prisoner was coming down; he asked me what brought me there - I said I did not know; we then went into the room - I caught hold of Daniel's hand, which he had in his pocket, and found this bit of paper, in which were these two gilt sixpences; I asked where he got them - he said of the prisoner; Lloyd searched the prisoner, and found on him 27s. or 28s. in silver, and, I believe, a half-sovereign, all good; I found the five shillings which I had marked - I said to the prisoner, "Nesbitt, it is a pity a man like you should do such a thing, to be taken from your family; where did you get these things?" he said, "Of him," pointing to Daniel - I said, "Now you are telling an untruth, for he has been employed by me to detect you;" we found two gilt farthings in a tea-chest, which the prisoner said were only counters - in going to the office he said he did not know there was any harm in guilding sixpences to put into the bottom of punch ladles and pots - but as to the selling he did not know how he should get over it; I have known Daniel about twelve months - he states he has been a cab-driver, and I believe he has been in the Police - I never advanced him any money; I have paid him when a case has been done - I think on the last occasion I paid him 1l. 10s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you give him that for past services, or was it money lent or advanced? A. No, it was money for past services; I have been employed by the Mint for many years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is he in your debt? A. No, Sir; I do not recollect that I ever lent him a shilling; I paid him for what he did, and he knew it was for that - I think the first time I employed him was in the case of Cole, tried here, and the last time was at Clerkenwell; when the case is over Mr. Powell pays me, and I pay him - if he says I have lent him money as a friend, it is wrong.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was with the other officer and Daniel at the Wilmington Arms -Daniel was searched, and he had no money but the five shillings marked by Hall; I kept Daniel in sight till he went into the prisoner's house, and when he came out I stopped him, and beckoned to Hall to come to me; when we got on the first floor the prisoner was called, and came down - we went into the room, and Daniel told me I should find three sixpences under an image on the mantel-piece, which I did; as we went to the station the prisoner said, "You have known me some time; be as merciful as you can."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Daniel told you where to find these three? A. Yes; I have known him two years - he was in the Police; I have apprehended several persons for passing bad coin - I believe this is about the second case I have known Daniel to be employed in.</p>

            . These are all good sixpences, which have been gilt with a mixture of gold and quicksilver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has it not been the habit, as long as you can remember, to put little coins into the bottom of punch ladles? A. I have seen them certainly, and I think I have seen them in tankards.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long address, stated that he had been a water-gilder for many years, and that Daniels had called on him, and employed him to gild the sixpences, to put into the bottom of punch-ladles, which he had done, and placed them on the mantel-piece, out of the reach of his children.</p>

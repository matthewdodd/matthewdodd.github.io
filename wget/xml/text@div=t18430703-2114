                  </hi>. I am in the Inspector General's office at the Ordnance. On Saturday morning last, about half-past one o'clock, I was going up Regent-street—the prisoner accosted me, and asked me to treat her to a glass of ale—I refused—she said she was a Scotch woman, and she must have a glass of ale—I refused—she caught hold of my arm—I told her to go off, I had nothing to give her—she stopped with me some time after telling</p>

               <p>her to go, and soon after left me very abruptly, and I found the money which I had in my pocket a few minutes before was gone—she went across the street—I ran after her, crying "Stop thief"—she ran down Regent-street—I over<lb></lb>took her at the other side of Glass-house-street, and gave her in charge—I had felt my money safe just at the bottom of Regent-street, under the piazza, to see if I bad any loose silver to pay my fare home by a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—it was then quite safe—I accosted no one from that time till I saw the prisoner—I lost four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes and five sovereigns—she ran a little above Haydon-court, forty or fifty yards or more—I was quite sober.</p>

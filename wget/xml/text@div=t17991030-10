            : On the 21st of October in the morning, about a quarter before eight, I came in a hackney coach from the Swan-with-two-Necks, Lad-lane, the coach stopped at the end of Black Raven-court; before the coachman had got off his box, I saw the prisoner come out of our vaults, apparently loaded; I let him pass the coach door; I immediately jumped out at the coach door, and called out to him, stop; I then went up; to him, laid hold of him by the collar, and said he had got our property upon him; he said he had not, and begged for God's sake that I would let him go; I said I would not let him go, and that they supposed they had me very safe, for they did not expect me coming form the country that morning; I then carried him into the kitchen and sent for a constable; before the constable came, he said he had got three bottles of wine, but he had brought them from a man of the name of Grant, No. 64, East Smithfield; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said it was for his own drinking, and he had been upon the sick lift, and the doctor and prescribed it for him; I then felt his breast, and said to him you have got something else besides wine? he said he had got a sample of rum, he was going to take to a customer of his masters; I told the constable the man had robbed me, and desired him to do his duty; he searched the prisoner, and found upon him one bottle in the right hand pocket, one in his side coat pocket, and another in the left hand coat pocket, and another in his small clothes; and a phial containing about half a pint of rum, that he said he had from a Mr. Butler.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. From the situation in which you were, it was impossible you should see him come out of the vaults? - A. I could not do otherwise, for the vault door faced the gate-way where the coach stood; the whole of the vault under Black Raven-cour belonged to us.</p>

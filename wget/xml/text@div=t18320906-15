I made the best of my way towards the spot, and two gentlemen came running down my beat; I stopped one, who made a complaint to me; I stopped him, thinking he might be an offender- at that moment three girls came up, and struck him violently, and as soon as I got them from him he ran off, and four men and the three women came and attacked me, knocked me down, kicked me about as long as they pleased, and robbed me of my handkerchief, which I had in my hand - they kicked me about, and left me all on a sudden; both the prisoners were among those persons, I can swear; the prisoner Austin kicked me violently several times while I was down, and struck me while I was falling - Newman tore my face; I cannot say who took my handkerchief; they searched me all over, and particularly the outside of my watch-pocket; they knocked me about as much as they pleased - I called Murder! till I was exhausted, but no assistance came - they left me altogether, and in the road began singing and dancing; I got up as soon as I could, sprung my rattle, and hallooed Murder! some of my brother officers came up, and went to look for them, and at that time found only three men; they were under Haggerstone-bridge - they were armed with a pailing each; Austin was one of them; they run from under the bridge into the field - Austin was taken, with the assistance of my brother officers, that night; that was not the prisoner at the bar, but his brother - the prisoner was not taken that night; only two were taken that night, and I swore to one at the office on the Friday - in consequence of information, I accompanied my serjeant, on the 28th of August, to the prisoner Newman's house, at Haggerstone; her mother kept the house - as soon as we went in, the serjeant asked me which was the one, and I immediately pointed her out; he charged her with taking the handkerchief, which she denied; he afterwards charged her with having the ticket of the handkerchief in her possession - she denied that, and said she did not know any thing of it; the serjeant searched, and in a drawer in the house found the duplicate of the handkerchief - (handkerchief produced) - this is mine, and what I lost that night; I have had it two years; we took her into custody, and as we took her to the station-house she said she hoped we would not make one girl suffer for all, and that Sam Austin gave her the ticket; she told us where he lived - after securing her, we went and secured him; I knew him again directly, and had not the least doubt of him - we afterwards went to the pawnbroker's with the duplicate - I saw my handkerchief, and swore to it.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live at No. 21, Harford-street, Heggerstone. The prisoner Newman, was with me at Camberwell Fair on the night in question - we arrived at Haggerstone about eleven o'clock at night; she was in my cart, and rode home with me - we then went to the George the Fourth at Haggerstone bridge; after we came out of the house, which was about half-past twelve o'clock - we were coming home, and heard a cry of Murder! there were two or three young men and a Policeman down on the ground - they were beating him about; when he got up, my wife said to him, "Good God! I thought they were going to murder you;" he said nothing, but went across the bridge, and brought two more Policeman - they took two young men, and took them to the watch-house; I, my wife, Newman, and her mother went to the watch-house to see what was done with them - he said he had lost a handkerchief and half-a-crown, that there were several women outside, and he should like to have them searched - the women were called in - my wife, Newman, and her mother; the Policeman said, "Is this one?" (meaning my wife); she said, "Do you mean to say I touched you?" he said No, she said, "All I said was, 'are they going to murder you?" Newman was present, but he said nothing to her - I can take my oath she was twenty yards from him; she remained at large till the day her mother was buried, and coming from the church-yard she was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How near was she to the Policeman? A. About thirty or forty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You said twenty before? A. Twenty or thirty - I was about thirty yards from the spot.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Seeing him ill-treated, and his life in danger, I suppose you assisted him? A. I said,"If he would be quiet, I would point out the person to him;" I had a child in my arms at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife could hold the child I suppose? A. She was going on about thirty yards ahead - both my wife and the prisoner's mother were going towards Haggerstone - they were ahead.</p>
               <p>Q. Towards the robbery, or away from it? A. Away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060021"></xptr>from it; the moment the Policeman was attacked, I gave my wife the child, and said I would tell the Policeman who had attacked him in that manner - I knew them by sight, not further; I am not acquainted with the prisoners; I only know Newman by where she works - the female prisoner, my wife, and her mother went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there other people in the watch-house? A. Nobody but the Policeman - I am positively sure the female prisoner went in.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she in your company again, having got thirty yards ahead? A. It was my wife and mother that went on; the prisoner was by my side.</p>
               <p>Q. Why could not the prisoner hold the child? A. She went to her mother, because a gentleman came up, and said she was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that, after the Policeman got up? A. It was before the Policeman was knocked down at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean it was before his handkerchief was taken, or when they came up, and attacked him with sticks? A. A young man came up, and said, "Did you hear the cry of murder?" - I said, Yes; he said, "Well, come along with me to search;" we went down to the side of the canal, and met a Policeman with two or three young men - my wife is not here, nor my mother - it was Newman's mother who is dead; I declare Sarah Newman was not near the spot.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you came up before the Policeman was knocked down. A. I was coming across the bridge when the cry of murder was; when I got up to him, he was down - Sarah Newman, my wife, and her mother all went up the watch-house to see what it was.</p>

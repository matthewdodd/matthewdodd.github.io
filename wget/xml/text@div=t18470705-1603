                  </hi> I am the daughter of Charles Clark, who keeps the Eight Bells public-house in Ironmonger-row, St. Luke's. On the 28th of June, about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner came and asked for half-a-pint of beer, which came to a penny—he gave me a shilling—I saw that it was bad, and told him so—he made very light of it—I called my father—the prisoner laughed and sneered at it—I went after a policeman, while my father stayed in the bar—I gave my father the shilling—I saw him cut it on the counter.</p>

                  </hi> My daughter called me to the bar on the night in question—I saw the prisoner—I recognised him as a person I had seen before—he had come on the Thursday or Friday previous, about eleven o'clock in the evening, for half-a-pint of beer—it came to a penny, he gave me a shilling—as soon as he put down the shilling, and I had put down the beer and the 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, he took it and <hi rend="italic">bolted.</hi>—I had a doubt about him when I first saw him again, but afterwards, circumstances brought it to my mind as vividly as possible—I am quite certain now that he is the man—I put the first shilling in my desk, and kept it there till this second transaction—on this Monday, the 28th, when my daughter called me, I said to the pri<lb></lb>soner, "This is not the first time I have seen you"—I sent my daughter to fetch a policeman—I went to take the chain off the door, to prevent the prisoner from escaping, and he endeavoured to get out of the bar—at that in<lb></lb>stant the policeman came in and took him—I gave the second shilling that was cut to the policeman.</p>

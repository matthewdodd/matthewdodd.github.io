I am a horse slaughterer, and live in Green-street, Black friars—the prisoner came to my place about a quarter past six o'clock on the morning of the 5th of April, with a bay gelding—I looked out of window and asked where he brought it from—he said from Mr. Archer, a fishmonger at Dorking—I got up and let him into the yard—I asked if he knew anybody at Dorking—he said yes, and his master had told him to bring the gelding to me, and get what he could—I asked it he knew Mr. Doudeney, a harness-maker at Dorking—he gave me an account of him that I knew was not correct—I told him to wait till I went to get change—I went and called our inspector, Mr. Harris—he came, and we all walked to the station house.</p>

I am inspector of places for slaughtering horses—I received information from Mr. Giddens last Friday, and I saw the prisoner at his place—he said the gelding was Mr. Archer's, of Dorking, and he had brought it there because it was glandered, which it was—I asked if he came through Kingston gate—he said yes, and that he started at two o'clock in the morning—I asked where the toll ticket was—he said he had not got it—I then took him to the station—I made inquiries at Kingston gate—I came back and told the prisoner what I had heard—he was locked up—he was taken in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark—Mr. Wheatley identified the gelding in the prisoner's presence, and the prisoner then said a man gave it him to take to the knacker's—Mr. Wheatley said that was false—he then put his hand to his hat and begged forgiveness—he said it was through poverty, and his wife and family had only had a penny loaf to eat for two days.</p>

                  </hi>. I was servant to Mr. Wooster. On 13th April, about 5 minutes to 2 o'clock, I saw Phillips and London come out of the front door of the shop; they each had desks in their hands; one went Barbican way, and the other Smithfield way—I then went up stairs to work, and saw Eldridge in the work room—that was all I saw</p>

On the morning of 3rd October I was opposite 4, Buckingham Street; about 6.20 and I saw the three prisoners and two other men not in custody standing opposite—they had a truck with a large wine cask on it—they pulled the truck up to the door of 4, Buckingham Street, look the barrel off and took it in to No. 4—I'then left in a cab and fetched Shrives, Dawson and Beachey, three detectives—I returned and watched the house till about 10 o'clock when I saw Green and Rennie leave the house with the wife of the prisoner Smith (I was not present when they were married, but I saw the certificate in the room)—they went to a public-house remained there a short time and came out and separated—Green came back shortly afterwards with a rope similar to this produced and went into No. 4—shortly after that a little boy drove up to the door in a cab—Green and Rennie brought down the box produced and placed it on the roof of the cab, tied up with a rope and they drove off through Fitzroy Square—we followed and came up with them at the top of Torrington Square—that is not half a mile from Charlotte Square where the. prosecutor</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Green.</hi> I went to Marlborough Mews police station for assistance—I returned about 8 o'clock or a little before—I was back <hi rend="italic">some</hi> time before the other officers because they had to get up and get ready—I was exactly 18 minutes away—I left the moment you went in with the things—I went away at 6.15—it would be about 6.45 when I got back—from 6.45 to 10 o'clock, I went round two or three times out of sight of the house—if anybody else had brought those things they might have brought them without my seeing them—I was away certainly—the other detectives were away—it must have been 8 o'clock I should think when I first saw them there—Dawson I think was there first—I would not be sure whether Shrives, or Beachey followed him—I think I left word for them to come to me at the Green Man, Euston Road, close by Bucking<lb></lb>ham Street, at all events that is where they found me—when I, was at the Green Man I could not be watching 4, Buckingham Street—it is perfectly daylight at 6 o'clock in the morning—I recognised you because I knew you so well—I know you all very well—I believed you were dressed the same then as now, you had a dark coat on; the one that is now in <hi rend="italic">the</hi> box—it belonged to the prosecutor and was taken off you at the station—I believe you had on the coat you are now wearing when I saw you at 6 o'clock in the morning, or one similar; an overcoat—I took particular notice of your coat—it was you; I was looking at your face and your features—from Cleveland Street, where I was, I could see 4, Buckingham Street as well was I can see you from where I am standing—I admit there is a slight bend in the street.</p>

I said "It is for being concerned with <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Green and another having a lot of things in their possession that have been found at your place"—he said" I know nothing about it"—I said "Which you know about"—he said "I do not know about it"—I said "I think you do"—he said "Very well, you say so"—I took him to Marlborough Street—some time after that I went to the prosecutor's place and I found an entry had been made by a back window in Tottenham Mews into the back workshop—I won't into the house—they went through there, down the workshops, through the back yard, and through a small office window into the shop—I examined the first floor and found an attempt had been made there to enter by the window—I found some marks on the window—a knife was handed to me by the pro<lb></lb>secutor which corresponded with those marks—no doubt it was used to push the catch back.</p>

The coat I have on now was actually in pledge at Mr. Attenborough's, I do not know whether the clerk could produce the book", and I put it on at the Hercules Pillars, Soho, at 9 o'clock in the day, and if these men were there they admit leaving the house, and that gives them an opportunity of saying I was back.

                  </hi>. I live in Tower-lane, Smithfield. I was returning home on the 2nd of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—I met Bowler at the bottom of Holborn—I went with her to a house in Field-lane—after I had been there a short time she left the room, and came up again with two men—she came and hustled round me—I was then sitting in a chair—she put her hand in my right-band pocket, and took out a half-sovereign, three half-crowns, and four shillings—I was not perfectly sober, or I should not have gone there, but I knew what I was doing—I can identify Fuller as one of the men—I am sure he was one—he had a stick when he came in—when Bowler took the money from my pocket she handed it into his hand—I heard it link, and he said to me, "What the b—y hell business have you with my wife, if you are not off, I will break your b—y neck down stairs"—I made my escape as soon a I could—I ran a little way up Snow-hill and met the policeman—he went back with me—we found Bowler in the house, but the man was gone—I am certain this money was in my pocket, and she took it.</p>

The prosecutor came to me—he said, two men had stood over him with sticks, and swore they would knock his brains out, while the woman took the money out of his pocket; I found a man in Bowler's room, and a woman, but he could not identify him—I took Fuller, about an hour and a half after, coming down Snow-hill—the prosecutor was then called out, and said he was the man—I found 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Bowler, nothing on Fuller—I asked Fuller if he used Field-lane—he said, "No."</p>

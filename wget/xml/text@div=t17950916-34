             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in the employment of Mr. Smith? - Yes, a foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the care of his business? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say to the loss of any butter? - No, further than having missed some some time ago; we had some come in out of a vessel, but what vessel I forget; it belongs to Messrs. Bell and Higginson; three hundred and ten firkins came from Ireland, it was landed on the wharf the 31st of July; it was placed in Mr. Smith's warehouse, exactly opposite the wharf in the course of rather better than a fortnight afterwards, Messrs. Bell and Higginson sent me an order to have it weighed, and I found three firkins missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Here are five in the indictment? - There was three out of another vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all this landed on the 31st of July that was missing? - No, some was landed on the 4th of August, and placed in the same warehouse, to deliver to different persons; on missing the three firkins I informed my employer, Mr. Smith, that there was a deficiency in the three hundred and ten, and I thought it very strange how it could go.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of it? - In consequence of same discovery of Mr. Dyke's I went into the yard with Mr. Smith, where Mrs. Harris lived, and looked at an empty firkin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time missed any part of the butter, landed on the 4th of August? - No, I had not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this yard of the house belonging to the prisoner, Elizabeth Harris, near Mr. Dyke's? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this that you went? - On Thursday, the 13th of August? I missed the butter the day before I found this firkin, or the same morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see in the yard? - Nobody at all; the yard opens into the house; the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go through the house into the yard? - Yes; by finding this firkin of butter with the mark and number, answering to what I lost. I took it into the warehouse; and my employer went up to the office and fetched an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is that to your warehouse? - Thirty or forty yards, not more; we searched Mrs. Harris's house, and found nothing in it; on the next morning I went with an officer to a warehouse adjoining to her house, a warehouse that was building, and found two firkins of butter, one a whole firkin and the other three parts empty, there might be five or six pounds in it.</p>
               <p>Q. These buildings were open I suppose? - Yes, but they had been under lock and key all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see there at this place? - The carpenter that was at work there. They were taken away and put into our warehouse; my employer and me and the officer went from there down to Anchor and Hope-alley, in Wapping, the same day, and there we found one firkin three parts full, and another empty, at the house of one Mr. Walton, a tallow chandler, and they were taken to the Rotation office, in Goodman's fields, and left there till the time of examination came on. The firkins are in court.</p>
               <p>Q. These firkins contained butter, of different persons? - Of two different persons, and the last of which arrived on the 4th of August.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say there was three hundred and ten casks landed? - Yes, I counted them out as they came into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. This yard which you describe as Mrs. Harris's yard, I would ask you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160089"></xptr>whether it is not a yard to which a great number of premises communicate? - Not that I could perceive. The yard was boarded round on one side and a wall on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not Mr. Dyke's premises communicate to this yard? - Not that I know of; it is ajoining to it.</p>
               <p>Q. This warehouse that is building does not belong to her house at all? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. This warehouse was repairing in such a way as to be open? - The warehouse was building.</p>
               <p>Court. How was the warehouse secured that these three hundred and ten firkins were put in? - By a bar across the gates, and a padlock on the side door, only locked at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever observe any marks of violence as if the warehouse had been broke open? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Jacob Hillman? - I employed him as a <rs id="t17950916-34-deflabel189" type="occupation">labourer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17950916-34-defend380 t17950916-34-deflabel189"></join> under me a fortnight or three weeks, or some where thereabouts, before the time that this was missing. I cannot say who took it. He was employed in removing it, and in watching it before it was removed likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he employed in watching and removing the other parcels? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are certain that these parcels were both stowed safely in your warehouses? - They were both.</p>
               <p>Q. What persons were employed about your warehouses? - There were divers persons employed at the time of removing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in the day time the doors of the warehouse was open? - Yes; but I was attending it myself; I left the prisoner in the warehouse several times when I had occasion to go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the key of this warehouse? - I did; I opened it myself and I shut it up myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Hillman? - Yes. Hillman came to my house in the month of July, and asked if I knew of ever a baker's place, if I could inform him of any body that wanted a servant as a baker. He is a baker by business, but he could get no employment, and therefore he went to work as a bricklayer's labourer, and I gave him work at my house. One morning in the month of August, I went to Mr. Smith's warehouse, and I asked Mr. Smith's servant if he had lost any butter? I had seen a quantity of butter in Mrs. Harris's house, not in a firkin, in the month of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to Mr. Smith's? - Yes. I went to the house after my pots, I see it laying on the table; it may be ten or fifteen pounds, I cannot positively say to the quantity; it was laying opposite to the door, and the door was wide open. It was in a lump.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give information of what you had seen at Harris's house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How that butter, which you see laying at Harris's, came there, you don't know of your own knowledge? - I do not. I see an empty firkin there in the yard the same day as I acquainted Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160090"></xptr>Smith's man what I had seen in Mrs. Harris's house. It was a little yard belonging to her house.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you enter the yard? - By going through her house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other communication to the yard but through her house? - No other to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do any other houses open into the yard? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Your house communicates with this yard? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you look into the yard? - Yes, from some leads on the top of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body can go into the yard without going through the house? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a public or private house? - A private house. She had the whole house.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Harris and you have been acquainted for some time? - I suppose for five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell Mrs. Harris you should be very glad of her company as far as Bristol? - I can take an oath I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have intimated to Mrs. Harris that you would be very glad for her to accompany you to some place or other? - Why should you ask me that question? I will swear I never did.</p>

               <p>I live in Anchor and Hope-alley, Wapping; I bought four firkins of butter of Mrs. Harris, on the 5th of August; I am a tallow chandler. On Wednesday the 5th of August, I was going along Wapping, and I see Mrs. Harris before me, she turned up a small court, and I walked fast after her. She owed me some money; I had not seen her for near twelve months before then; she told me she had no money, but she had some butter to sell, and asked me whether I would go home with her and look at it? I did; I went home with her, and there were two firkins standing in her yard, and an empty firkin. It was in the court where she lived where I overtook her; and I bought them two of her, in part of my debt; my debt was three pounds all but a few shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to give for the butter? - Sixpence a pound. It was a salt butter; there was somewhere about a hundred and six pounds of it; I only took it in part of the debt, she had some of the money. On Monday following she sent to me informing me that she had two more firkins, if I chose to have them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her business? - I was told she kept a lodging house. She said she bought it over the water; when I dealt with her, and she got into my debt, she dealt in butter. I went on Monday and agreed for them two, one firkin was in her yard, and the other was standing in her room, out of the firkin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken away the two that you had bought before? - My boy fetched them away the same day that I bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you any account of the last butter? - I don't know that I asked her. It was the first time that she told me that she bought them over the water. When I went to look at the second butter, the prisoner Hillman, was at the door, the door was a jar, that to, but not fastened, and when I came up to him he shoved the door open, and went in before me; he asked me if I wanted Mrs. Harris? I told him, yes; he said, she was at the public house, and he would go and send her; he went, and she came to me; then I bought the other two firkins of her; I bargained for them in her house; the two first I bargained for at her door; I was coming away; she wanted more for them than I chose to give.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160091"></xptr>Q. What did you give for the last two? - The same as before; I gave her a guinea on the two first, and I gave her four or five and twenty shillings on the two last. It was the Wednesday after that I gave her the last money. When I went there the Wednesday after Hillman was asleep in her parlour; I then told her it was so falt I did not think I could use it, I would be glad if she would send me any body to buy it, and she said, she would send a gingerbread baker, or a biscuit baker, and he would buy it. I wanted her to take the firkin back instead of the money; but it coming to more than the money, she said she would send somebody to buy it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the firkins? - Mr. Smith had two, one with butter in it, and the other empty standing in my shop; and the others my servant broke up and burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. What use did you make of the butter? - I melted it; but I should not have given that price for it, as a tallow chandler, if it had not been for the debt that she owed me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Hillman lodged in her house; you see him sleeping there? - I don't know that he lodged there, he was there.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Walton; I went to Mr. Harris's for this butter.</p>

               <p>Q. Who sent you? - Mr. Walton. I believe it was the 5th of August, but I cannot say justly.</p>
               <p>Q. What butter did she deliver to you? - Four firkins. They were melted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry them to Mr. Walton's? - Yes. I went four different times for them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you carry at a time? - One.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all melted? - There is one whole one here and one empty one.</p>

               <p>Q. Then there were only three melted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the casks? - Some were broke up; here are two here whole.</p>

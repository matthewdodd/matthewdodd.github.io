                  </hi>. I had amongst my customers a Mrs. Holland—on the 6th of February here is entered as her order, by Edmund Lewell Wil<lb></lb>son, 1 gallon of vinegar, 1lb. of capers, and 2 dozen lbs. of candles—here is no treacle entered—I had no idea that her order included 7 lbs. of treacle—neither of the prisoners had authority to take out any thing that was not in the order—they were prohibited from doing so—the whole of this bill—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—is the writing of Edmund Lewell Wilson, ex<lb></lb>cept the words in the margin, "half a pound over, and jar," which is Michael's writing—neither of them were authorized to send out any treacle on that occasion.</p>

                  </hi>. I made out an invoice of the articles entered in this order-book, on the 6th of February—I gave that invoice to Michael Wilson—I gave no authority to any body to make out this invoice of these things, and the treacle—the invoice I made did not contain the treacle.</p>

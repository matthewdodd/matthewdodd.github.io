                  </hi>. I am an oilman, and live in St. Martin's-lane. The prisoner was my shopman, and had 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, with board and lodging—on Friday, the 23rd of February, I took eight shillings and four sixpences to Mr. Handford, in the Strand, who marked them, in my presence, with a file, on the edge—it was done with a view to try the honesty of my servant—he was to lay it out at my shop—I went to dinner at half-past one o'clock, leaving the prisoner in the shop to serve—at two o'clock I sent him up stairs, and looked into the till—there was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which I had left in it, previous to my going to dinner, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in addition—the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was marked—I then went to Mr. Handford, to know what he had spent of the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had given the prisoner eight shillings and two six<lb></lb>pences—I then took an officer, and took him into the dining-room, on the same floor as the kitchen, where the prisoner was at dinner, and called him in—the officer requested him to turn out his money—he put down 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the table—I selected from it two shillings and a sixpence, which was marked in the manner in which Mr. Handford and myself had done it in the morning, and I can swear to it.</p>

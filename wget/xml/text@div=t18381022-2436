                  </hi>. About five or six o'clock, on the 25th of October, I was opposite my shop in Monmouth-street—the prisoner and two others passed my door—the prisoner made a pull at the waistcoats, and took them—I crossed and followed him—he saw me, and ran away—I cried "Stop thief," and caught him—a girl, crossing the road, called "Stop thief," and the others dropped the waistcoats, in her presence—she is not here—I am sure the prisoner took them—he said, when I took him, that he did not take them, and had nothing to do with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was coming down, and saw the gentleman in the shop, seeing a lad with a pair of trowsers—I was going on, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I had nothing to do with. the waistcoats—a gentleman came and said I had nothing to do with them—the lads that took them were gone on—the witness said at Bow-street, he could not be positive that I took them. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I may have said it, but I am since positive he did—he was nearest the wall—my father was serving in one of our shops.</p>

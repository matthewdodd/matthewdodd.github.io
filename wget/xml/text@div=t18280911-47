            . I am in the service of the East India Company. On the 11th of July the prisoner was on the third floor of the warehouse in <placeName id="t18280911-47-crimeloc237">Cutler-street</placeName>

            . I was in the privy, and saw the prisoner there; as he pulled up his trousers some tea fell out, which raised my suspicion, and I informed Mr. French.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received the two papers of tea from a young man belonging to a steam-packet, as a sample, to dispose of, and put it into some paper which I had out of the warehouse; I heard next day the boat was seized - I thought it a bad concern, and threw the tea on the shelf. Every man is searched as he comes out, and it is not likely I should put tea into my pocket; every case was cleared that day; I put this into my pocket to watch an opportunity to put it into the chest; I was called away in a hurry, or I should have done so; the tea in that room is all turned into bags, and I picked this up. I have been twenty-three years in the service.</p>

            . I am conductor of the warehouse. The men are all searched by two deputies, who are under me; they regularly do it, but in rubbing them down it is impossible to discover tea: there are two hundred and eighty-seven men in that warehouse - the chest did not contain more than 12lbs.; I have a sample from it, but the other being in his pocket would alter the bloom.</p>

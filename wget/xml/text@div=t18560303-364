                  </hi>. I live in Paradise-place, Islington, and am in the employ of Mr. Wood, of Bucklersbury. On 23rd Nov. the prisoner brought this order there (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Mr. Wood. Please send by the bearer two dozen comp. No. 6 and No. 12, for R. Mixer, 99, Goswell-street. 23rd Nov., 1800")—I told him there was no one at home—he said he wanted these candles, as he was in a hurry—he said they were to go to No. 99, Goswell-street—he went away and came again—I gave the order to Mr. Rothwell, and I saw him give the prisoner two dozen pounds of candles, the same as were ordered—Mr. Rothwell went into another room to make out the invoice, and while he was gone the prisoner took the two dozen which Mr. Rothwell bad done up, and he took two dozen more and took them away—he put<lb></lb>five parcels in his box, and tied tip three in a string, which he carried under his arm—I did not say anything to him—I thought he had to have them all.</p>

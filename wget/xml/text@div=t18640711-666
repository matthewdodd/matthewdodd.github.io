                  </hi>. I live at 4, Carlton-chambers, Regent-street, and am a furrier—about a quarter-past 12, on the morning of 23d May, I was passing through Cranbourne-street—I had had a little drop to drink, but nothing out of the way; I knew what I was doing—as I was passing along some persons came up to me, one on each side, and shoved against me, and one felt me round my body—I don't know him—a man named Moran struck me—I lost nothing, out of my pockets—I called out for a policeman, and one came up, and took Moran in charge—Moran struck me in the mouth, loosened one of my teeth, and knocked me down—I got up as quick as I could—I was so upset I could hardly tell how I got up.</p>

Soon after midnight on the 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, I was on duty in Cranbourne-street—I saw the prisoner, another man, and Moran, standing together there—I saw the prosecutor going along, and he appeared to be drunk—the prisoner and the man not in custody went on each side of him, and shoved against him, and Moran went in front, and rushed against him—they did that twice, and then they all three stopped and talked together—the prosecutor still continued going along—I went across, and stood at the corner of a court, and I heard one of the three say, "Come on; he is right"—the prisoner and the other man then pressed against the prosecutor again, and Moran, after getting two or three yards in front of him, returned back, struck the prosecutor, and knocked him down—the prisoner was then close by, and when the prosecutor was on the ground he</p>

               <p>took him by the arms, and pinned him behind—I had them in sight from the time they came from Leicester-square, about ten minutes altogether—Moran knocked the prisoner down just by a hoarding which is there—the prosecutor called out, "Police."—I came up at the moment, and laid hold of Moran and the prisoner—the other man was some yards off, and be took to his heels—I laid hold of the prisoner, and pulled his paper collar off his neck, and he made his escape—I secured Moran—I did not see the prisoner again till he was apprehended on Saturday last by Sergeant Shore of the F division—I gave a description of him after this, and his name—I knew him before well.</p>

In consequence of information, I apprehended the prisoner—I went to his place, but he was not there; I was looking out for him for about a month—I took him last Saturday about 2 o'clock—he asked me what I wanted him for—I told him I was going to charge him with being concerned with a man named Moran, who had been convicted for assaulting a man with intent to rob him, in Leicester-square—he said he hoped he should have fair play—he said he knew that he lived in the same house with a man who was convicted at the time of the assault, and that he was with him on the night he was taken, but he had left him half an hour before he was taken in some street in Leicester-square—I forget the name he said—he said he then went home with a woman, and stopped with her all night, and he said he could prove it.</p>

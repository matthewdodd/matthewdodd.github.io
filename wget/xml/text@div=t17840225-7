               <p>Court. What in anger? - I do not know, I did not see him till I felt him. I took him a bit of a push with my arm, and took him I did not like it; he then asked me if I knew him, I said, no.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you not know him at that time? - No, I did not know him till he told me who he was; he asked me to have something to drink; I told him I had had enough; he desired me to have a glass, and said it would not hurt me; I had a glass and he had another, I thanked him, and was coming out of doors, I took hold of my reins to get upon my box as usual, then he called to me, and said he wanted to speak to me, and I went by the side of the coach, rather behind; he then asked me who I had got inside; I told them there were two poor people going to Brentford, that I had plenty of room; I thought he wanted to tie his horse, which the hostler had in his hand, and ride withinside; I never looked at the horse to take any notice of it; he then asked me if the passengers had got any money; I told him no, I did not think they had; he staggered up against the windows, and said he warranted they could stand a guinea, and he would give me half; he seemed to me to be very drunk; I told him I could work for half a guinea as well as he could; he then mounted his horse and rode away; I stopped about ten minutes, but I spoke to my passengers first, and told them if they had any money to leave it with the landlord.</p>
               <p>Court. Should not you have done well to have seized this fellow, and taken care of him? - It was impossible for me, we are afraid to do that, because often times a passenger will run away, and not pay us, and if we go to hold them, they summons us before a Justice of Peace.</p>
               <p>Court. What was your opinion of it? - I could not tell whether he was romancing; I drove on, and in about fifty or sixty yards I was told by the prisoner to stop.</p>
               <p>Was it the same man that you drank the glass with, and had this discourse with, was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250016"></xptr> he the man that stopped you? - To the best of my knowledge it was.</p>
               <p>Look round and see whether the prisoner is the man? - To the best of my knowledge he is.</p>
               <p>Did you see any other man before you saw him? - I saw one other man before I saw him, there was another man came past before he rode away to London.</p>
               <p>When this man that you talked with mounted his horse, which way did he ride? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Which way did the man come from that stopped the coach? - He came from Brentford.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He told me to stop, or he would blow my brains out; I went on, he had something in his hand, then he rode up rather before me again, and told me to stop, then I stopped; the man rapped at the coach, and told them to put down the blinds, and I heard him ask the people in the coach for their money; he staid about two minutes.</p>
               <p>Was you before the Justice? - Yes, on the Saturday following, it was on Monday the coach was stopped, and the next day I was rather in liquor; on the Saturday following I saw the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again? - I did not think I could be certain of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you such a discernment of his face at Hammersmith? - I did not stay any longer than my liquor was poured out, and he drank his.</p>
               <p>Then you did not take sufficient notice of him at Hammersmith to know him again? - I did not take great notice of him, I rather had doubts of him, I do not think I can be perfect as to the man.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol on the Brentford road, on the 9th of February we were out about eight o'clock, and I met a post chaise and four between Kensington and Hammersmith turnpike gate, and the gentleman that was in the post chaise informed us he had been fired at by a single highwayman, giving us a description of his clothes and horse, which was a bay horse with a switch tail.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. Does that answer the description of your horse? - Yes, the horse I found in this man's possession is my horse, my horse is called a bay chesnut, with a switch tail, commonly so called.</p>
               <p>Maynard. We went to Hammersmith, and enquired for such a person, they said there had been such a person; after that I returned back to Kensington turnpike-gate, and when we had got within three hundred yards of Kensington gate, we heard a horse coming very fast; we then set off, and ran three of us, and left two men behind, there were five of us all together, and in a few minutes the horse came up, he did not ask for the gate to be opened, but ran against it, and it almost dismounted him, and I laid hold of him and saw a pistol stick on one side of his pocket; I seized him, that was the prisoner at the bar; he was about to lay hold of the pistol that was in his pocket, and I took it out of his pocket; we then took him off the horse, and took him into the turnpike house to search him, there we found another pistol in his other pocket, and in his right hand coat pocket there was found a woman's glove, with two shillings and threepence halfpenny in it, I did not take that out; in his waistcoat pocket was found some powder and balls; in his breeches pocket there was two shillings and sixpence and half a guinea; the pistols were loaded with powder and ball; he was taken the next morning before Sir Sampson, the two passengers were there,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250017"></xptr> but I believe they said they could not tell whether it was the same man; we took the horse to the George in Long-acre, and it was there when Jones claimed the horse; the coachman was at Sir Sampson's the next morning on the 10th, with his coach, he saw the prisoner, and said he could not stop, but that that was the man that had treated him with brandy.</p>

               <p>Court. What do you say to that, you told us you was not there till Saturday, you said you was fuddled the next morning; was you at Sir Sampson Wright's the next morning, recollect yourself? - I was not had before any magistrate, I was up at the office, I was up there, and took up some passengers from the the Brown Bear.</p>

               <p>Court to Coachman. Did you, or did you not, say that the man that gave you the glass of brandy was the man that stopped you? - I did not tell my master the words that Mr. Maynard says, I told my master I had stopped at the Red Cow, and set down two passengers, and that a man gave me a smack in the face, and that he gave me a glass of brandy, and that I had not gone above fifty yards before I was stopped; I did not to my master, that the man that stopped me was the man that gave me the brandy.</p>

               <p>I went down to Windsor on the Sunday evening, I stopped there all day on Monday, and spoke to the waiter about a place, and him and I could not agree upon terms, and I set out from Windsor on Monday night about five o'clock, and I was taken by these men; they came directly and pulled me off my horse, and lugged me into the public house, and took the pistols out of my pocket, and what else they took I do not know; but one of them struck me, I was a good deal in liquor when I was taken, very much, I could hardly set on my horse, and perhaps I might go up against the gate pretty hard; I believe I have witnesses to my character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight Witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.</p>

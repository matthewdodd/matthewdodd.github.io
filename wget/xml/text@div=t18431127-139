                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Blackfriars-road. About eleven o'clock in the morning of the 11th of Nov. I was in the Strand, near Temple<lb></lb>bar, with my sister—I felt a pull at my pocket—I turned immediately, and caught the prisoner with my purse in his hand—he said, "I have not got it"—I said, "You have"—he rumpled it up in his hand—I tried to get it from him—he put his hand behind him, and let it fall—I saw that, and took it up—a gentleman came and took hold of him.</p>

I quitted my shop about eight o'clock in the evening preceeding the robbery, and returned about nine in the morning; I then found that about eighty pairs of boots, and about twenty pairs of shoes had been taken from my shop. They were worth considerably more than sixty pounds. I perceived no marks of violence whatever on any part of the shop. There were nine odd boots, and eight pairs of shoes not bound, which they did not take. I got an officer from Bow street. who had all the locks taken off, and examined. I have now forty two pairs and an old boot. The 10th of May was a Saturday. I saw twelve pairs of shoes at Bow street, and I was confident that they were part of those that had been stolen.</p>

            . On the morning of Monday, the 13th, a person gave me information, where the property was. We went to Phoenix-street, Soho, out of Crown street. I got a neighbour to let me stay in their place to watch No. 4, to see if any one would go in there;

            , my brother, was with me the whole of the time. At about four o'clock in the afternoon, there came two men to No. 4, and knocked at the door, which was opened, and they went in. Afterwards my brother and I went in, and searched the house, but could not find either of the two men. We opened the back yard door, and found the prisoner working at a woman's or child's shoe, in a shed, I asked him if he had seen two gentlemen go out that way, and he said, he had not. There was a ladder against the wall, and there is a communication to the next house, No.3, which is a pigeon shop, the parlour of No. 4, was full of women's and ladies' shoes. The prisoner's brother makes up orders of ladies and children's shoes. Then my brother and I went out, and watched again, and we saw the two men come out who had gone in. That was about five or ten minutes after we came out. I immediately ran round by another street thinking to meet them; but missed them. I and my brother then returned to the house again, and asked leave to search for the property. I rather think I did not say what property. The prisoner made no objection to that; he said, he knew nothing of any property; and while I was talking to him I looked through the back kitchen window, and discovered the toes of several pairs of boots, which appeared to be covered over with a bag. I don't know that that kitchen was occupied by the prisoner. I called to my brother, who was searching No. 3, to come to take care of the prisoner, while I broke open the kitchen, when I saw the property. He came, and took charge of him. I went down to the back kitchen, and tried to break the door open; but could not. I then knocked at the front kitchen door, where a man and woman lived, and asked them for the poker; and they seemed rather confused, and denied me it. I immediately went up stairs to the shed, where the prisoner was at work, and asked him to lead me a hammer to break the door open; he said directly, here is the key of the back kitchen, which two men who have taken the place, have left with me, that key opened the back kitchen door, and there we found forty two pairs of boots, and an odd one, and twelve pairs of shoes. They were afterwards claimed at Bow street.</p>

            . I own No. 3 and 4 in Phoenix street. The prisoner at the bar is my brother in law; he lived in that house No. 4 with me, was born there, and served his apprenticeship there. I remember a man taking the back kitchen of me, on Friday, the 10th of May, in the evening; he was a working looking man; Mrs. Nelson was present at the time, in all the time my brother has lived in that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290041"></xptr>house, I never knew him in company with the person who took the back kitchen. On Friday he worked all day with me, and we worked all the evening together, and he supped with me, and at about half past eleven, he took a light, and went to bed; and I saw him in his own room, and the head of his bedstead is against the partition against which the head of my bed is; and I never heard any noise in his room, or heard him get up during the night, this man took this place to put goods in, and he said, he should only want it about a week, and as it was empty, and I found it difficult to let. I thought it a good thing to get it occupied. I carry on the business of a ladies' shoemaker, and have opened part of the shop No. 3, as a pigeon shop.</p>

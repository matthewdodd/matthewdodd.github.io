I am a brother of the last witness—I saw the two prisoners standing in front of the bar on the evening in question—I took the coin from the hand of my father or my sister, broke it in two pieces, and put it in the fire—they paid in good money, a half-crown, and I told them to be off out of the house—I saw Scottock pat his hand to his mouth—he appeared to put something in his mouth—I went round, took him by the collar, and told him to open his month—in about a minute and a half he opened it, and told me to put my finger in—he then put his hand in his pocket and drew out what I thought was a pistol—I saw in his hand an open knife, and he said, "I will show you what I will do for you"—I stepped on one side, and some one took hold of him and he was secured.</p>

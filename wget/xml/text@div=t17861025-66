            ; I know the three prisoners; they came to my shop on the 5th of October, about four in the afternoon; nobody was at home but myself; they asked to look at some jackets, and as they came in, I observed one of them pull at a waistcoat that hung at the door; I went and took it down, and while I had it in my hand one of them asked me the price of it; I hung it up in the window, and they asked to look at another; I took it out of the window, and they asked me the price of that, and I told them; then they asked to look at some blue cloth jackets; one of them put on one and pulled it off; and asked to look at a shagg waistcoat, he put it on, and said, it was too little, he could not button it, and he wished I would see if I could; I told him, no; the tallest of them wanted to shut the door; he pushed the door half way to; and I told them the door must not be shut; and he said, what did I mean, did I think they were thieves; and I told them, I did not know; and they said, they were honest men, and men that could pay for what they had; and that they were just come from on board a ship from Blackwall; that it was better to lay out their money for things for themselves,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250142"></xptr> than to let the bed women have it; he bid me reach him down another under waistcoat; they were all three in the shop at the same time; I turned round to reach another for the prisoner Lutwitche, and the prisoner Wallace was gone, he had taken a waistcoat out of the window where I had hung it up before; I missed it directly; when I missed the man I was afraid; I had nobody in the house but a servant maid, which I called down directly to take a child I had in my arms; when I said the man had taken the waistcoat; a person stepped into the shop, and said they had taken him; he was stopped directly in the passage by the neighbours that saw him go out with it; the others were in the shop at the time; then the prisoner Milne said, he wished he had pushed to the door and left my nose black; then the runners were sent for, and they were taken away directly; they bought nothing.</p>
               <p>Then Lutwiche tried on the things, and Wallace ran away with the waistcoat, and Milne tried to shut the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they come in together? - Yes; they appeared to be acquainted and talked one to another while they were looking at the jacket.</p>

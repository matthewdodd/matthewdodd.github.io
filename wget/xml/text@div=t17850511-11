               <p>Prosecutrix. I know them by a private mark; the prisoner begged me to forgive him, and offered me his watch and money, money I saw none, but his watch he pulled out in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council. Did you say to the constable you saw him take the bundle? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Is that the only constable that was concerned? - The only one.</p>
               <p>The MAID SERVANT sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw my mistress take the goods from under his coat, I was in the shop at the time; my mistress said, you villain, what do you buy one pair, and steal a dozen! then I came out with the child in my arms.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner at the bar take them and put them under his coat? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When I went into the shop, I had another young man with me, I saw him go by from a public house in Holborn; I used to buy stockings at this shop, and I recommended him there, he went with me and bought a pair, and he paid for them; there was a parcel, a great quantity of them lay on the counter; I knocked down two or three, and I was picking up one, and my great coat, which I had on my arm, slipped over it. She says I offered her money, but I would see her choaked before I would have given her any thing for any such thing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the value of these stockings? - Thirty-six-shillings.</p>

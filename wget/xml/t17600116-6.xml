               <p>Q. What colour were they?</p>
               <p>Jones. One was a black draft horse, and the other a grey riding nag: They were both in my stable at eight o'clock the over night, and about five the next morning my servant (who had got up to feed the horses) came and told me they were both missing, and also a saddle, a bridle, and a halter.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>

I went to two of my neighbours, and desired them to take their nags and go out in search of them; they went out accordingly, and myself also, by eight o'clock that morning, one towards Kingston, another towards Uxbridge, and the other towards the Forrest; this was on the Tuesday, and on the Thursday was seven-night after, Mr. Green sent a man, who told me he had stopped the black one, and the person that brought him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you advertised them?</p>
               <p>Jones. I had, and also put out one thousand hand bills. I went the next day to Mr. Green's at Bethnal Green, where I saw the horse and swore to him as my property, it being the same I lost that night; he was delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Green. I was at Hackney, standing at the doctor's door who shoes my horses, when the prisoner came by on a black gelding, and asked me if I knew any body that would buy such a little horse. I immediately said I would, if he would sell him worth the money. He said, he would. I said, let me see him move; he moved him backwards and forwards. I liked his moving very well, and asked him the price. He said, the horse is worth nine pounds. I said, I could not afford to give to much. He said he bought him in a drunken frolick, and he had no use for him; that he cost him six pounds ten shillings, and I should have him for that; but at last, bought him for five guineas. I gave him half a guinea earnen, and said, if you will bring me a voucher, that you came honestly by him, I will pay you the rest of the money. He said, if I would go with him to Mr Paimer's at Capton, there was a person would vouch for him; out the person there said he would not vouch for him, and told me he had been tried at the Old-Bailey about a year ago for stealing a horse, and suspected this as stole likewise, by his selling him for the horse was worth more money. The at the Cock at Hackney, to drink, and told him what we had been told. He said he had been in trouble before, ~ but this horse was honestly come by. I charged an officer with him, and got my half guinea again. We took him before justice

                  </hi>. I am a furrier, and live at 82, St. John-street-road, and at 21, Little Saffron-hill. I have seen these furs produced; these rabbit skins are my own, there musquash skins are Mr. Barnard Muller's, a furrier in Aldersgate-street; they were sent to me to dye. I know nothing of Marley—Butler had been in my employ about nine months—he must have known there were rabbit skins kept in that place—these were taken from the warehouse—previous to 7th of Feb. these had been deposited in the pasting room on the first-floor—these were taken from the pasting room—my resi<lb></lb>dence is half a mile away—I did not go and see the wall broken—I did not miss any skins, but we found fifty-five dozen that were sent down on the 5th—they were in one bag, and they were gone; and sixty-five or sixty-six dozen of wild, and sixty dozen of tame rabbit skins—they were all brought, with the exception of seven or eight skins.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you all the skins here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; these are some of the skins—these five are wild rabbit skins—these two are musquash—sometimes one rabbit skin is as like another as one egg is to another—I lost a number of skins—these are like what I lost—Butler had worked for me before—I can swear to the skins, these are a peculiar lot, and this skin bears my name on it—these skins bear the mark of B M on them—there are many traders in the fur line.</p>

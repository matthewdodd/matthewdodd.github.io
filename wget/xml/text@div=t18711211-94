                  </hi>. I am a waiter, of 68, Regent Street—on the night in question, at 1 o'clock, I was in Tottenham Court Road and met Dooley—she said would I stand something to drink, ginger beer or something—I said it was too late—she said she could get some close by where she lived—I went home with her—I don't know where it was, but it was in the direc<lb></lb>tion of Long Acre—she asked me if I would mind going upstairs; it was a poor house, but she was an honest woman; and then she asked me if I would give her sixpence to fetch the ginger beer—I could not find a six-pence, and gave her a shilling, which I took out with other money, and she had the opportunity of seeing it—the moment she left to get the ginger beer another girl, who I believe was Price, came in and said that her friend would not be long—she stopped a few seconds, and down she went—three men then came up together—one was dressed as a soldier—Higgs and Morgan and the soldier said "Now pull your money out, we know you have lots of money," and at the same time gave me some blows on the chest and knocked me over on the bed—they all three put their hands in my pockets and took all they could find, four half-sovereigns from one pocket, and over 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from another—the door was left open a little, and I saw Dooley look in—Higgs had on a soldier's overcoat, not the uniform coat he has on now—they all ran down, and I called "Police!"—I met a policeman—at once went back with him—we saw some people standing there—I think it was the prisoners—we spoke to them, and they ran away—we followed and caught Morgan behind a doorway—I heard him drop some money—I gave a description of Higgs—I recognise all the prisoners by their faces except Price.</p>

I was on duty in Charles Street, Drury Lane, heard cries of "Police!" and saw the prosecutor—in consequence of what he said I looked under the archway as I was running, and saw the five prisoners trying to escape; they dispersed in different directions—I caught Morgan in a doorway and handed him over to Booker—I went up<lb></lb>stairs after three men and Merz followed me—I saw Johnson and a girl under the bed, and Dooley was trying to get under when I went into the room—there was another woman under the bed who managed to get away, because I could only take' two down stairs—I am certain that Price or Dooley were under the arch, and I believe I saw Price go into the house—I cannot swear to her, because she was gone when I came back—I did not notice who Price ran away with from under the arch—I took Morgan about</p>

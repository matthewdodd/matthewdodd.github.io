             sworn. - I am boot closer to Mr. Hacker. On the afternoon of Friday last, the prisoner brought me three pair of boot legs; two of them were to be done for his master, and one on his own account; I marked the pair that were to be done for himself in his presence; next morning Mr. Hacker came to me, and I shewed them to him. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You knew the prisoner before as servant to Mr. Hacker. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of such a practice as servants asking boot closers to do business on their own account? - A. Yes. (The boot legs were identified by Mr. Hacker.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Monday before the Friday, I took a pair of boot legs to cut out for myself; I had not an opportunity of cutting them out till the Friday, and because my master should not find it out (as he does not like to see his men cut out work for themselves) I put them upon my masters own boot legs; I have been in business for myself, and these are part of my old stock.</p>
               <p>Hacker. From the appearance of the leather it has not been curried above six months.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

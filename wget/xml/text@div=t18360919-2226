                  </hi>. I live in Bedford-place. Borough-road. On the 13th of September I was walking in Blackfriars-road, near the New Cut, and saw the prisoner there—my sister Rose was there with me—we all three went into a public-house—he accompanied us to our lodging, and went up stairs with us—he remained in the room with me—my sister was con<lb></lb>stantly in and out—he proposed to drink tea with us—I said I could not afford it, but if he would send half a crown down to the landlady, she would send tea up—he pulled a parcel out of his pocket, which seemed to me to contain half-sovereigns—my sister was in the room at the time he gave me two half-crowns, which I took down to the landlady—I shortly afterwards left him alone with my sister, for nearly half an hour, and when I came back she had got half-a-sovereign—she showed it to me—I said it was not a good one—she sounded it on the drawers, and said it was good—the prisoner said he wished he had got a thousand of them, and that it was good—I asked him to give me one, and, after considering, he said he could not afford it, but at last said, if I would fetch the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back, he would give me one—I fetched him the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave them to him, and he gave me what I supposed was half-a-sovereign—he left the room almost imme<lb></lb>diately, and said he would be back in a quarter of an hour—after he was gone, I rubbed the half-sovereign between my fingers, and thought it was not good—I went down stairs and saw the landlady, and then went out in pursuit of him—I found him about two doors, below, on the opposite side of the way—I told him he had given me bad money—he said, had he? he would give me good, and asked me to give him that I had got in my hand—I said, "No"—he said if I would give it to him, he would give me good, and asked if I would have it all in gold, or all in silver—I said I did not care what it was, so that it was good—he walked a good way—I turned round to look for a policeman—we walked a long distance—he asked me if I would accompany him to his place, and then he would give it me all in silver—he went to snatch both half-sovereigns, and snatched one from my hand—Wyborn and two policeman came up—I saw him then take out of his right-hand pocket a brown paper parcel and throw it into the road—it was found to contain several gilt sixpences—I gave the one I had in my hand, to Corstorpham the constable.</p>

I lay some time; but, not hearing any thing, I concluded the wind had blown some rubbish from the scaffold, as my house was repairing. The nurse came into the room for something for the child; then I thought it was she that I had heard. Presently I heard more noise. I waked Mrs. Hankey, and told her my suspicion that the house was beset, and desired she would not be alarmed. I rested about five minutes; then I heard a pane of glass break with amazing force, enough to wake any person in the house. I ran from the bed, opened my door, and went softly down stairs in my shirt, I had no weapons. I stopped on the middle of the stair-case, to see if I could discover any thing; but I could not. I stopped there about twenty seconds, and then heard the skrew of the window unscrew and draw out of the nut. I thought it would be best to get to the street-door, and then I could alarm the neighbourhood, and might perhaps be able to secure one of them. I went immediately to the street-door. From the time of breaking the glass to my opening the door was but half a minute, or little more. Upon my opening the door, the prisoner and another jumped from the top of the rails where they stood immediately against the window that was broke open; and as they jumped from the rails, I jumped down the steps. They kept about a yard and a half asunder. I took the prisoner about fifteen yards from the house. He threw me down, and hurt me; but I never quitted my hold, but rolled over him. He called out for his comrade, Peter, come to my assistance; he called many times, but Peter never came back. I called out for help, after having had hold of him five minutes; I called out to my opposite neighbour Mr. Keeler, but he did not come down: at last one

The lowermost middle pane in the uppermost sash was broke, the window was down, I had not given him time to get the sash up. Mrs. Hankey and the servants came down; and we carried him into the house.

            . I am a ballast trimmer. I never gave this crow to the prisoner; I have seen it in his custody; I saw him have it three or four days before this affair.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That crow is not fit to break open a house, the pewterers use it in making pewter pots, I never had it for any such thing as that.</p>

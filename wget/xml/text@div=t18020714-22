               <p>THOMAS HEVERITT sworn. - I am foreman to Mr. Richard Cooke: On Saturday, the 12th of June, we had a quantity of coffee upon <placeName id="t18020714-22-crimeloc123">Bear-quay</placeName>

               <p>JOHN FLETCHER sworn. - I am a watchman: On the 12th of June, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I was going round, and saw a bag of coffee cut; there were about a hundred bags one upon another; I then saw the prisoner concealed between a bag of coffee and some casks; I pulled him out, and searched him; I found a quantity of coffee in his breeches, and in his trowsers, and different parts about him; he then begged of me to let him go; I took him into custody, and delivered the coffee into the custody of the street-keeper.</p>
               <p>(Isaac Rolse, the street-keeper, produced the coffee.)</p>
               <p>Heveritt. This is the same sort of coffee that was in the bag.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This coffee was given to me upon the wharf.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18020714-22-verdict124" type="verdictDescription">

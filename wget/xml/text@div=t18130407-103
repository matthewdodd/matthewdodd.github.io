On Friday, the 2d of this month, about half past six in the evening, the two prisoners came into my shop, and asked to look at some black silk stockings. My young man shewed them several parcels; they had come for three following days for black silk stockings; I had suspicion. I gave the young man two fresh dozens of silk hose, that I might know what was in them; the price that we charged for the stockings was eleven shillings, and twelve shillings. I went to Stone; she said, I will take this pair; and in rolling the parcel up, there was two pair missing. The eleven shillings stockings were marked with two diamonds at the top; the twelve shilling were all marked with four diamonds at the top. Gray said she would take a pair of them; she did, and paid for them. I missed two pair out of that parcel. On the next morning I went to Hancock the officer; I gave him the address of the prisoners; about an hour after that, Hancock sent up for somebody to identify the prisoners; my young man went. The officer found part of the property.</p>

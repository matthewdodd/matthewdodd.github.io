                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Mr. Ray, No. 13, Montague<lb></lb>place, St. Marylebone. On the 28th of July last I left the house through illness, and on the 2nd of Oct. I called, and found the family all out of town, except my master—I went to Teignmouth on the 28th of Nov.—I returned to town, and went to the house—the prisoner was in charge of it, but she was not there—she arrived a few hours after me, to take charge of the house in the daytime—she came again on the 29th and on the 30th, and went away each evening—there was a message on the 30th, and she did not return after that day—on Sunday evening, the 1st of Dec, I went to my drawer, and missed some things—I saw the prisoner about a fort<lb></lb>night afterwards at No. 40, York-place, which house also belongs to my master—she told me she was in charge of that house—(she was in the habit of being left in charge of houses)—my master and the policeman went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030093"></xptr>
               <p>with me—I told her I had missed some things—she said the had not taken them and knew nothing about them—I told her I had lost a gold brooch, and a stone brooch, and a pen-wiper—I did not know anything of the prints at that time, or that she had stolen them, and the other things, till I found them—she said if she had robbed any one she would not have robbed a servant, she would have robbed a lady or a gentleman—her boxes were searched, and nothing was found in them—I was afterwards sent for to No. 40, York-place, and saw the things which I had lost, pinned up in a great many parcels, very carefully indeed—there were a great many wrap<lb></lb>pers on some of them—they were on the table in the kitchen—these are my articles.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 188.) I went into the vault of the house No. 40, York-place, and discovered the bundle there, on the morning of the 14th of January—it contained several packages—most of them were sewn up—I should say some of the articles were not worth sewing up—I watched some time, and was relieved by another officer—I went to Mr. Ray's, in Montague-place—he accompanied me, and his servants were sent for—they claimed a portion of the articles—some of them were not claimed—I found the prisoner in charge of a house of Mr. Dobson, in Montague-square—I asked if her name was Lyon, and if she put the bundle in the vault—she said, "I put it there last night, and in<lb></lb>tended to fetch it away to-night"—I asked if the things in the bundle belonged to her—she said they did not—I took her to York-place—Mr. Ray was there—he asked her how she came to do it—she said she was very sorry, she hoped he would forgive her, and she would not do so again—I found in the bundle this gold brooch, the stone brooch, and other things named—I do not find that anything has been made away with, or offered in pawn—the prisoner appeared very well; I saw nothing the matter with her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook to Mr. Ray. I came to town On the 29th of Nov., and on the 1st of Dec. I missed this gold brooch, which belonged to Mary Eldridge—I had put it away in the drawer in Aug., and I meant to return it to Eldridge—I missed this handkerchief and this collar—these books and one of these cups are mine—I never saw the prisoner till I came to town on the 29th of Nov.—I thought her a very simple quiet girl—I believe I remarked that I thought her a strange sort of girl.</p>

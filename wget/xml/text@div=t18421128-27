                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Mackenzie, a surgeon, and live at No. 41, Charlotte-street, Portman-square. On Thursday evening, the 10th of Nov., I had occasion to leave home about half-past eight o'clock, and after I had transacted the matters for which I went out, I was on my way home through Westmoreland-street, between ten and eleven—I stopped at an oyster and fish stall there, and had some oysters—I sent for a pint of ale, merely put my lips to it, and gave it to the fishmonger—I also purchased</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184211280030"></xptr>
               <p>some herrings to take home—three persons came up while I was at the stall, not all together, but separately—the prisoner was the last of the three—the first one spoke to me, and went away, and returned again while the prisoner was there—the prisoner talked to the fishmonger, and said he was out of work, and also to the second person, that came across and bought some fish, who he appeared to know very well—he asked the second person to treat him, as he was out of work, and said if he had been out of work he would have treated him—he had not spoken to me then—I was waiting for my fish to be tied up in a paper bag—the prisoner then said to me, he wished he could get some one to treat him, and I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the stall—I then went away to go home, he fol<lb></lb>lowed me directly, and asked me to allow him to carry my fish—I thanked him, and said no, I could carry it myself—I had a large bag on my arm, with other things in it which I had purchased—I proceeded straight towards my home—he followed me to Duke-street, which is in a line with Charlotte-street—I told him not to follow me, that if my husband saw him following me he would be very angry; that I wanted nobody to carry my fish, and told him to go away—he then said "Good night," and appeared to leave me—he went from me, and returned back again in an instant, as if he was going to speak to me—he did not speak, but put his hand on my chest, pushed me down on some iron railings, and, when I was down, dragged my shawl off my shoul<lb></lb>ders—it was pinned very fast—it was not a very violent push, but my right shoulder was cut with the fall—I have not had the use of my band since—he ran away with the shawl up Duke-street, round by the church—I got up, and ran after him as well as I could, and cried out "Stop thief"—I did not over<lb></lb>take him—when I found I could not overtake him, I went round Portland-place, to see if I could see him any where, but I could not, and then went home—I think I was at the fishmonger's stall from ten minutes to a quarter-of-an-hour altogether—the prisoner was there about ten minutes—I had an opportunity of seeing his face—there was a light at the stall—my husband was not at home when I got home, but when he came home I told him what had happened—I saw the policeman about eight next evening, and gave him a description of the person who robbed me—about nine that night I accom<lb></lb>panied the policeman to No. 12, Westmoreland-street—I stood across the road whilst the policeman went and knocked at the door—I saw the prisoner, and recognized him—the constable came to me, and I said, "That is the man"—the constable went and took him—I went over to the house, and saw him in the passage—I said, "You have stolen my shawl last night"—he said, "Me stole your shawl?"—I said, "Yes, you did"—that was all that passed—my shawl was worth a guinea—I have no doubt whatever that the prisoner is the man that took it—I attended before the Magistrate next day—at the second examination, Mr. Wooller attended for the prisoner, and called the fishmonger as a witness.</p>

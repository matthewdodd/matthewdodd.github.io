            . I live in Church-street, Lissongrove. On the 3rd of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18311201-161-crimeloc869">Bridge-street, Balckfriars</placeName>

I do not know whether the driver heard; they did not call loud - I did not call, for I was alarmed; I should think the driver might have seen her, but cannot be certain - the wheel went over her legs; she was near the footpath, but none of her person was on the footpath; we were on the right-hand side of the way - the cab was on its right side; she screamed out several times - the man drove on ten or a dozen yards, and then stopped; I cannot say whether he came back or not - Mrs. Easy was taken to the hospital, and died in about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She attempted to cross to the coaches, instead of calling one? A. Yes - she turned back to come on the pavement again; I cannot say whether the driver heard the gentlemen call; the cab itself made a noise going along - I did not see a gentleman in it; it was not a light night.</p>

            . I am a porter. I was in Bridge-street, and saw the cab, it was driving very fast when I first saw it - I did not call out; my back was towards it - I did not see it go over the woman; several persons went to her assistance - I followed the cab, and took the number, which was 46; when I got up I said, "Why did you not stop before you went over the woman?" the prisoner got off his seat, and went and looked over the shoulders of the people who were assisting her, then returned to his cab, and drove off.</p>

            . I am a surgeon of St. Bartholomew-hospital. I saw the deceased the instant she arrived there; both the bones of her legs were broken and came through the skin - the best attention was paid to her - crysipelas came on, and mortification subsequently; there is not a doubt that the injury caused her death - she lived thirteen days.</p>

            . I had a child at the hospital, and saw the deceased there; she expected to die - she told me she went to cross, and stepped from the curb with a baby in her arms, and the cab went over her legs - I said, "Do you think it was the driver's fault?" she said not at all, and if it had not been for the baby she could have moved before the cab came up, and that it was so dark the cabman could not see her.</p>

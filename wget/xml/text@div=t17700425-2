I missed a cupping-instrument and a silver catheter in November, and my coat and waistcoat. When I charged him with the clothes, he said he had taken them to a friend of his to be cleaned. I had laid them on the counter, thinking to send them to be cleaned, and he took them unknown to me, and I never saw them since.

When I missed them, the prisoner said he had taken some of them, and he brought five pair of steel ones and eight of silver again, and one pair I found in the drawer afterwards. I went to get a warrant for him, and he absconded, and could not find him till about two months after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My master fell down in the street and daubed his clothes on a Sunday night, and on the Monday morning I was told they were to be carried to be cleaned. One of my countrymen came, he told me, there was a friend of his in the Borough could do. them well, and desired me to let him have them to clean. I delivered them to him to carry; that friend is since gone to Amsterdam, and I forgot to ask him where his friend lived. I have given myself a great deal of trouble to find him, but cannot. I used to do the cupping business. I left these instruments with his patients one day. I found the cock-spurs in an old drawer; I pricked my finger with one of them. I put them in my pocket to enquire what they were, and was told they were cock-spurs. Master asked me for them; I went and fetched them from where I had left them, two doors off, and delivered to him all I had taken out of the drawer, I had never seen such things before.</p>

I also knew him by his dress, and the handkerchief which he had on under an old velveteen jacket; I knew his person, because I went to the watch-house with him when he was locked up.</p>

Our porter was out, and I had been with a note; there were some fire-works being let off over the Tenter-ground - there were no other persons about where I was robbed - he was smoking his pipe when he came up, and it was in his hand when he was taken - he had it in his mouth when he caught hold of the chain.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not run as if to escape - were there any persons before him? A. No; he afterwards turned back, and came right towards me; I said at the watch-house, that I did not know what to make of it, as he did not seem to run as if to escape, and he offered no resistance; when I took hold of him he was going to strike me, but he did not - he seemed against going to the watch-house, because he said it was not him who robbed me - he said it was the other gentlemen behind him, whom he did not know, but they he passed before it was taken; my Christian names are William Julius.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does any body ever call you Julius? A. No; my friends tell me that is my name, but I never saw my register - I never sign that name, and am never called any thing but William; when I was young my friends told me my name was Julius.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 5th of November I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running across Whitechapel from Red Lion-street, towards Castle-street - he was running; I stopped him; he said"You may search me, I have no property;" I took him to the watch-house; nothing was found on him; I came back to my beat, and in about three quarters of an hour I found the seals, and one link of the chain, in the kennel, about four doors up Red Lion-street.</p>

               <p>THOMAS THOROGOOD. - I am constable of Broad-street. About eleven o'clock at night. I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor in Threadneedle-street. In about two minutes I heard him call out, saying, she had stolen his watch, and was gone that way, pointing towards Cornhill, but as I knew her I went down Bartholomew-lane, and overtook her in Bell-alley; I stopped her, and told her that she had got the man's watch. She said she was only going to stall it, which means, pawn it. I took her back; she told him he gave it to her, and refused to return it. I took it from her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They both swear false. I took him to the Borough; he gave me the watch, as he only had 18 d. The watchman said,</p>
               <p>"Give me the watch, and you may bolt, but if not, it will be worse for you."</p>

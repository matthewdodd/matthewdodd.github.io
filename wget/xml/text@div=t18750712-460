                  </hi>. I keep an hotel at 76 and 77, Aldgate High Street, City—on 7th October the prisoner passed the night at my hotel—next morning my attention was drawn to bedroom No. 2, by Emma Chick, the chamber-maid—I found the bed cut open, the spring mattreas was also cut open in two or three places, the sheet had been held up and burnt in various places, the. blanket had also been served the same, all the handles of the mahogany chest of drawers had been burnt all over, two very indecent words were scratched on the looking-glass with a diamond, and also on the window, the soap was cut into small pieces and kneaded into the carpet pretty well all over the room, and water was strewed about all over</p>

               <p>the carpet—about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of damage was caused—the prisoner went away without paying his bill—on the evening of 30th April he came again and took a bed; the chamber-maid let it to him, I did not see him—I was taken into the room No. 9, in the morning, and found the bed cut open, the greater portion of the feathers taken out and strewed about the room, and the water jug emptied all over the feathers and on to the carpet, going through and damaging the ceiling below, the looking-glass was scratched over in the same manner with two very filthy words, the window curtains torn in halves and something dirty done in it and thrown out of window on to the skylight—the amount of damage done then was above 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 11th June the prisoner came again, about 1 o'clock in the morning, and had a bed—the chambermaid recognised him in the morning, as he came up the stairs, and called me—she first locked the door—I found him struggling with a captain who was staying in the house—I assisted in preventing him from going out, and sent for a policeman and gave him in charge—as soon as the constable came the prisoner held up a glass of ale that he had been served with, and said, "This is what I came in for, now let me out, or I shall charge you with serving me after hours"—I said, "We have merely served you to keep you quiet till we got a constable"—he was taken to the station, and he was very abusive there.</p>

I am chambermaid to Mr. Baverstock—the prisoner slept there on the night of 7th October, in room No. 2—I went into the room next morning, about ten minutes after he left it, and found the bed and mattress cut, the sheets and blankets burnt, and everything in the room spoiled, the handles of the drawers burnt, and the looking-glass and window scratched with a diamond ring, and the carpet soaked with water and soap—the prisoner went away without paying for his bed—I next saw him on 30th April, he then occupied No. 9—I saw him come in but did not recog<lb></lb>nise him that night: I did in the morning when he came downstairs, and I directly went to the room he had occupied—I found it pretty well in the same state as before—I went and told my master—I did not see anything more of the prisoner.</p>

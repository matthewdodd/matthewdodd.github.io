                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 212). On Sunday morning, 7th May, about a quarter-past 1 o'clock, I saw Dinan in the New-road, just by the railway, he said, "Hulloa, Radley, "I said, "Hulloa, Dinan, where are you going?"—he said, "Down to the railway-station to see the night-porter, Simper, about 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I lent him a short time ago, to give a gentleman change for a florin"—he went over the bridge, and I went round my beat—at about a quarter to 2 I met him again in William-street, about 128 yards from the up and 320 from the down platform, walking towards his own home, away from the station—he had a portmanteau in his hand; I said, "Halloa, Dinan, what have you got there?"—he said, "I found this outside the railway-station, and am going to take it home till the morning"—I said, "You had better not do that, you had better come back to the station"—he hesitated for a moment or so, and then accompanied me back, and when within eighteen yards of the station door, on the down side, he put the portmanteau down and said, "That is where I found it, we will leave it there, and go and see the porter"—I said, "I will take charge of it now"—he said, "For Christ's sake, Radley, be a man, act square to me, let me take it home, and I will act square to you"—I took it up and said, "Dinan I will not, I will do my duty"—he pushed the door open, and walked in—there was no one in the station; he called out "Simper" but no, one answered—I called out, "Porter"—we then crossed over the bridge on the up side to the front office, calling out "Porter" several times; no one answered, and I said, "Come on, we will go down to the signal-box, and see if anyone is there;" we found Simper there; I said to him, "Do you know anything of this, "alluding to the portmanteau I had in my hand; he said, "Yes, it is all right, it belongs to a party at Shooter's Hill, and has to be delivered in the morning:" Dinan said, "Well, I found it outside the station:" I said, "Now, stop Dinan, tell the truth:" Simper said, "It is all right, I will show you where I left it about ten minutes or a quarter of an I hour before;" we then went to the bridge on the up side of the line where there was a large box standing, covered with white canvass with a red edging, just outside the cloak-room door, and Simper said, "That is were I left it, on the top of that box"—I said, "Well, I wish to see the station-master"—Simper said, "You will not see him to-night"—I said,—I shall see him before I leave here"—he said, "No, be d----d if you do;" I asked him where the station-master's room was, that I might call him, but he did not tell me; I said, "I shall not give up the property till I do see him"—Simper then seized the portmanteau and drove me into the ticket-office; we struggled four or five minutes; he got it out of my hand, and said, "You d—d scamp you are drunk, what business have you here"—they both then seized me, and I was bundled out at the front-door into the street—they closed the door and locked it, leaving me outside—I went to the police-station, and Serjeant Featherstone came back and called the station-master up, then we went down on the platform, and the station-master asked Simper about the portmanteau—Simper began telling him about 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he had borrowed of Dinan—the station-master asked him whether he knew Dinan, and what he did there at that time of night—he said that he did not know much of Dinan, and came then to meet a friend by the midnight train—the station-master went with me to Dinan's house, 4, Whit worth-place; we knocked at the door, Dinan put his head out at the bedroom window, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186505080090"></xptr>
               <p>the station-master said, "About this portmanteau, what do you know of it"—he said, "All I know is I met the constable coming out of the station with it, and as there was no one there but me, he turned round, put it on me, and said that I stole it"—I took him to the station; I received the port<lb></lb>manteau from the station-master.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Dinan.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At what time did you meet Dinan with the port<lb></lb>manteau? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty minutes or a quarter to 2—I do not recollect that Simper asked to look at the address—the address is still on it—he appeared to know the portmanteau; he did not say, "It was left in my charge"—he said that it had been left there till the morning, and that it would be delivered in the morning—I kept it my hand; he asked me to deliver it up, but I said that I should not till I had seen the station-master—I do not recollect that he asked me more than once to let him have it—the sergeant pointed out where the station-master lived; Simper did not say "He lives there"—I was not much ruffled at being put out of the station; it was Simper who tried to take the portmanteau from me; Dinan stood close by—Simper seemed ruffled at my not giving it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in the Royal Artillery, stationed at Wool<lb></lb>wich—on 6th May I went by train, at 11 o'clock, from London Bridge to Woolwich—I had a large box covered with red edging, and this small portmanteau (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), belonging to my sister, who was with me—when we arrived at Woolwich a porter carried it for me, I having ordered a cab to be there, but the cab was not there, and the porter could not get me one, so I left the luggage at the station with him—I think it was Simper, bat cannot swear to him—next morning Simper came to my house with the box—he asked to see me, and said that the portmanteau had been stolen from the station the night before, by a thief, but that it was at the station-house and he could not get it till Monday afternoon, and he was afraid of getting into a scrape, as he bad left the luggage outside the cloak-room, instead of putting it inside.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a porter at Woolwich Arsenal Station; on the night in question on the arrival of the 10. 50 train from Charing-Cross it was my duty to attend to the luggage-van; I took out a portmanteau and box covered with canvass; took them to the front office, where the <hi rend="italic">gent</hi> said that he had ordered a cab, but there was no cab there, and I could not get one, so I left the portmauteau with the <hi rend="italic">gent</hi>, outside, and the prisoner Simper—I heard some communication between them that Simper should deliver the luggage in the morning—we brought it in through the office, and I assisted Simper to place it outside the cloak-room; that is inside the station on the bridge that leads from the down platform to the booking-office—it was not my business to put it into the cloak-room; Simper had the key of the cloak-room—I believe I last saw the portmanteau and box there about 1:2 o'clock.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had Simper charge of the key that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I won't say—the station door on the down side has a spring-look, which opens inside—there is a wall which runs at the side of the door on the down side, but nobody could get in at any of the windows by that; it if about 2 feet 6 or 3 feet high from the platform; anybody could get over it, but from the cab-stand it is much higher—a person could not get over within the company's premises, he could only get into the cab-yard outside the station—there is a wall on the other side of the cab-yard about four or five feet high—if anybody put his shoulder to the door with force it might be forced open, unless it was double bolted.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there folding-doors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I bolted the top and the? bottom, but cannot say whether both doors were bolted—I closed it by the spring-lock, and pushed it; if it had not been bolted I think it would have sprung open—simper was left on duty then—it was his duty to be at the signal-box after all the passengers were out, and I believe it was his duty to see to the fastenings of the door after I left.</p>

I am station-master at Woolwich Arsenal—I let Dinan and Featherstone into my house that morning, and then went to the signal-box with two constables, and saw Simper there, that was about 3 o'clock—I asked him if he knew the man who the constable brought to the station just now, he said that he did not know much of him, his name was Dinan—I asked him what his business was at that time of the morning—he said that he had borrowed 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of him to give a passenger change, who had come by the train, and had come to pay it, and that the portmanteau belonged to a gentleman at Shooter' a-hill, who had left it with a box to be delivered in the morning—I went with Featherstone to Dinan's house, knocked at the door, and when Dinan put his head out at the window, I said, "What about that portmanteau"—he said that he was going to the station for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he had lent Simper, and just before he got to the station he met the constable with the portmanteau, coming from the station—I said, "This is a very strange story ": he said, "Had I better come down?": I said, "Yes, you had," and we walked together to the police-station—I had left the station soon after 10 o'clock, I have an inspector there—Simper was night watchman, he comes on duty at 8 o'clock, and from 8 till the last passenger-train comes in, he is office-porter—the last tram arrives at 1 o'clock, it is then his duty to lock up the station, and then go down to the signal-box and take care of the switches.</p>

He said I met a man with it in Bull's-fields. I said, "Where is the man?" He said, "You are the man, and you know it" I turned and abused him; he forced the trunk from Simper's hand. I did not interfere, and Simper without any aid put him outside. He then unlocked the door and I went home.</p>

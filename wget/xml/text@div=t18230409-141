            . Pearce lodged in the same room I met him in the Strand one Saturday morning, in February, and went with him to the Borough. He said he was going with some hats and bonnets. I waited on the bridge till he returned with some hats in a bag. I carried the bag part of the way. We came to Field-lane; he wished me to sell the hats. We were to have a pair of shoes each with the money. He gave me a hat in Field-lane; I took it into one Solomon's shop but did not sell it. In the evening I went to the west end of the town with him. We went together to Marks's shop in Field-lane. Pearce sold him some bonnets for 7 s. 6 d. - this was Saturday; and on Monday I sold Marks two of the hats for 15 s., and gave 
               <persName id="t18230409-141-person1290">Pearce</persName>
             the money; and on Thursday I sold him another of the hats for 7 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see how many hats he had - A. No; I sold them publicly in his shop; he keeps a clothes-shop. I agreed with Solomons for some of them.</p>

            . The hats are worth twenty shillings each.</p>
               <p>PEARCE'S Defence. This man asked me into a public-house; then asked me to take the hats out, and said</p>
               <p>"Let me sell them" - I said No; and while I was reading the paper, he took them and sold them without my consent; and entirely contrary to my feelings.</p>
               <p>MARK'S Defence. Brown and Furzman passed my door. I called Furzman back, and shook hands with him, and asked him to walk in. As to the hats, Brown bought clothes which came to 2 l. 6 s. - he gave me twenty-six shillings, and asked me to take the hats for a week or two, till he got more money.</p>
               <p>FURZMAN. He did call to me and shook hands - I have known him some time. I found the goods in his yard; he had them in his hand.</p>

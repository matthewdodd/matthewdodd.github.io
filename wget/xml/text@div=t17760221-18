               <p>I am a bricklayer; I was concerned with the prisoner in robbing Mr. Boulton; it was on Monday night the 8th of January, about six o'clock; as near as I can remember, it was near the bason in Hyde Park we met him, as we were coming from Grosvenor-gate; I went up to him and asked him what o'clock it was, I took hold of him, and the two prisoners came up and took his watch and his money as I held him.</p>
               <p>Was that all you took? - No, we took his coat; I cannot remember much about the buckles: after we had taken his coat and watch and money, we desired him to go about his business; then we returned again towards Hyde Park corner; I pawned the coat at the corner of Derby-court, Jermyn-street, for five shillings, and Langar pawned the watch at Mr. Johnson's in the Broad-way, Westminster; I stood at the door while he pawned it; from Hyde Park we went down Piccadilly, Langar went to try to get the watch off; I met with him again at Charing-cross. Dickinson crossed the way to speak to somebody, we missed him and went and pawned the watch, and then we all met at the Bull-head in Peter's-street, Westminster; we had about seventeen shillings each.</p>
               <p>How was Langar dressed? - He had on a brown close-bodied coat, a plain hat, white<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210018"></xptr> breeches, and I believe, a light-coloured great coat.</p>

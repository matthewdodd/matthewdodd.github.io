I fell in with the prisoner on the 23rd of December, on Pentonville-hill, about twelve o'clock at night—we got talking together, and went to her lodging in Lucas-court, near Hunter<lb></lb>street—I gave her a shilling and two sixpences—I had then two half<lb></lb>crowns, five shillings, and two sixpences—I got on the bed with her for about five minutes—I felt her hand in my pocket, and I accused her of robbing me—she struck me with the poker, because I would not let her out of my sight—she got from the room, which was up stairs, and went into the parlour, but I still kept sight of her—the policeman heard the dis<lb></lb>turbance, and looked in—I accused her of robbing me—she denied that she took it, or had any half-crown on her—she was taken, and searched by a female, and the half-crowns found on her.</p>

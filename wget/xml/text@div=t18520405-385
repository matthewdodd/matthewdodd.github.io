                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 383). I was on duty on 6th March in Red Lion-street, Wapping, at half-past 1 o'clock—I saw a light in the window of No. 7, Mr. Watts', a cheesemonger—I listened at the door, and heard parties moving goods up and down inside—I tried the house and shop doors, and found them both fast—I knocked at the shop door, and the light immediately disappeared—I kept knocking, and Mr. Watts came down—he opened the door—I went in, and behind the door I found a bundle and a pair of Blucher boots—in the bundle there was an overcoat and two vests, and on the counter was another bundle, which contained three aprons, three handkerchiefs, and two chemises—I searched the house, and, going down stairs, I found both the prisoners concealed in the cellar—I brought them out—William was the first that came out—I asked him what he wanted there—he said he found the door open, and came in to call the people, to let them know it—on bringing them up, William asked for his shoes—I asked him what he did with his shoes off—he said he was going to bed—I asked Daniel what he had to say—he said he had nothing to say but what the other pri<lb></lb>soner had said—the shoes by the side of the bundle, William claimed as his—I got assistance, and took the prisoners to the station, and returned, and found this staple in the middle of the shop floor—I tried it by the side of the door-post, and it fitted two holes where the bolt was—I searched William, and found 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Red Lion-street, Wappin, in the parish of St. John; I am a grocer and cheesemonger. I had frequently seen the pri<lb></lb>soners come in and out of my shop, but have only known them in the way of trade—they had no business in my house at all—I fastened my door at 12 o'clock at night—the lock was defective, and would not lock, but there was a bolt under it, which was a good security for it—the house door had been fastened before—we do not go in and out that way—I saw that that was secure when I fastened the other—it was fastened by a lock, and bolt, and a key—when I came down I found the bolt in its place on the shop door, but the staple had been drawn—the bolt was shot—this coat and waistcoat are mine—they had been in a drawer in a chest of drawers in the parlour behind the shop—they had to break open another door to get in there—I had locked that door myself—I missed a half-side of bacon, a show-glass, a jar of pickles, and also a pair of sugar-tongs, but they were found in the cellar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">William Fitzgerald's Defence.</hi> I always dealt at his shop, and I came out and wanted some <hi rend="italic">grub</hi>; I work for the Trinity Company; we got paid on Friday night; I went to get some <hi rend="italic">grub</hi>, and this door was open; I walked in, and said, "Mr. Watts, I want some <hi rend="italic">grub</hi>;" I had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket; I went by a little cellar, and fell down, and they came and took me.</p>

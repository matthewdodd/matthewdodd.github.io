                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 35.) On Monday week, I was in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, and saw the two prisoners coming down Salisbury-street—in the act of turning into William-street—I went up to them, and said, "Halloo, my lads, where are you going to at this time in the morning!"—Turner said he was going to Covent-garden market—I said, it was rather early to be going to Covent-garden market—I then asked Field where it was at work now—he said, he was at work in Harper's fields—I asked who for there—he said, "For Mr. White"—I asked when he worked fit him last—he said, "On Saturday night"—I said, "Where have you been to all night then?"—Field said, he had been at home, and abed, but he said that Turner had called him up—I then asked Turner where he had been to all night—he said, he had been about the streets—I then asked what they had got in their pockets—Field said he had got a few halfpence—he gave me out two penny pieces—I said, "You have got more than that," and he afterward gave me out three farthings, and a comb—I touched him on his trowsers pocket, and said, "You have got some silver here"—he then gave me a new half-crown, and a thimble—finding that he had got no more, I returned him the property back again—I then asked Turner what he had—he gave me a comb and a purse first—I said, "Have you not got any money?"—he said, "I have got half-a-crown, and a halfpenny," which he gave me oat of his pocket—I gave him the property back also—I said I was not satis<lb></lb>fied with the story they told me, and should take them to the station—on the road to the station, I said if they did not mind what they were after before long they would be advocates for the Isle of Wight, or Botany Bay—Turner said, he was a b—sight too artful for that, but he should be better off in Botany Bay than he was here—at the station I took the property away from them again, and on Turner's neck I found this silk handkerchief—I took it off, and was looking at it—he said, "You have no occasion to look at it, there are no marks on it"—I asked him how he knew that—he said, "It is my own property"—in the morning I found out the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Salisbury-street, Lis<lb></lb>son-grove. Last Monday morning week, I got up between six and seven o'clock, came down to open the shop as usual, and found the place broken into—all the drawers, and things turned out—I missed the articles stated which were all my property—it was safe in the shop and parlour at nine</p>

               <p>o'clock, when we went to bed—the clock had just struck nine when I went to bed—I had closed the house, and fastened the windows and doors myself—in the morning I found the door safe, but the back window had been broken into—it was broken in two places to unscrew the hasp which was fast at night—a person could put a hand in to do so—the win<lb></lb>dow was lifted wide open—it was wide enough for a man to get in—the window opens into the back yard—a person can get over the wall, which is about six feet high, into the yard—there were no shutters to this window—there was an alarum bell put inside, on a plate of iron stuck between the two sashes, so that if anybody broke the window they could take it out—it was taken out—that must have been done first—I went to the police office, met the constable, and he went back with me and examined the place where they had got over the wall—it had been white-washed on Saturday, two days before, and there were the marks of feeling distinctly on the wall the side was scraped off—I looked down on the ground, and saw these three parcels containing all the things except the two half-crowns, handkerchief, and thimble—this silk handkerchief is mine—I had not seen it for a fortnight before—I have worn it round my neck several times—I know it by a mark on it—it was put into the drawer with the clothes in the parlour—the value of the things stolen was from 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

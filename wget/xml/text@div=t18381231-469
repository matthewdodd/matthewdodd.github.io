                  </hi>. I reside in Coleman-street. About four o'clock in the morning, on the 27th of December, I was in Fleet-street—I had been up all night—I was just parting with" a friend when I met the prisoner, and supposing I was locked out I was induced to accompany her to a place which I have since understood to be Shire-lane—I had no money about me, but I allowed the people of the house for their remuneration to pledge two rings, which they gave me the duplicates of—I slept with the prisoner, and in the morning I missed a breast-pin from my cravat—I had paid her 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the landlady had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I think—that was out of what the rings fetched, which was 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were pledged I suppose about eight o'clock in the morning—I missed my breast-pins on dressing myself—I said it was little consequence saying any thing about it, I knew where they were—I said to the landlady's daughter down stain,." I have lost a ruby breast-pin, if I call in the evening perhaps you will give it me?"—I intended to think no more about it—but on reaching Cheapside, a little after eleven o'clock, I missed a gold pencil-case—I immediately went to my inn, dressed myself, and went to Bow-street office—the inspector referred me to Matthews, who eventually took the prisoner into custody—these are my pencil-case and breast-pin—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>

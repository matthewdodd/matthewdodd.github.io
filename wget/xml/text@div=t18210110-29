            . On Christmas night I was out with a friend about half-past twelve o'clock - I found I was locked out - I am <rs id="t18210110-29-viclabel168" type="occupation">servant</rs>

I walked about, and tried the door several times till three o'clock in the morning; as the family were out of town I could not get in. I went to the corner of Pickett-street, Strand. About three o'clock in the morning I went into a coffee-shop, saw some persons drinking coffee, and called for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182101100014"></xptr>some. Two gentlemen came in, sat close to me, and were speaking to me - the prisoner was looking at my seal; when I saw that I tucked it into my pocket. I staid there till six o'clock, the two gentlemen came out with me to the Bell, near Temple-bar, I then parted with them, and was going down <placeName id="t18210110-29-crimeloc169">Bell-yard</placeName>

I began to call the watchman, and he said,</p>
               <p>"The watch be d - d." He held me against the wall, while the other four took my property and turned my pockets inside out - all five then ran up Bell-yard, and the watchman stopped the prisoner at the corner of Apollo-court and Bell-yard. I am sure he is the man - he was not out of my sight. I do not know what became of the others. I have not found my watch. I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You had been spending your Christmas night - A. Yes, at No. 3, Bedford-place. I was quite sober. I had no girls with me. Two women followed me into the street and had a glass of gin at the public-house - they teazed us for drink. I did not return to the coffee-shop. The women were not in my company, they followed the two men. I never told the landlord of the coffee-house that two women had robbed me - I never told anybody so. I do not know Cole - (looking at him.)</p>

            . I was going on an errand for my mother, and passed Bell-yard about half-past six o'clock. I saw the prisoner lay hold of the prosecutor up against the wall, he had a white great-coat on. The prosecutor tried to hold him while he called Watch! but he hustled away, and ran up Bell-yard. I ran to see what became of the prisoner; he was turning down Apollo-court, the watchman came up and stopped him. I belong to St. Dunstan's charity-school.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About twenty minutes or half-past six o'clock, there was a repeated cry of Watch! at the bottom of Bell-yard; I got out of my box, which is in Bell-yard, ran towards the bottom of the yard, saw four or five men running up, and saw the prisoner in a white great coat; he turned short round Apollo-court, I seized the prisoner as he was the foremost of the men. I collared him and said,</p>
               <p>"Is this the man?" The prosecutor came up and said he was the man, and gave him in charge for robbing him of his watch.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TURNER. I was constable of the night, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, charged with holding the prosecutor while four others robbed him of his watch and seals. I searched him, and found 1 l. 14 s. on him, but nothing else. When I took him to Guildhall he had a coach; he threw his white great coat out of the coach-window to a person, who caught it and ran away with it.</p>

            . I keep a coffee-shop in Ship-yard, Temple-bar. The prosecutor came to my house about four o'clock on the morning after Christmas Day, and asked if the young woman was there who had been to my house with him, I said I did not know he had been with any woman. He said,</p>
               <p>"She has robbed me of my watch." I said,</p>
               <p>"We will go up and see if it is in the room." We went up and found a girl's bonnet but no girl. He said,</p>
               <p>"Keep this bonnet till I come, and if the girl comes keep her." This was the first time I had seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again that morning - A. He came, and asked me to light his pipe. He said there were three or four houses about, and I must see her if I went to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publican, and was living in West-street, near Long-acre—on 8th July I was aroused about 5 o'clock—I came down as soon as I possibly could, and found the prisoner inside the bar, in custody of a policeman, who was searching him—he had on him about seven shillings'-worth of farthings—this decanter was full of wine then—it was in his hand, and the cigars were secreted in various quantities over different parts of his clothes—I saw them taken from him—this bag contains farthings—they were taken from different parts of his persons concealed in his pockets—I left these things safe the night before at 12 o'clock; all in the same part of the bar—I fastened, bolted, and locked every door at 12 o'clock; the front door was fastened-the prisoner's coat was covered with sawdust—there was some dust on my cellar, and there were corresponding marks where he had lain in the cellar—I usually keep the celler locked, but the key happened to he lost that night; we looked before we went to bed, and could not find it at all—we did not look in the cellar; the lights were all out, and we had not the slightest suspicion of anything—afrer this took place the cellar was open—the value of these things, is I supose, about, a pound, including the seven shillings'-worth of farthings—my house is in St. Giles' parish.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 28, King-street, Old-street, Long-acre, and am a carman—I was passing Mr. Jackson's house on the morning about twenty-five minutes to 5, and saw Davis standing looking about there—he was about two yards from the house, with dirt and sawdust all over his coat—I stood back in the gateway, and saw him go into Mr. Jackson's house, at the one half of the front door, and then the door was left open about two inches, or a little more—that was just about a minute after the time at which I first saw him—I watched, and saw him come out and go up the court, and I</p>

About 5 o'clock on the morning of 8th July, in consequence of what the last witness said to me, I went up to the prisoner, who was then, I should think, about 300 yards from the prosecutor's house; it would be rather farther than that by the way he went—I took him in custody, and took him back to the public-house, the street door of which was open—I took him in, searched him, and found on him these articles—the decanter was in this apron, and the cigars and money loose in different pockets; the farthings were in his pocket—some of them are new farthings, not all—he said he saw the door open, and walked in and helped himself to them—I noticed some sawdust on his coat—I passed the house about 4 o'clock that morning, and tried all the doors; they were then secure.</p>

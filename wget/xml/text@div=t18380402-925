                  </hi>. I am a lieutenant in the Royal Horse Guards Blue. On Monday, the 19th of March, I gave George Carrington a cheque for£300, on Cox and Biddulph—this is the cheque—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I saw him go into the banking-house with the cheque—he came out, and gave me, the money directly—there were two£100 notes and seven£10 notes among it—30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was deducted—I desired him to keep the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took the two£100 notes, and seven£10 notes, home with me—I left one£100 note and the seven£10 notes at home—I put one£100 note into my waistcoat pocket, and went to Mr. Wright's, in Gough-street, Gray's Inn-lane—I was there about half an hour, and then went to Pall Mall, and when I got there I found the note was gone out of my pocket—I was at Wright's about half-past two o'clock, and at Pall Mall at ten minutes after three o'clock, when I missed the note—I looked at my watch after I missed it—the cheque was drawn by Mr. Sandford—I did not notice either of the prisoners any where that day.</p>

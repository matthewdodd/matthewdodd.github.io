I live at 9, Blossom Street, Norton Folgate—am a packing-case maker—on Sunday night, 4th April, I left my house about 9.30—I live in the ground floor—it is let out in tenements—when I left my house the door was fast, with an ordinary lock—I locked the door and took the key with me, and went to a public house at the top of the street, about fifty yards off—my. wife was in thereat the time—my wife left me, to go home, and I heard her scream out "Police!" about ten minutes after—I ran out of the public house and said "What is it?"—she said "A man is in the place, and he has gone down that way"—I did not see anybody—I examined the door, and found the bolt was out, as if it had been opened with a key—there was no light in my house when I went out—the prisoner was taken into custody by a friend of mine—there was a. light in <hi rend="italic">the</hi> room-when I came back—I heard him say to the policeman "Ask that woman if she has lost anything"—he appeared as if he had been drinking a little.</p>

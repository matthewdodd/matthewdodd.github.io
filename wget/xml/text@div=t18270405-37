When he came on Wednesday he engaged the bed of me for nine nights, and next morning, after he was gone, I missed a coat, a waistcoat, a watch, a silver snuff-box, and two cravats from the drawer in my bed-room - I had placed the snuff-box there at night, after the prisoner went to bed, and saw the watch and cravats in the same drawer; the value of what I lost is 8l. or 9l.; it cost me more.</p>

I am porter at this hotel, and remember the prisoner being there - I did not see him till the morning of the 22d of February; I went up to his room about nine o'clock, and took his great coat, his other coat,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050023"></xptr>and shoes to brush; there was a screw-driver in his coat-pocket, which I took out and put in again. I missed a pair of trousers that morning, about twelve o'clock, out of a box in my bed-room - I slept on the same floor as Champ, but not in the same room. I am sure he is the man.</p>

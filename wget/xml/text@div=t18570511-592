                  </hi>. I live at No. 16, South Parade, Brompton. I was in the service of Mr. Mark Boyd, of Victoria Street—on the night before this happened I left everything quite safe, at half past 11o'clock, and about 7 next morning came into the library, and it was ransacked, and a great many things taken away—Mr. Boyd's papers were strewed about the room—these articles produced are his property.—I had not bolted the doors myself.</p>

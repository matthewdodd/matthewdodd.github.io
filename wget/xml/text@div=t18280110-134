I am landlady of the Red Lion Hammond was at my house, and fell asleep; I saw the two prisoners with him; I saw Beekley draw his left hand from Hammond's right-hand pocket, and put both his hands into his own breeches pocket; Atkins was then out of doors; I called the ostler, who awoke Hammond - Atkins then came and wanted to knock me down, saying he would not have Hammond disturbed - Hammond had before that laid his purse on the table, and I saw two sovereigns and a half in it - I put it back into his pocket - I would not let him have any more drink, and be produced his purse, to shew me he had got money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you keep your eye on Beekley? A. Yes, except when I went to call in the ostler -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100082"></xptr>the money could not drop out of the purse; Hammond was tipsy, and fell asleep - the prisoners were not drunk.</p>

I know him better than you - let him alone;" I said I would awake him; he abused my mistress, and struck at her; I stepped before her, and received the blow - I awoke Hammond - his pocket was turned inside out - he missed his purse, but found it, empty, in his coat pocket - I did not detain the prisoners; they said they would come next morning, and set all right - he said, "Very well" - but they did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not Hammond drunk? A. Yes, rather; but he got up in his cart, and drove home afterwards.</p>

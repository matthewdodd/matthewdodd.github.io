                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Darling, and occupy part of a house in Short's-alley, Woolwich. Mr. Grove, the landlord, is a relation of Emery's, and lodges in the same house—on the 5th of June, between four and five o'clock, Emery came and inquired for her brother's wife—she came again soon after, and came into the yard where I was—she would pass her brother's door and mine—I have the back room, and her brother the front—her bro<lb></lb>ther's family were out—I had my husband's watch in my room—I had seen it safe about a quarter of an hour before—I missed it directly Emery was gone—this is it—I saw no one but Emery there—I left my door a little way open when I went into the yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at Woolwich. Between four and five o'clock on Monday afternoon, I saw the two prisoners talking together close by a public-house, not five yards from the prosecutor's house-Duncan had a basket—I was afterwards at the station, and heard the watch drop from Duncan's person—I saw the prisoners come direct from the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoners—I told them they were charged on suspicion of stealing a watch—they both denied it—Emery said, "Good God! Mrs. Duncan, you have got me into a nice thing"—Duncan said, "I know nothing about it"—I took them to the station—as a female was about to search them, I heard the watch drop from Duncan—she said, "Mrs. Emery gave me the watch before we entered the station door"—Emery said, "For God's sake, Mrs. Duncan, ease me with it, (or words to that effect,) and I will do all I can for you."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did she not say something about forgiving her for making such a charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She did—there was a good deal of recrimination—Emery had a basket—I know Mr. Jeremy's hand writing—this is his sig<lb></lb>nature—this was read over to the prisoners as what they stated—(<hi rend="italic">The prison<lb></lb>ers' examination being read, Emery stated that she accompanied Duncan to pur<lb></lb>chase a pair of shoes for her child, that she went to the prosecutor's house to see her sister; and went into the yard, leaving Duncan in the passage, and when she returned, Duncan was gone; that she overtook her, and knew nothing of the watch till Duncan dropped it at the station. Duncan stated, that when Emery went to the prosecutor's house, she remained ten or twelve yards from the door, and was never in the house; that when Emery came out, she gave her the watch, and asked her to pawn it.</hi>)</p>

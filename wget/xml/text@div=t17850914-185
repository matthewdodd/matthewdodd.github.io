               GUILTY
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. The perjured defences set up on behalf of prisoners, has long been the disgrace of the criminal courts of this country; I have thought it my duty, ever since I have sat in a criminal court of justice, to pay great attention to that circumstance, and to do all that lay in my power to prevent the continuance of so wicked and so dangerous a practice; for the mischief of such perjured defences by no means terminates in an unjust-acquittal, if believed; for that, though a failure of justice, and consequently a great mischief, is but a very small one to the mischief that follows from the frequency of this kind of perjuries, because they induce a court and jury to look with a suspicious eye on the defences of prisoners even when true; they require to be more strongly proved than any other kind of defence, in order to gain credit with the jury, so that the innocent may as often be hurt as the guilty: this is therefore the worst of all offences, except that most horrid of all offences, of which it falls very little short, the crime of murder; and no perjury can be more mischievous than that which frequently occurs in the defence of prisoners. I have therefore made it a point, where there appears strong and cogent grounds before the court on the trial of prisoners, to induce them to suspect, or rather to believe, that a witness is perjured, to put the matter into a way of trial, and to pursue to justice and condign punishment the offenders, if on a full and impartial hearing of a second jury they should be found guilty; and it appears to me that no trial can afford the party accused a better chance of justification, because, before a party can be found guilty, there must be the concurrent testimony of two juries; therefore, it would be idle and nugatory in me, and in the court, to direct a prosecution of that sort, and where it was afterwards supported by clear and satisfactory evidence, to pass a slight sentence on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140210"></xptr> offenders; for such sentence would be a mockery of justice: however, considering the situation of the prisoner, the court will remember at the same time a degree of mercy with justice, and will nor pass so severe a sentence as might be passed on this prisoner; supposing that the might be ignorant in some degree of the full enormity of her guilt; sentence, however, somewhat severe, it is the duty of the Court to pass, and it is the sentence of the Court, that you,

On the 30th of July, about twelve o'clock in the morning, I was at the Mansfield-arms, I staid there till about five o'clock; I had drank rather too much - I went into the skittle-ground - I laid my head on the table and went to sleep-the landlord awoke me and asked me if I had lost any thing. I found my breeches unbottoned and my watch gone.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BROWN. I am the landlord of the house. I was looking out of my window, and saw the prosecutor asleep on the table, the prisoner pretended to be asleep also; I saw him trying to get something out of the prosecutor's pocket - I saw him draw something out, and put it into his right hand waistcoat-pocket; the prisoner went towards the back-door to go out - I ran down and collared him, and told him he had committed the robbery, he denied it; after remonstrating with him he gave me the watch; he said he did not mean to keep it. I awoke the prosecutor - he gave him in charge. They did not appear to know each other.</p>

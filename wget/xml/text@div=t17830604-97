               <p>Court. Was the petticoat you saw under her arm, upon the counter before? - Yes, with several others (the coat produced) she gave me direction to No. 8, Bow-street, but she said at the Justice's, she lived at No. 17.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you any private mark on that coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know that to be your master's property? - I do.</p>
               <p>Court. Was she close to the counter at this time? - No, the space of a yard and a half off.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were they folded up? - Yes, they were folded up, she seemed confused; I saw the foldings through the arm hole of her cloak, she saw that I saw it, and she dropped it on the ground, and took it up, and laid it on the counter, and said, she was not culpable.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did she say she was not culpable, before you charged her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she ever look at that petticoat before? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe her take the petticoat up? - I came round the counter to shut the door, she was a good many minutes looking for her money, but she had but two-pence or three-pence.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you did not observe her take it and put it under her arm? - No, I did not see it till I saw it under the armhole of her cloak.</p>
               <p>Court. Then if she had left the five shillings, she would have gone off uninterrupted? - No, I do not believe she would.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he was before the Justice, he said, he was in great confusion.</p>
               <p>I was a little suspicious when I was on the other side the counter; she asked me to make out a bill, I got a pen and ink, and then I was a little confused, suspecting she had something under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Court. You was not so confused but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040089"></xptr> you remember the circumstances you have now mentioned? - Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The reason I did not leave money, I had been out to market and changed half a guinea, and left it on the drawers.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the value of the things she bought? - Fifteen shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Court. Then half a guinea could not pay that, you must go into the shop with an intention only to steal.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I am innocent of what is alledged to me; I have been five weeks in two different prisons, not a friend to help me to a shilling.</p>
               <p>Court. What way of life are you in? - My husband has been abroad about a twelve-month, he supported me in a genteel life and that is expended; I expect to hear from him every day, to remit me some money, or to support me.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. In this case I should recommended to you to take the milder meathod, and reduce the value under five shillings though if ever there was a case of private stealing this is one; I was in hopes something would have come out, that he saw her steal it, therefore, if you think she is guilty, you will find her guilty of stealing, but under five shillings.</p>

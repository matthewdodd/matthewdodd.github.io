                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Pitt, a publican, of 3, Hayes-court—I remember the prisoner first coming to our house, with another man, a few weeks previous to the 27th February—he then asked for a pint of beer, which was twopence, and gave me a half-crown—I gave him two shillings, a threepenny-piece, and a penny in change, and while I was serving other customers he took the opportunity of changing a good shilling for a bad one—the other man with him said, "Why did you pay a half-crown? I have twopence," and the prisoner asked me for the half-crown back again, and I gave it him back—I thought there was something wrong, and looked at the change—I saw one of the shillings was bad, and said, "This is not the money I laid down; this is a bad shilling"—the prisoner said he had no other about him—I called my husband, and they both ran away, leaving some of the beer—the two shillings I gave the prisoner were good—he came again on 27th February, alone, and asked for a glass of ale—I recognised him directly he came in—he gave me a florin in payment—I tried it, bent it up, and told him I could not take it—he was going to take it up as I laid it on the counter—I called my husband, and the prisoner ran out directly—I went out after him, and saw him at the top of the court, looking back—I said, "That is the man"—my husband took him in custody in King-street, I believe—I gave the constable the florin that day, and the shilling the day after.</p>

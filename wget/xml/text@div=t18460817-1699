On Saturday night, the 25th of July, I went to my brother's, in Compton-street—I was walking, about nine o'clock that night, in Compton-court, with Amelia Knox—we met the prisoners and George Tibbey at Leices<lb></lb>ter-square—we all went together towards my residence—when we got to South-street, Phipps said, "There is my aunt"—I said, "Where?"—I looked round, but could not see her, and Phipps was then out of my sight—Whichelow then said, "We will have some porter"—we went into a public-house, and staid there about ten minutes—I then went borne—Whichelow wanted me to stop, but I would not—he, Tibbey, and Knox, went home with me, and I found the area grating open—I said, "Oh, my God 1 the place has been robbed"—I went down to the kitchen, where I live—the things were very much displaced, and I could not stand, I was so giddy—I do not know what made me so—I did not miss anything on that occasion, but about two o'clock on Sunday, the next day, I missed my coat, waistcoat, a pair of trow<lb></lb>sers, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which had been in my waistcoat pocket—I saw the prisoners that day, and told them I had been robbed—they said, "Oh, have yoa? who do you suspect"—I said, "I don't know who to suspect"—Whichelow said, "Do you think it is Dudley Moore?"—I said, "I don't know"—he said, "We will go and see"—Phipps and Whichelow went to see—I went to the station and gave information—Phipps came to me, and said Dudley Moore had plenty of money, and he had not been at work that day—I went with the policeman, and took both the prisoners—in coming along Oxford-street, Phipps said, "I will get you the clothes back for 8.; they are sold at Mrs. Bateman's, and I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to say nothing about it"—I said, "It is not in my hands now, it is in the constable's; I cannot do anything with it"—just before we got to the station, Phipps said, "Will you—now or never?"—I knew both the prisoners—Whichelow was in my employ—I had some goats and chaises—he used to go out with them.</p>

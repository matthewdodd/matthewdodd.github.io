                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at Binfield, in Berkshire. On the evening of 28th May, I was at Greenwich fair between 6 and 7 o'clock—I had a watch in my right waistcoat pocket—the prisoner was standing on my right-hand side—I found a little bit of a tug at the top of my neck, bat not much—I found it out more by the silver guard chain hitting me, to which the watch was fastened—I directly looked down, and saw the guard swinging without the watch—I looked round at the prisoner, and saw the watch between his fingers—the police were there watching, and took him into custody—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the watch, it has my initials on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was standing looking at the show the same as other persons; two young men came up to me and asked me the name of the show; 1 said I did not know, and they went away; I was standing behind the prosecutor, and in about two minutes two constables came and laid hold of me, and said I had robbed the gentleman of his watch; it was picked up at my feet; the gentleman said he did not know who took it <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I swear that I saw the watch in the prisoner's hand, and when the police came up, in the struggle, he dropped it.</p>

On the night in question I was at Greenwich fair, in company with sergeant Newell, and saw the prisoner there, in company with four others—the prisoner was directly in front of the prosecutor, with his elbow up—I saw him leave the prosecutor very suddenly; I followed him, and saw him throw the watch down, so I caught hold of his collar—I took him into custody, and picked up the watch.</p>

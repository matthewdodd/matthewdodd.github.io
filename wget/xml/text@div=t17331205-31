My Handkerchief was ty'd about my Neck in a double Knot, and in getting it off, he had like to have strangled me. I cry'd out, Murder! and said, Fye upon it, what a sad thing it is, for a Man to be robb'd in his native Land ! A Woman came out of a Chandler's-Shop with a Candle, and yet, for all that, the Prisoner kept pulling my Handkerchief, 'till he had got it off, and then he run away. The good Woman, I don't know her Name, took me into a House, and gave me a Farthen's worth of Small-beer. I was afraid to go home, left I should meet the Prisoner again, and so I stay'd in that House all Night - I had never seen the Prisoner before, but I had a full View of him in the Brandy-Shop, and am sure he is the same Man.

            . I had been winding Silk all Day, and went down to a Chandler's Shop in Blue -coat-fields, between 10 and 11 at Night to drink; I had been there but a few Minutes before I heard a Man cry out Murder! Its a sad Thing for a Man to be robb'd in a Christian Land by his own Fellow-natives. I ran out with a Candle, and saw the Prosecutor sitting on the Stones at Brown's Door, and a Man (which I believe was the Prisoner) pulling a Handkerchief off his Neck, and then he ran away. The Prosetor's Nose was cut, and he was very bloody. He ask'd me for a little Water; I told him I'd give him a Farthing's worth of Small-beer, and so I lifted him up, but he sell down again, whether it was owing to Drink, or to the Damage he had suffer'd, I can't say; at last I got him into the Chandler's Shop, and gave him some Small-beer, and ask'd him why he did not get a Dram? He felt in his Pocket, and said he had lost 4s. but hop'd his Note was safe; but searching farther, he said that was gone too; so I left him, and went to bed. The Houses in our Neighbourhood are left out in Tenements to Lodgers; between one and two, Mr. Ovington, the Beadle, and the Watch, came and knock'd at our Street-door; my Husband went down and let 'em in; they said they came to search for some Fellows that had made a Disturbance; they went backwards, and saw the Prisoner getting over the Wall in the Yard into an Alley, and there he was taken.</p>

John, says I, you must go with me to the Watch-house. Go with you, you Black-guard Dog? says he. Do you know who you talk to? I'd have you to know, Sirrah, that I have got Money, and a 5 l. Note in my Pocket. I made no more Words, but took him away. When he was in the Watch-house he pull'd a Paper out of his Fob, and said, See here, you Rascal! you Black-guard Rogue! here's a 5 l. Note! I ask'd him to let me see it in my Hand, but he refus'd, and put it up again.</p>

               <p>Ovington. No; I search'd him only for Arms, for I did not then think the Paper he had shewn me was really such a Note as he said it was. In the Morning the Prosecutor came to see him in the Cage, and said directly, That's the Man! He robb'd me of 4 s. a pair of Garters, a Key, a Handkerchief, and a Note of 5 l. 9 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. One of the Watchmen search'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050019"></xptr> me, and found but a Groat in my Pocket, and that he took away.</p>

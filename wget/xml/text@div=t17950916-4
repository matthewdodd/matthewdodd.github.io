               <p>Q. When did you see the horse last before you missed it? - I see the horse about a quarter after six in the morning, that was the last I see of the horse, when I sent it to the common.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see it on the common? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you send it to the common by? - By a son of mine about nine years old.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your horse again? - On Tuesday evening, between and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was the 24th? - Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see it next? - I see it in a stable, in a place called Hog Island, a place in the parish of Mary-le-bone, near Cumberland-place, at the back of Messrs. Ward and Harpur, the Cowkeeper's.</p>
               <p>Q. By what marks did you know the horse again? Was it altered in appearance? - Yes, the prisoner had cut the mane, and mangled the hair of its tail.</p>
               <p>Q. By what marks did you know your horse? - He is rather vicious in dressing, and he has two of his teeth broke out before, by reason of his biting people; they were broke out before I bought him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any thing of the prisoner? - I took the man on Tuesday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160011"></xptr>myself, with the assistance of another man, whose name is Grissin, he keeps a public house he would have been here to day, but is licence day, and he could not possibly come. When I took him I told him that he must go back with me, for I had a strong suspicion that he stole my horse the night before; he says, I will go any where with you. He then came back with me about a hundred yards, and he began to cry, and said, if I would but forgive him, he would tell me where the horse was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him before you had seen your horse or after? - Before. He informed me where my horse was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise to forgive him? - I told him I wanted to see the horse, very possibly it was not my horse; he says; it is your horse and I know it; but I have cut his mane and tail; and says he. it is in such a place. I took him to Paddington, to a public house, the sign of the King and Queen, and I sent him for a constable, and from thence I sent him down to Marlborough-street; the magistrate then ordered a search warrant, and sent one of the officers along with me, and we went and found the horse according to the description that he had given before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive it is the same horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he first met me on the road, I told him that I had got the horse which I took in my drunkenness, but the horse is very safe; he said, will you go along with me? I said, I will go with you; and we went to the Red Lion, and when we got to the Red Lion he said he would forgive me if he could get the horse; and when he and the constable went in with the search warrant, I stood at the door, and the constable went in to look at the horse, he told me to run away any where from the door, as soon as he had seen and was satisfied it was his horse. He knows I only took the horse in a frolic.</p>
               <p> Court to Prosecutor. Did you say to him that you would forgive him? - No, I did not. I lost a mare about this time twelve month, and I have a strong suspicion that this is the man that took it.</p>
               <p> Prisoner. I have been at home but nine weeks from abroad.</p>

               <p>Q. How was it altered? - The mane and tail had been cut.</p>
               <p>Q. But though the mane and tail was cut, do you think it was or was not the same horse? - I must incline to think it was the same indeed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he know you before? - I believe he had seen me there a night or two before that.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to our house, and I see him pass with the gentleman's horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - On Westburne-green.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it? - On the 24th of August; about half after seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him? - He asked me if there were any of his comrades at our house. I told him no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured horse was it that you see him on? - A bay horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your house a public house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. What is the value of this horse? - About five pounds. I was bid five pounds one shilling for him last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the horse that you found was the same horse that you lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the prosecutor met me on the green he challenged me with the horse, and I told him I would tell him where it was; and when we had walked some distance on the road, he told me if I would tell him where it was he would freely forgive me, and I begged and prayed that he would for it was merely a drunken frolic; I told him that I met the horse on the road. Accordingly we went into the Red Lion, and Mr. Townsend came in and asked me whether he had got me in custody? he said, he had; he said, he hoped he would keep me. As soon as Mr. Townsend was gone from the room, he said, as soon as I have gone in and seen the horse and was satisfied that it was his horse, do you make your escape, and told me to run as fast as I could, and that I might run any where,all he wanted, he said, was to have his horse. I immediately spoke to the man that was with him, and says, that I did not think he would do what he said; the man said, he would be bound for him that he would, and I said, I hoped he would, for I would not wish for it to go to the regiment. We went from there to the King and Queen, in Paddington, and we had some bread and cheese there, and he charged me with the constable there. As to the mane and tail of the horse it was as I found it.</p>

               <p>Q. What corps do you belong to? - The second regiment of the Queen's dragoon guards; part of them lay now at Norwich. The paymaster of the regiment was to be here, but I don't know the reason he is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Princes Square, Shadwell—on the 29th August, I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">John</hi> Goods—about 4 o'clock that morning I was called to go on deck—I saw Keith, the mate, there, and he asked me whose "Wheel" it was—I said it was "Jack's wheel"—Jack is a boy on board—the prisoner was there, and he asked if I was not going to the wheel—I said, "It is not my wheel"—he said, "If you don't go to the wheel I will kick you there?—I said I did not want any kicking, and would go there without—he wanted to fight me, I said I did not want to fight, and went aft—I said; "It looks like as if you will be master of the ship"—as I was walking aft, cutting a piece of tobacco with my knife, I heard somebody behind me, and en turning round saw the prisoner—he said, "Don't show the knife to me, because I am not frightened of it"—I said, "I do not want you to be frightened with my knife, and neither with my fiats"—I put my knife in my sheath, and turned round to go to relieve the wheel; and he commenced striking me on the head with his fists—I turned round, and he stabbed me in the throat with a knife—he stabbed me upwards like that (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>)—I had a thick comforter on, and the knife went through that—my throat bled much—I did not take out my knife—I had no struggle with him, and did not strike him in any way—I went to the captain, and the steward dressed the wound—this occurred about three weeks' sail from land.</p>

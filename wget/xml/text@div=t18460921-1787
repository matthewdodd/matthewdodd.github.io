                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Lower Kent-street, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road. On the 8th of Sept, about half-past one o'clock at night, I was in High-street Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner with three or four men and three or four women—they surrounded me—the prisoner took my bonnet and veil off my head, and ran away with them—I knew none of the parties before—I afterwards found them in Buncham's possession—he had taken the prisoner on my giving an alarm—it was torn from my head, and the ribbon broken, and a little of my hair was torn away with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Another girl took it, and gave it to me; I did not intend to keep it; the young girl said she was very proud to wear a veil, and began pulling her about; they have paid her for it since. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> They came to me three or four times—I refused to take the money, but was afraid at last, or a young man said, if I did not take it, they would be hung for me, and I took it through fear last Friday—nothing was said about my being proud; they merely got round me, and tore my bonnet off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Wentworth—street, and heard a cry of "Police!"—I went down George-yard, and met the prisoner running towards me, with the bonnet and veil under her arm—I stopped her and said, "Where did you get this?"—she was very much exhausted, and said, "It was given me; if you will walk this way you will see"—when I got into Whitechapel I saw the prosecutrix surrounded by four or five very bad characters—it is a very bad neighbourhood.</p>

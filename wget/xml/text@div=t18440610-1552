                  </hi>. I am dresser under Mr. Andrews, a surgeon at the London Hospital. Hatfield was under Mr. Andrews' care—I attended to him—he was brought in early on Sunday morning, the 5th of May—I found a lacerated wound at the back of the scalp, about an inch long—his face was very much swollen, and had a small wound—the laceration on the head might very likely have been produced by a kick—his mouth was full of blood—I afterwards discovered that a small artery had been ruptured—I was called up about an hour after I had been in bed, to stop the hemorrhage—he remained there at least a week, then left, and returned for another week—I think the brain had sustained some injury in consequence of the violence—I think there was con<lb></lb>cussion—we had to rouse him before he could answer the questions I put to him—the lacerated wound was torn, and a portion of it smashed, about one-eighth of an inch wide—a common shoe might possibly make the wound—it was in the hairy part of the head—it was caused by some blunt instrument—it might have been a stone, or a kick with a heavy shoe, or falling against a step, or anything of that sort—I attribute the rupture of the small artery to the wound in the face—that was a much cleaner cut than the one at the back of the head—that might have been done with the fist—the cleanness of the cut was owing to its having caught against the tooth—the man is not well now—it has given him a general shock, and done him a deal of harm—he</p>

                  </hi>. I went to the Grave Maurice on this night—the prisoners were there and a good party—I left the house with M'Nally, and went along down towards the Blind Beggar, and the corner of North-street—Tobin was not in our company then—he was in the public-house at the corner of North-street—we met with the prosecutor—he was lying on the pavement—he never moved—he looked almost dead—he was in a very bad state—M'Nally had not struck or touched him in any way—I stood close by, and had gone with him all along from the public-house—Tobin had gone out of the public-house before us—I cannot say whether he went down the road, or which way he went after he got out—I went home—I live in John-street—M'Nally lives in Queen Ann-street—he and I came out of the public-house together—Tobin went out first—he was a-head of us—he could not have left two or three minutes before us—I saw him go out—M'Nally went out next, and I followed him out—I did not see anybody in a glazed hat when we came up to the prosecutor—M'Nally wore a cap—Tobin had a glazed hat in the public-house—I did not see the man fall—I only saw him on the ground.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you been in the public-house that even<lb></lb>ing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three quarters of an hour—I went somewhere about eleven o'clock—I was in the tap-room—I did not know the prisoners were there till I found them there—I went there to have some beer—Davies, the pot-boy, served me—I and John Barry, and Peter Foy, had three pots of beer—they are not here—they were not friends of mine—they lodged in the same house—one was my bed-fellow—they left before me after drinking the three pots of porter—I staid to listen to a man singing a song—I heard Hatfield complain of being robbed of half-a-crown—M'Nally was there—Tobin was not—I have been slightly acquainted with M'Nally about four months, and lived near him—I afterwards saw Tobin come in and go out again—I saw M'Nally strike Hatfield in the public-house—Mr. Hill, the landlord, spoke to Hatfield and helped to send him home—I saw him leave the tap-room and go out—Tobin had then left—I swear that—he came in afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean to swear Tobin was not in the public-house when Hatfield was spoken to by the landlord, and went out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he was not—Tobin and M'Nally did not follow Hatfield out of the tap-room—Hatfield went out of the house first, and the prisoners afterwards—I did not hear either of them say "We will serve you out"—if it had been said I think I should have heard it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then Tobin came in after Hatfield had left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and M'Nally told him he had been accused of this—I and M'Nally then went out, about two minutes after Tobin—M'Nally never parted from me after we left the public-house, till we found Hatfield lying on the pavement—I did not see Tobin when we got outside the public-house—I did not see Mrs. Rayment when I saw the prosecutor on the ground—there were a good many people on the road—this is the first time I have been called on to give an account of this matter—M'Nally's wife asked me to do so—I heard of his being taken up about the 6th of May—Mrs. M'Nally knew where I lived—she has been to me once, twice, or three times, but I rather declined to come—the week after it happened she asked me to come up—I had constant work, and did not want to come and lose a day's work.</p>

                  </hi>. I cannot say whether Fining was-at my honse that night, because I did not see all their faces; I did not see him there, and do not remember ever seeing him in my life—I am certain the prisoners were together, when I heard one of them say, "We will serve him out"—Tobin had not left the house while Hatfield was there.</p>

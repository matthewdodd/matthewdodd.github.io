               <p>Q. How many poultry had you - A. I believe six or seven, they were entirely enclosed from the sides and the top so as to separate them from the garden; I only know when the poultry were produced at Queen-square, they were mine; my business is in town, I am not often there; they were of the French poland kind, and worth four shillings.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER GOODYEAR. I am a paper-stainer. On the 19th of April I lived in Mr. East's house. On that morning about a quarter past three, it was moon-light, I was alarmed at the barking of a dog, and shortly after the alarm I heard a fowl squall out. I jumped out of bed, opened my window, and looked out. I saw the prisoner standing in Mr. East's garden. I asked him what he was about there; he made no answer. I called the watchman, the watchman came, and took the prisoner with the two fowls they appeared to have been recently killed. I knew the fowls, they were alive the evening before.</p>

I am a sailor belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Merlin</hi> schooner, which was lying off Nicholson's-wharf, London-bridge—I am an Irishman—the prisoner was a common seaman on board that vessel—we were both discharged last Tuesday, and left the ship together about 12 o'clock—I then went to be paid off, and as soon as I had got my money I was shipped again by the captain—he told me to go on board—the prisoner was not shipped again—I went to the Britannia Circus, to see a show—I got on board the ship by 11 o'clock at night—I had my money in my pocket at the Britannia—I went there alone—I had parted with the prisoner about 4 o'clock—when I got on board, I cast off my clothes, and counted my money—I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in a little pocket book which I put into my chest before I went to bed—I was sober—I think the prisoner saw me count my money—he was on board before me—he came on board to sleep, although he was not shipped again—we both slept in the forecastle—I slept on a bed that had been the prisoner's, and when I went to sleep he was walking about the forecastle—the captain called me about 7 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was not there then—I missed my monkey jacket, silk handkerchief, and cap, which I had put on my chest the night before, and my pocket book, containing 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went with Thomas Anderson, another sailor, who has gone to sea, and inquired after the prisoner—we found him in Charles-court, Wellclose-square—he had on my jacket, cap, and silk handkerchief, and I saw my comforter, which I had not missed before, among his old clothes—the policeman has got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the money—I am sure I was sober.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 193). I took the prisoner about half past 9 o'clock on Wednesday morning, Jan. 25th, at Charles-street, Wellclose-square, where some acquaintance of his lives—he was outside, in the court—he had on the jacket, waistcoat, and handkerchief—he said he had only put them on to have a <hi rend="italic">roll</hi> in—he said, going to the station, that he took the purse, which he found lying on the chest, to take care of it, and that there was only 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it, which he would give him, all but 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he had spent, and that the man of the house had got the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the purse—he begged the prosecutor not to charge him—I took him to the Leman-street station, then went back to the house, and inquired for the purse—the woman said she knew nothing about it, and sent a lad to the docks, to her husband—the lad brought back the purse and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the pocket of the jacket which the prisoner had on—he was not sober, he had been drinking very freely.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> We had a glass of grog together; I went down below, and could not sleep; I turned out again; I took the jacket, and put it on; I then saw his purse, and said, "What do you leave the money there for?" and put it into my pocket; a policeman met me, and asked me to give him some drink; I drank a glass of grog, and got tipsy again; two men met me, took me to the station-house, and I gave up the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the men there asked me to stand a drop of brandy; I did so, and spent 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I afterwards gave the purse to the man of the house, with 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it; I was coming on board after breakfast to my shipmate, with the jacket, handker<lb></lb>chief, and money; and on going on board, I met him, and he asked me about it, and went and got a policeman; he has got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I had no intention of stealing it.</p>

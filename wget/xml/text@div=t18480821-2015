                  </hi>. I am bailiff at the County Court, Greenwich. On Wed<lb></lb>nesday, 26th July, I put a man into possession of the prisoner's house, at Plampstead—in consequence of a communication, I went to the house, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon—when I entered the house I saw the prisoner standing at the door—I said I was a bailiff of the County Court, and had a warrant to seize his goods—I produced the warrant to him—he said, "Get out of my house, you d----vagabond; if you don't I will kill you"—he had something concealed behind him, and he made a <hi rend="italic">job</hi> at my eye—it turned out to be a red-hot poker—it burnt my ear, and all my hair off there—he then struck me a violent blow with it at the back of the head, which caused a wound, and a great quantity of blood to flow—Holmes, who was with me, tried to take the poker from him, and he struck Holmes over the hat at the back of the head, which made a large dent in his hat—we at length succeeded in getting the poker from him—I went to a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 93). I accompanied Roscoe, and saw him produce his warrant—the prisoner asked him what he wanted, and immediately struck him twice with the poker, once on the side of the face, and once on the back of the head—the last blow caused a great discharge of blood—I interfered, to take the poker' from him, and he struck me with it, which bruised my hat, and made a lump on my head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Deptford-bridge—Roscoe came to me next morning—I found a scar on the left ear. and at the back of the head a wound about half an inch long—I did not probe it, as he had been to a surgeon before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of a large dairy at Islington, formerly Laycock's. The prisoner was in my employ as book-keeper—it was his duty to keep the books—and after that, his duty to receive the money and hand it over to the cashier, and day by day to square his accounts—I found him de<lb></lb>ficient in his accounts in the early part of last June—I was induced, in conse<lb></lb>quence of the respectability of his friends, and the urgent requests they made me, to pass it over—about a fortnight after that detection he returned to my employment, and took the same place as book-keeper—an alteration was made in the regulations with respect to the money—the prisoner said, to prevent the possibility of his doing wrong, he should always call the cashier to receive money, as he would not even venture to touch it—I replied that it was a very excellent resolution he had formed, and I had no doubt, if he adhered to it, he would be restored to society and respectability, which was my sincere desire—he was in my service on the 9th and 15th of September last—he has never accounted to me for the sum of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as received on the 9th from David Wiseman, or 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 15th of Sep<lb></lb>tember from Evan Lewis—he absconded on the 15th, and I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

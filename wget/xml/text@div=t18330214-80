               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you speak to me first, or I to you? A. I do not exactly recollect; I do not recollect going into the parlour of the public-house, and calling for rum and water, and having a silk umbrella, and telling you to hold it till I got into a coach - I did not go after you and say I would go home with you; I never was in the house before in my life.</p>

            . I live at the house in Whitcomb-street; I remember the prosecutor and prisoner coming that evening - I had never seen them before; it is a house of accommodation - they were tussleing in the passage for some minutes; I went out, and she was trying to persuade him to come in; he was very much intoxicated, and had been down in the mud; she put a shilling into my hand, and said, "This is a friend of mine I have known for fifteen years; he is a respectable man, the father of a family, and I found him in company with two prostitutes" - I took them into the first floor front room, and said "this room will be two shillings;" she said, "We came for nothing criminal" - the prosecutor sat down on a chair, and she asked him to send for some rum; he said, "I have had quite a sufficiency" - she said to me, "I know he has many guineas about him, you had better search him for fear any improper person should come up, and rob him;" I said, "That is a thing we never do" - she said."Then you had better search my pockets, for I must go home to prayers at ten o'clock at night, in the family I live with;" she then took out some pieces of bread, and said he took her to the coach-office and gave her some rum and water, and three shillings; she afterwards came down with a half-sovereign to get some drink - I said, "It is a thing we do not allow, for any lady to go away without the gentleman; and my master said there was 2s. to pay for the room - she then gave me the half-sovereign to go; I went, returned, and gave her the change - I then went up stairs to the adjoining room to where they were, to light the fire for some company, and looked through a crevice in the wainscot; I saw her on the bed, and the old gentleman tumbled down twice - he was partly undressed, and laid his clothes on the floor; he then tumbled on the bed, and complained of being cold, and she said she would get her gown and put over him - I then saw her take two sovereigns out of his pocket, I think his waistcoat pocket- she felt all his pockets; she held the two sovereigns up to the candle, put them into her mouth, and went to bed again; I then went down, and told my master what I had seen - he went up stairs, fastened the door of the room they were in, and sent for an officer; in about ten minutes the prisoner was dressed, and was calling to me to get her some rum to treat me and my master - she said the old gentleman was gone to sleep, and she wanted to go home by the omnibus, to her family; one sovereign was found in her stays, and one in her mouth.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not beg you to take care of his money? A. Yes, and I refused - I saw you take the sovereigns out of his pocket; you had been drinking.</p>

             (Police-constable C 71.) I was sent for, and took the prisoner; I told her she had been robbing the man - she said, "No, I have not;" I said,"What is that in your hand?" she said it was some silver of her own; I said, "Where is the sovereign?" she said,"I have no sovereign;" I was searching her, and a sovereign dropped from her neck; I took her to the station, then went back, and fetched the prosecutor.</p>

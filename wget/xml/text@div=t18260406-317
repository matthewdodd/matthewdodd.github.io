            . My mother, Sarah Dunn, is in partnership with Robert Harcastle. The prisoners had been in their employ seven or eight months; between five and seven o'clock on the evening of the 4th of March, I gave Goodhall the key of the solder cupboard - I then took it away, and said I had not time to lock to it, but in ten minutes after I gave him the key again to go down to the solder cupboard - he went down, with Dade and Hedley - Goodhall was below, and Dade at the top, and Hedley was handing the solder to the counting-house - I stood over the cellar looking at them - I waited for the key; when they had got it all up, I said, "Is it all up?" they said,"Yes;" I then hung up the key and went to my tea - on my return I found all the men waiting, except those three - I went after them, and found them still in the cellar - I jumped down, then Dade ran from them and I called him, but he would not come - I called Goodhall to give me a light, and I held it to Dade, and said, "Is that you?" I took him into the counting-house - he said "It is my first offence;" I said, "You have been found guilty before, but forgiven;" I sent Goodhall for an officer - he was gone some time, and in the mean time the officer came; they were taken to the watch-house - I was present when they were searched; this new sucker was found on Dade, which I believe to be my mother's - and here are seven wall-books, which I cannot swear to - but we had articles of this description; here is half of a sucker, which was found on Goodhall; this solder was found on Dade, under his coat, when I went into the cellar - it is of the same description as that they handed out of the cellar - these four pieces were secreted away, and found the following morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you know of their being in the cellar? A. Not till I came down; it was necessary to clean the cellar - they went down to get coals and coke up; I found these two bars of solder on Dade - they fit our mould exactly - we make them ourselves; others may have moulds of the same shape; Hedley had the making of the suckers - it should have been hanging up - he ought to have shown it to me, but he had not; it fits the mould on which he was working.</p>
               <p>Prisoner DADE. Q. Will you say the solder was secreted? A. It was carried across his arm.</p>

            . These two men were in our employ - I was in the counting-house when they came up - the witness brought Dade in to me, and said,"I have found out the thieves;" I began to remonstrate with him; he at first said he was going to bring it up stairs, and then he said, he hoped I would forgive him - he said he would make me any amends - I found these other pieces of solder hid upon some old wood where we deposit Coke.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by hid? A. They were in a place where they had no business to be - there was nothing on them; I stood on tip too - the candle glanced on them; Dade said he was going to bring up the solder - Goodhall was not present; it is the custom to keep a certain quantity in the counting house; Dads did not say he had been told to bring that up to the counting-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060119"></xptr>house - what he said was, that he was going to bring it up stairs.</p>
               <p>COURT to JOHN DUNN. You mentioned that these men were gone into the cellar to fetch coals and coke - but is that usual? A. No; the labourers should do it, but they will do as they like - they do fetch them sometimes; they had the coal basket in their hands.</p>

               <p>GOODHALL'S Defence. This solder I was ordered to get up: I returned the keys, and in the course of the evening Mr. Dunn told us to go and get coals and coke up; when I had delivered the keys to Mr. Dunn, he came running down, and went up to Dade, and said, "What have you got?" he said, "Two bars of metal to take up stais;" he called to me to get the candle, which I did - and when I came up he told me to go and get a constable, which I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you on foot or on horseback? - A. On foot, I met the three prisoners at the bar between the three and four mile stone; one of them passed me first, the second came to me, presented a pistol, and demanded my money; I lifted up my stick to strike him, and it was taken from me immediately by one of them, I cannot say which; I then ran a little way, and the prisoners pursued me; upon one of them saying, shoot, I stopped immediately, and the three prisoners came up, each with a pistol, and demanded my money.</p>
               <p>Q. What size were the pistols; - A. They appeared to me to be pocket pistols; I begged of them not to use me ill, and I would give it them; I gave them 5s.; they asked me if that was all, and I said, no, I had another sixpence, and they gave me a shilling back again, and took my watch from me; when I had got a little further towards Town, I met some countrymen, and I asked them to pursue, we pursued them immediately, but did not find them till near two hours after; at last we found them exactly facing the gibbet, about a mile further from Town than where I was robbed; we took them to a public-house, and searched them; I saw my watch found upon them, and I saw two pistols taken from them.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of light was it? - A. It was after dark, but the moon was rising; I saw their faces very clearly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about the men at all? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you recollect, before any of them came up, hearing any conversation about the father or mother? - A. I think I heard one of them say, I wonder what my father would say to this; I understood it so.</p>
               <p>Q. They returned you one shilling out of your five shillings and sixpence? - A. They returned me one shilling, and did not take the sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know upon which of them the watch was found? - A. No; I was in the room when it was taken from him, but it was not taken from him by me.</p>

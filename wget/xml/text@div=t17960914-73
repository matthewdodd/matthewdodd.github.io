               <p>I am a pawnbroker, at No. 1, Crown-street; about the hour of one o'clock, on Saturday the 2d of July, the last witness came into my shop, and asked if I had lost a cloak; I said, I did not know I had; he said, two women had taken a cloak; I bid him go after them, and bring them back, I sent my boy after them he brought them back; and when they came into the shop, the cloak was dropped under foot; this is the cloak, it has my mark upon it, I am positive to the mark, it is the sale mark.</p>
               <p>Williams's defence. I was in the public-house, I had been to market, I am innocent of it; I never was in the shop till the man brought me there, I am as innocent as the child unborn; I know the soldier owes me a spite, and would swear my life away, because he could not kidnap my husband.</p>
               <p>Aldridge's defence. The soldier ran after this woman that I never saw before in my life; I was walking and he stopped me, and he searched me all over to my very knees; he brought me to the shop, the shop was full; he took up a cloak, and said I dropped it. I am as innocent of the cloak as the child unborn.</p>

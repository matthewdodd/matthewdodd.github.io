My house was safe on the night of the 29th of March, and the cellars quite secure - the next morning, which was Sunday, I went to draw some ale - I saw the cellar broken open; the boards had been broken exactly where the bolts were, and they had put their arm in and drawn the bolts back; I can swear that I missed about ten gallons from different casks, of cloves, peppermint, shrub, rum, and gin - some ale, onions, casks, and stone bottles - one bottle had a little shrub in it, one a little ale, and one was empty; I sent off to Barnet for an officer, and we both examined the premises; a person called on me, and I went with my ostler, cooper, to the field, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; I found five men drinking in the field, four of whom I knew - the prisoners were three of them; they were drinking ale out of a stonebottle - they all drank in their turns - it was such a bottle as I had lost; Franklin was sitting on one of the casks which I knew - I ordered my ostler to take three of the casks up, and Gray said, "Master took it out;" I said they were my casks - they said if they were mine I might take them; Franklin said they found them in the hedge - I got on the coach to go to Barnet, leaving them with one bottle, pouring ale out; Cooper took the casks to my house - I got two officers, went to South Mims, and found Gray in a chandler's-shop; we went to a cottage near where they had been drinking and found Franklin - my ostler and I then got on a coach, and took Hemmings about a mile on this side of St. Alban's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This breaking open of your cellar took place on the night of the 29th of March? A. Yes; or early on the following morning; I went to bed about eleven o'clock, and was the last person up - the cellar is in the garden - it is not under the same roof as the house - there is a side door from the kitchen into it; it was open day-light when these men were sitting drinking - Gray asked me to pour some out for them - they were all pretty far gone; two or three of them seemed as if they were able to understand me; I believe the prisoners<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090143"></xptr>were so tipsy that they did not know what they were about; there is a footpath near the place where they were, but they are bye fields - I went back to the spot where they had been, and brought away the other bottle; there was nothing to prevent our taking them - but I did not know I might without an officer.</p>

                  </hi> I am a clock and watch-maker, at Brill-row, Somers-town. On 30th April I was in Bagnigge Wells-road, with Miss Greenfield, a few minutes after twelve o'clock at night—I was not sober, and was taken by the police to the station—as they dragged me along, I saw my watch-chain hanging round my neck—a young woman spoke to me, and I</p>

                  </hi> I was with the last witness on this Sunday night, a few minutes past twelve o'clock—he was tips—I do not think he knew what he was about—I was by his side—one policeman came up, and then two more—a policeman took him—my brother came to meet me, as I am not often one so late—the prisoner came up—I knew him before—he asked my brother what was the matter—he told him—he said, "—I do not see why one man should not be locked up as well as another"—I told him not to say what was the matter—he said he ought not to be locked up, went up to Mr. Reickle, behind him, and put his arms round him to take from the policeman—one policeman was on each side of him—the prisoner them got a short distance off, and ran away—I had asked Reickle the time at twelve—he took the watch out, and put it into his waistcoat pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> I am brother of the last witness. I went into Bagnigge Wells-road about twelve o'clock that night, and saw Reickle in charge of the policeman, tipsy—my sister was about five yards from him—the prisoner, who I knew by sight, came up in three or four minutes, and asked me what was the matter—I said a friend of mine was in trouble—he said he did not see why one man should not be locked up as well as another—my sister said to the prisoner, "But he knows nothing about it"—the prisoner went into the mob, and in a few minutes went behind Reickle, who was between two policeman, put his hand under his arm to his waistcat-pocket, gave a snatch, then walked away a few yards, put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, then to his mouth, and then ran away—I was almost in front of Reickle and the policemen—I told the policemen that the prisoner was gone—in a minute or two I saw Reickle's watch was gone—the guard was hanging by itself about his waistcoat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You said nothing about it for some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said to the policemen. "Good God! some man must have taken his watch"—that was before I saw the chain hanging without the watch—I did not try to get him away—I did place my hand on him and speak to the policemen—there was a great mob—I did not see where the prisoner came from.</p>

               <p>round his neck, and went into his pocket—that was after I had seen him in the mob—I spoke to the policeman afterwards—there was not much mob round the policemen then—I was persuading Reickle to go away, and Connelt took him from me, and kept him till another policeman came on the other side of him—the prisoner walked behind him, put his hand under his right arm, made a jerk, and ran away round Exmouth-street—nobody touched Reickle but the two policemen and the prisoner—in about two minutes his guard was hanging loose about his neck—the ends were loose and out of his pocket—I told the policemen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

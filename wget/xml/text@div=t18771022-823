                  </hi>. I am second clerk at Southwark police-court—on 10th September I was present at the hearing of this summons (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—it is against William Timmings for unlawfully causing the steam barge Swift to be navigated without having a licensed man on board—the defendant appeared and called the present defendant as a witness on his behalf—he was sworn, and I produce my notes of his evidence. (<hi rend="italic">These being read, stated that the defendant swore that he was on board the barge Swift during her passage up the Thames on 22nd August</hi>, 1877; <hi rend="italic">that he was not navigating the said barge, but was on board the barge Willey, which was being towed by the Swift, and that Benjamin Elliott, the complainant, never came near him or spoke to him on that day.</hi>) The question about Blackfriars Bridge was repeated several times by the Magistrate in my hearing, but the prisoner adhered to his statement that Elliott never came near.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Before the prisoner was examined the Magistrate made some observation about his apparent state—I noticed that his manner in the witness-box was peculiar, as if he had been drinking—I cannot say that the Magistrate was somewhat—exacting in his manner of putting questions—his strangeness did not diminish under the Magistrate's questions, but I cannot say that it increased under them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed waterman and lighterman, of Duke Street, Stamford Street—on Wednesday, August 22nd, I was in a skiff near Cherry Garden pier, and saw the steam barge Swift, belonging to William Timmings, going up the river towards London Bridge, towing the barge Willey with a line—they passed quite close to me, within afew feet, and I saw the prisoner on board the steam barge steering with the wheel—William Timmings, the owner, was also on board, and the engine-driver was at the door of the engine-room—I knew the prisoner and his brother well up and down the river, and knew that William Tim<lb></lb>mings</p>

               <p>was a licensed waterman, but that the prisoner was unlicensed—in consequence of that I hailed the prisoner but he would not tab notice—he turned his face and spoke to the engine-driver—I could not hear what he said, but the engine-driver went in, and by the difference of the steam from the funnel and the speed she went at I conclude that he put on more steam—I rowed up as close as I could to him and asked him to give me a turn with my headfast, but it was only momentary, for the steam barge dashed by, and I was only rowing a small boat—they steamed away and I followed—they pulled up just before they got to Blackfriars Bridge, and I overtook them—they moored the Willey along<lb></lb>side a barge of coal to have some coal put into her, and I rowed along<lb></lb>side the Swift—the prisoner was still on board, and I said to him "Are you aware you are breaking the law, Mr. Timmings, and he said "Get out of it, you scamp, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to be rowing about preventing honest men from earning their living"—I said that he, a non-freeman, was robbing us of our rights and privileges—he made use of a beastly expression and abused me—I said if he used such language I should summons him—he used another expression and told me to go and see his brother, I should find him at the Old Barge House public-house—I afterwards summoned William Timmings, as under the bye-law the owner of the barge is liable, and it came on for hearing on the 12th September at the police-court, and the prisoner was called as a witness for his brother—I have heard read to-day the evidence which he then gave, and it is correct—prisoner was greatly excited, and I believe he had been drinking.</p>

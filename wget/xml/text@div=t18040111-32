             sworn. - I am a mantua-maker, in Sandford-lane: On Tuesday evening, the 12th of December, about eight o'clock, the prisoner brought me ten yards of cotton, and asked me if I could make a gown and coat that week; I said I was busy, but if she particularly wanted it, I would do it; she said, it was not for her, but a young woman, and if I fitted her, it would fit the young woman, who was the same size; she came on Saturday, and asked if it was done; I said, yes; she said, she would take the petticoat, and leave the gown till Monday, and I did not see her again; the piece found there was part of the ten yards she brought.

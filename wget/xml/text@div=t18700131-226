                  </hi>. I am housekeeper, in the employ of Messrs. Yeo &amp; Warner, solicitors, Hart Street, Bloomsbury—on 3rd January I went to bed, about 10 o'clock, after having fastened up the house, and seen all secure</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187001310057"></xptr>
               <p>—we slept in the basement—my wife aroused me, and I heard a scraping noise at the bedroom window—I got out of bed, and put on my trowsers, when I heard the sash of the window shoved up—I went across the room, god got up in the corner, where I could look between the curtains—I saw the prisoner, apparently listening—he jumped on to the window sill, on the opposite side of the window to where I was—the chiffonier was close to the window—I saw his arm come round the curtain, and take something off—I made a grab at him; but the curtain baffled me—he dropped the article he had got, and ran away—I jumped through the window into the area, after him, and caught him as he was climbing up the pipe, to get hold of the iron railings—I hung on to his legs till I exhausted his strength—he gave me two or three kicks; but ultimately I got him down—I sung out for a policeman, and held him till one arrived, about fifteen minutes after<lb></lb>wards, and gave him in custody—there were marks on the window sash—something had been inserted between the bars—I found this clock on the floor, by the window; it had been taken from the chiffonier.</p>

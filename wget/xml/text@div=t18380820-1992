                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of information I went with a man named Clements to the East Vault Office, London Docks, on the 14th of August—the prisoner was employed in that office as a clerk—I asked Clements to examine the prisoner's desk—it is a large desk which extends from one side of the box to the other—I should think it is about eight feet—there are others sit there besides him—there is a small cupboard under his desk from the ground up to the desk—the prisoner un<lb></lb>locked the door of the cupboard—I searched it all round, and I found a small bag, but nothing of consequence—I perceived that the inside of the cup<lb></lb>board did not extend so high as the outside-by pulling a drawer out in the desk, he could get to the top of this cupboard-while the drawer was closed I could not see any opening—I pulled the drawer out entirely, and saw a board which appeared to have been recently planed—I pulled up that board, put my hand in, and found three bottles containing two pints of brandy, and one pint of wine—I examined the cupboard well—there was no means of getting to the place where I found the bottles without opening the drawer—the desk does not open—it was by pulling the drawer out, I got to the top of the cupboard, and the prisoner unlocked the drawer—I asked whether he could give any account of these bottles—he said he knew nothing of them, nor yet of the place—he had been in the employment of the Docks a long time—he came there when quite a lad.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you the first officer em<lb></lb>ployed, or was Mr. Hogg? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no knowledge of any one but my<lb></lb>self</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200187"></xptr>
               <p>and Clements—I had a letter from Mr. Edwards, but I have not got it present—I believe it is in the hands of the solicitor—I have seen a paper called the "Town"—I believe I have seen the number of the 18th of august—I do not doubt that I have—I see most of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this letter in it—(<hi rend="italic">handing the paper to the witness</hi>)-did you sea that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I received the letter signed Edwards before I saw this paper or heard of it—I received the letter on Friday, the 10th of August—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—this is the letter I received then—I know Mr. lames Edwards—he is here in Court—he is foreman to Lady Carman—I believe he has other names besides Edwards—I believe his names are Edwards Andrew Pearson—it was in consequence of this letter that I made my inquiries and my searches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you learn from James Edwards that the prisoner had written a letter to the "Town" about the clerks in the office, and that he would give him a turn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—I know Betts—I cannot say whether he is an acquaintance of Pearson's—I know Groom—I cannot say whether he is an acquaintance of Betts's.</p>

                  </hi>. I was present at the finding of these bottels—the prisoner said he knew nothing about them, and did not know even of the existence of the place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you searched him first on the Monday evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and found nothing on him—I had searched the seat before that evening, but did not find the secret place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an extra clerk in the East Vault Office, London Docks—I was present when Dix found the bottles of wine and brandy over a drawer in the prisoner's desk—the prisoner kept the key of the drawer—I have noticed that the prisoner has been in the habit of locking his drawer latterly when he went out and taking the key with him—the key was on a bunch of keys—I saw the bottles found—this is one of them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a bottle</hi>)—I have seen this bottle before at the office in the prisoner's possession—it was then empty—I saw it a fortnight or three weeks before, in the prisoner's cupboard I think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had he been in the London Dock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—he has been in our place about ten months—I have known him in the Docks about two years—he and I were on very good terms as clerks sitting together—I could not help feeling sorry when the officers made this discovery—I was a good deal surprised—there have not been any irregularities in the Docks to my knowledge—the prisoner is rather given to writing lampoons, and it seems according to the "Town," that he has been writing them against his friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any means of knowing that he has written lampoons against his friends and against yourself, except from the "Town?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> yes—I saw him writing a paper I think on, the Saturday week previous to its appearing in the "Town"-at least he was writing it on the Thursday and Friday, and I suppose it was sent on the Saturday—there was only the prisoner and I sat on that side of the desk, and on the other side Mr. Treble and Mr. Patrick sat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As you saw he was writing on the Thursday and Friday, did you suspect he was going to send a lampoon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—we sat so close that it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200188"></xptr>
               <p>was impossible for one to write without the other seeing him—I happened to catch a glimpse of the word "Town," and having seen the paper called the "Town," that arrested my attention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you <hi rend="italic">crib</hi> the draft of it from under his portfolio? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—he wrote it and kept a copy of it—that is the fact—it began as this letter does—Mr. Rundle is foreman of the vault, and I am casting clerk-when I <hi rend="italic">cribbed</hi> this letter, I showed it to Mr. Mitchel, a superior officer, but to no one else—I have not had it since—I do not know Edwards—I know Pearson—he is a common man—I had some conversation with him about the letter-everybody in the Docks knew it—I do not know how soon after an officer was desired to be in attendance to see if he could find any thing on a gentleman wearing grey breeches—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>.)I saw this at the police-office—I cannot say whether Pearson wrote it—it is dis<lb></lb>guised—I think some of the letters are very like his writing—it is a long time since I saw his writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There is a secret bottom to this drawer or top to the cupboard, how long has it been there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I have known it there two years, ever since I have been there—that may be a nice place to put a bottle in, to get a man into a scrape, that writes in the <hi rend="italic">Town</hi>—I do not know whether Pearson knew of that place, or whether the superior officer did—I never told them of it—I mentioned it at the Thames police, and to the constables—I do not know of any other secret place—I have not got one.</p>

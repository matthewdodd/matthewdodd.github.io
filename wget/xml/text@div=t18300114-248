On the 8th of January the prisoner came there and asked for a job - I said we had none; I saw him go away with my shovel under his arm - I did not go after him, as the watchman said if I did I should not get in again till twelve o'clock, and I should lose half a day: I afterwards found him at work with my shovel - this is it; I know it by three notches on the handle, and the iron being turned up.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. The prosecutor told me the prisoner had his shovel, and I took him with it - he said he bought it in the street, and gave 2s. 9d. for it; he then said he gave 3s. for it.</p>

            . The prisoner lodged with me. This shovel came into my house bran new six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>MOSES WATERS. I cannot swear to this shovel, but six weeks ago last Thursday, I bought one at the corner of Parliament-street, for 2s. 8d. - it had no mark on it; I sold it to the prisoner for the same price - he gave me 3s., and I gave him 3d., which was all I had; I believe this to be it.</p>
               <p>JOHN BERRY. The prisoner came to the place for work, and I saw him go out with his hands in his pockets - he had no shovel.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go in the chaise with a gentleman, or did you walk on foot with the prosecutor? - A. We went on foot about three quarters of a mile towards London; we met a gentleman in a onehorse chaise; we asked him if he had met with two soldiers on the road with sticks; he said he had, and offered to turn his horse round and go in pursuit after them; I told him, if it was agreeable, I would go in the chaise with him, and he agreed to it; we came up with the prisoners at Bayswater-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. What had they in their hands at the time you came up with them? - A.They had two sticks,(produces them); I laid hold of one of them, and the gentleman in the chaise laid hold of the other.</p>

No; we took them to the public-house at Bayswater, and searched them; I found upon Grister a purse, containing three shillings, and a lady's locket, in his waistcoat pocket, I also found a handkerchief and a knife, (produces them); upon the other prisoner I found a pocket-book, with a ring, and some duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find any gold? - A. No, only three shillings in the purse; the prosecutor afterwards came into the house, and said, those were the two men that had robbed him, and the shortest was the man who had taken his purse from him; he had described the men and the sticks before we went after them.</p>

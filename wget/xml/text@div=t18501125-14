                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to George Batty and anothor, export oilmen, of Leadenhall-street and Finsbury-pavement. The prisoner was their porter—no goods were sold retail in the ware-house in which he was employed—on 13th Nov. 1 was told something, and next day, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw a bag under the counter, at the extreme corner of the warehouse, with a dirty shirt over it—I opened it—it contained about 3lbs. of pepper—I saw it there again, at five minutes past five.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, in Messrs. Batty's service. On 14th Nov. I saw the prisoner go into the top warehouse, between eight and nine o'clock—in two or three minutes he came down, with a parcel under his apron—he put it under the counter on the second-floor, brought out an old shirt, and said he had lost that shirt three weeks, and had just found it, and he supposed it fell out of his hat, which be kept undcr the counter in that corner—I never knew he had lost a shirt—soon afterwards he was sent out of the warehouse, and I told Hook way, who is over me—he examined the corner in my presence, but I did not see what he found—the prisoner returned to the warehouse at five o'clock, when we went to tea—he stopped in the corner, and wrapped the parcel up in the shirt—I had not examined it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Messrs.

                  </hi>. I worked in the same room as the prisoner. On 14th Nov. the prisoner came down from the upper ✗floor, where the spices are kept, to our floor—he had something behind the lappet of his coat—he placed it in a corner under the counter where he was at work—it was a linen bag—he pulled a shirt out, and said, "I have found a shirt which has been lost for some time"—he rolled it up, and put it back—at tea-time I saw him take it, wrap it in the shirt, and go down the yard.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>,151) On the evening of 14th Nov. I went to Messrs. Batty's, and afterwards to the prisoner's lodging, 5, Gunpowder-alley, Crutched-friars, about a quarter-past five o'clock—I told him I wanted that 3lbs. of black pepper which he had a few minutes previously brought away from Messrs. Batty's—he said, "I brought away no pepper, all I brought away was this," producing an old. ragged shirt,</p>

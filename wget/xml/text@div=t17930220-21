               <p>Court.

            ; I could not find the waiter; I found he was gone in search of the coachman, I asked Mr. Careless if he could describe the coach, coachman and horses; I went down to Charing Cross to look for the coach, and coachman, from which place I understood Mr. Careless had taken the coach, I made an enquiry among the watermen, and the coachmen who were on the stand, and gave them such a description as Mr. Careless had given me; I offered a guinea reward, I might be about ten minutes making this enquiry, I went up to the Golding Cross, Charing Cross, supposing I might get some intelligence there; coming down from the gateway, I met a man with an apron on, this man told me he believed he could inform me where the coachman was, in consequence of which I endeavoured to find out the person; I found him at the bottom of the gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe the man as Mr. Careless had described him to you? - I described him to that man, and the trunk also; accordingly I met with this man that is at the bar at the bottom of the gateway, near to Charing Cross, I asked him if he had brought a fare from Covent Garden? he said, no, he had just come from the city with a fare, and there is the money for my fare, and shewed me eightteen-pence, I told him I had got some idea he had got the property of a gentleman at my house; on looking into the boot of the coach, his coach was standing at the bottom of the gateway, rather to the left of the gateway, he had just set down his fare; looking into the boot, I saw the end of the trunk which answered the description which Mr. Careless had given of it; with that I told the coachman I believed that was the property of a gentleman at my house, I put my hand on the trunk and ordered him to take it out of the boot and put it into the coach, the man very readily assisted me in doing so, I believe he put it in for me; I then ordered him to drive me to the New Hummums which he did; as soon as I arrived there I called the waiter to aquaint Mr. Careless with what I had done, that I had brought his trunk Mr. Careless came to the door to the coachman, and he said it was his trunk, I then ordered one of my waiters to go to Bow-street, and get one of these people from Bow-street to take him to Sir Sampson Wright, and he did so; I went with him, the coachman and Mr. Careless.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it between the time that Mr. Careless came into your house, to the time you went to the Golden Cross, Charing Cross? - It might be near an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Mr. Harrison what did the prisoner say, when Mr. Careless saw his trunk again? - He did not say any thing then; at Charing Cross when I interrogated him about taking the trunk away, he gave for answer that he had brought it from the Black Lion, Water-lane Fleet-street, and that he should have taken it back to the New Hummums as soon as he had an opportunity; there was a direction on the trunk, Mr. Careless's name, directed to my house; when he got to my house I think he repeated it, that he intended to bring it back as soon as he had an opportunity.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200040"></xptr>Q. Did you see any body get out of his coach at Charing Cross? - I did not, but I had some reason to believe that he had set down a fare, because he shewed me the 18 d. for the fare he had brought from the city.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other reason except seeing the 18 d. in his hand? - He had it in his hand as if he had just set down his fare.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether it is an 18 d. or a 1 s. fare from your house to Charing Cross? - It is only a shilling fare.</p>
               <p>Court to Careless. Did you give a shilling or eighteen-pence? - The waiter paid one shilling, I told him to pay.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel to Mr. Harrison. When you took the coach at Charing Cross you got into the coach, and he drove you to Covent-garden? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with stealing at that time? - Yes, I believe I did; I told him that it was Mr. Careless's property, that he had taken it away either intentionally or by a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time he told you that he meant to carry it to the new Hummums? - To the best of my recollection he did.</p>

               <p>I was waiter this 23d of January at the new Hummums when Mr. Careless came there, between the hours of three and four; I went to the door and opened the coach door; I took out a little dressing case; I told the coachman to bring out the trunk; I went in doors with Mr. Careless, I cannot positively say whether the coachman made any answer; I went in doors with Mr. Careless and went up stairs to shew him a room, and when I came down again to see for the trunk, the coachman was gone, on which I made enquiry; I thought the man had gone without his fare, but I found he had been paid by one of the other waiters. That waiter is not here.</p>
               <p>Jury. What answer did the coachman make when you told him to bring in the trunk? - I don't immediately recollect he made me any answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he heard you? - He stood close by my elbow.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you attend at Sir Sampson Wright's office? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you depose there? - I believe I deposed he answered yes; I said, I believed he answered yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the 23d of January I got down from Spring Garden gate, and took that gentleman, Mr. Careless, up; he ordered me to pull up to the Golden Cross, Charing Cross, I did s; he then ordered me to the New Hummums, Covent-garden; in going to the New Hummums my near side keeping rein broke, just about the end of Southampton-street; in consequence of that I did not think it proper to stop to mend my keeping reins there, but as soon as I got to the New Hummums the prosecutor got out, he ordered the porter or waiter, I don't know which, to take the luggage out of the coach; I then went to put my keeping reins to rights to mend them; in a few minutes after the waiter came out and says, coachman what is your fare? I told him a shilling, he paid me a shilling; I then continued, I suppose, five minutes at the same door, mending my keeping reins; after I was paid I walks on gently to Catharine-street, and I found the rank full there, and I goes to the Temple, and I put in second coach at the Temple, and I was not there above three or four minutes before a man calls, Coach, I follows him to take up at the Black Lion, Water-lane, Fleet-street, he ordered me to turn round, I turned the coach about, and pulls up to the inn; when the man had opened the coach door the gentleman was ready with his luggage,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200041"></xptr>he said, coachman that trunk does not belong to me. The gentleman that I carried said so; he had luggage to take up himself; I told him no, I supposed it was the trunk that belonged to a gentleman that I had set down at the Hummums, that the porter had omitted taking out; in consequence of that he ordered me to drive him to the Golden Cross, Charing Cross; I drove him to the Golden Cross, Charing Cross; and as I was setting him down this Mr. Harrison, that gentleman there, was making enquiry.</p>
               <p>Court. At the time the gentleman said it was not his? - I put it openly on the foot board, because it should not be mixed with his things. I meant to return it when I had set down my fare.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him an excellent character.</p>

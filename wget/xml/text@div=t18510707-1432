                  </hi>. I live in Regent-street, and manage a warehouse for my brother, John William Phillips, and another; the prisoner was, their porter. On Wednesday, 18th June, about half-past 5 o'clock, I observed the till-drawer in the counting-house—there was gold and silver and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note in it—I looked at the till again about 9, and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—note was gone—I saw the prisoner in the shop between 7 and 8; he was wait<lb></lb>ing for parcels—he would have to go in the counting-house for paper, and string for parcels—I counted the gold at night, but did not miss any.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband keeps the White Horse, Burlington-street. On Thursday, 19th June, the prisoner brought me this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, and asked me to change it for Mr. Phillips.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I had not heard of the loss of the note—Mr. Phillips came, soon after—he asked if I had changed a note, and I told him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, C</hi> 146). I took the prisoner at 198, Regent-street. I asked him what money he had about him—he took from his pocket two sovereigns and four half-sovereigns—on the way to the station, he said he was very sorry, but he picked it up in the room.</p>

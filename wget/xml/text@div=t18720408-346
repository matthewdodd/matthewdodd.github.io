                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). The cheque was drawn by Joseph Ord on the Central Bank, Bermondsey Branch—he opened his account with that cheque—I told him that of course I must see that the cheque was duly honoured before he could draw any cash against it, and I also declined to have his account until I had investigated the <hi rend="italic">bond fides</hi> of the three bills he had left with me—I never assented to his drawing against the bills—he proposed that, if I approved of the bills, would I advance him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the credit of his account on the security of the bills—as he was leaving, he said, "I suppose you will allow me to have a cheque-book"—I said "Yes," but he was to understand that he was not to draw until he heard from me whether the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was placed to his credit on the bills—I believed the cheque was good, and I allowed him to open an account and have the cheque-book, believing the statements he made to me about his introduction to our late managing director—I sent a messenger on to the Central Bank, not to wait for its going through the Clearing House, in order to anticipate him if I could—the messenger brought back the cheque, marked "Effects not cleared"—we presented the cheque again next day, and it was returned again unpaid—I then desired a clerk to write to the prisoner on the 15th, returning the cheque and stating that it had been dishonoured—this is the letter—this cheque for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was presented the next morning—I don't recollect whether it was before or after the letter was sent—the cheque was brought in to me to know if it was to be honoured, and I said "Certainly not"—I was sur<lb></lb>prised at its being presented, and returned it to the person who presented it—I don't know who the person was—I understood afterwards that other cheques came in, but of course they were not paid—I then wrote a letter myself to the prisoner, of which this is a copy. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th Feb<lb></lb>ruary, and expressed surprise at the cheques having been presented, as the pri<lb></lb>soner had been informed that the cheque paid in had been dishonoured, and dated that the bank declined any business with him.</hi>) The prisoner never had a penny to his credit at the bank—these are the three bills—we have had possession of them—the drawer of one of them is Joseph Ord, and another is drawn by Patten—we have had sundry notices not to part with the bills—we have not discounted them; I would not have the man's account at any price—I can't say much about this cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 19th February, because I only saw the first one, which was brought into my room—the pri<lb></lb>soner had not 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the bank at that time—this cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I believe was one of those presented, but there was nothing to meet it—when the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was dishonoured I had nothing more to do with the man—this cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., of 20th February, drawn in favour of Ord, is out of the same book.</p>

               <p>think there could be any mistake about it—the cheque was sent with the letter saying that it was dishonoured—he left the cheque and three bills on the first day I saw him—it was understood that if I approved of the bills after three or four days, I was to credit him with 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we always take three days to make inquiries—we did make inquiries—he was not to draw at all until we communicated the fact to him that I could place 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to his credit—I did not write till the 24th February, because he presented the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque the next day—he was not to draw anything until he had autho<lb></lb>rity—I believe the cheque was sent back on 15th February—there were cheques presented dated previous to the 24th February—I don't know whether there were any dated after—I am not able to say—I don't remem<lb></lb>ber receiving a letter from the prisoner dated 15th February, or the 17th—I don't know whether there was a letter or not—if it did come, it was to the effect that he would call on a certain day—our letter of the 24th was certainly not written in answer to a letter from the prisoner—when the clerk came and said "There is another cheque from Mason, sir; what shall we do?" I said "I must stop this," and I wrote—I don't recollect any cor<lb></lb>respondence from the prisoner—if we did receive a letter from him, we produce it—letters are opened before I arrive at the office in the morning—as far as I know, that is the only letter that I saw of the prisoner's—he never called after I wrote to him on the 24th—I wish he had.</p>

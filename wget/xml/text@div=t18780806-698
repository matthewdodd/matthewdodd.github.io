The Magistrate said what Hall said of you and the glasses, was not sufficient evidence unless supported by another party—as I took Hall to the cell at Bow Street, where you were with several other men, you said to Hall "Did ever I give you any glasses?"—Hall said "Yes"—you said "When?"—Hall said "The morning after Irving's benefit"—Hall told me you took them to his room for him to pledge.</p>

I do not know it"—I said "It is in Lambeth, and near, St Thomas's Hospital"—Smith gave his address "Henry Smith, 137, Gate Street, Mile End Road"—there is no such place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoners Statements before the Magistrate.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hall's Defence</hi>. My conduct has been straightforward. I never denied my name to the detective. Another name has been hinted, my father's. When I pawned these glasses, I was known to live close by. Mr. Archbutt knows me. I only put "Harry" instead of "Charles" in a moment of thoughtlessness. Ten days elapsed after I pawned them before I was taken into custody, so that I had every opportunity to assume another name, but I apprehended no danger. Smith has always known and addressed me as Charles Hall. I have never been in prison, or convicted before. I have suffered three weeks' remand, and I hope you will give me the benefit of any doubt.</p>

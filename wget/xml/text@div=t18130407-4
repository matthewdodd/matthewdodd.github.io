               <p>Q. Had you been drinking - A. I had. I was not so intoxicated but what I knew what I was doing. I was going through Whitecross-street. I went into a cook-shop, and had something to eat. After I came out of the cook's-shop, I had not been gone many yards before two men came up to me, one put his hand to my breeches pocket. I turned round, and seized him by the collar. They came up to me behind. I turned round, and caught hold of him by the collar. The same moment my hat was take off. The person that took it off my head ran away from me, and ran down a court.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose - A. My hat. I had nothing in my pocket. The prisoner was the man that put his hand to my pocket. I am quite certain of it. I never let him go until the watchman came up and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after you laid hold of him - A. I called the watch; the watch came and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man - A. I do'nt know; he took away my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say you were walking along and the prisoner came behind you; he did not meet you - A. No, he did not. He came up towards me from behind. I felt his hand in my pocket, and turned round and seized him by the collar, and at that instant my hat was taken off, just as I turned round, and seized the man my hat was taken off and ran away with. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were not you very much intoxicated - A. I certainly was intoxicated. but not so but what I knew what I was doing. I saw the man run away with my hat, and I called the watch.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I know nothing further than I was called by Highfield to his assistance. As soon as possible I could get down Highfield had hold of the prisoner by the collar. I took him out of his hands, and took him to the watchhouse in Bunhill-row.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not the prosecutor very much intoxicated, and could not give charge of me at the time - A. He was not so much intoxicated. He gave charge to me at the time.

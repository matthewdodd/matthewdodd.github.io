            . I live in Radnor-street, in the same house. I occupy the back room on the second floor- on the evening of the robbery, the prisoner came up to my room between eight and nine o'clock, and asked me to give him a light; it was Tuesday evening - I gave him a light, and he soon afterwards left the house; I heard him go down stairs in a hurry, and he left the house - on the Wednesday morning Flook gave me information and I afterwards met the prisoner accidentally in Bunhill-row (on the Tuesday week), and asked what he had done with Flook's things - he said he had pawned them - I neither threatened nor made him any promise; I told him I had heard Flook say he would not care provided he could get his duplicates or his property - he said he had pawned them; he did not say where, but he gave me the duplicates, and I gave them to Flook.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not know I was going to take them before I did it? A. Certainly not; or I should have stopped him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told you an hour and a half before; you were on the stairs, and held the light, and was to answer the door if there was a knock Witness. It is false, I was at my work in my own room - if I had known it I should have stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell me if I gave back the tickets, my mother would get them out? A. I had heard her say if she could get the duplicates she would not care.</p>

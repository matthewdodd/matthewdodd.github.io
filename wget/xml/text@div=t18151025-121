            . I am a turner, in Mount-street, Grosvenor square. On the 21st of August; the prisoner brought some washing tubs, and a pounds worth of silver to me, for which I returned him a one pound note, and never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, declaring he lost the note, and arguing upon that circumstance; that if he had a fraudulent intention, he would have absconded in the first instance; with the washing tubs and the silver.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

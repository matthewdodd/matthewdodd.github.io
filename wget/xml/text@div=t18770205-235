                  </hi>. I live in Ferndale Road, Brixton, and have been a congregational minister, but am now the proprietor and editor of the "Christian Union," whose offices are in Salisbury Court, Fleet Street-in consequence of communications received from advertisers in December last, I went to the offices of the "Christian Herald "in Doctor's Commons and saw the prisoner's wife first, but afterwards found the prisoner in the offices on the ground floor writing his name upon some circulars like the one pro<lb></lb>duced—I asked if Mr. Bradlaugh was in—he said "I am he"—I took a bundle of twenty-three or twenty-five circulars and left the office—his name was written on the one produced; there were 200 or 300 altogether; I have read it and have tried to find out the real author of <hi rend="italic">it</hi>—I attended at the police-court; Mr. George Lewis appeared for the prisoner—I do not know who employs the prisoner in the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I applied to the Soldier's Home at Alder-shot, in July, 1875, for an advertisement, by letter—I afterwards went there, not to induce the lady president to advertise; she did advertise, she paid fourteen guineas—I cannot say if we had authority to insert an advertisement for St. Luke's, Bethnal Green, Medical Missionary Society, or for the Soldiers' Daughters' Home—the circulation of my paper varied, but it was about 1,000 weekly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have made no other representation for the purpose of getting advertisements than is contained in the paper produced—the object of my visit to Aldershot was an article written in my paper—the payment made was for the advertisement alone—the article appeared first—the ad<lb></lb>vertisement occupied two or three pages and was inserted in three consecu<lb></lb>tive weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of Wilcox and Gibbs' Sewing Machine Company, 150, Cheapside—I received this circular marked "Private &amp; Confidential"—"The Christian Union," of November 10th, contained our advertisement—when the defendant was under remand I received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated December 21st</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">and asked Mr. Powers to inform the prisoners' solicitors what was the sum paid for an advertisement in "The Christian Union" and stated "Had you known that the actual number printed was only</hi> 1,000, <hi rend="italic">would you have advertised in such a medium</hi>? * * * <hi rend="italic">My case is adjourned till December 29th, at Bow Street." The circular was dated</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">rd November</hi>, 1876, and stated "If Mr. Kirkby, editor and proprietor of "The Christian Union," has, in com<lb></lb>municating with you about your advertisement, used any language in writing such as that his paper is a 'valuable medium,' or has a 'large circulation,' you can prosecute him in a police-court for obtaining money under false pretences.")</p>

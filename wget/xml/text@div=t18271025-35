On the 22d of September, about half-past ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came into the shop as a customer; she stood near the window in which there were some handkerchiefs; in consequence of what a customer said, I looked and missed some handkerchiefs; she held her apron up, as if something was in it - I said"You have taken some handkerchiefs from the window;" she did not reply, but threw part of them behind her - I came from behind the counter to speak to her - I took up some handkerchiefs, and on missing a pink one, I said,"You have taken more;" she directly threw that one down, and a waistcoat, which I had not missed; it was in the same window - I put them there about four o'clock, and believe I had been out since that; she begged of me not to send for an officer, and while the boy was gone for one, she ran out of the shop - I found her in custody in two or three minutes.</p>

            . I am beadle. A boy fetched me - I met the prisoner running towards me, and took her about eighty yards from the shop - I asked what could possess her to do such a thing; she said, "Oh Sir, I did not mean to do it;" she said she went in with a young man to pawn a handkerchief, and picked them up on the floor.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WILCOX FAIRLAM. I saw a young man who went out of the shop, give her a black handkerchief; she might have picked them off the floor, but they could not have fallen out of the window, because they were in a glass-case.</p>

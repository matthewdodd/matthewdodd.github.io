                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). In consequence of in<lb></lb>formation I watched the premises of Leach and Co., Newcastle Street, Farringdon Street on 16th September, about 11.30 a.m., and saw Goddard take a cartload of type to the prosecutor's other shop in Lincoln's Inn Fields—he then took the empty cart to the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi> office, from where he took a number of electrotype plates—this is one of the largest, and this one of the smallest (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he then drove to Shore<lb></lb>ditch Church, where he left the boy who was with him, and went to 6, Margaret Place, Bethnal Green, a private house; there is nothing on the door to indicate a business—he got there about 1 o'clock—he drove direct to the door, went in for a few minutes, and came out and carried in the plates a few at a time—I left Inspector Wells at the top of the turning, and as I was entering the door I met Goddard, and pushed him back into the house, and said in Faden's hearing "I am a police<lb></lb>officer, where is that type?" he made no reply, but Faden said "It is the first I have bought"—I said "Where is it?"—she pointed across the room, the door of which was open, and said "There it is by the window; I have just taken it off the scale"—I Said "Is that all he has brought that I see lying there?" she said "Yes"—I said "Are you the proprietress of the place?" she said "Yes"—I said "Have you a husband?" she said "Yes, but he is out"—I said "When do you expect him in?" she said "I cannot tell how long he will be, but I expect him in soon"—I asked Goddard "Have you any instructions to bring the type here?" he laid "No"—I asked to whom it belonged; he said "To Leach and Co."—Faden then said "I have not paid for it yet, I was going to borrow the money of a neighbour to pay for it: I was going to give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a cwt"—I said "How much does it weigh?" she said "2cwt. 3qrs. less a few pounds"—they were both taken to the station with the plates—I then went back and searched the house, and found three half pecks of dross in the yard, which was strewn with tin: a melting pot was on the other side of the yard—the parlour had tin shavings all over the floor, and there were tin shavings in other rooms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I only took away the stereotype plates—I do not think I asked Faden how much they weighed; I will not swear I did not—I waited till her husband came home; his wife was then in the house—he told me later on that he was in the habit of clearing out tin factories and selling tin scraps—she appeared rather stout, as if near her confinement—I did not lock her husband up; he was there when the charge was read over—I found about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Goddard, but nothing relating to the charge.</p>

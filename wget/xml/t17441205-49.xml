               <p>Q. What! was he above you?</p>
               <p>Harper. Yes, a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any dealings with him?</p>
               <p>Harper. Yes, about eleven weeks ago we got in one night seven watches, three gold ones, three silver ones, and a Pinchbeck: we got one in Charter-house-lane, one in Aldersgate-street, two in King-street, another in Fenchurch-street, and that man got his arm cut. - We sold these watches to Turbutt the Prisoner the next day, we went to him in the morning, and he bid us thirty-two guineas for the seven; we thought it was too little, so we went to three Jews in Duke's-place (I don't know their names) and they would give us three pounds an ounce for the gold, but they would not give us any thing for the work; so we went back again to the Prisoner, because thirty-two guineas were better than thirty pounds.

             (one who is not taken yet) and it was divided in Cross-lane in Holborn; we divided three guineas apiece among ten of us, and the rest of the money was spent at the Horse and Groom in Crosslane.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he gave you a good price; do you think he knew how you came by them?</p>
               <p>Harper. He knew what we were, and how we came by them; for he went a picking of pockets with me two years ago: when he paid us for the watches, he said we were very hard with him, and ought to give him a bottle of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you appeared like gentlemen?</p>
               <p>Harper. We appeared as we could; sometimes we had a shirt, and sometimes ne'er an one.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you dressed then?</p>
               <p>Harper. Some were dressed clean, and some were in a ragged dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any difference between a Sunday, and a working-day?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050045"></xptr>Harper. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any other time sell him any more?</p>
               <p>Harper. The Sunday following we sold him six watches more, four silver ones, a gold one, and a Pinchbeck; we sold them for twelve guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a good week; how much money had you left out of this?</p>
               <p>Harper. Perhaps never a peny the next morning. Some had money left, and some had none; and may be never a shirt - we used to play with one another; and if we lost, those that won would not give the losers a drop of gin to save their lives, unless they liked them very well. There was a sword among these watches, and the Prisoner said, as he gave us twelve guineas for the watches, we must give him the sword; but I think at last he gave us two shillings, or half a crown for the sword: he said he would wear that himself - There were all ten of us present at the selling this parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask one another's leave who should take the money?</p>
               <p>Harper. We did not use to rob one another in this way; we used to sink upon one another sometimes; that is, wrong one another privately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never bought a watch of them in my life, and never concerned myself with any of them. I know them no otherwise, than by their going by my door.</p>
               <p>Harper. I have known him four years, and used to go with him picking pockets privately in the streets, and at the playhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a watch stolen on Bartholomew day?</p>
               <p>Harper. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that sold for?</p>
               <p>Harper. It was sold for twenty-eight shillings?</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that sold to?</p>
               <p>Harper to the Prisoner - The watch we took from Mr. Underwood we sold to the Prisoner, on the 28th of August.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I keep a house in Sharp's-alley by Cowcross, and pay seven pounds ten shillings a year, and deal in horses. I go to Smithfield every Friday, and work as hard as any young fellow in England. I have a stable in Sharp's-alley that holds two horses - I have had but two or three lately.</p>

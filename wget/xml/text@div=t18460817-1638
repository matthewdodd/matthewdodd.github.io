                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. John Kelp, of South-street, Grosvenor-square. I was employed in King-street, St. James's—the prisoner was employed there as a plumber—he had to line a cistern—I found the suc<lb></lb>tion-pipe of a pump in the cistern—I marked it, and left it there—I found the pump from which it had been cut—at seven o'clock next morning the prisoner came to work—I watched him—he did not see me—he went into the cistern to work—I asked if his labourer had come—he said no—I went on to the balcony of the next house, and saw him take the lead from the cistern, and put it into his bag—at about five minutes to eight I said, "Has your labourer come?"—he said, "No,"rind went away—I followed him, over-took him, and found four pieces of lead in his pocket—it was the lead I had marked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Francis Place and another, tailors, at Charing-cross. About half-past seven o'clock on Saturday morning, the 11th of June, the prisoner and another man came into my master's shop—the prisoner's friend asked me for a pair of straps—I served him—he asked me to put them on his trowsers, which I did—while that was doing the prisoner walked up and down the shop—he had a macintosh on his arm—they offered a sixpence to pay for the straps—I had not got change—I told them to call as they came back—in five minutes they came and tendered a fourpenny-piece—I gave them 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out—the other then asked to look at some light summer waistcoat-pieces—I took twelve pieces out of the box, and laid them on the counter—he did not like my of them, but took another piece out of the box, took it over to another counter, and looked at it—he asked me the price—I said I could not tell—I went to the back of the shop to ring for my master—I returned—I had some suspicion, and looked the prisoner hard in the face—he walked out, I followed him, and when he got two or three feet from the door, I took him and asked what he had got under his Macintosh—I lifted it up and found this piece of quilted satin and this piece of figured silk—they are my master's, and had been in the shop that morning, and are worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he only wanted to look at them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman N</hi> 237). On the morning of 3rd October, about 1.15, I was at the corner of Canonbury Street, near a church, and saw Ross standing near a seat there lighting his pipe, a few yards from 239, Essex Road, and not far from Quadrant Road—I asked what he was doing, and he [said he was doing nothing, only getting a light—I asked if he had seen another man there just before—he said "No"—I told him he had better get away—he said he was going home, and he went down the Essex Road towards Quadrant Road.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Foster's Defence</hi>. I should like to explain how I came into possession of these tools. About 12.30 I was at the Angel public-house, and met two men, a description of whom I gave to the inspector. They asked if I was out of work. I said "Yes." They said "We will put a job in your way; carry these down to the Essex Road, where there is a seat Be there at 2.30, and if we are not there place them behind the wall and we shall find them" I went, and finding they were not there, I walked along Quadrant Road and met Gentry. He said "What are you doing here?" I said "I have to meet two men. He said "You look cold." I said "Yes, where is there a coffee-stall?" He struck me on the head, and broke his truncheon over my head with a second blow. I said "You cowardly rascal, to hit a man like that behind his back," and I hit him with my fist The jemmy was in my pocket. Another constable came up and knocked me about, and I was</p>

The tools were in a handkerchief, and I did not know what they were till, finding the men did not come, I looked in the handkerchief and found them.</p>

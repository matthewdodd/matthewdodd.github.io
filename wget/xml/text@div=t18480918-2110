                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Joseph Holding, a gardener, at Bromley. William Payne is in his service, and the prisoner also. On 22nd May they were at work together—Payne was picking out celery—I believe he was stooping—I saw the prisoner hit him over the head with a rake, and he fell to the ground, and I and Pitman picked him up—he was bleeding from the head, and kicking, as though in convulsions—the prisoner walked away.</p>

On 22nd May, we began to work at five o'clock in the morning, and soon after I saw Holes hit Payne at the side of the head with his hand—I was about forty or fifty yards off, so that I could not hear the conversation—a few minutes after I heard a blow struck with a rake—I looked up and saw Payne down, and the prisoner threw the rake out of his hand—I immediately went towards Payne, and met Holden in the path, and said, "What have you been doing to the boy, now?"—he stood back for a moment and said he was not hurt—I helped to carry him to the doctor's—the prisoner walked away as soon as he had struck him—there was a great deal of blood running from a hole in the boy's head and a great deal on the ground.</p>

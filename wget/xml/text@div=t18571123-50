                  </hi>. I live at No. 75, Westbourne Park Villas, and am a Magistrate.

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police sergeant, D</hi> 16). On a Friday morning, about the 6th Nov., the day after Sankey arrived in London in custody, I was told that he wished to see me in his cell at Marylebone police station—I went to him, and he said, "Sergeant Potter, I believe you are engaged in this case?"—I said, "I am"—he said, "I wish to tell the truth"—I said, "What have you to say?"—he said, "I find I have been entirely deceived by a man of the name of White, and two men whom White introduced to me as his friends; and them first two men took me home drunk, and I fell asleep, and they robbed the house; after they had taken me home, they went out to get more drink, and I believe they let others in; when they awoke up in the morning, I found the house had been completely ransacked; the articles which were found on me were left in the dining room; and those things I put into the portmanteau and intended to take to the station, and report the case, but being afraid the case would be put on my shoulders, and being distracted in my mind, I took the woman, and went off with the things, instead of taking them to the station"—I did not take that down in writing—this was about an hour and a half or two hours before I went to the police court—last Thursday week, at a quarter before two o'clock, I went to Earl Street, Seven Dials, to the attic, with two officers—I knocked at the front room door, received no answer, and broke it open—we went in, and found Burnett and Mills in bed together—I said, "Have you got any jewellery or property here which does not belong to you?"—they both said they had none, and Mills jumped out of bed—I said, "Are you sure you have no watch or jewellery here—she said, "No; we have no watches and no jewellery"—I thought she took something quickly from a table that was standing by the bed—I said, "What have you there?"—she said, "Nothing but money" I said, "Let me look?" and took from her hand this red purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), containing seven sovereigns and some silver—I asked her whose it was—she said her's, and that she had had it for years—I said, "What have you in the other hand?"—she said, "Nothing"—I took hold of her hand, and found a lady's gold watch—I asked her whose it was—she said, "Mine"—I searched, and found two pillow cases, two or three towels, and some napkins—I left sergeant Pierce and Joy there, and searched the landlady's room, where I found a quantity of sheets—on the next day I made a further search in Burnett's room, and, on removing a cupboard which was standing on a shelf, I found twenty-six skeleton and latch keys, and large door keys of all descriptions; a centre bit, and two picklocks—I told them that I took them on a charge of robbery in Great Portland Street—Burnett said, "I do not know Sankey"—Sankey's name had not been mentioned then—I said, "Why do you mention Sankey; no one here has mentioned his name?"—he made no reply—Sankey was in custody at that time, and committed for trial—this was last Thursday week, and he was committed on the Friday—there had been a report, and the prisoner Sankey had given me the names of <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>—Burnett is the one whom he described as <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>—I know White—he was taken into custody before Sankey was apprehended, and remanded—he has since absconded.</p>

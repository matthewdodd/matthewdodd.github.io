                  </hi> I am a carriage-manufacturer, in Finsbury-pavement. The prisoner was my trimmer for six years—these articles were produced to me by Harvey—I believe them all to be mine—this narrow broad lace was made fro a carriage going to Bombay—here is some more of the same pattern, but of a different colour—I swear to this calico—this silk is for carriage win<lb></lb>dows.</p>

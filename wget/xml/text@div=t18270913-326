On the 23d of July I directed an officer to watch my premises; Dixon was taken into custody, and in about an hour and a half Barry was taken; I never gave Dixon leave to take or give away any sack of soot from my premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You say you never gave Dixon leave to take away any soot? A. No, not by any means; he had been in the habit of conveying some from one of my premises to another for three months - but I had given him orders not to take any on the 23d of July. Barry was not in the habit of buying soot of me; I never knew of his having any soot till the 23d of July.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Dixon never had any authority to let Barry have any? A. No, and he never received any of mine; Dixon had been employed by me to take it for me from Queen's-court to Coleman-street.</p>

            . I am a sweep, in the employ of Mr. Badger. I know the two prisoners - I have seen Barry at my master's cellar, and Dixon told me if I saw my master I was to say, "Master, do you want Jack?"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How much did you get? A. We had part of one sack between us; Dixon was in my master's service - I knew Barry before Dixon came; he used to come to another man who was there. I have been there three years - I first thought of telling my master of this on Sunday, when I came home from school. I do not know when they took it rightly - they had been at it about six weeks; I had no share of it till the last; Dixon told me he would beat me if I told; master did not say he knew all about it, and he would beat me if I did not tell him; I had a share of it.</p>

            . I am fellow-apprentice with the last witness. Barry never was in my master's employ - on Saturday, the 21st of July, I saw the prisoners in the cellar; Dixon filled a sack, and Barry took it away; then he came back with the sack empty; Dixon filled it again, and he took it away again - he came back in the afternoon about three o'clock, and then took another sack; he told me to cut the lumps down, and put the lightest of the soot in; Dixon gave me and Tuff 1s. between us - they promised us 1s. out of every three sacks.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you remember Barry coming there before Dixon was there? A. Yes, and Tuff knew it too; my master never lost any soot before Dixon came, to my knowledge. I did not tell my master of it till the Sunday, when we came from school, because they said they would beat us - we had only 1s.; Savage came and told our master, and then he asked us if we knew any thing of the robbery.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor set me to watch on the 23d of July - I saw Dixon come out of the cellar about eleven o'clock, with a sack on his back; I asked where he was going - he said to Green-court; Barry was out in London-wall, about one hundred yards from Mr. Badger's - they walked on to Quaker-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the other two little sweeps there? A. They were in the cellar - if they have said that Dixon and Barry were in the cellar, they have said what was not true.</p>

               <p>DIXON's Defence. My master told me to go to the cellar and turn the soot over, which I did. I then asked if I should go to Green-court to take some soot, and he said Yes: I had taken one sack on my back to go there, and the officer came up and took me.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Watson</hi>. When I got to the gate, Starr was in the house. I begged you not to go in and take him. I will take my oath you never caught him against the gate at all; the landlord shut the door. When I got up he had gone in, and the door was shut. I followed Stevens to the station, and when I got to the Hornsey-road, you asked me what I wanted following you. I said, "Nothing." You met a gentleman on horseback, stopped him, and told him about it. Starr would have gone home if they had let him have his clothes, but they would not. They took me in custody. I asked what it was for. They said it was because I had been asking them to let Starr go. I only put my hand on your shoulder to ask you to let me take Starr home. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. You asked me quietly to let you take Starr home, but that was after Forster had given him in custody—you did not ask in a violent manner—I could not do so because he had been given in custody—you said no more then, but you both followed us—I am sure you got me by the collar—I first saw you after getting Starr out of the beer-shop—you were quite sober—I told you several times to let go of my collar in Hooper-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of Andover-road, Holloway—on 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> December, about 11 o'clock, I was in Hornsey-road, and saw the prisoners wrestling with the police and assaulting them—I saw Barnes fall on the ground, with his back on the kerb—he was thrown down—I cannot tell by whom—I saw some one on him, but it was dark, and I could not see who it was—that person was doing nothing, but I saw them get up again, and then I saw that Barnes was very much hurt—I did not see him bleeding—the prisoners were calling on the mob to rescue them, and brickbats and stones were thrown.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Highgate—on the night of 9th December, I was sent for to the station, and saw Barnes—two ribs in his right side were fractured; a third I was not certain about—the sternum was injured, though there was no abrasion of the skin, and he</p>

               <p>complained of great pain there and in the broken ribs—he did not complain of his head or back—he was not bleeding—I had him sent to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Examined by the Court</hi>). <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did either of the prisoners do anything to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they only tried to get away—I assisted Sergeant Foster to hold Stevens—I was kicked and fell down, we fell altogether—some of the mob kicked me; not the prisoners, but they tried to get away <hi rend="italic">Stevens. Q.</hi> You did not see me kick Foster or strike him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I saw no blows on either side.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Stevens's Defence</hi>. I was drunk in the Hornsey-road when I was taken by Foster; there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in the street and Foster ordered us along; I did not go exactly to please him and he took me in custody. I rather hung back and he threw me on the ground and knelt on me, put his knuckles in my throat and called on Mr. Hoare to assist him; he took me part of the way to the station and gave me in charge of another policeman—I never kicked a policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Watson's Defence</hi>. Starr and another man had a fight at the Volun<lb></lb>teer, and the landlord called the police to get them out; they took the first man out and he went away: they put Starr out and told him to go home; he said that he would if they would let him go back to get his clothes; Sergeant Foster took him, and then said that he struck him on the mouth, but I did not see it. I asked the policemen to let me take him but they would not; a brick caught Barnes in the side and he was knocked down. When I got to Hooper-street I begged them not to take him; he said if he did not take him at night he would take him in the morning. I told the patrol that I had been in a good deal of trouble trying to get them to let me take him home; they took me and Starr out of bed at two or three o'clock on Sunday morning. I can take my oath I never touched him.</p>

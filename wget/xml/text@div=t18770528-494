                  </hi>. I reside at Atherleigh House, Lansdown Road, Twickenham—on 19th August I answered an advertisement in a newspaper,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187705280022"></xptr>
               <p>and on 22nd August received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Auction and Estate Agency Offices, 488, New Oxford Street, London, August. 21st, 1876. E. T. Edgington &amp; Co. Established 1860. Dear Sir,—If you will call upon me at your convenience I will give you particulars of the partnership adver<lb></lb>tisement, if not settled, but I cannot go into details without a personal in<lb></lb>terview Yours truly, Edward F. Edgington.") On 28th August, in consequence of this letter, I went to 488, Oxford Street, and saw Edgington—he said the party he advertised for, a Mr. Barker, of 22, Bloomsbury Square, had found a partner, but he knew of another gentleman who required a partner in the same business at 13a, Red Lion Square, who was a first-class man of business, and that if we could come to terms I should be perfectly satisfied, and that he would recommend the business as a first-class one—no terms were mentioned then, but an appointment was made for the next day to meet Atkinson—I went the next day and was introduced to Atkinson as the party who had written to Edgington about the partnership, and Edging<lb></lb>ton asked what he wanted—Atkinson said 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a half share of the business, the profits of which were from 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and even might come to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum for each partner; and that the profits had been equal to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for each—Edgington then said that Atkinson had always done some agency business for him which amounted to about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, and that he would still continue to give him that portion of his business, so that I might look for a participation in that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum from Edgington's busi<lb></lb>ness—those sums represented the profits of the business, so Edgington said, and Atkinson acquiesced in the statement—Atkinson said the best time for business was in the months of September, October, and November, and that it was desirable to come to a conclusion at once, or we might lose some valu<lb></lb>able opportunities—it was arranged that I was to pay 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash and give an I O U for the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance which was to be paid by quarterly instalments of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the profits of the business, which I was told I should have no difficulty in doing out of my share of the profits—a deposit was required of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave Edgington 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I had not 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me, and I gave an I O U for the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance—an arrangement was made to complete on the 31st—I went on that day to 488, Oxford Street—both prisoners were present—I handed over to Edgington some Bank of England notes which I received from the London and Westminster Bank, Lothbury, in exchange for a cheque from Severs &amp; Thomas—I then signed the agreement of partnership—I parted with my money in consequence of the representations that were made to me by the prisoners of the business they had done, were doing, and likely to do—on the 29th I had asked Atkinson to let me see the books—he said that he had been out so much and for want of office assistance ho had been unable to keep up the books, and that they would not show the business done—I afterwards called at 13a, Red Lion Square, and Atkinson showed me a book called "Public Houses;" that is the only book I saw—I entered on my duties as partner on the 1st September, 1876, and continued in daily attendance up to November 16th, when there was a writ of ejectment, and Atkinson removed the few articles of furniture there were, and on arriving there in the morn<lb></lb>ing I found a man in possession—the furniture consisted of a few chairs and a long stuffed seat—some days afterwards I saw Atkinson at Edgington's office apparently transacting Edgington's business—I did not introduce a Mr. Henderson—Atkinson came to the business place three, four, or five times a week; he only stayed a short time, perhaps half an hour—the only business I knew of was a house apparently sold, the White Horse, Holland</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187705280023"></xptr>
               <p>Street, Blackfriars, by a Mr. Brown, who was put into a beer-house in White<lb></lb>chapel—I did not see any money paid by Brown—I received from Atkinson 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—the fourteen documents produced were delivered by post or by hand, they were found on the premises. (<hi rend="italic">These were claims for rates and summonses, and papers relating to legal proceedings</hi>.) I then consulted a solicitor and went to Bow Street and got a warrant—Atkinson was brought up on the 7th and Edgington on 28th April—I have not since entertained any proposal to compromise the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not say this morning I received 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said I received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. up to the 16th November, because I was asked up to that date; I have given the whole amount—many entries in the order-book to view are in my handwriting, as many as five in one day, and seven in another—I quite understood I was only to be paid upon sales effected—I went with Atkinson, to the Ship, the Sun, and the Old Fountain Tavern, about the sale of those houses—he had received instructions previously—I cannot tell you what was said—I went to other houses which I cannot name now—the order-book may contain 250 orders—they are not numbered—Atkinson having received my money was to pay office expenses—he paid 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the expenses were to be apportioned between us; I do not know that the advertisements are not genuine—Atkinson did not tell me I was unfitted for the work—I remember seeing requests to sell come by post—I did not go to see about the houses—I cannot give the average of people who called on business—some called to complain that the house they went to view was not for sale—one case was as to the White Horse, North Street, Fitzroy Square—complaints were mode that the houses had been sold to other parties and they had had their journey for nothing—a man might employ two brokers to sell his house, and one might not be aware of the sale by the other, but I do not know it as a fact—I could not surmise what my commission might have been—I did hot know Atkinson had gone to Edgington's office till I found him there; I urged him continually to carry out his engagement with me—I wrote Atkinson this letter: "On Friday last, when I saw you you said you should procure a partner for the purpose of paying me out, and that you would at once let me know what progress you had made, but I have never heard a word from you"—Atkinson complained of the badness of trade, but I replied that other people were doing business—there are about a dozen entries in the "Register of Public Houses" for sale, while I was there; there are no dates—the prices are marked—they were not sold—I do not think Atkinson tried to get business; I did—he paid for the advertisements with my money, and what he called looking after the business ended with his coming home intoxicated—I issued the orders to view the Red Lion, Shoe Lane, the Ship, Gray's Inn, and the Devonshire Arms—I have seen a Mr. Pinner, and a Mr. Josephs-Atkinson told me the firm was instructed to find a partner for one of those men—Josephs never denied it, Atkinson never told me that he made no profit unless he found a purchaser—I did not go to Duncan Terrace, and tell Mrs. Atkinson,. she had better remove the furniture—Atkinson said he was not liable for the rent when I spoke to him about a distraint coming in a few days after I was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. There were no sales except that of Mr. Brown's house—the orders to view were given to anyone who applied in answer to the advertisements—beyond Atkinson's statements and the case of Brown, I do not know of any actual business done from September to November—</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 28, Millman Street, Guildford Street December I saw an advertisement in the "Daily Telegraph" in reference to a partnership, in consequence of which I went to 488, New Oxford street—I there saw Atkinson and then Edgington, who drew up a memo<lb></lb>randum and submitted it to me I afterwards received this letter of 21st December, 1876, signed by Edgington: "If you are prepared to carry out the proposed arrangement, please call on Mr. Edgington between 3 and 4 or 7 and 10 to-morrow, Friday. Yours truly, Edgington &amp; Co."(Thomas Galpin. This letter is in Atkinson's writing.) On the 8th December I received from Edgington this letter: "Please give me another call at your earliest convenience. I will keep any written appointment not before 5 p.m.—I afterwards called; Atkinson's name was not mentioned, but I saw Atkinson at his own house after I received this letter from him of January 23rd, 1877, from 9, Duncan Terrace, Islington: "I am informed by Mr. Edgington of 488, Oxford Street, that you are desirous of investing money in a partnership. I shall be pleased to see you if you will make an appointment"—a proposal was then made to me by Atkinson of a partner<lb></lb>ship in a public-house business for which I was to pay 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; no place was mentioned, but I was to have an equal share—I was to pay 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down at once for the purpose of relieving him of his present partner, who, he said, was too old a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> and quite useless in the business—he said the profits were very fair, but no sum was mentioned—on the 6th February I received this letter from Atkinson: "Dear Sir,—I shall be pleased to know your decision as regards the proposed partnership, as I am desirous of at once settling my arrangements"—I did not see him after that letter—he had told me the best time for business was February and March, on account of gentlemen's servants coming to town who had received money in the holidays in the country and wished to invest it in public houses—I did not part with any money—Atkinson is the same person I saw at Duncan Terrace and at 488, Oxford Street—he explained that he was a confidential clerk who had a knowledge of the value of the public houses.</p>

I know Edgington by sight—I had a warrant, dated 10th April, for his apprehension, and took him into custody in Bloomsbury on the 22nd April—I found several papers at his house, amongst which was a filled-up ohequejon the Birkbeck Bank, and a receipt for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., given by a Mr. Clarkson to Edgington in January, 1877, also seven pawn tickets—I found on him a dozen letters addressed to X. Y. Z., at a house in Bloomsbury Square, in reference to apartments—I also found this newspaper report of-his appearance in a police-court, and this letter written to the editor of a newspaper, and a notice from a Mr. Verrall putting an end to his connection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not inquire when I first had the warrant, at the house in Bloomsbury Square, but I have since ascertained that he lived there—he was in furnished apartments.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, carrying on business at 26, Budgo Row, City—I have had many years experience in the sale and transfer of public-houses, in fact since I was admitted in 1862—I have known Atkinson, three or four years in his business as a public-house broker and valuer; I employed him to sell the Ship public-house for l,850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at 5 per cent, commission—I come here voluntarily having seen the account in the newspapers of this case—last season was the worst ever known for his business—I have looked at the advertisements in this book—if a fair amount of sales took place a handsome commission would be realised—I have never known anything against his character.</p>

He does not move in the same circle as I do—I have not inquired into the transactions of the prisoners, I have been travelling about a good deal in Africa and other places—I do not know a Mrs. Watson—a client of mine bought the Ship of Atkinson—he lived there two and a half years, and then wanted to sell it—the purchase-money has not yet been paid, and there is a law suit about it.</p>

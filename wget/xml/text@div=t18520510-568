On 17th April, the male prisoner came there about 12 o'clock in the day, put three shillings on the counter, and asked me if I would give him a half a crown and a sixpence for them—I saw that the middle one was counterfeit, and gave it to Mr. King, who sent for a constable, and he was taken into custody—the constable brought in the female prisoner—I then heard a shilling drop, which the policeman picked up, and I gave him the shilling which Mr. King had given back to me.</p>

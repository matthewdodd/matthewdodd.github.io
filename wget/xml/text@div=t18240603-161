I had a basket in my cart on the 24th of April, with a calve's head and loin of veal in it - it was near the middle of the cart, which only opens in front - the tilt cannot be lifted up. I stopped at the Old White-horse-cellar to deliver some goods; I was in the cart, and gave them out - another man took them of me - the basket was safe then; when I got to <placeName id="t18240603-161-crimeloc857">Fleet-market</placeName>

I had seen it in the Strand, near Temple-bar, and did not miss it till I got to Fleet-market.

            . I am a watchman. On the 24th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030056"></xptr>of April I was in Lower Charles-street, Clerken well, at half-past five o'clock in the morning, I was going to shut the box to go off duty and saw the prisoner with a basket on his shoulder, and two other men following him - one had a long blue coat on, and the other a smock frock; I thought it was not all right, and followed them to Vine-yard-street. I then asked the prisoner what he had got - he said he had got beef - I asked where he was going to take it - he said to Newington-green, and had brought it from Newgate-market; he did not know the person's name, but a person whom he knew had given it to him. I detained him - I looked at the basket, and saw a bit of card tied to it, which had been a direction torn off; it had a calve's head, a loin of veal, and two pigs' cheeks in it, and at the bottom was a letter, directed</p>

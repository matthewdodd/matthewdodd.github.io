               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was there anything strange in his looking at you - A. I thought he was looking at my bundle - it was very dark, and I thought he seemed to follow me - the street was lighted with gas. I never saw him before, but I knew him again by the light when he took my bundle, and I saw him running nearly to the end of Well-street with it. My fright was so great I cannot say whether I saw his face for a minute or less.</p>

            . I am a porter. I was in Bartholomew-close, about two hundred yards from Jewin-street, about nine o'clock, and heard a cry of Stop thief! - turned round, saw the prisoner running very fast, and stopped him. The people came up; I asked if he had done any thing, but could not hear that he had. I brought him down to Jewin-street, and let him go; and in a quarter of an hour after, as I was passing Cripplegate watch-house, I heard a man was in custody, went in, and found it was him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did you see him before you let him go - A. About five minutes - I caught him under a lamp.</p>

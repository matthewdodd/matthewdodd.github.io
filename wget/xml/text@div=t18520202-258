                  </hi>. I am a silk printer, of West Ham. On 14th Jan., about two o'clock, I received information—I ran through my shop into my back garden—as I passed through my shop, I noticed my till was drawn out, and was left about half open—I went through my garden into a field called Lady's-well field, and there saw the three prisoners, 150 or 200 yards from my premises, walking together—I had known them all for years—I walked up to them and asked them for my money—they all answered that they had no money, and they did not know what I meant—I took hold of Rogers, and How—I found that Rogers meant to struggle, and I told How he might go if he liked, as I knew him so well, I could take him to-morrow—Mr. Anderson came up, he took Hoban, and told him he might go—Mr. Anderson assisted me with Rogers—going to the station we met an officer, and Rogers looked at me and said "Mr. Carter, will you let me go if I give you your money?"—I said, "No, I will give you in custody"—he put his hand in his pocket took out two half-crowns and two sixpences, which he dropped into my hand—I had had a bowl in my till, and as we were going along Mr. Anderson called out "Hold hard, Carter, there goes your money"—the prisoners were breaking the bowl up, and throwing it away, and Mr. Anderson thought that was the money—he picked up this part of a bowl in the field—I believe this to be mine—I had my money is a bowl like this, and the bowl was gone from the till, and some silver that was in it.</p>

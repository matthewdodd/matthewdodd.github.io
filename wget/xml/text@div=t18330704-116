             is in our service; and on Saturday, the 29th of June, I had a communication from him - our usual hour of dining was three o'clock, but we generally did not sit down till five or ten minutes past three o'clock - in consequence of what Crawley said, I on that day altered the dinner hour to two o'clock; but a few minutes after two o'clock I said to Warren "Take this parcel to the Old Change;" it was a parcel of tobacco weighing sixty pounds - I said, "Let us see how quick you can be back"- after he was gone I examined the shop, and under the counter on the selling side I found a box, and in it three parcels of tobacco, each weighing about two pounds; two of them were tied up, and the other only folded up and the ends tucked in - this was not at all a proper place for the deposit of tobacco - our counter is about a yard high, or not quite so much - I called Crawley and Browne, who were in our employ, and showed the tobacco to them - we had no customer of my father's named Rainsford - Warren returned back from the City in about an hour and ten minutes, which was very quick for him - I was at home when he returned, but I don't recolect saying anything to him - in consequence of something being said to me I went out in about five minutes after Warren's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040093"></xptr>return - I went to the corner of Wardour-street and stood there some time, but I could not see our shop from there; I then went to a place where I could see our shop, and I saw the prisoner Rainsford lingering about our shop with a blue bag - (I had received a description of a person from Crawley) - after he had lingered about for four or five minutes, he stood at the window where we keep snuff-boxes, and pretended to be looking at them, but I observed that he fixed his eyes towards the counter, and he at last went in; Warren was then in the shop - Rainsford came out again in less than five minutes with his bag much fuller than it was before; it had had a small parcel in the bottom of it before he went in - I and a friend who was with me, crossed over to him and asked what he had in his bag; he said, tobacco - I at the same time took hold of his bag and took it from him, and asked him if he would allow me to see it - he said, Certainly - we then returned to our shop, and I took out of the bag (before my friend) these two parcels, which are two of the three which had been in the box under the counter, and which I had replaced there after looking at them; I am sure they are two of them - I said to Rainsford, "Where did you get this tobacco?" he said, from his father's stock - I asked where his father lived, and he wrote down his address, "Edward Rainsford, 16, Cumberland-row, King's-cross;" which turned out to be his right address - he said this was a part of his father's stock, and he had brought it out to sell - he said he came into our shop to buy half an ounce of snuff; and on his being asked what he paid for it, he said, 1d., and Warren said 2d.; they both answered together - I then asked Warren, who was present, what he knew of the tobacco; he said he knew nothing about it, but he knew Rainsford by sight - no man of ordinary height, could reach the tobacco from under the counter from the customers side; Rainsford certainly could not - it is customary in our trade when we send out any quantity of tobacco, to give also a permit; this is one of them - there was no bill with these parcels, nor any permit; it was quite clear they could not have been disposed of in the ordinary way of trade - one of the parcels which Rainsford had was loose, the other tied up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you put any mark on the parcels when you put them back in the box? A. No; I opened one and found it was tobacco, and I weighed it - I am not in partnership with my father- I can swear to these two parcels as being my father's, and could if I saw them thirty miles off - I observed a mark on one of the parcels, but I did not make it - I am satisfied these are the parcels.</p>

I know Rainsford; I had seen him at my master's shop several times before the 28th of June - our usual dinner-time was between three and four o'clock; and Rainsford used to come to the shop about half-past three, while master was at dinner - Warren used to be there at the time, and he seemed to know Rainsford - my master had lost a great deal of tobacco, and he made it known to the servants - I told my master what I had seen about Rainsford - my master went off to Brighton on Saturday morning, the 29th of June, and my young master changed his dinner hour that day - I was called to look at a box under the counter which had three parcels of tobacco in it, two tied, and one rolled up - I went out for a pint of porter about half-past three; I saw Rainsford outside the door - my young master was just going out with Mr. Riley, and he turned back and said, "Here is the rascal outside the door" - I went to the inner part of the warehouse; I could not see the customers side of the counter from there, but Brown could - he said to me, "Here he comes" - I went into our snuff-room where there is a square of glass broken; I looked through, and saw Rainsford at the counter, and Warren behind the counter; they were opposite and talking to each other - Rainsford staid about two minutes then went out, and in about a minute he came in again with my master - I saw my master produce from Rainsford's bag two of the parcels which had been in the box under the counter; I am perfectly sure of it.</p>

             (police-constable E 41). I was called in to take the prisoners - I found on Warren 1l. 10s. 6d., in silver, and 1s. 9d., in copper, and this letter- I afterwards searched the lodging of Warren at No. 94, John-street, Fitzroy-square; I there found this other letter</p>
               <p>JAMES - . I am an excise-officer. It is customary in the tobacco trade for vendors of tobacco to issue permits with any quantity of tobacco sold above one pound in weight; but I believe they generally do so with half a pound - on the 29th of June there was no permit from Mr. Rogers for four pounds.</p>
               <p>Rainsford's Defence. I have been in the habit of purchasing this tobacco of Warren as smuggled; he having represented that he had a captain, a friend of his who brought it over; I had generally sent him an order on the previous evening for what I wanted the next day, and on that Friday evening I sent an order for 6 lbs. of tobacco, 4 lbs. of shag, and 2 lbs. of returns, but the tobacco in the box was 4 lbs. of returns and 2 lbs. of shag - I took the 2 lbs. of shag, and 2 lbs. of the returns; I paid him for them and was coming out of the shop when I was stopped by Mr. Rogers - I did not wish that he should know that we were mixed up in any smuggling transaction, and I told him they were my father's - we were then taken before a magistrate - I have been to Mr. Rogers' at all hours for it; on the Thursday I had sent 
               <persName id="t18330704-116-person1179">Warren</persName>
             an order for some, and I went for it, and Mr. Rogers was sitting at his own desk, and must have seen me; it is not likely I should have gone there in broad day-light, with two or three other persons in the warehouse. if there had been any guilty intention on my part, except knowing that the tobacco was smuggled.</p>
               <p>Warren's Defence. I admit that the tobacco in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040094"></xptr>box was placed there by me; it was not Mr. Rogers's but my own; I had bought and paid for it of a smuggler - I shall not give up the name.</p>
               <p>The letters were here put in and read: -</p>
               <p>"Dear Warren - Let me have ready at half-past three tomorrow, without fail, 4lbs. shag and 2lbs. returns, positively, and if you can at the same time 4lbs. shag, or 3lbs. shag and 1lb. returns. I owe you to-day 1s. 6d., Thursday 3s., and Saturday last 5s. for cigars, which I will give you the next time I see you: let me likewise have on Monday next, without fail, 3lbs. shag and 1lb. returns; in haste, E. R.</p>
               <p>Friday evening, six o'clock."</p>
               <p>Dear Sir - As I shall leave home this evening to convey my mother from the country, it will be useless your coming down here to-morrow morning, as originally proposed, as I shall be from home; but if you can make it convenient to call here tomorrow evening, after half-past eleven, the old man will have left, and we can then come to a settlement, or if more convenient will meet you on Monday or Tuesday, after half-past eleven in the evening, at any place you may appoint.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner 14 Years; she always pretended to me, that she belonged to Plays, &amp;c. and was employed in Singing, and Dancing upon the Ropes, and dresses sometimes in Mens Cloaths. The 8th of this Month she came to my Shop in High-Holbourn, with this Gown upon her Back, and asked me to change it for something that fitted her better; she said, she had it out of pawn; and they would not let her try it on. without buying it outright; I gave her another Gown for it, and two Shillings to boot, and 18 d for this Apron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. A Dutch Woman carried me to Mrs Marsh, and had half a Crown for carrying me; I was to give her 8 s. a Week for my Lodging and Board; she lent me these Things to put on to go into Company. <rs id="t17430629-18-verdict110" type="verdictDescription">

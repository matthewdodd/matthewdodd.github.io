                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Jaques, an oilman, of 2, Backroad, Shadwell—on 21st June last, the prisoner White came into oar shop for a quartern of soap, and some soda, which came to twopence—she gave me a shilling, and I gave her tenpence change—I examined it afterwards, when she was gone, and found it was bad; I marked it and put it on the shelf—on Saturday evening, between 5 and 6, Barry came in and asked for a quartern of mottled soap, and gave me a bad shilling in payment; I bit it and told her it was bad—she said she did not know it—I then sent for a constable and gave her in charge—I said to her, "You knew this was bad, and the party I have seen you with tendered me one on Friday, between 12 and 1 o'clock"—she said she did not know the party—the policeman took her to the station—I only gave him the marked shilling which I had received from Mary Ann White—I gave another policeman the other—I went to the police station, and while there, White was brought in by another constable—I don't know his name, I gave him the other shilling—I have seen the prisoners walking together dozens of times; they have not been in my shop together, they have passed on the other side of the way; that might be three or four years ago—I have known them about the place together—I cannot say the last time I saw them together.</p>

On 22d June last, I was on duty at Back-road, Shadwell, and saw a constable taking Barry into the station—I was coming right past at the time—that was twenty or thirty yards from Mrs. Jaques' shop, and just as they turned the corner, White was pointed out to me by Mrs. Jaques' daughter—in consequence of what she said, I took White to the station—Mrs. Jaques was there, and when I brought White in, she said, "Oh, this is the other one that came and passed a bad shilling, between 12 and 1 yesterday"—the prisoners were put in the dock together, and White said she knew nothing about it, and knew nothing of Mrs. Jaques, or of Barry—she was searched, but there was no money found upon her—Mra Jaques gave me this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

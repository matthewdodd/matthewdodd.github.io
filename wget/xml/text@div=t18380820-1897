                  </hi>. I live in Trinity-court, Aldersgate-street, in tie ser<lb></lb>vice of Dr. Wallis. On the night of the 27th of July, I was driving the carnage—I left it in Chancery-lane, and I left on the box a Macintosh coat—I came back in a quarter of an hour, and it was gone—there were a great many persons about.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Stephen-street, Tottenham-court-road. I was coming along Fleet-street, and saw an omnibus and a four-wheel car<lb></lb>riage get together-a great many said it was all the prosecutor's fault crossed over, and saw a man put his arm inside the coach, and then snatch this Macintosh off the dickey, and give it to the prisoner—I went after him, and took it from under his coat.</p>

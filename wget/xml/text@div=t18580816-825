                  </hi>. I live at 32, Joiner-street, Westminster-road—at about half-past 9 o'clock on Sunday evening, the 8th instant, I went into Watch<lb></lb>orn's public-house, Marsh-gate, Lambeth, for a pint of beer—I saw the prisoners there—the male prisoner came outside the house with me and asked which way I was going, I told him to Joiner-street—he said, "I am coming that way"—we walked along the Westminster-road, when I said, "I think I am going too for beyond my crossing;" "No," says he, "there is the Catholic church,"—then he made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at my watch—I said, "Do not take that," and put up my hand to save it—with that he made a pull at the chain, gave the watch a sudden drag, and broke the guard—I got hold of him, clung to him, and cried out "Police,"—he had the watch in his hand, and I saw him reach it to the female prisoner—I had seen her in the public-house before; she was called Mary Ann—a man came to my assist<lb></lb>ance,</p>

               <p>and then a policeman came up—I told him what had happened, and he took the male prisoner into custody—I did not notice the female walking alongside of us—I saw her go out of the public-house—I had asked her in the house if she was an Irish girl, and she said not—she drank out of the pot with me and the rest—I am sure the prisoner is the man who snatched the watch—I held him tight till the officer came—I did not see the woman again till the Wednesday after—I was then going to the Lambeth Police-court, and I saw her standing in a bye place, off the street, not far from the court—she turned her head on one side while I was passing her, and I went on straight ahead to the court, where the man was called up and com<lb></lb>mitted—when I came out, I saw her coming up another passage to the court—I went up to the gate to see if I could see a policeman; then I lost sight of her—a young, man came up and said there was a woman down there, who had sent him up to see what had happened to the man that stole the watch—he told that to a policeman, who took her into custody—I am sure she is the same woman.</p>

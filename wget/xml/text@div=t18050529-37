               <p>Q. On the 27th of April last did you see the prisoners there, while you were on your duty? - A. Yes; Johnson had to superintend some brandies in the front warehouse No. 1; he is an Excise officer; about five o'clock in the afternoon I saw the three prisoner's there, in the back room of No. 1, up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What articles were there in the back room? - A.Barrels of raisins and almonds.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Johnson, as an Excise officer, any occasion to be in the back room? - A. No, none at all; the other two men were strangers to me; I I saw the three prisoners standing by a barrel of almonds; Colston and Calvert were taking them out of the barrel and putting them into their pockets, and Johnson was either leaning at the barrel, or holding it on one side, that they might get at it the more readily: I considered it my duty to report it; I went to Mr. Marshall and gave him the information; he directed me to go to the constable at the gate, and direct him to come, which I did; when I came back with the constable, we found them down in the Dock, opposite No. 1; we apprehended them, and took them to the superintendant's office; they were then ordered to turn out what they had got in their pockets; Calvert turned out two or three pounds of almonds and a few figs,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290025"></xptr>and Colston turned out two or three pounds; they were then taken to the Thames Police-Office.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any thing taken from him, either a single almond or a fig? - A. I did not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Pooley. Q. You are one of the constables of the London-Dock? - A. I am; Colston took from his pocket three pounds of almonds and some figs by my order.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. He was very sorry for what he had done he said; he had taken some to eat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Calvert's defence. I only took a few, with intent to eat them, not to have done any thing else with them.</p>
               <p>Colston's defence. I only took a few to eat, I had no idea of the quantity.</p>
               <p>Johnson's defence. A part of this warehouse was occupied to deposit goods, subject to the duties of the Excise, and under my care; the remaining part of the warehouse on the same floor, was appropriated for housing of fruit of various kinds; this fruit was exposed to view, and thirty or forty people, in the course of the day, came in to examine, and participate as they thought proper; the servants of the warehouse were in the warehouse from the moment it was unlocked to the time it was locked up, and I never heard them take the least exception; that not being any concern of mine, I did not think it necessary while there were people there who had the care of them; nor did I interfere in any respect whatever any farther than my own duty compelled me, and I am sure that my superiors will say, that in every thing where I have acted under them, I have ever given a faithful account of the trust they have been pleased to repose in me; with respect to the business that is now depending before the Court, I had no knowledge whatever when it took place, nor was I in the least apprized of it till six o'clock in the evening; I had locked up the warehouse, and was going to the Excise-office in Thames-street to finish my business of the day, which I was obliged to do, when I was informed at the gate of the London Dock what had occurred, and that I must be detained, in consequence of being in the warehouse at the time; I walked about the Dock, and enquired of some of the gentlemen in the most exalted stations, thinking they could inform me for what cause I was in detention, and none of them could inform me. If they had suspected any unwarrantable power of that kind, they knew where I was; instead of which, an hour and a half elapsed before I knew any thing of it; and then I was about to leave the premises. They did not think it was necessary to search me, nor was I searched, till I was conveyed to the Police office, when the Magistrate desired me to do it. There was nothing found on me belonging to these warehouses but the book and the key of the warehouse, and what I could call my own; if there had, they no doubt would have mentioned it. I am now brought into this Court, charged with being accessary to what I know not, was not, nor never did I, on my own account, dare to take a liberty of the kind, either within the walls of the London Dock, or any other part, with the property that was committed to my care. My Lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, I have that consolation that there is no misconduct whatever can be attached on my part; at least, I trust so; as such I humbly leave my case to the consideration of the Judge and the Jury.</p>
               <p>Johnson called four witnesses, Colston four, and Calvert one, who gave them a good character.</p>

The prisoner came to my house on the 26th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; he said he had come from sea; he had slept at my house the night before. I am in the habit of letting lodgings; he wanted to buy my quadrant. On the 26th, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, he sent me out to get him some beer; when I returned, he was gone, and the quadrant also. I saw the prisoner again on the 27th; I charged him with robbing me; he ran away; he was stopped. I found my quadrant at the pawnbroker's.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker; live with Mr. Dickins, at Limehouse. The prisoner pledged the quadrant at our shop, on the evening of the 26tk of November, about five o'clock. I am sure that he is the man. It was afterwards claimed by Davies. He has pawned two quadrants with us.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BROWN. I met the prisoner about three o'clock in the afternoon on the dock bridge. He gave me the quadrant, and told me to carry it. I carried it down to a public-house, and he then took it from me. I am sure it was Mr. Davies's quadrant; I had seen it before.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL MORRIS. I am an officer. I saw the prisoner taken, and he was given up to me; he said he knew nothing of the quadrant.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. That quadrant is my own.</p>

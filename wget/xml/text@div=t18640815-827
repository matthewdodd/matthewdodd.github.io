                  </hi>. I am a leather shaver, at 2, Elizabeth-terrace, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey—about 1 o'clock on the morning of 29th July I was returning home and I met Cronin, in Tooley-street—she spoke to me and continued walking by my side for some time—I noticed two men following us, the male prisoner is one of them—when we got to the railway a man came behind me, put his arm under my neck and said, "Do it Dick"—Why burgh took my pin, my handkerchief, half a sovereign, and half a crown, and then they all ran off together—in the scuffle my hat fell off, and as they were running away I said, "You might as well have left me my hat"—the prisoner came back and gave me my hat, and then walked down into Russell-street with me, till we met a policeman, and I gave him in charge—he did not try to run away—I did not collar him till I saw a policeman—to the best of my belief the female prisoner is the woman I saw on that night—I was talking to her perhaps half an hour altogether—I was walking with the man about five or six minutes.</p>

               <p>where I was going—I went to the King of Prussia public-house, in Tooley-street, and had a glass there—I remained there perhaps half an hour, and was going back again towards home, when this woman accosted me—she followed me—I did not know the prisoner was one of the men when the two men were following me—it was from what I afterwards saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tea-dealer and grocer, and live in High-street, Peckham, in the parish of Camberwell. On Saturday, the 23rd of March, the prisoner came into my service—on the 27th I sent her out, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, on an errand—she did not return—she was apprehended on the Friday following—I searched my bed. room, as she did not return, and missed three sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, two dollars, and two old shillings, out of the looking-glass drawer—three of the sovereigns were in a small box—the drawer was locked, and I found it still locked.</p>

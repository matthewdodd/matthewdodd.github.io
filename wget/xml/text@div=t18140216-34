            . I live at Paddington. I know the prisoner Hill; he has often told me that he had bristles to sell cheap. On the 28th of December, I met the prisoner as I was crossing Blenherm-mews, he had some bristles tied up in an handkerchief, he asked me if I would buy them; I said, I would; I gave him ten shillings for them. I could not tell what the bristles were worth; they were not weighed. On the 10th of January Mr. Kent came, and found the bristles at my house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I produce the bristles found in Boquet's house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know this bundle of bristles are my property by the marks; they are marked the size; all manufacturers mark them alike.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Boquet has falsely sworn; I never did deliver any bristles to him. He has taken bristles himself out of my master's premises. I never robbed my employer the four years I have worked for him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

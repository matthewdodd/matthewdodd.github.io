                  </hi>. I live at 12, Charles Street, Drury Lane—on the morning of 1st March, about 1 o'clock, I was coming down Charles Street, going home—Elliott was standing on the right hand side—he was coming out of a house, and George was on the left hand side—Elliott followed me about three steps, and took me by the arm—I turned round, and before I had time to speak he hit me in the mouth, and staggered me—he hit me again, which staggered me more; and the third time he hit me I fell down—when I was down on the ground he tried to put his hand in my pockets—he kicked me as well—I got hold of his arm, and raised myself up, and as I got up he called to George to come to his assistance—he said "<hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> come!"—George came up, and hit me twice on the head—I fell down, and they kicked me on the hip-bone when I was down—I felt Elliott's band in my pocket; George never touched my pocket at all—he stepped away on to the footpath, and kept saying "It is all right," during the time the other one was trying my pockets—I had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket—I got up again, and made a run in doors, to my house, and then Elliott hit me again—George called out "<hi rend="italic">Cheese it!"</hi> and Elliott picked up my hat and ran away—my hat was sent back the next day by his sister—the police came up, and I gave George in charge before he had time to get away—he was walking away when the police came up—Elliott got away.</p>

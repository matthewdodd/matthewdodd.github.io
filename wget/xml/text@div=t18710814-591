I am a labourer—I was haymaking about two miles from Edgware—on Friday, 4th August, about 2.15 in the morning, I was lying at the aide of the road—the prisoner came up to me, and asked me for my money—I told him I would see him d——first, and got up, and showed fighting—he overpowered me, and I fell down—he put his hand in my trowsers pocket, and took out all my money, which was about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I struggled to get up, and he kicked me under the jaw, and said "Lie still, or I will break your jaw for you"—he had a female with him—she said "Don't hurt him"—they went away, and left me—I laid there, half sense<lb></lb>less, for a little time—I got up, and went and laid down in a barn, being a stranger there—the next morning I got up, and went into the road, to see if I could see a policeman—I gave him a description of the man and woman—I went out in the hay-fields, to do my work—I was afterwards sent for to the police-station, and saw the prisoner and the woman with other men and women—I went up to the prisoner, and said "That is the man," and I went to the woman, and said "That is the female"—she was afterwards discharged—she never laid the weight of her hand upon me.</p>

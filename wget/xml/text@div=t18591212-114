On 23d November, about the middle of the day, I was in High-street, Islington, with Tomkins—we were in plain clothes—the prisoner and two other men attracted our notice—we watched them—they went along the street; one of them went into a shop, another stood outside, and the prisoner walked on—the man who was outside made a signal to the man inside and he came out—the prisoner and the other joined, and the other made a motion to the prisoner and he left them and went on by himself—Tomkins and I followed him some yards—I said to him, "You are about something wrong, I shall take you on suspicion"—he put something in his mouth and he made a rush towards a public-house—he did not get in; I stopped him—he said he wanted some beer to drink—I noticed his face; he began to turn black in the face, and appeared to be choking—we got him about twenty or thirty yards further and then he spat out of his mouth six half-crowns—I picked them up and said, "I have got them"—he said, "If there is anything there you put them there, you b—thief"—when I picked up the coins they were in a packet; one of them fell out of the packet; the others were done up in separate papers one from the other—Tomkins was with me; he was struggling with the prisoner.</p>

I was with the last witness and saw the prisoner and the other two men—one went in a shop, another stood outside, the prisoner went on—they then went to him—they then parted; the other two went in another direction—they intended" us to follow them—we followed the prisoner—I told him I was a police-officer and I should take him—he put something in his mouth—he made an effort and turned black in the face—he appeared to be trying to swallow something—he asked for half a pint of beer; I said he should not have it—he then asked for water; I said he should not have it, he should come to the station and should have water—when he got to the corner of Cross-street, he spat out these six half-crowns—he tried to get away—I had to throw him down to secure him—I found on him one half-crown, a watch guard and a key—he said he lived in Edgeware-road.</p>

They asked me if I would put this parcel in my pocket, which I did, and they walked on ahead. I lost sight of them, and I opened the parcel. I found that it contained half-crowns. I did not know what to do; I found there was a snare laid for me. I put them in my mouth; the officers came and asked what I was doing, and said they should search me. I knew that I had the money, but I did not know it was bad. I had not them with a guilty knowledge.</p>

I missed the gown about ten minutes after she had been in the shop. It hung up near the door, upon a hook, for sale. I followed her, and overtook her. I desired her to come back with me; she did: and, when she came back, she threw the gown away from her in the passage. I saw her untie her apron and throw it out (the gown produced and deposed to.) She tore it in pulling it off the hook.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Was any body in the shop, after me, before you missed it?</p>
               <p>Davis. No; I was an hour and an half before I found her.</p>

               <p>I went into Mr. Davis's to pawn a bed gown for one shilling and six-pence. I went to buy some meat for my four children. I went to a public house; he sent for me out, and said his wife wanted me. I went home with him: then he charged me with stealing the gown. I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>

               <p>JOHN ROACH. I was at the Admiral Hagel public-house, between nine and ten o'clock at night, on the 2d of August - I lost my watch from my pocket; I did not feel it go, nor see who took it; I saw the prisoner in the house - I had been drinking, but was not in liquor; I had my head on the table, and went to sleep; I awoke, and missed my watch - I have not found it.</p>

            . I was at the public-house with some friends. and saw the prosecutor fall asleep - I saw the prisoner take the watch from his pocket, and put it into his own; when the prosecutor came in, the prisoner stood up and shook hands with him, and they drank together; the prisoner and another man went out together, and then the prosecutor said he had been robbed, and went out; I am certain the prisoner took the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where did I sit? A. At his right-hand side; I sat at the corner of the table - you sat next him, and his friend on the other side of him; you came in before them.</p>

            . I was tried last Session, and acquitted. I did not see the prosecutor and his friend come back to the house; I saw the prisoner in the street, but did not give charge of him; I had heard of the loss - there was some wrangling in the street; I went up, and said he ought to return the watch - he said he would knock me down.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROACH. I did not suspect Sullivan - I missed my watch just as I came out at the door; my friend and I came out just after the prisoner, and my friend accused him of it; he said he could knock his head off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-whipper. I lived in Lower Shadwell—the prisoner lodged in the same house and slept in the same bed with me—I had known him about a month—he worked in the same employ as I did—he was learning the business—on the 1st of August I got up about the same time as he did, and we were both down stairs together—I had a trunk in my room, which I know was locked—it contained the property stated, and I had put the key of it in a waistcoat in the room—I went out to work—I returned about four o'clock, and went up to my room—I saw the key lying under the bed—I opened the trunk, and found the things all upside down—the articles stated were gone—I have never seen any of them since—the coat was in the room, but that belonged to Peter Graney—the prisoner did not return—he was not seen at the house from about two o'clock that day till he was brought back from the county of Leitrim, in Ireland—on the 11th of February, I saw him at the Thames police-office—three or four persons lodged in the room.</p>

The prisoner and De-laney, and three others, lodged in that room—on the morning of the 1st of August they all went out to work about eight o'clock, as usual—the pri<lb></lb>soner returned about nine o'clock, as I was taking my breakfast—I asked him to take some coffee—he said he would; then he went up stairs, and came down again—he was in the house during the day, and as I was clean<lb></lb>ing the room, he said, could he assist me to move the beds, or do any thing—I said he could not, I could do what I had to do myself—he was in and out several times, and I saw he had Graney's coat on his back—he could hare had the opportunity of opening the box while I was not in the room—he went away about two o'clock that day—he had given me no notice—he asked me for a needle and thread to mend his own old coat, and I thought he had only slipped Graney's coat on while he did it—he left his own old coat behind.</p>

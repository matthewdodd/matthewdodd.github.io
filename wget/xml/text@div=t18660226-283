                  </hi>. I keep a public-house in West-street, St. Martin's-lane—the prisoner came in on 20th January, about a quarter to 9 o'clock—I had seen her there frequently before—three months before that she came there and asked for a quartern of gin—she gave a half-crown—after she had gone, my son made a communication to me, and, in consequence of that, I examined the half-crown, and found it bad—there were only two shillings and one sixpence in the till—after that, she came in, perhaps once in two or three weeks—on 20th January my son served her—she gave him a half-crown—I told him to look at it, and he found it to be bad—I told the prisoner it was bad—she did not say anything—I told her I should detain her until a policeman came—I said, "I have seen you before, and I have marked you some time—I gave her in charge—she is not a regular customer."</p>

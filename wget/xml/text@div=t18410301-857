                  </hi>. I am servant to Wm. Valder. On the 22nd of February our servant gave me information, and I missed this bottle of oil from the window—I went out after the prisoner—I called to him—he began run<lb></lb>ning—he went to a beer-shop—I followed, and saw the bottle in his bosom—I do not know what he did with it—I returned, and told my master—I am sure the bottle I saw in his bosom was the one I put the oil into—there was no one in our tap-room but the servant and the prisoner—it had not got a cork in it when I put it into the window, nor when I saw it with the prisoner.</p>

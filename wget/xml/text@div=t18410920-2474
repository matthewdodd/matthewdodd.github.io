                  </hi>. I live at Doddinghurst, near Ingatestone. On the 14th of September, I was turning the corner of Rose-lane, Wentworth-street, and missed this coat from my hay-cart—I had seen it five minutes before.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner on the 14th of September take the coat from the tail of the cart, which the prosecutor was driving, at the corner of Wentworth-street, just turning into Rose-lane.</p>

I saw the prisoner with the coat on his arm running in Wentworth-street—he threw the coat down while I was pursuing him—he was stopped by another officer—he resisted very much by kicking, and making all sorts of rushes to get to a back door where he could get over some low paling to another yard—I had my hat knocked off, and was kicked—I found the prosecutor on the Thursday following.</p>

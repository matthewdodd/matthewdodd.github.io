                  </hi>. I live at Sutton, near Macclesfield—I am assistant overseer and collector of poorrates for the parish of Sutton—I knew the deceased, Edward Roe, for thirteen or fourteen years before his death—I attested the will and codicil produced—the codicil was executed on 30th December, 1858—I saw the testator execute it—he was very feeble that day—his hand was very much cramped—when I first went in I read the codicil over to him, then he took it up in his hands, and read it himself, after wiping, his spectacles, and his hand was in this position (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—he had to put his fingers so, to straighten it—he put his right band into his left, and he put his name four or five times on a pieoe of blank paper before he, attached it to the codicil—I saw the letters and cheque at Bow-street—these, are them—in my judgment this is not the writing of the testator, Edward Roe—he could not write a hand like that at the date it purports to be writ<lb></lb>ten—at the time I saw the codicil executed it was getting near 4 o'clock in the afternoon—the letter and cheque may bear a little resemblance to the testator's writing two or three years before his decease, but not for a long time before—he died on the 1st January, the next day but one, early in the morning—he was then living at Sutton, near Macclesfield—it is an adjoining township to Macclesfield, and within the Parliamentary borough.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186108190026"></xptr>
               <p>the front door was often fast—if it was not, you opened the gate first, then went the three yards of lobby, and then his door was on the right-hand side, on the ground floor—the window that he tapped at overlooked the road—there is a footpath there on that side of the road—the back way into the house was at the gable end—I had to go through the yard-door to get to the back—door, and then through the kitchen into the lobby I have spoken of—there was a door between the lobby and the kitchen, which cut off his room from the kitchen—on Wednesday, the 29th, the day before the codicil was executed, I had a conversation with John Orme Roe, and I copied a draft that he brought to me—having copied it, I went to the old man on the 30th—I do not think he was looking much better on that day—I do not know that he was much better—he questioned me as to his health—I was examined on the former occasion to establish the validity of the will—I cannot say whether I stated on that occasion that the testator looked much better on that day—it is a long while ago—I have never looked at the evidence—I might have said so; I won't dispute it—I told him the business I had come on—I first read the codicil to him; he then took it up and read it himself, and said, "That will do"—I cannot say whether he read it without his spectacles—I remember well enough his taking it up and saying, "That will do," but I cannot remember whether he had his spectacles or not—he asked Turner to get the ink for him, and he tried the pen several times—he then said that he must attend to his books, for he had neglected them sadly of late—they were books of his own business.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you often visit him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my road home I had to pass his house, and we chatted very frequently; I did not go in, he would walk along with me on the way—that was for several years before his death—I was not examined before the commission at Macclesfield—this is the first time I have been examined upon the matter; I was not at the police-court—it was a couple of years or more before his death that he used to walk with me—during the latter part of the time I did pot go into his house at all—I do not think this is much like his writing two years ago; there is some resemblance, but I hardly think I should have been taken in by it for a moment—I did not often receive letters from him; I have received some, not latterly—I have seen him write; the last time was in 1857—I had frequently seen him write up to that time—I have been acting as solicitor to Mr. John Orme Roe in this matter, in the Court of Chancery and the Court of Probate; he was acting in connexion with Mr. Hartwell Roe for the purpose of establishing the will—I never saw the previous will of 1857, it was not produced to me by my client, John Orme Roe—I never saw any previous will—there was a bill filed in chancery and an answer put in, and</p>

               <p>subsequently the suit was dismissed—I apprehend that the defendant in that suit might have had an order to examine the plaintiff—I am not aware that that step was taken—I heard of the criminal proceedings, immediately after the date of the answer; I heard it from Mr. Hartwell Roe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Johnson and Coote, of Gray's Inn-square, and also of Doctors' Commons—I know the prisoner; he was a client of ours in respect of certain proceedings in the Court of Probate, of <hi rend="italic">Sale v. Roe</hi>, and also in the Court of Chancery, of <hi rend="italic">Roe v. Roe</hi>—on 19th June I wrote this letter, to Messrs. Brocklehurst and Bagshaw, by the instruction of the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "June 19th, 1860—Gentlemen,—Re Edward Roe, deceased—We think it right to inform you that we have to-day had a long interview with our client, the Rev. James Roe, with reference to a letter which has been discovered, within the last few days, written by the deceased Edward Roe, dated 30th December, 1858, in which he complains of the coercion exercised towards him, and forwarding him a cheque. We intend immediately to consult counsel as to the course which should be pursued by Mr. James Roe, which we imagine will be "that we should at once apply to the Court for a new trial we inform you of this that the executors may not proceed to distribute the estate until the questions raised by this letter have been disposed of—We are, gentlemen, your very obedient servants, Johnson and Coote.")—I afterwards wrote another letter of September 5th—it is my writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: September 5th, 1 860—Gentlemen,—Re Edward Roe, deceased—We think it right to inform you that, since writing our letter to you of the 19th June last, we have satisfied ourselves of the authenticity of the letter of the 30th December, 1858, which we shall be able to prove unquestionably to be in Mr. Edward Roe's handwriting, and we shall now proceed to take such steps as counsel may advise. Though our letter to you of the 19th June last, was, we imagine, quite sufficient to put the executor on his guard, and to caution him against distributing the estate, pending the questions raised by Mr. Edward Roe's letter, still we think it right to give you this further notice, as, notwithstanding our letter, the executor is, we are informed, proceeding in the distribution of the estate.—We are, gentlemen, yours faithfully, Johnson and Coote.")—I received the letter and envelope produced from the prisoner on 13th August, 1860—I retained them in my possession until they were deposited in the Court of Chancery, under an order of Vice—Chancellor Wood, with the exception of four or five days, when I handed them to my partner, who took them into the country—I received them back again from him—on Saturday, 26th January last, I was at my office in Doctors Commons, in an inner room with the prisoner—I opened the door and requested Mr. Surrey to come in—after he came in, the prisoner, looking at him, said, "Who are you?"—I answered for Mr. Surrey by saying, "I think he is the son of Mr. Surrey, of Fleet-lane;" and I said to Mr. Surrey, "Is that (pointing to the prisoner) the gentleman for whom your father made the dies?"—he said, "Yes, he is"—the prisoner seemed confounded with the accusation that seemed to be implied (I had had some conversation with him before Mr. Surrey entered the room)—he seemed confounded by the accusation; he put his hand to his head and stood aghast, and quite thunderstruck at the charge—he left our office a few minutes afterwards—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186108190030"></xptr>
               <p>these document were deposited in the Court of Chancery under an order of very nearly that date—on the morning of that day a summons was attended, which I attended myself before the chief clerk of the Vice-Chancellor—that was to deposit the documents in the hands of the Court of Chancery—that summons was taken out by the defendant's agents, Messrs. Elsdale and Byrne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the order made to deposit the documents before Mr. Surrey came in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, before I saw Mr. Surrey—I did not commu<lb></lb>nicate to the prisoner that the summons was taken out, or that there was an application to deposit the documents—the summons was returnable on my return to London, which was that same day—I did not communicate to the prisoner, when I saw him in my office, that there was such an application and order; I had no opportunity of doing so—I told him before Mr. Surrey came in that the order had been made to deposit the documents—I do not know exactly the day when the summons was made; it was served before my return from Macclesfield—my partner, Mr. Coote, has not attended a great deal more to this matter than myself; he attended to the trial at Chester more than myself, but I have attended all the Chancery proceedings—it was on the 29th or 30th of August that I handed these documents over to Mr. Coote for four or five days—that was in order that he might make inquiries at Macclesfield and elsewhere, about the genuineness of the documents—Mr. Coote is in London; he is not in court; I think he is at Doctors' Commons—he is accessible at any moment—I gave him the documents, with instructions to ascertain their genuineness—he has told me that he did make inquiries, and upon his report of those inquiries I acted in the suit—it was after that report from him that I wrote the letter to Messrs. Brocklehurst, which has been read, stating that I had satisfied myself of the authenticity of the documents—after that I proceeded in the suit, filed the bill, and went to considerable expense—those expenses have not been paid—I did not undertake to carry on the suit at my own risk; merely advanced money on account—we are not out of pocket to a very large amount; only the amount expended in this suit; not in the suit of <hi rend="italic">Sale v. Roe</hi>; those have been paid—I should not have undertaken the suit if I had thought there was any doubt about it—Mr. Coote conducted the trial which took place at Chester, and saw the witnesses—Mr. and Mrs. Loney were both witnesses on that trial—I know that Mr. Coote went to Macclesfield and saw Mr. and Mrs. Loney—I know also that he saw Mrs. Thompson; she was formerly a Miss Gee; a relation of the family—he also saw the postmistress at Macclesfield, and put the envelope and stamps before her; at least, so he told me—I also know that he went to Bath, and saw the Bath postmaster, and put the envelope and stamps before him—I think he also saw Mr. Hollway, the gentleman mentioned in the bill, from whom the parcel was said to have come—after receiving the result of this infor<lb></lb>mation from Mr. Coote, I wrote to Messrs. Brocklehurst—I also wrote to Mr. Roe, on 5th September—being satisfied by Mr. Coote's inquiries I then took proceedings—the 24th January was the first day that any commn—nication was made to me by the other side about—Mr. Surrey; the letter and cheque was not submitted to me before 13th August—I suppose it was to Mr. Coote—I only know that, from what Mr. Cooteh as said—Mr. Coote did not submit the original letter to me—he gave me some informa<lb></lb>tion upon which the letter of 19th June was written—the prisoner came to town on the 19th, and on that day he wrote out a copy of the letter from his own head, not having the letter with him—at the time I wrote the</p>

               <p>letter of 19th June I had not seen the original letter or cheque—I had seen a copy which the prisoner gave me—I have seen the prisoner in the presence of Mr. Coote—we were together on 19th June—the original letter was placed before Mr. Coote some time before that—I am not sure of the day—I think it was on the 4th of June—I only speak from what Mr. Coote told me—it was certainly some time before the 19th—I do not think there is any call-book at Doctors' Commons—Mr. Coote has a journal of his own in which be makes entries, and I enter in my own journal what I do—we do not eater jointly—there is no unfriendliness between myself and Mr. Coote—I have seen the prisoner with Mr. Coote—I first saw him with him on 19th June, the day I wrote this letter I met the prisoner at Doctors' Commons, at the request of Mr. Coote—Mr. Coote told me on that occasion that he had seen the original document; that Mr. Roe had been to town and shown him the original letter and envelope—I do not remember his saying that he had looked at the date of the stamp on the envelope—I do not recollect his telling me whether he did or not—I do not think Mr. Coote has been subpoenaed on the part of the prosecution—he was not examined at the police-court—I communicated to the other side that Mr. Coote had made inquiries about the genuineness of these documents—while the documents were in my hands persons called on behalf of Mr. Hartwell Roe to see them several times—Mr. Hartwell Roe himself called on 3d November—I do not think any one called before that—I received an answer to my letter of 19th June from Messrs. Brocklehurst—when I wrote the letter of 5th September, no one called to see the documents and inquire about them—the 3d of November was the first time that any one came to see them—on that day Mr. Hartwell Roe, and Mr. Collis, an attorney, acting for him, called—they called twice on the 3d, and remained for a long time on both occasions—I showed them the letter, cheque, and envelope, and they examined them very carefully; they used a lens, or microscope—I am not sure whether that was on the first occasion, but they did after<lb></lb>wards, certainly—they used very powerful lenses, I am not sure about the microscope—on 5th Mr. Collis called alone, and on 6th Mr. Collis and Mr. Hartwell Roe both called again—on 8th I endeavoured to obtain from Messrs. Brocklehurst some cheques and papers so that I might compare them—I did not receive them—they attended with them—I did not have the custody of them—they brought them so that they might be compared—they brought cheques of the testators; not letters—I also procured some letters through the prisoner—Mr. Loney supplied Mr. Coote with them, and Mr. Coote gave them over to me—I think that was before he went to Macclesfield—I asked him to let me see some of the documents that I might compare them—Mr. Loney did not bring any to me—he brought them to Mr. Coote—they were writings containing accounts; not strictly letters, any of them—I think I have them here—it was such writing of the testator as he was able to furnish us with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you yourself compare those documents, and also the documents that Mr. Brocklehurst submitted to you with these documents that are now produced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were compared at the time by experts—I looked at them—I compared those I received from Mr. Coote, and also those I received from Messrs. Brocklehurst—the result of that comparison in my own mind was that I was satisfied there appeared to be a great similarity in the writing, so strong that I had no doubt they were the same—the suit was commenced before that, and we went on with it—it was not commenced before the documents ere received by Mr. Coote from Mr. Loney—I com<lb></lb>pared</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186108190032"></xptr>
               <p>those documents with the cheque and envelope, and was satisfied with the comparison, and subsequently to that instituted the suit—I then com<lb></lb>pared them with the cheque received from Messrs. Brocklehurst, and was satisfied then—on 15th I produced the letter, cheque, and envelope to two experts, Mr. Netherclift and Mr. Adlard—Mr. Hartwell Roe was with them, and Mr. Collis also—they brought the experts with them—they are men of great celebrity—they all four examined them for more than an hour—on 17th Mr. Cooke, another expert, compared the documents with the cheques I had obtained from Mr. Brocklehurst—Mr. Cooke was called in by us for our own protection—I think we did it as a proper precaution—we thought it a right step to take—Mr. Cooke is a gentleman of eminence as an expert—on 19th I also called in Mr. Lane—he bad made an appointment to come on 17th, but did not come till the 19th—he examined them carefully on 19th, with magnifying glasses, and so on—I do not think he measured them with a compass—I think Mr. Hartwell Roe did so—I can hardly say; so much has been done—on 17th Mr. Adlard, Mr. Hartwell Roe, and Mr. Collis again called to see them, and again examined them for a considerable time—on 28th Mr. Brocklehurst called with Mr. Hartwell Roe and Mr. Collis, and they again examined them very carefully—on 3d December Mr. Adlard, Mr. Collis, and Mr. Hartwell Roe again called and saw them, and they then examined them for a considerable time—on 15th a man named Burgess and Mr. Stainbridge called; they did not see them on that day, but they did on the 18th—they were sent by Messrs. Brocklehurst—I do not know what Burgess is—I believe he has been a policeman—Stainbridge is a clerk in the General Post Office—he came to look at the post office stamps—they inspected them carefully—the experts, introduced by Mr. Hartwell Roe, never expressed any opinion at all in my presence—having been present at all these examinations I was still satisfied and still continued the suit—on 7th January I received a letter from Messrs. Brocklehurst, asking me to give a photograph copy, and I said they could have it if they liked—I was first told anything about Mr. Surrey on 24th January; that was by Mr. Parrott—I believe he is the attorney for John Orme Roe—up to that time I had not any reason whatever to doubt the genuineness of these documents—there were many insinuations made during my stay at Macclesfield, but no positive statement was made to me before the 24th—I discontinued the suit in consequence of what Mr. Surrey stated.</p>

GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you abandon all proceedings in the suit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave notice to Mr. Roe, on my interview on the 26th, that we should not continue any farther to act in the suit, and he must appoint some one else—I did not take any further steps in it, except so far as I was required to take for the purpose of depositing the documents—the prisoner did not him<lb></lb>self come to me to demand the documents, but in consequence of the order, I deposited them in the Court of Chancery—I never saw the testator, and never saw him write—I had formed no opinion whatever of his handwriting except from comparison of documents; they appeared to me to be precisely alike—if I had known that the envelope was a forged one, probably I should have formed a different judgment as to the likeness of the handwriting—the statement of Mr. Surrey certainly influenced me in my conduct afterwards—I am not aware that Mr. Coote has been subpoenaed on behalf of the prisoner—I first heard of the name of Mr. Hollway I think, on 19th June—if his name is not mentioned in the bill, that was the act of the counsel who drew it, not mine, I gave the name to the equity draftsman—I do not know of the name being communicated to the defendants in the suit—they</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the post-office at Macclesfield—it was part of my duty in 1858 and 1859 to change the date of the post-office endorsing stamps—in the course of business at the post-office, I change the endorsing stamp at different periods of the day—it is part of my duty before I stamp any letters, to take an impression of the stamp, when changed, on a piece of paper kept for that purpose—the stamps are changed now at 12 o'clock at noon, and about 5 in the afternoon—the letter D is put in at 12—the letter A is put in up to 12, B at 12, and C at 5—in the month of January, 1859, the letter B was lost, we used the letter D instead—I have got the sheet here on which the impressions were made by me when I changed the stamps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I first used the letter D on 3d of January—on 1st January I used the letters A, B, and C—this envelope could not have passed through our post-office on 1st January, 1859—I continued to use the letter D up to the 9th of May; all the letters passing through the Macclesfield post-office, which were posted between 12 and 5, from 3d of January to 9th of May in that year, would bear the letter D on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Some question has been raised about what you call the D on that envelope, can you tell me whether that is C turned upside down, or D? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is D, because C was not used turned upside down in that way; if the</p>

               <p>C had been turned upside down by mistake in the stamp, I should have found it on my impression—there is no impression of C turned upside down on that day; it is correct on that day—that impression is made before any letters are stamped—a letter posted at Macclesfield on 1st January, 1859, would go to Bath by railway, by the night mail, which leaves Macclesfield about quarter-past 10 in the evening—it could not in course of post arrive at Bath until after 12 o'clock on that night—I cannot say at what time it would arrive at Bath.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Mr. Higginbotham, an attorney, come on behalf of the prisoner and request to see this book. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I declined to show it to him until I had permission—the first change here is on January 1st, 1858—the figure eight had not been changed, it was afterwards altered to nine—I accidentally omitted to change it—I altered it with a pen I believe—the second stamp was also an eight, and is now altered into a nine—that was done at the time the impression was taken—I did not stamp the letters in that way before—I altered this instead of making another impression—I altered it with a pen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The first stamp is "A, January 1, 1858," which you altered into 1859, and the second stamp is B, that commences at 12 o'clock, so that up to 12 o'clock you must have been stamping the letters 1858? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe they are two distinct stamps; we use two stamps—we never use a D except as a substitute; it is used at some offices—the letter B was lost on 3d January—there is no B used on the 2d, that was Sunday; we never use B on Sun<lb></lb>day—the letter C has been used turned upside down occasionally—this letter on the envelope is not a C turned upside down; it is a different shape altogether, it is not like it at all—I think there are some days upon which I have omitted to stamp the book at all—on 2d March it is not stamped—the mode of stamping is to have a cloth or flannel saturated with ink, to place the stamp upon that, and then to stamp it on the paper—if we get the stamp full of ink we make a very strong impression; but if it only sucks up a small quantity of ink we only get a very dull impression; we stamp it on the blotting pad for each impression; it is quite necessary—if the im<lb></lb>pression is dull it would be because the pad required more ink I should think—I do not stamp all the letters myself—there are two deliveries a day from Macclesfield—we have several despatches, five now—we call these des<lb></lb>patches—the letters are not used to indicate which despatch it is by, but to show what time it is posted—the letter A would show that it was posted before 12—I have seen Mr. Coote—I believe he came to our office—Miss Serjeant, the postmistress, saw him, not in my presence—she is not here—I always take the impression of the stamp in this book—I did not speak to Mr. Coote when he came down to see the postmistress—I did not see him produce the envelope that has been handed in to-day—I cannot tell what month it was in that I saw him there—I do not know whether it was in September—I was not examined at Macclesfield for the purposes of the Chancery suit—I was examined at Bow-street; that was the first time—I have occasional holidays in the summer—I did not give Mr. Hartwell Roe information about this matter—I saw him once or twice in Macclesfield—he came to see the book—the postmistress gave him information—I think he saw the book; it was shown to Mr. Collis and also to Whicher, the de<lb></lb>tective—we had not permission to show it to Mr. Higginbotham.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the Bath post—office, and was so in januray, 1859—the bath post mark upon this envelope is not a genuine post mark—I am able to say that positively—a letter posted at Macclesfield 1st january, and getting to bath by the night mail, would bear the bath post mark of 2d January, but it would have a different index letter to that given in the stamp—I am speakingfrom the general routine of duty—it would have a different index letter upon the post mark—I know the prisoner—I remem<lb></lb>ber his calling at the Bath post office, sometime in the year 1860—I cannot say distinctly what mouth it was in; I made no note of it—I should imagine it was somewhere in july or August—I saw him—he asked if he could be allowed to see the book in which impressions from the date stamp were made of 1st January, 1859—I requested him to call the following moring, and I would let him see it if it was in the office—he called the fol<lb></lb>lowing moring; I saw him—I had searched for the book in the mean time and found that it had been sent to the Gneral post-office, in the ordinary course of business—I told the prisoner that it was not there.</p>

               <p>stamped is one similar to that produced—we use six or seven letters, or perhaps more, A, B, C, D, and so on—we do use an A—when I said that A would be the wrong index letter, I meant that it would be wrong for a letter coming from London—I thought the question I was asked was as to a letter coming by way of London—A would be the proper index letter from Mac<lb></lb>clesfield—I dare say in our office, as in others, we sometimes make a clear im<lb></lb>pression, and sometimes a dull one, according to the state of the ink.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have already told me that, to the best of your belief, it was the end of August or the beginning of September. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I alluded to Mr. Roe calling—I believe the gentleman with the envelope called before Mr. Roe, but I cannot say the precise date—I intended to have said it was about the end of August, or the beginning of September that Mr. Roe called—there are clerks in the sorting office at Bath below me—they would not have anything to do with the stamps—it is the stamper's duty to alter the stamps; the clerks do not do that, if they want to use it they can, but there is a distinct man for that duty, called the stamper—there are two or there stampers—the stamps are locked up in charge of the stamper then on duty—none of the stampers are here—I was subpoenaed yesterday morning—I had been given to understand I should not be required—I had seen Mr. Hartwell Roe on the previous Saturday—I only saw him once—I told Mr. Roe what I knew about it—I told him I was quite sure this was not the envelope, at least, I had not seen the envelope before this morning—he came to inquire if the prisoner had ever made inquiries about the stamp—I told him very nearly all that I have told you, not quite—I did not tell him about this envelope of course, because I had never seen it: I could not have done so—I showed him the impressions in this book—I had had an order to do so, from the Post-master general—he did not bring the order with him; but I had a written order to give information, although they had never</p>

C. Wyld, Cheltenham—it might have been C. J.—I know there was a J. and a C, but which stood first I cannot recollect—I forwarded that parcel as I had been directed, and re-directed it myself to Gloucester—I afterwards received a letter, I have not got it here, we kept it in the office fearing a second parcel should come, and in the course of a month or two it was destroyed—the effect of that letter was, that on the 11th, by the 8.10 train another parcel would come, and asking me to send it to the Gloucester station—that letter was in the name of Wyld—a parcel did come on the 11th by the 8.10 train from London, addressed the same as the previous one—I forwarded that in the same way to Gloucester—we booked it oh the 12th—in the early part of the following November, the prisoner called at our office at Cheltenham—he said, "Have you any parcels for the Rev.

Q.</hi> And by Mr. Hart well Roe also? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw Mr. Hartwell Roe at the same time—he talked to me about this matter—Mr. Humphreys put these letters before me; Mr. Hartwell Roe was in theroom—Icannotsay whether it was towards the end of last year that the inquiry about the envelopes took place, it was a circumstance that did not impress me at the time—it was not as late as August or September last year, it was much earlier than that—I should think it was most likely to have been at the time he went over our premises—I did not give a written statement of the evidence I could give—Mr. Humphreys made a copy of what I stated—I should say it was in 1860 that the prisoner spoke about the envelopes; but it is a thing that I took no notice of at the time and I cannot charge my memory with it—I can give the date of his going over our premises exactly; it was 30th April, 1860—I should say the inquiry about the, stamps was before, but I really could not say—the prisoner removed from Coomb Hay to Gloucester—after his removal I continued to send him copies of the publication, back numbers, to his address at College-green, Gloucester—there were several numbers printed about the same time, in December, 1858—I believe I printed one number before 14th February, if not more—I printed a number together—I cannot say whether I sent them all off together, most likely they have gone together—we printed generally once a week—I sent him sufficient for the current supply, and afterwards sent a parcel containing the back numbers—if several numbers were printed together, we should send him at the time sufficient for his circulation, and afterwards send the back numbers—letters were occasionally inclosed with those parcels—soon after he left Cheltenham his letters were delivered at our place in Milsom—street—two or three letters remained a considerable</p>

               <p>time at our place—the only reason why they remained was because they had been overlooked, otherwise we should have sent them off sooner—I cannot say that they were dispatched in a packet of books; the mode I adopted was to send on his letters as soon as I received them, but as time went on, from his leaving, the letters came few and far between, and then they may have laid there two or three weeks—I did not, to my knowledge, on one occasion send him a suit of regimentals in one of the packets; I do not remember it—I did not pack the parcels myself—I suppose the back numbers would not come into use till the first issue was exhausted; I do not know what he would do with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Hollway—I remember the prisoner calling at his place of business at Bath, in April, 1860—he spoke to me—he said, with Mr. Hollway's permission, I was to show him over the process of lithography—I did show him—he was there about three quarters of an hour altogether, I should think—he inquired very minutely into the practical working, and also as to the various kinds of pens that were used—I showed him the various sorts of pens which were used—he used one pen himself, on transfer paper, merely to try his skill in using the pen; he could use it—from the conversation I had with him, I am able to say that he had some knowledge of the art—it appeared to me, from the conversation, that there was some difficulty in the process which he could not get over, and he came to me to make it out—I know that this was 30th April, 1860 from an entry I made in the book at the time; I have it here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I speak positively to the date, from that entry—he has not examined the process on other occasions besides this once, neither before or since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you ever shown other people over your works? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; nobody at all—I was not aware at the time that he had a lithographic press, I only know it from hearsay—I did not know at that time that he was proposing to take out a patent for a lithographic press—not before the last half hour—I inferred there were some difficulties from what he said; I explained the process to him as minutely as I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lithographer—about the month of May or June, 1860, I had a lithographic press for sale—between the latter end of May and the middle of June, 1860 the prisoner called upon me to look at the press, and afterwards purchased it of me—he called upon me from time to time after he had purchased it, and had conversations with me about the mode of working it—he seemed to understand the process pretty well I thought—I remember being at work upon a job one day when the prisoner came in—he asked me something about lithography, and he tried the press that I was using, a few times; what we call rolling—he rolled a copy of what I was doing, off; he seemed to do it pretty well, I thought.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the M Division, detective police—I received a warrant for the apprehension of the prisoner on 9th, May—I endeavoured to take him immediately, and was successful on 20th—I had been looking for him in the meantime—on Monday, 20th, I saw him in Hatton-garden between 9 and 10 in the evening—I said to him, "I believe you are the Rev. James Roe"—he made no answer, and I then said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186108190042"></xptr>
               <p>"I believe your name is Roe, is it not?"—he said, "I decline to answer that question; but why do you ask?"—I said, "I am a police officer and hold a warrant for your apprehension, charging you with uttering a forged document for 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>".—he made no reply, but turned round to a lady, his wife, who was walking with him—I then went to No. 35, or 36, Hatton-wall, to his lodgings, and there read the warrant to him—he asked several times to see Mr. Roe, and I said, "Mr. Roe is at the bottom of the street if you wish to see him;" but I said if it was with a view of stopping these proceedings I could not allow him to see him, as the warrant was executed—I then took him to the police-station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had Mr. Roe been about with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; assisting me—Mr. Hartwell Roe had a cigar in his mouth at the time I took the pri<lb></lb>soner—I went with Mr. Hartwell Roe to Mr. Chandler's, at Gloucester—I was introduced there by him as Mr. Wilson, an attorney from Cambridge, and I adopted that—Mr. Chandler is a very respectable man, a friend of the prisoner's—I appeared as an attorney because I understood that Mr. Chand<lb></lb>ler could give information where the prisoner was; and I thought if I was to represent myself as a police officer, I should not, perhaps, get what I wanted—I did not go as an attorney to Mrs. Sale also—I went as Mr. Wilson; bat not an attorney—she said she knew I was a lawyer, and I did not contradict her—I did not tell her I was a police-officer—nothing was said about being a friend of Mr. Roe's—I did not ask Mrs. Sale to give evidence, nor did Mr. Roe—we asked her for the prisoner's address—there was some conversation about her being indebted to Mr. Roe the costs of the suit—he said he could have her arrested if he thought proper—nothing was said about her giving evidence—he wanted her to give Mr. James Roe's address—he did not say he was going to prosecute him for forgery or for anything—he said nothing at all about evidence—I don't believe he did—we did not wish her to know that we were about apprehending him—we were endeavouring to get his address from her, and in consequence of her refusing to give it Mr. Roe said, "I think you ought; as you know if I thought proper I could have you arrested for the costs"—Mr. Roe did not say to Mr. Chandler that he was going to prosecute the prisoner, but he would not proceed against him if he would withdraw his claim, nor anything to that effect—Mr. Chandler wanted to know what we wanted to find the prisoner for, and Mr. Roe said it was to settle the matter—that was on 15th May, after the warrant was out—I had the warrant in my pocket at that time—he did not say if a bond of indemnity was given against the claim he would withdraw the proceedings—the wanting to settle it was a mere subterfuge—no terms of settlement were named—Mr. Chandler said, "Before I give you any information, Mr. Roe is a friend of mine; you want to apprehend him, if you do, I will not give you any information," and upon that Mr. Roe said that he wanted to settle it—I do not believe he said anything to the effect that he would withdraw from the proceedings if a bond of indemnity was given—he certainly said he wanted to see him to settle the matter.</p>

Johnson and Coote—I knew nothing at all about John Orme Roe—I knew none of them: in fact I am engaged in trade, and that has made all the difference in the family—I never knew any of my relatives—those who are in professions are separated from those who are in trade—when I heard of this cheque I went to Mr. Johnson's to examine it—I went frequently—took Mr. Netherclift and Adlard, the experts, with me—I did not meet Mr. Cooke, another expert there—I did not know that he had been—I heard that Mr. Coote had had parties there, but I cannot speak of my own knowledge—I took Mr. Netherclift, and Mr. Adlard on one occasion with me to examine the documents, and on several occcasions I took Mr. Adlard himself—Mr. Collis also went with me, or more properly speaking, I went with him—I also went with Mr. Brocklehurst—I got cheques from Mr. Brocklehurst for Mr. Johnson to examine—I think Mr. Collis had them—I do not know whether they were left with Mr. Johnson—I went to Mr. Chandler with the detective, and introduced him as Mr. Wilson, an attorney—I did not introduce him to Mrs. Sale as Mr. Wilson—he called himself Wilson—I did not tell Mr. Chandler that all I wanted was an indemnity against the claim, nor anything to that effect—I said we wanted to find the prisoner—I did not say I wanted to settle it—certainly</p>

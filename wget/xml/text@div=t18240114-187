I asked how they came possessed of it. Stevens said he had taken it out of pawn that morning. I asked how he got it before he pawned it - he gave no answer. Bennett then called me aside, and said,</p>
               <p>"The harness was stolen last night from Clerkenwell." I said,</p>
               <p>"Then you know something about it?" He said,</p>

I went to the coffee-shop at the corner of Fleet-market next morning, and saw the prisoners with the harness on the table. Bennett was cleaning the bridle; he threw a handkerchief over it, and went out. I went over to Stevens and said,</p>
               <p>"I think that harness has been stolen, for Bennett has been out all night." He said,</p>
               <p>"No, for I took it out of pawn this morning." Bennett brought a man in to buy it, but he would not, as he could not satisfy him how he got it.</p>

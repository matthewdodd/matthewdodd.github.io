                  </persName>. I am a shoemaker, and lodge in Harley-street—the prisoner lodged in the next room. On the 22nd of November I went out, leaving my watch hanging by the side of the window—I returned in ten minutes and it was gone—I asked the prisoner if any one had been up in my room—she said "No"—I went out in the evening and found it had been pledged at Mr. Greaves's—this is it—<hi rend="italic">(looking at it.)</hi>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you leave your door open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I shut it, but did not lock it—I told the prisoner I had lost my watch, and she expressed sorrow—I took an officer and asked the prisoner to go with me to the pawnbroker's—she went willingly, and when he indentified her she denied it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="largeCaps">JAMES CHESTER</hi>. I am in the service of a pawnbroker. This watch was pawned by the prisoner on the 22nd of November, about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you always been as sure of her as you are now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I expressed an opinion that it was a stouter person—I should not like to swear positively that the prisoner is the person—I believe she is, but I have heard of a person so very similar to her, that it is possible I may be mistaken.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SAMUEL NEWSOME</hi>. I am the landlord of the house in which the pri<lb></lb>soner resides with her husband. I know a person who comes to my house who resembles the prisoner in appearance, and I have made every effort in my power to find that person—I had seen her in my house the day pre<lb></lb>vious to the robbery, and I could not positively swear but that she was there on the day of the robbery—she formerly lived at the next house.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. How long did you search for that person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly two days—I went to the person who moved her things, and he said it was ten or twelve doors down Phoenix-street—Mr. Alderton went with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ALDERTON</hi>. I am a carman, and live in Little Marylebone-street.</p>
               <p>I have known the prisoner seven years, she has been strictly honest—I went with the last witness, to search for a person for nearly two days—we did all in our power to find her.</p>

               <p>twelve doors down Greek-street, by the person who keeps a coffee-shop, where she had lodged—the man who moved her things said it was eight or ten doors in Phoenix-street—we went to nine houses.</p>

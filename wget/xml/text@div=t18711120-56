                  </hi>. I am a Doctor of Medicine, and live at 22, Caledonian Road—about 12.30 on the morning of 14th November, I was going home with a friend—I went into the Peacock, near the Angel, Isling<lb></lb>ton, to have a glass of ale—as I came out I was surrounded by four men; my hands were pinned to my side, and my hat was knocked over my head—I felt my watch go from my pocket—I saw the prisoner run away, through an alley—I was speaking to a man on the pavement, and the prisoner came back through the alley right into my arms—I held him until Detective Dudley came to the rescue—the three other men came up, and I thought Dudley would be overpowered—a policeman came up then—Dudley asked the prisoner for the watch—he denied having it—they took him to a lamp-post—he was very violent, and they threw him on his back—I saw the watch taken from his hand, under the lamp post—this is the watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was about 12.45 when I went into the public-house—I had not been drinking before—I did not see any of the men in the Peacock, to my knowledge—I am quite certain there were four men—I was completely surrounded, and my arms pinned down, and my hat was crushed on my head—I don't know which of them did that—it was all done momentarily.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer N</hi>). On the night of this occurrence I saw Dr. Spurin come out of the Peacock—four men fell on him as he came out—the prisoner was one of them—the prosecutor had not got four yards from the door when the four men jumped on him, and I saw his hat smashed on his head—the prisoner got hold of his watch, and ran away with it up a passage called Field Place into High Street again, turned to the left into Chapel Street, Clerkenwell, and there he crossed the road and ran through the passage again—he ran against the gentleman, and they went across the road together—I got hold of the prisoner's right hand, and the other officer got his left—as I closed on him he pulled his right hand out of his pocket—I seized his hand—we conveyed him to a lamp-post—I got hold of his fingers, and the gentleman took the watch out of his hand and gave it to me—I had asked him to give me the watch, but he would not—he squeezed it so that the glass broke in his hand—I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been standing close to the Peacock watching the four men—I was about four yards from them—I saw the prosecutor's hat crushed—I did not see his arms held down by his side—I believe the four of them crushed his hat—I can distinctly say I saw the prisoner crush his hat—the prisoner is no stranger to me, and I am able to say he was one of the men—the other three men ran away—I did not follow them—I ran after this man because he had the watch.</p>

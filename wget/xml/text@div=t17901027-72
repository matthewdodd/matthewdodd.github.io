               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes; the night that this affair happened, it seems he brought the prosecutrix to my door; she was very much disguised in liquor; and the woman that was in my place led her in, and she said, she wanted a lodging, and her things dropped with wet, very wet she was; I looked at her, and saw she had no cap on nor handkerchief, nor nothing, and her head was very bare; I said to the two women that were in my house, mind and take notice what she has got on; one of the women I keep by the week; I give her a shilling a week, victuals, drink, washing, and lodging, to do about the place, because I am not able to do it myself; and the other woman lodges with me.</p>
               <p>Then that this first woman is a servant? - Yes, Sir; I said to the two women, look in what a condition she is in; and Mrs. Adams sat down, and swore very wickedly, in a very wicked manner, how she would have some gin; and I seeing her very much disguised, I said, you had better not have any more; with that she took out a few halfpence and a sixpence out of her pocket, and she said, I will have some gin, and I could not pacify her till she had had half a pint; I said, it is needless for you to have any, for none of us can drink any, for I never drink any; in a little while after she said she would lay there, and we were but just moved into the house; I had but two beds, because I keep a broker's shop, and a cloaths shop besides, and we put the two women to lay there for safety; so I said, we have never a bed for you here, but if you come to our other house I can let you lay there by yourself; and I and the other young woman took her down to the other house, to let her lay there: and I said, now will you go to bed? and she said, no, not till I please, and she swore very wickedly: says she, I will not go out till you have me in the scouts: says I, I do not know what you mean! says she, I have lost my tail and cap, and I will charge you, you have got it; and I said, I can bring witness that you had it not when you came to my place.</p>
               <p>When did she leave your house? - That same night, she was led out.</p>
               <p>At what hour? - Why, I believe, to the best of my knowledge, it might be about half past eleven.</p>
               <p>What time did she come? - She came, I believe, about ten: I think it was, to the best of my knowledge, but I cannot take upon me to say exactly the time, but I think it was to the best of my memory.</p>
               <p>Had she any think else, besides gin? - No, Sir, I would not let her.</p>
               <p>Did any body drink any of the gin with her? - No; Sir, we did not drink any, only the young woman that had helped her out of my place; she drank one glass, but I would not let her have any more: I knew the prisoner before, by seeing him about with sheeps heads.</p>
               <p>Are you any way related to the prisoner? - No, Sir, no more than you are.</p>

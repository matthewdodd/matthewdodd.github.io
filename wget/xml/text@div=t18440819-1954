                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Ray, and live in North-street, Limehouse-fields. On the 29th of July, my husband went to the North Pole public-house to have some beer—I went after him—the prisoner snatched out of his band a paper with the numbers of some bank notes that he bad lost—I said to him, "You do not know the consequence that might be of"—he then smacked my face, and afterwards repeated it a second and a third time; and he ill-used my husband dreadfully—about half-past six o'clock next morn<lb></lb>ing, my daughter went out to her work, and left the street door open—I was going to wash, when the prisoner came into the kitchen, and knocked me down with his fist—it was a severe blow under the ear—I had not spoken to him—as soon as I got up and recovered myself, I went into the street, and said, "Oh, you villain"—he walked out of my own place, and struck me a severe blow on my head with an iron instrument, a piece of an auger, which had been in my house—it cut my head," which bled very much—I was swamped with blood—I was taken to the hospital—I did not know any more till after I was at the hospital—I was there a fortnight.</p>

On the morning of the 30th of July, about half-past six o'clock, I saw Mrs. Ray in the street, and Mr. Ray in his bed-room—words occurred between them, but I cannot say what it was, but I heard Mrs. Ray say, running across to the prisoner's door, "There, do you hear that"—I saw no more then—I afterwards saw the prisoner strike Mr. Ray with the iron—I did not see Mrs. Ray struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gerrard-street, Islington. I was house-surgeon at the London Hospital at this time—I examined Mrs. Ray on the morning of the 3rd of July, and found a lacerated wound of the scalp on the left side of the head—she had lost a considerable quantity of blood—this auger was a very likely thing to produce the mischief—she was in considerable danger afterwards, when reaction took place—she was ill about ten days or a fortnight—her illness was occasioned by the wound.</p>

About a quarter to six on this morning I was in bed, and was awoke by a disturbance in the street—I got up to see what was the matter, and found Mrs. Ray trying to break the prisoner's door open, first pushing with her back, and then kicking with her feet, and using all manner of abusive language—finding she could not get the door open, she tried at the shutters—she continued doing so some time, and at last went away—the prisoner came out to remonstrate with her, he went over the way to her house, and was not there half a moment—in coming back again, Mrs. Ray followed him with the auger in her hand, and, before he could close his door, she got the auger between the door and door-post, and prevented his shutting it—finding he could not shut the door, he came out, took it away from her, and hit her on the head with it—she bled—Ray at the same time came running out of the house with a bed-rail in his hand, and struck the prisoner over the shoulders.</p>

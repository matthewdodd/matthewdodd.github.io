            ; Mullen had forgot something, and went back to the coffee-house, and asked Warren for a direction where he should join them; this was just across the street; Warren gave him a direction to a house of which the last name of the firm was Johnson, and told him the street, and the number of the house; we went on, to go to the warehouse, and I asked him if it was far off; then we went on, and came to a public-house in Bunhill-row, kept by Fitshee; I asked him whether we were now near the warehouse; he said, just by, but he had some errand to call on at that public-house; he asked me in; he should not stop, he would not desire me to sit down; we went into the house, and Warren called for a room; I sat down at the head of the table, and Warren on my left, and the other on my right, who has escaped; they asked me to drink; they called for a glass of rum and water; I refused to sit down; before that was come, a stranger came, and begged pardon for coming in, but asked leave to sit down; that person was Oxton; he sat by, at a little distance, and began talking that he was very much fatigued with his journey, for he had come about ninety miles; he asked Warren, (who called himself Johnson, describing himself as the last person in the firm; he had heard my name in the coffee-room, and shook hands with me; glad he was to see his namesake, and would serve me still on lower terms:) Oxton asked Warren if he should be able to get him a porter, to shew him (Oxton) the other side of the water; he wished to get an honest man, for he was a man of property, that he might not be taken in by him, as being a stranger: Warren said to him, he did not appear to be a man of property; Oxton seemed to be affronted at this; he put his hands by the side of his coat, and pulled out a quantity of notes, in a shabby-looking pocketbook, and said, I have fourteen or fifteen hundred pounds, why do you talk so to me? A parcel of beggars and day-labourers, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080050"></xptr>talk to me in such a stile! You cannot even shew me gold, instead of Bank notes! Warren took out of his pocket one or two guineas, and said, here is gold; says the man who escaped, I do not know whether I have gold or no, and pulled out a guinea or half a guinea; and Warren asked me if I had any gold; I told him I had got no gold, nor silver, except half-a-guinea: Oxton then said, I will hold you twenty pounds to ten, that you do not produce me an hundred pounds; this he said to Warren: Warren then asked me if I had got any notes about me; I told him I had not, but I had some bills on banks here, and I was going to purchase goods, and should draw the money that afternoon: Warren said he was going to the Bank this afternoon, and to do some business for the house, and to draw money; he seemed very glad, and said we will both go together; Warren had laid down the bet of 10 l. note, and Oxton laid down the 20 l. note, as they said it was, I did not examine it, and they were put into the other man's hands, and we went away to the bank together, I and Warren, according to agreement, and got the bill accepted for next day; Oxton and the other man staid in the public-house till we were to come back: Warren said, as we could not then be paid, what will you do now? I said it made no odds to me: he then advised me to go to some place and buy five pounds worth of goods, and they would give me the balance: I then said, I would call on Mr. Clark, an acquaintance of my own, and he probably would discount it: I did not know the distance, he said: we took a coach, and I told the coachman to drive to the Swan with Two Necks, and Waring called there for Mullen, and then we went to Mr. Clark's, and he discounted the bill; I desired him to stay there till I returned; when I came back, he was in Lad-lane; he asked me whether I had done my business, and got the money now: I told him I had got a check on Mr. Clark's banker, and was going to get the money; he seemed to be very glad; I asked Waring where he was going to draw his money, to make his shew; he said, I have done that, I have drawn three or four hundred pounds; he asked me what banker I had got the check upon; I told him; he asked me if I knew where it was; I told him no; he said he would go along with me; he did so; I presented the check, and was paid in four 20 l. Bank notes, nineteen guineas, and a shilling; this was paid in the presence of Warren: we came out of the Bank; Warren seemed very glad, and said, now we will take a coach; in the coach he told me he was a man of fortune, seven or eight hundred pounds a year, besides his business, and would serve me remarkably cheap; we found Oxton and the other man exactly as we left them, and sat down on the same seat, and Warren sat on my left, and Oxton asked Warren if he had done his business; he said he had. Warren and the other man asked me what I would drink; Oxton says, taste something now you have been out; he asked me to drink some wine and water; I did. I then told them I had occasion to go to the door; I was going out at the front door, and he pulled me by the coat, and said, here was a more private place, and I wished still to go out at the fore-door; they said this is the room, then they wished me to drink again. Oxton began talking, and said that last night he picked up a girl at Covent Garden, and went home with her, and there was a person in the house, and the supper not being ready, he and the person had amused themselves with chalking; Warren said to Oxton, let me see what chalking for money is; I know not what it is: Oxton says, if I had a piece of chalk, I would let you see. Oxton got a bit of chalk, I do not know where he got it, and laid his hat down; the other man was entertaining me about Scotch cattle, stating that he had formerly been a drover; then about two minutes they had a good scolding, Oxton and Warren had, and Oxton rose up to get away; and then Oxton said to Warren, can you let me see the money you promised to produce? Yes, Warren says, I can shew you money and more, and laid down his pocket-book and did not take out the notes;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080051"></xptr>and says, Mr. Johnson, how many notes, or how much money have you got? I cannot positively recollect: he knew perfectly well what I had, and I think he said how much money I had; he desired me to take out my money; I then took out my pocket-book, and took out of it four twenty pound bank notes, the notes I had received at the banker's, and laid them down on the table, and my left-hand firm on the notes; my nineteen guineas in gold was in my right-hand pocket: Warren says, take out your gold; I then took out eighteen guineas and put it down, and had hardly counted it, while Oxton wished to get a hand of the money; my left hand was both upon the money and the notes; indeed both my right-hand and my left; I put the guineas on the notes, just by the edges; and while I put my right hand into my pocket to take out the gold, my left hand was on the notes, and I kept both my hands on the notes: Oxton then put up both his hands for the money; I did not know what he meant: Warren was on the right-hand, Oxton was at the foot, holding out both his hands for the money; Warren then lifted up my left hand to enable him to get the money by force: his right-hand was towards my left, he griped it up, and assisted Oxton with the money. He kept my hands with one hand, and shoved the money to Oxton; and the other man that has escaped, he took hold of the other hand, and assisted likewise. Warren swept it cross the table to Oxton, both the money and the notes; the other man assisted likewise, just as Warren did. Oxton took the money and notes right off the table, and put it into his pockets, and was going off with it to the door immediately, as quick as he could; the man on my righthand, who escaped, followed Oxton as fast as he could, and Warren was the last out of the room. I attempted to get out before him, and he pushed me back, till he got out. When he went out at the door, he shut the door after him as fast as he could: I lost sight of him till I opened the door, and I went after them; they all three went out at the outward street-door; I looked round me when I came out, and I saw Oxton running down the street as fast as he could. I saw the other two at the same time, Warren running the same way as Oxton; I observed perfectly where he run to; Warren went into some place and shut the door, but I still ran after Oxton; the other man ran a contrary way. I followed Oxton, and called out stop thief; a young lad took him hold by the tail of his coat: I come up to him in a very short time, the lad had him; this lad and another man was holding him when I came up to him: I laid hold of him by the breast, and brought him to Mr. Fitzhees public-house, where we were before, and into the same room, and he asked me what he had got of me; says I, four twenty pound notes, and eighteen guineas in gold; he acknowledged he had; and I said to him, give me my money this moment: yes, says he, I will give you your money, but I do not choose to do it before so many people. I ordered the people all out except six or seven: I shut the door upon them, I then come back to get my money of him: says I, give me my money now; he then said no, without that the whole of the people should go out; I then told him I would have my money directly; Oxton then put his hand into his breeches pocket, and took out the gold before these persons: he says, there is the gold, and was counting it on the table, and the constable was wanting to get in, and Oxton told me to let nobody in; the door not being open, the constable opened a window and got in, and asked what was the matter; then Oxton put the money into his pocket again; I told the constable what was done, he demanded the money, and Oxton refused to give it at all; he then seized him immediately, and took the money out of Oxton's pocket, four twenty pound notes, and the gold; he took the twenty pound notes from his right waistcoat pocket, I am not certain as to the gold. The constable then told him he must go to the Justice; and the constable and I, and two or three more, came out and had a coach, and conveyed him to a magistrate, and there he was committed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Have you been in town before? - No, never out of Scotland before.</p>
               <p>What became of Mullen? - He went home about a week after this happened.</p>
               <p>You knew the town; was not you recommended to any body in town? - No.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in town? - About four or five days before this happened.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - About twenty-four.</p>
               <p>You seemed to have closed your acquaintance with Warren very easily? - I took him to be a friend, to be sure.</p>
               <p>What made you take him to be a friend, only having that small opportunity of knowing any thing of him? - Because I did not presume that any body would do such a thing, whom I found at such a respectable coffee-house.</p>
               <p>When you went away from this public-house with Warren, what should lead you to discount your bill at this time? - Because I wished to draw my money from the banker's to buy goods.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it you returned to this public-house, before you saw Oxton? - Between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you mean to purchase articles that day? - I did positively.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go? - Because I could not get them out of the house.</p>
               <p>When you came back to this house, and had changed your note, you complied with Warren's request to go into the house; why did not you say, I cannot go into the house with you now? - He had this other man there that made up to him in the coffee-house, and he would call upon him before he would go.</p>
               <p>Then when he had an opportunity to go in and call upon his partner, what should induce you to go into the room, or to stay there; did you at all at that time, tell him you could stay no longer? - I did, I told him I did not choose to sit down at all.</p>
               <p>Why did you not choose it? - Because I wished to do my business.</p>
               <p>If you was determined to do your business, how came you to be such a fool as to take out this money? - Because I was attending upon Mr. Warren.</p>
               <p>What was there that induced you, wishing, as you did, to buy your goods, to have pulled out your money? - Because this man, Oxton, called us all beggars before.</p>
               <p>What should induce him to call you beggars? - Because he had so much property upon him.</p>
               <p>So that he was vapouring you were beggars, and not fit to compare to him, and that was the reason, you, in order to shew you was no beggar, went to the banker's to get this money? - I told him I was going to draw money in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>What induced you to tell him you was going to draw money in the afternoon? - I do not know what induced me, I did not think of any accident happening to me.</p>
               <p>What time was this conversation about beggars? - About eleven o'clock, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Did Warren join any part of that conversation? - Yes, he did; he seemed to be a stranger, and as if he had never seen Oxton before.</p>
               <p>You was willing to shew you was not a beggar? - Warren asked me if I had any money on me to shew we were not beggars.</p>
               <p>Was there any bet made between you on this discovery? - Yes, after that Oxton said, I will hold you twenty pounds to ten pounds a-piece, that you do not produce me a hundred pounds; that was to Warren: Warren said he had not got so much, and then asked me if I had got so much; I told him I had not got one pound, I had but half a guinea; I told him I was going to draw some money at the bank that night; but that would not do for the mean time.</p>
               <p>Now in consequence of this, did not you go to the Bank for the express purpose, in order that you might shew the sum about you? - I did not, it was not in consequence to produce the money there again that I went back again.</p>
               <p>What after you had got away from Oxton, what should lead you back again to this place? - Because Warren would call there before he went to the ware-room.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080053"></xptr>Was any bet made between Oxton and and Warren? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you know you was coming back to this house in order to determine this bet? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>But you was going back to Oxton, had Warren got any money at that time; was Warren either to win the bet, in case of your producing the one hundred pounds, or his own producing one hundred pounds? - It was his own producing one hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Then Oxton challenged you both, that none of you, or altogether, could not produce an hundred pounds? - He did.</p>
               <p>Then you see, when you came back with the one hundred pounds, you could enable Warren to win the bet of twenty pounds, had you come on purpose for that? - No, but he desired me to take out the notes, to shew the man that we were not beggars.</p>
               <p>Now in the coach Warren began telling you the story about the chalking? - No, not in the coach; it was Oxton talked about it in the house.</p>
               <p>Oxton then and Warren shewed how the game was played among themselves? - I do not know as they played at all.</p>
               <p>What! did not Oxton and Warren play, or pretend to play, at this game of chalking? - I did not see the game at all, I saw Oxton chalking.</p>
               <p>When you came into the room, how were they situated that were left, and what did they say? - Oxton asked Warren if he had done his business; he said he had: Oxton then wished to sit at the end of the table.</p>
               <p>Did Warren then produce any notes? - No.</p>
               <p>What did Oxton do? - I then went out of the door, and did not know what they meant to be about, and I wished to ask the landlord about Oxton, because of the other two I had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go about your business and ask this question? - I went out on purpose, and Warren then followed me out to the door; I was going out at the fore-door, and he says, don't go that way, there is a privater place on the back way.</p>
               <p>Did this increase or diminish your suspicion; I should have thought that it was most probable, your suspicion would be extremely increased by Warren's wanting to keep you in the room? - Not at all, he did not wish to keep me in, only when I wanted to go out of the door.</p>
               <p>Having no resistance made to you, why did you not go from these people, and ask the landlord or landlady something about them? - I was coming in to do it, and passed the room-door, thinking Warren would have gone into the room again; and he takes hold of my coat, and said here is the room.</p>
               <p>I want to know why it was, when there was no absolute resistance made to you, and with these suspicions that you was with people that would possibly cheat you, that you did not get away from them? - Because the men were with me.</p>
               <p>So at length you did, notwithstanding your suspicions, come into the room with them again? - I had no suspicion at all of Warren and of the other man, my suspicion was of Oxton.</p>
               <p>When Warren and Oxton were describing the game of chalk, were they playing together? - I did not observe them playing.</p>
               <p>How long was this conversation with the pretended drover? - About three minutes.</p>
               <p>Had they made any chalk marks on the table? - Yes, they had.</p>
               <p>Did not they ask you to join in the game? - They did not at all; the other man and I were talking about Scotch cattle, and how he got his fortune.</p>
               <p>Was there no money staked on the table to play this game? - I did not see any money at all.</p>
               <p>You did not stake any money at all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Nor win any money? - Nor win any at all.</p>
               <p>Was not your suspicion doubly increased when you saw these marks on the table? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>How long was it after this before you was induced to lay your notes on the table? - In a very short time.</p>
               <p>How came you to lay your notes down?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080054"></xptr>- Because they disputed among themselves about the chalking; and then Oxton stood up, and seemed to take something amiss that Warren had said; and Oxton said to Warren, do what you promised, shew me the money; upon which Warren took out his pocket-book and said, there is money plenty.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect you was examined before the magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>What did you say there? - I said he took out his pocket-book.</p>


               <p>Only his pocket-book? - Only his pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Did you say at the magistrate's he took out nothing else? - He took it out, and opened it, and there seemed to be a large parcel of papers in it; he laid it down, and said to me, Mr. Johnson, how much money have you got? says I, you know perfectly well what I have got, because he was with me the same time when I drew the money.</p>
               <p>How did you proceed then? - I took the pocket-book out of my pocket, and took out the four twenty pound notes.</p>
               <p>Was not that on purpose to shew Oxton that you had so much money? - It was to be sure, and to shew Oxton I was not a beggar.</p>
               <p>Did you think there was any money in Warren's pocket? - I thought there was three hundred or four hundred pounds, I thought the English notes were all so as his appeared to be; I had never seen one in my life till that day I took the money from the Bank.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the magistrate on your examination, that Warren pulled out any notes? - I did not; the notes were in his pocketbook, and they had a large appearance.</p>
               <p>When was it you went to any body that you employed as a lawyer in this business? - I went to my friend Mr. Clarke that night, who was my particular friend; I went to him, and wished him to inform me how to behave, as I was a stranger.</p>
               <p>Did any body go with you? - The constable went with me.</p>
               <p>Was he the only person that directed you to an attorney? - The Justice directed me to an attorney.</p>
               <p>Did you employ the attorney whom the Justice directed you to? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Who is the gentleman that is employed by you here now? - Mr. Newman, I suppose you know the man.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the man to whom the Justice directed you? - I did, but the gentleman seemed to be engaged.</p>
               <p>Did the magistrate tell you that night, that he should look upon this as a felony? - He did.</p>
               <p>Now, if you please, we will go back to the public-house: during this time of chalking between these people, and Oxton's explaining the business to Warren, did not you join with them to wish to know what the game was? - No, I did not at all attend to that; we could not see at all.</p>
               <p>Of course then you will tell me that you did not play, or win any money at all? - I will tell you that plainly.</p>
               <p>And these men, Oxton or Warren did not play? - They did not play to my knowledge, Oxton was shewing how the person and him had behaved the night before.</p>
               <p>When this money was before you, did not Oxton pretend to have won this money? - He did not at all.</p>
               <p>What made you, when you produced the notes and guineas out of your pocket, to put your hand down on them; had you any suspicion? - No, I had not to be sure.</p>
               <p>What made you keep your hands down upon them then? - Because being in a house where I did not know where I was, I always should keep my hand on it.</p>
               <p>Having done this, then it did not strike you there was any danger in putting your money on the table? - I did not think it any danger at all.</p>
               <p>Did you think it safe? - I did.</p>
               <p>Would have thought it equally safe if you had put it on the middle of the table? - It would not have been so convenient to me, but I might have thought it equally safe.</p>
               <p>Would you have had any suspicion of Oxton in laying down your money? - I should not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080055"></xptr>Why was it that you now describe your hand as placed upon this money covering your bank-notes and your guineas, and having no suspicion at all; was that the case? - I had no suspicion at all.</p>
               <p>Why was it that Oxton wanted the money any more than Warren? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>In fact, Oxton called out for the money? He did not call out at all.</p>
               <p>Did not he want the money? - He wanted the money to be sure, but he did not ask for it at all, not a word.</p>
               <p>Bless your soul, not ask a word! he counted this money; did not he? - Yes, because he got it.</p>
               <p>He said he had won it, did not he? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Did you yourself make any sort of a noise at this time? - Yes to be sure.</p>
               <p>What sort of a noise? - I wished to keep my money; I then thought he had no title to put his hand to my money.</p>
               <p>Did you call out for any assistance at this time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You knew there was assistance near; you knew there was a landlord and a waiter? - There was some people in the house, but when my money was gone, I thought it was better get it back again.</p>
               <p>But you did not call out for any assistance at this time? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Why did not you? - Because I thought these men and the people of the house might be concerned together, and then what would become of me then? and so I thought it was better to get out.</p>
               <p>Then that suspicion instantly seized your mind, that the people of the house might be in confederacy with them, and therefore you would not call out? - Yes, it was so.</p>
               <p>When Oxton got out of the door, Warren wanted to keep you in; how came it he did not keep you? - I got out as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>When Oxton was gone out of the house, did you attempt to alarm the house? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>You say Warren was desirous of going too? - Yes, as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>What part of the house did you go through before you got into the street? - A small passage.</p>
               <p>How many people did you see in your way from the parlour? - I did not look at any people at all, because I wished to get out as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>How far was Oxton from the house? - About three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>When you told him you would have your money again, he acknowledged he had this money? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did not he say he won it? - He did not; he seemed very much frightened.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt but a man that has played a trick, would wish to give it up to get clear of it; however afterward he was in the very act of delivering this money to you when the constable came in? - Yes, he would have delivered the whole of the money.</p>
               <p>The constable, and the attorney, and the magistrate, all agreed in it, that to get the money back again, you must consider it as a felony, not as a fraud? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The conversation the gentleman alludes to, passed after you was bound over? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever stake or bet any money with these two men whatever? - No, none.</p>

Scotch bills, which he has omitted to tell you of, which I never saw before, therefore I put down the 20 l. we put down 100 l. a-piece; he put into my hand a draft for 50 l. we went to Moorfields for a coach, and went to Lombard-street for 65 l. there he got his bill honoured; he begged exceedingly hard of the banker's clerk to get that bill discounted; the clerk said he could not do it, except he found some person that they knew; Johnson still urged very much, and offered to pay any premium; but he would not do it: then we took coach to go to Lombard-street, and then to the Strand, to Mr. Coutts a banker; then Johnson said, I think I can do my business, I owe a tradesman some money, and he will let me have cash for the 100 l. says I, that will save you all the trouble. We came down to the Swan with two Necks in Lad lane: says I, I am afraid we shall be past the time of the wager for the 20 l. says he, never mind, if it is half an hour, it will make no difference? says he, you stop here, and I will go to my friends; he went and came back again; says I, well have you got your bill honoured; yes, says he, I have 100 l. check on their banker; you must go with me: I did so; we took coach again, we went to No. 12, in Birchin-lane; there he got four 20 l. banknotes, nineteen guineas and a shilling: we came back in the coach, there was Oxton and the other man in the room; the chalk was put on the table, and the other man brought the money; so then there was a piece of chalk on the mantle-piece; we began playing, I won a guinea; there was A, B, C, and D on the table; I began playing with Oxton for six penny worth of rum and water, which I won; I then played him myself for half a guinea, that I won also; I had my odds of the game, which was four to one against him; I wanted to give Oxton his guinea again; after that I shewed Oxton the odds of the game, he was to turn his back, and to name a figure, which was four to one against him; I referred to Johnson, says I, it is a pity to keep this man's money, I will give it him again, for if he had the Duke of Bedford's estate he would lose it: says Johnson, no, damn it, keep it, he would keep yours: so then Oxton says, I will go back to them gentlemen and play them all round; says I, then you may as well lay them a guinea a-piece: I put down one guinea to Johnson, he covers that, and puts a guinea to another man that is absent, the same three guineas we won, we all three won a guinea of Johnson; then Oxton said, I could make a letter any way, and he would not play if I made the letter, but if I would let that man make it, referring to Johnson, he would play for 100 l. a piece; Oxton turned his back, and Johnson makes the letter D, and Oxton come to name the letter, and instead of putting down 100 l. he put down eighteen guineas, and four 20 l. notes; he made the letter D, and Oxton turns his back, that is one of the four letters, and he came forward and named the letter right, and Oxton came and named the D, then he lost his money: there were four letters made separate, A, B, C, and D; then in order to game, you must name one of the four, he was to turn his back, and I was to make one of those four letters, and he was to come forward and name the one I had made, which was put under the bowl: I made an A, and put the bowl upon it; then I laid him six-penny-worth of rum and water that he named the wrong. Oxton won the 100 l. then Johnson wanted to play on cards, he would not play with him, because he had no more money.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say but on the same ground as this man says; this man I understood was a person that got a good deal of money, and he wished to engage in playing with me, after he lost the money; when he came back to the public-house he says, give me my money again, I did not understand the game, and go about your business;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080058"></xptr>when we came back into the room, all the chalks were on the table, which was A, B, C, D; and the letter A and the letter D, which Johnson made while he put down his money: Johnson said when we came into the street that I had cheated him; I told him I had won it very fair, and would keep it; he would not have given me my money if I had lost it: I said I would rather go before a magistrate. He never said any thing about a robbery, till we came before the magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Batty's-garden, Back Church-lane. I met the three prisoners at a public-house in Rosemary-lane—I had five half-sove<lb></lb>reigns and sixteen half-crowns in my right hand waistcoat pocket—I went with them to their lodging, and went to bed with M'Leau—I kept my waistcoat on—Willis came into the room while we were on the bed, and I saw her <hi rend="italic">crunch</hi> out the light—when the light was out, they all three came into the bed—I got out of bed, and put on my trowsers—they said that I should stop inside, and one of them said I should pay the landlady 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I would—the landlady came into the room, and I gave her a half-crown; my money was then safe—I told the landlady to go out and bring in some beer—the went out of the room, and then the three prisoners caught me and forced me down, and M'Lean took my purse from my pocket, while the other two held me—M'Lean caught me with her teeth on the finger and arm—I was off the bed, standing on the boards—they then got out of the room, and I ran down stairs, and called out for the policeman—I think it was something about three or four o'clock in the morning—I had had something to drink, but was not drank—I cannot say whether I was sober; I had drunk a few pints of beer.</p>

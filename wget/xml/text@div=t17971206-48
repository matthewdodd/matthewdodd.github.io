               <p>Q. Has he been living with you since he has been out of Bedlam? - A. The last time he has not been with me much; he was away two years without my seeing him; he came home to me about his time last December, he staid with me a week, and seemed to be deranged in his mind, unsettled; he never gets any rest or sleep for weeks together.</p>

               <p>Q. You have no doubt, whether he was in a situation fit to be put there? - A. He was as bad as a man could be at times, both times that he was put in.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the father.) Had he at any time received any injury in his head? - A. Yes; his master at Cheshunt happened to hit him with a heel of a shoe, and made three marks of the nails in his head, and after that be was sent to Bedlam.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that a good shilling? - No; but in the mean time I looked at the other that was in my hand with the two six-pences, and I said here is another as bad. The constable Peat was standing by me at the same time I held the two shillings in my hand; I never gave her them back; the six-pences are one good and one bad; I kept the two shillings and two six-pences in this state, and have had them in my possession ever since.</p>

He knows me these four years, and he knows that I have a family of children? - I know nothing of the woman otherwise than by her coming to market buying fish; I know nothing of her otherwise than being informed of her being a common utterer of bad money, and I was surprised at her giving it me.</p>

               <p>I was standing at the corner by the side of Mr. Finch; he says to this woman this is a bad shilling; she gave him another which was equally as bad. I then desired Mr. Finch to keep what he had got in his possession; I went to her, and from her left hand she attempted to drop something, but I prevented her by seizing her hand, and I found two shillings and a six-pence in it, one six pence was a bad one and the other was a good one, and the six-pence was good. I have kept the bad ever since, but the good was given her before the Lord Mayor; I took her up stairs and searched her afterwards, and found two good shillings, two bad ones and a six-pence. These three bad shillings I now produce, one was taken from her hand and the other two taken from her pocket. I cannot tell which is which.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the two shillings and two six-pences that were taken by Finch? - That is produced by him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What do you mean by saying that he contradicted that; did not he say all through that Askam had been the person that gave him the bill? A. Not exactly - he said that he had taken it first in the way of business; he did not name Askam as the person that had given it, nor any body else - I had him taken up without asking any explanation about the bill; I had known him from about last October - he was taken up at his own home.</p>

I will give you the names and address of the parties, should you like to take it, and let me have goods for the balance: I am sure you will approve of it, as they are right respectable, and it will be made pay able at Messrs.

I have been in the habit of accommodating a few of my friends with my acceptances; I do not think I have accommodated twenty persons with my acceptances, but I will not swear that I have not; I was examined about a month ago at the Queen-square Police-office - I do not recollect stating there that I had never given any acceptance as an accommodation; I recollect afterwards swearing that I had given one within six weeks of that time, to a person of the name of Marcus, who is a general-dealer, I believe, in some sort of things, and lives at No. 6, Red Lion-court, Fleet-street; I stated at Queen-square Police-office, that I did not know where in Fleet-street Marcus lived - I forgot then, it slipped my memory; the amount of that bill was 19l. some odd shillings; I do not recollect that I stated to the Magistrate that I did not know the amount of the bill, or where it was made payable: I have not seen Marcus since, and do not know where I could find him; I know where he lives if I should be fixed with the payment of that bill; I never lent my name to Mr. Marcus as an accommodation but that once - I have been fixed with the payment of these bills in every instance in my former accommodations; I do not remember whether I have ever been reimbursed - I have had no money transactions with any persons - I never got from Mr. Marcus 10l. on account of a bill of exchange, purported to be accepted by my brother; my brother gave me a 100l. bill which he accepted in my favour, I think about two or three months ago; I heard of Mr. Marcus then for the first time, and that he was in the habit of discounting bills; I went to him, and gave him the bill to get discounted for me - he kept it for near ten days, pretending he could not get it discounted; I was kept in London waiting for the bill ten days; my brother was a little uneasy about it - he came up and saw Mr. Marcus, and demanded the bill back, which Marcus gave him; then Mr. Marcus came to Cowley, and made out his bill for 8l. for expences, and desired to get the bill discounted; he said he wanted me to pay him the 8l., then he said if I could accommodate him with a 19l. bill he could pay it away for some stoves that he wanted to put into his house, and when the bill became due he was to find his part and I mine; this was the acceptance of the same brother, who is represented to be a person of fortune; it was not an accommodation to me; when my father died he left some property in my hands, and this was a part of it; Marcus gave up the bill to my brother, the acceptor; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100079"></xptr>have had in my hands a bill of exchange for 90l., purported to be accepted by my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not take a bill of exchange out of the hands of Keating and Co. to avoid a prosecution? A. I refuse to answer; I never in my life accepted bills of exchange in blank, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were the accommodation bills you accepted used before you became a bankrupt? A. Before; I do not believe any of them were proved under my commission - part of them were in existence before the commission; I cannot say how many I have excepted since the commission - it is not ten, certainly; I never put my name on a blank piece of paper for the last two years, certainly - when I speak of my brother, I always mean Thomas, the brick-maker.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you ever see him write? A. Yes, five years ago; he owes me about 2000l. - I am one of his assignees; I have known very little of him since, for he was shy of me - I was going to render him once or twice; the amount of debts under the commission is nearly 4000l.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's attorney. I was engaged at the time he was taken up, in endeavouring to get same money belonging to his wife from a will, and expected to get it before the Chancery Office closed for the vacation; the last I knew of him before he took the baker's shop is, that he was engaged in buying and selling varnish on commission for about six months in the last year, during which time he had sold this house at Lambeth: I took proceedings against a Mr. Farmer for a debt due to him for varnish.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where does Farmer live? A. Somewhere about Peckham; it was a Surrey writ - the amount was 6l. 8s. or 10l.; I always understood he was a baker before he sold the house in Winter-place, and this summer he told me he was going into the house again - he then said he was selling varnish on commission, that was November last; I proceeded against Farmer, and the debt was paid: I live in Bond-court, Walbrook - I do not know of any other dealing of his in varnish.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Farmer's was the only writ in which you was employed to sue? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has he got into the same or a different house? A. He stated to me that it was the same - before that we used to direct to him in Oakley-street, Lambeth.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you tell me when in July he brought it? A. Somewhere between the 27th and 31st; Potter owed me 30l. - I have no mills; I have no flour ground at Newbury - I put no mark on the bill; it was the same number and amount as this - it was endorsed by Potter when I had it; I made no enquiry about Burton- I delivered the first of the floor on the 24th of July; Potter had promised me a bill on Burton, of Cowley - he mentioned no Christian name.</p>
               <p>MR. NEIL. When I went to the prisoner he gave me the name; I put it down on my own card, and went directly to Holborn to inquire - he did not tear off a piece of my letter, and write it himself, I am positive; I had the card at the office, but have lost it.</p>

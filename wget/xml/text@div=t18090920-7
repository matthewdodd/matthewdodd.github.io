               <p>Mr. TITFORD. I am a linen-draper at the corner of Finsbury-square. On the 18th of August I went out of my house, I returned home, I found the prisoner and another woman in company with her in my shop, they had been extremely abusive to Mrs. Titford; when I came in I said I would send for a constable, I sent for a constable, I told them that they had what was not their own, the other person said I should not see it, it was in the other woman's possession before, the prisoner took the parcel from the other woman, and said I should not see what was there. I sent for a constable; on searching the bundle I found a six quarter imitation shawl, on the other woman I found the other shawl, in my endeavouring to take them to the office she escaped.</p>
               <p>JONES. I am a shopman to Mr. Saunders, I was in the shop at the time that the prisoner took the shawls.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take the shawls - A. I saw the prisoner come in the shop along with an old woman; she asked to look at some prints, we shewed her some prints, there was none that would do for her, I was at the time shewing two ladies some shawls, they were laying on the counter, I turned my back, and went to the far end of the shop to look at the invoice of them, and left the boy along with these two women, shewing them some prints. Before I returned they both went out, I missed nothing at that time. On the next morning I missed two shawls, I had seen them on the evening before when the two women came there, about twelve minutes before they came in.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the prisoner to the shawls. - A. The prisoner was at the counter close by the shawls, which were on the counter, the prisoner and the other woman were both standing together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. You say that there were two ladies and a boy that were in the shop at the time, are they here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not miss the shawls till the next day. - A. Not till the next morning, the shawls were not put strait that night, they were left in a drawer throwed altogether. The prime cost of these shawls was twenty-six shillings.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The young woman that I met gave me the bundle into my hand in that gentleman's shop, I held it for her, the gentleman asked me for it, I gave it to him, I said it did not belong to me.</p>

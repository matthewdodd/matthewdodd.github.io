                  </hi>. I am Superintendent of police at St. Katha<lb></lb>rine's Docks. About ten o'clock in the morning, on 25th July, I saw Cook in the Docks, drawing samples from-casks—I saw a tray resting on the cask to his left—Williams was standing between two cases to his right—Cook drew a sample from a cask, the last, or last but one, and be handed it to Williams, who put it into his pocket, which attracted my notice—he turned to the right, and walked off—I followed him—he went into the locker's box—I asked him if he had a pass for that—he said, "No," and he said, "Don't take any notice, it will ruin me"—I took him back to where Cook was—I said, "I saw it done; call him"—Cook came, and said, "It is all right, he is one of our people, going to take it to the Dock-house"—I took them both to the Dock-house, and, while there, Williams said he would tell me the truth, that Spry told him to get it—this is it—it is a Customs' bottle; there is no label to it—I believe Spry is connected with the Customs, he is a locker—on the other bottles there was a label, showing what cask the brandy was drawn from—Williams did not say a word to me about any broken bottle—I had not noticed any other sample taken from this particular cask—Williams seemed to be hiding between the two cases.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of gaugers at the Lon<lb></lb>don Docks. I was on duty on 25th July—Cook was employed as a sample-drawer that day—it was his duty to get the number of bottles that were given out to him by the gauger—he takes them into his own room and labels them according to the sample he has to draw—he then goes out to draw them, and it is his duty to mark on the cask the number he draws—he then puts the bottles in the tray and takes them to the office—he generally carries them all in his tray—he is not authorised to put any in his pocket to carry away—if he had more than his tray would hold, he might put one in his pocket to carry it to the office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known Cook? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Seven or eight years; I am informed he has been employed in the Docks thirty-five years—Williams has been there but a short time—the bottles are given out by the officer at the proof-room; they have then no label on them—he would then take them to the sample-room and put on the labels, and then take them to the casks and draw the spirits—if one bottle breaks, he would draw another—it would be his duty to take the broken pieces and the fresh bottle to the proof-room, and explain the circumstance—I do not know what Williams's employment was that day—I fancy he was assistant sample-drawer to Cook—there is no separate quay for the rum—the trays are of different sizes; they hold one dozen, two dozen, or three dozen bottles-Spry keeps the locker's place—men leave things there for security—suppos<lb></lb>ing such an accident to happen on the 24th, as to break a bottle, and on the 25th Williams had required an extra bottle, there would have been nothing wrong in his leaving that bottle at Spry's while he got another label.</p>

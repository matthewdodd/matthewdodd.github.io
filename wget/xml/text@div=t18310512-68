            .</p>
               <p>EMILY STEERS. I live in the family of Mr. and Mrs. Kirby, in Bloomsbury-square. I lost a pelisse, three necklaces, a gown, and a brooch, from a small straw box, which was in a large box, at Mr. Tremain's, in <placeName id="t18310512-68-crimeloc417">Southampton-row</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18310512-68-crimeloc417" type="placeName" value="Southampton-row"></interp>

               <p>DAVID TRAIL. I live with Mr. Aldridge, a pawnbroker, in Orange-street. I have a gown and a pelisse, pawned on the 23rd of April by a woman, but I do not know who.</p>
               <p>JAMES BOLAN. I am a Police-constable, (No. 68, E,) and lodge at No. 14, Castle-street. I apprehended the prisoner on Thursday last, in Maynard-court, Borough - I went with Mr. Tremain in search of her; I asked her a great many questions - she denied every thing she had taken, except the box of beads, which I found under her pillow in that house; I did not find any thing on her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see who put that box of beads under the pillow? A. No; I did not see the prisoner do any thing with regard to that pillow - there were two empty boxes in the room; I did not see the prisoner do any thing, with regard to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this your name and hand-writing? (handing him his deposition.) A. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did you see the prisoner do any thing to any box? A. No, Sir - in going up stairs my foot slipped, the prisoner went forward, and I suspect she went to the box, took it out, and put it under the pillow.</p>
               <p>Q.Then if you have sworn that you saw the prisoner go to a box in the corner of the room, take something out of it, and then slip it under the pillow of the bed, is that true? A. No, Sir - I had no conversation with her; I questioned her a good deal - I am sober; the prisoner said nothing.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not ask if she had any thing about her? A. I asked where the duplicates were, and she said she had destroyed them.</p>
               <p>SUSAN BAYFORD. I am single, and live in the same service with the prosecutrix - my master has the occupation of a room at Mr. Tremain's, in Southampton-row; I am sent there occasionally. There was a trunk there containing these articles, and some other things - it was not locked; I recollect the pelisse, the gown, and the little straw box, containing the necklace and brooch, being in it- I went to that room on the 5th of May; I saw something on the table, which directed my attention to the trunk - I found the things had been taken out of it, and were very much rumpled; I missed these articles - I saw the gown and pelisse at Mr. Aldridge's; I had not known the prisoner.</p>
               <p>GEORGE TREMAIN. The prisoner was in my service, at No. 6, Southampton-row. She came on the 16th of April, and left on the Monday week following - the property stated was in a trunk in my front attic, which belonged to Mr. Kirby - it was there while the prisoner was there; I went with the officer when the prisoner was apprehended; I saw the officer coming down stairs with the little straw box in his hand - the prisoner's father and mother lived there.</p>

In May last I had forty-three sheep - I bought them in Smithfield on the Monday; some were Lincolnshire, and some Leicestershire sheep, and some were lambs.

             - I am confident it is the skin of the sheep I lost the day before; a hind quarter of mutton, a shoulder, and liver were also brought to my house by Kerridge, my servant, on the 29th- I saw a side of mutton at Worship-street on the 30th, I believe; it was on a Thursday. I compared the mutton brought to my house with the skin, and am certain it corresponded. I know Tooley - I believe he carries milk out for his father, who is a respectable man. The mutton was cut up in a butcher-like manner, and the skin well taken off; the head was servered from the skin: I compared the head with the skin - it fitted exactly. I was not present when any other mutton was compared with what was brought to my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the person here who fastened your sheep up at night? A. Yes. I had bought the sheep on the 28th, the day before; I always examine them well before I buy them; I bought forty-three - some of them at 6 o'clock in the morning, and some at 11; they were driven to Hampstead; I only had the rest of the day to get acquainted with the marks, but they were my own marks; a ruddle mark across the back is very common - it was done with oakum. I have known Tooley three or four years - he assists his father; I never knew him in any other employ: I never knew a breach in his character before - he has been out on bail, and surrendered.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were these sheep part of a larger lot in the market so marked? A. No, my Lord. I marked them myself after I bought them.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Islington - my beat is on Highgate-hill. On Tuesday morning, the 29th of May, at five o'clock, I saw the prisoners Edward and John Sadler, on Highgate-hill; John had a bag on his back- I asked them what they had got - Edward Sadler said it was pork; they were in company together: I said I wished to see it - Edward said, "If you will come to my house I will show it to you;" I asked where they lived - Edward said he lived just over the way, thirty or forty yards off; it turned out to be the place where they did live- I accompained them there, and then asked Edward to show me what the bag contained - he asked where was my authority, or had I a search-warrant; I told him No, that my duty was to stop any body I thought suspicious; he then said, "Well, if I must tell you the truth, it is mutton"- he opened the bag, and I saw it; there was a hind quarter and a fore quarter of mutton, and some fat - it was quite warm at the time; I asked Edward where he had it from- he said he had it from Hampstead, and mentioned a person's name. I took the prisoners and mutton to the watch-house.

            's wife had the breakfast things on the table, and before I took them to the watch-house Edward told her to go to Hampstead, and tell the person of whom he bought the mutton, that he was in the watch-house; I proceeded with them and the mutton to the watch-house, and on the road Edward said he expected the man he bought the mutton of was gone to the races, but if he was not there his man must come - he said that to his wife when he sent her. I asked them on the road where they got the mutton from; Edward said that he bought it overnight - I asked him at what time - he said about five o'clock in the afternoon. They both said they had been to Hampstead to pay their club, and spent their money, got drunk, and stopped there all night, and that was the reason they had not got home before; they said they had sold mutton all the winter since Christmas, and had it from the same person as they bought that of - that they were out of work, and got 6s. or 7s. a week by it. I gave them into Grafton's custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is Highgate-hill from the watch-house? A.

            . I am a constable of the night of Islington. On Tuesday morning, the 29th of May, Ashby brought the Sadlers to me; they had this bag, containing a fore and hind quarter of mutton, and a long piece of fat. - After the mutton was taken before the Magistrate it was delivered to Mr. Smith; I examined it - it was not cold. I put some questions to the prisoners, and went to the house of Tooley the same morning, in company with Ashby (Sadlers being in the watch-house;) I met Tooley on the road to his house - it was about seven o'clock in the morning (directly after securing the prisoners) - I asked if his name was Tooley; he acknowledged that it was; I asked if he had sold any persons any mutton that morning; he said he had not. I took him into custody, and searched his house between seven and eight o'clock that morning, but found nothing there. I went again in the afternoon, with a warrant, but had searched the house before; nothing was found in my presence at either search, not in the house or any where else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you do with Tooley after you took him? A. I kept him in custody - he was not out of my sight till he went before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>JOHN BUSTIN. I am a constable of Hampstead. On Wednesday, the 30th of May, in consequence of information which I received, I searched Tooley's house, between ten and eleven o'clock; Eldridge, another constable was with me: we found nothing material in the house, but in a basket in the area I found a gut - it appeared to be a sheep's gut; it was only a short piece of gut; there was a basket of dung and straw in the area - I cannot tell what sort it was. We went into a cellar, and in a rabbit-hutch there we found a piece of suet fat - it was kidney fat, and appeared to me to be sheep's fat; we searched the privy, and among the soil, on stirring it up, we saw some congealed blood; after that, in the kitchen, under the sink, I found this handkerchief, all over blood; I found nothing else there. I had made a search before that; on my first coming up that day, in Golden-square, at the top of Hampstead, about thirty yards from Tooley's house, and on the ground there was a leg and loin of mutton - it appeared to have been taken out of a privy; the privy, there is open to the whole yard - I searched that privy, but there was no blood there; the privy I found the blood in was occupied by Tooley - his wife was present when I found the gut in the basket. I went that morning from his house to a pond, about one hundred yards off - it is called Clock-house pond; Phillips and Eldridge were with me; I saw something laying on the top of the water: Phillips pulled it out - it was a shoulder of mutton, and was fresh. After that I saw Eldridge pull out a piece of suet kidney fat - that was fresh. I saw a lad named Preston take the liver out of the pond - that was also fresh; two or three old sheep skins were found in the pond, tied together with a rope, and bricks tied to them. I was at Worship-street when the whole of the mutton found, and that taken from the prisoners Sadlers, was compared together, and to the best of my judgment, they fitted - I have no doubt of it. I saw a sheep's skin produced at Worship-street; the mutton found by me, and that found on Sadlers was compared with the skin - it all corresponded together exactly; I did not see the head compared. I have not the least doubt they came from the same carcase.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not a butcher? A. No. The privy in which the hind quarter was supposed to be found was common to all the houses - any body might go there; it is about thirty yards from Tooley's: there are a great many more houses nearer to it than his. There is a road right round the pond; Golden-square is about one hundred yards from the pond. I know Tooley - he bore a most respectable character as far as I ever heard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know whether either of the prisoners have been bred as a butcher? A. I do not, my Lord.</p>

On the 30th of May I was fishing in a pond at the Vale of Health - it is called Vale of Health pond, and is about five hundred yards from Tooley's house - I found two sheeps' skins there - the first was very fresh, and the other quite decayed. I was alarmed, and left it there - Clark was with me; and between ten and eleven o'clock I got the skin out, and took it to Mr. Smith's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Tooley's house a cottage by itself, or in a street? A. There are a lot of houses together, joining one another, in Golden-square; there are a great many houses nearer to the pond than his. The pond is on the heath, open to every body.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live with my father, at Hampstead. I was present on the 30th of May, when the pond was searched, and found the sheep's head in Clock-house-pond - it is not called Vale of Health-pond- it is nearly a quarter of a mile from Vale of Health-pond- I gave it to Kerridge, and did not see it compared. I saw the skin - it was a very large sheep, and the Lincolnshire breed are very large.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you swear to the county it was born in, from seeing the head? A. No. The skin was not on the head - I cannot swear to the breed, but suppose it to be Lincolnshire.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live at West-end. I was employed by Mr. Smith to count his sheep on Tuesday morning, the 29th of May - there were then forty-two; I had brought them from Smithfield the day before; how many there were then I cannot say: some of them were Lincolnshire sheep; I can tell Lincolnshire mutton from any other breed. On the 29th, I saw at Worship-street a hind and fore quarter of mutton, and part of the caul fat, and am certain it was Lincolnshire mutton. I was afterwards present when the pond was searched, and saw the shoulder and the head, and am quite certain they belonged to the same carcase as the other mutton. - I saw the skin next day, in the prosecutor's presence, and knew it by the marks - it was a Lincolnshire sheep; I saw it compared with the mutton at the office on the Thursday - I carefully examined it, and have no doubt it belonged to the mutton, and it was the skin of one of the sheep I had brought from the market. When the nose piece was cut off a piece of skin was cut off with it, and it tallied with the skin; it was cut sloping down, and if ever it is cut off it is done perpendicularly. Tooley works with his father - he was never employed by me. The mutton I saw was cut in a butcher-like manner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you say, if you saw a hind quarter of mutton fifty miles off, you could swear to its<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130006"></xptr>being Lincolnshire without the skin? A. I should pass my judgment on it - I could tell it from Leicestershire, or any other county almost. There may be breeds which I never saw. I could tell Lincolnshire from Leicestershire mutton - if it was cross breed I should call it half breed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Lincolnshire is a coarse breed? A. Yes, and lean.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Smith. On the 28th of May, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I counted his sheep; there were then forty-three. I know all the prisoners by sight - I never knew Tooley except as living with his father, who is a milkman.</p>
               <p>COURT to T. GRAFTON. Q. Did you search the back kitchen? A. Yes; in the back kitchen of the house which Sadler took me to, I found a meat-saw, a chopper, a gamblehook, a cord, and an axe; I found them there on the afternoon of the 29th, about six or seven o'clock; I do not know whether any body else lives there; I also found a pair of overalls, stained with blood, in that kitchen - the prisoners were then at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>The prisoners made no defence. Two witnesses gave both the Sadlers a good character.</p>

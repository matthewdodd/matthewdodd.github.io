                  </hi>. I am the wife of John McSwinney, and live with my husband at 13, Rose-alley, Bishopsgate—the prisoner lived next door—his wife was a sister of mine—her name was Eliza Keefe—she was about forty years old I think—she had been married to the prisoner about thirteen or fourteen years, to the best of my knowledge; I do not know—she has had children by him—three are living, and she has buried two or three—Mary Ann, the eldest, is between eleven and twelve years old—the boy if about five, and the other about three—the prisoner and his wife occupied the front room on the ground floor of 12, Rose-alley—part of it was divided by a wainscoting from the house where I lived—if they spoke very loud, I could hear in one room what was passing in the other—I saw my sister about 8 o'clock on the Friday evening before she died on the Monday—I do not know the day of the month—she seemed then in pretty good health, but expecting her confinement—on the Saturday morning, about 2 o'clock, six hours afterwards, I was in bed, and heard the children scream dreadfully—I listened, and knew her children's screams—I sat on my bed, and heard a great weight fall, and then I heard a scream, and listened to it, and knew my sister's voice—I came down stairs directly, and went into her passage, and found her lying there—I saw the prisoner standing in his own room with a stick or piece of iron in his hand—on my coining there my sister said, "Mary-Ann, I'm done;" and she put her hand right down by the side of her belly—she was then lying on the floor with her feet towards her own room door—at the time she said "I'm done" the prisoner wanted to rush out at her from to his room—I stood in the doorway, turned my back to him, and opened my two arms to keep him in—he said, "I will kick the b——y bastard out of you; you have come to take her part, you old w—e; I will serve you just same"—I would not let him out, and he struck at me with something on the right elbow—it is quite purple still—I screamed for the police, hallooed out "Murder," and some men came up the steps—I heard them come up, and heard two or throe voices in the court—they were the scavengers, I think—one of the men made an attempt to come into the passage, and my sister said to him, "He is a blind man"—when the prisoner heard the people speak in the court he went into his room, shut the door, and made it fast—we heard him fastening it with something inside—I went into my house, and returned shortly afterwards to the passage—my sister was still lying on the floor of the passage—I helped her up, and sat her on the stairs—the prisoner was</p>

               <p>then in his own room—I did not hear him say anything in his own room—I went upstairs to my own room, and came down to my sister two or three times during the night—she told me she had no pains of labour, but felt very faint and weak indeed—she did not appear to be in labour, but she complained of the side of her belly—about 6 in the morning, Mary Ann, the little girl, opened the door, and I came down stairs—she did not come out; I looked in—I stood it the door of the room where the prisoner was in bed—when he heard her voice he said, "Oh, it is you, is it, you b——y old w—e; get my shirt ready; you know where I am going this morning"—he was going to a blind asylum to get his money—I was with her at different times on the Saturday—on the Sunday, at 8 o'clock, she sent a little girl up to me—I went round, and found her lying in her own bed—she told me she was in labour, and I went to Mrs. Lewis, a Midwife, who came back with me di<lb></lb>rectly—I remained in the room with my sister and the midwife; and I afterwards went for Dr. Fowler, in consequence of something Mrs. Lewis and to me—I remained there till the child was delivered, which was about 12 o'clock, I should say—the child was not alive—the prisoner came to the door while the doctor was there—the doctor told him he could not come in—that was, I think, about the time of the delivery—he then went away, and I next aw him on Monday evening, between 7 and 8 o'clock—he came into the room—there were a few others there he was in liquor—they told him to make no noise; that his wife was very ill indeed, and the child was dead—he said, "Yes, the b——y old w—e, her sister, has killed her and the child with brandy"—he said, "Eliza, take no more of it; you must have tome beer "—he remained there about three-quarters of an hour—I next saw him on the Tuesday morning about 12 o'clock—his wife was then dead—Mrs. Sutton was with me—they told him his wife was dead, and he said, "A b——y good job; I am rid of the lot of them now; Dr. Fowler and her b——y old sister have killed her "—I have seen him use violence towards my sister several times before—I have seen him use her shamefully.</p>

               <p>in New-street between 2 and 3 o'clock; I did not see her go there nor hear that she had been there till I heard you say so at the Mansion-house—she never, to my knowledge, gave me any money to get a waistcoat of yours, which money I spent in drink; she never did; I do not think she had the chance of having 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you never gave it her; you took care to go all those errands yourself—I did not see you come in at 12 o'clock at night, just after she died; I was not speaking to you—on the Tuesday morning, when you came in drunk with another man, you went to sit on the bed where she lay, and I said, "You must not sit there;" that was not at 12 o'clock on Sunday morning.</p>

My husband's name is James, and we live in the ground-floor back room, at 12, Rose-alley, the same house in which the prisoner and the deceased lived—they occupied the front room on the same floor—there is a small partition between the two rooms, not bigger than a room door—we can hear everything that pastes in the adjoining room—on Friday night I went to bed between 9 and 10 o'clock, as near as I can tell—I was awoke on Saturday morning by the screams of the children; I think it must have been about 2 o'clock; and I heard the prisoner say, "You wh—, I will kill you; I will rip your belly open, and let your bastard out"—I heard a weight fall; I cannot say what it was that appeared to fall—it was a common occurrence there, a disturbance at a late hour of the night, and I did not take much notice—it seemed a soft fall, not the sound of a noisy weight—then I heard Mrs. Keefe scream, and she groaned for some time after—the first person I heard come in was Mrs. McSwinney, from the adjoining house—I heard her say, "What is the matter? Murder, murder—I heard the prisoner say, "You wh—, you have come in to take her part; I will kill you; I will take your chemise off and turn you out," and he made use of a fearful expression which I cannot mention—I was in my room all the time, and never opened my door—I heard a scrimmage, and then I heard a man's voice—that was after Mrs. McSwinney had come in—I did not hear anything besides words before I heard the groaning, or before Mrs. McSwinney came in—the groans and screaming were imme<lb></lb>diately after the fall—after Mrs. McSwinney came in I heard a man's voice, not the prisoner's; I cannot say whose it was, but I imagine it was one of the scavengers, for I heard Mrs. Keefe say, "He is blind"—that was the first word I heard her say after the fall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine, residing at Bishopsgate-street-within, and am district medical officer to the East London Union—about half-past 9 o'clock on Sunday, 28th September, I was sent for by Mrs. Lewis to attend the deceased woman—I got there between half-past 9 and 10, and found her presenting some of the most serious symp<lb></lb>toms which can possibly arise during a state of midwifery—she was in a state of perfect collapse, the face pale and very anxious-looking, breathing difficult; her tongue and breath were cold, her pulse scarcely perceptible at all at the wrists; there was an entire absence of all uterine action, and she was vomiting—from the examination I made of the state of her labour, I found that the child was in such a position that a few expul<lb></lb>sive pains should have brought it into the world; those symptoms indi<lb></lb>cated internal hæmorrhage, the result of some serious internal mischief—my judgment told me that her only safety lay in immediate delivery—I proceeded to attempt to obtain pains by medicinal and other measures, by stimulants; being unable to do so, I returned home for my obstetric instruments, and attempted to deliver by instruments; I was unsuccessful—I then effected the delivery by the operation of turning, and the woman was delivered of a still-born child; it was a large male child—I cannot positively state when its death occurred; it might have been dead between two and three days—I should say that it did not appear to have been alive within a few minutes or hours of delivery—it was a full-grown child—there was no alleviation whatever in the patient, of the symptoms produced by the delivery; in spite of domestic and other stimulants, she died in about twenty-four hours after delivery—I had once attended her about two or three years before, in the absence of a midwife; that was a natural labour, of twins; that was without any difficulty whatever; she was delivered before I could get there—I was subsequently present, when the post-mortem examination was made by Dr. Holden, in consequence of my declining to make it—I suggested that I would rather have some inde<lb></lb>pendent medical gentleman to perform it—on opening the belly, we found about half a pint of blood in its cavity, and, tracing for the source of that we discovered a large laceration at the posterior wall of the vagina, near to its junction with the neck of the womb—as regards the vital organs of the body generally, there were very slight indications of some old disease of the lungs, but quite insufficient to have prod need death—there was, in my opinion, nothing in any of the other vital organs which conduced to accele-rate death—there was hæmorrhage into the cavity of the belly—in my opinion, the kick which has been sworn to having been received by the woman, produced, at the time of its infliction, a certain amount of injury of the part, which injury became extended during the expulsive efforts of the mother in labour—from the fact of her being in perfect health up to the time these injuries were inflicted on her, and from what I saw in her life-time,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270113"></xptr>
               <p>and on the post-mortem examination, the cause of death, in my judg<lb></lb>ment, was the laceration of the vagina—there is no doubt that that was the cause of death, and the cause of that laceration was a kick.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Unless there was some previous injury, could a natural de<lb></lb>livery have produced that laceration? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—they do occur when there is no symptom of external violence, but in those cases the woman has pre<lb></lb>viously had very severe labours; she generally, during her last pregnancy, complains of some fixed pain in the womb, and the labour itself is more than ordinarily difficult—then the womb is more or less previously diseased, and the labour more than ordinarily severe—cases of laceration have occurred where the labour has been very severe, and where the previous confinements have also been very severe—if there has been some previous injury, it is hardly in its normal state—supposing it were in its normal state at the time of the delivery, very severe labour pains could undoubtedly have pro<lb></lb>duced this state—labours very severe, have effected that injury, where it has been in its normal state at the time.</p>

SLIEGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do those cases of laceration occur more frequently in first labours than in subsequent ones? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Less frequently in first labours—in a case when a woman has had some six or seven children, and the labours were without any unfavourable character, it would be very impro<lb></lb>bable that there would be such laceration—the woman died on Monday, between 11 and 12 o'clock, and the post-mortem was made on the Thursday, about 10 o'clock—the body was in a perfect state of decomposition—I had not examined the exterior of the body previously—the decomposition was such that the evidence of bruises or ecchymosis would be quite destroyed—I heard of the acts of violence just subsequently to the delivery; previous to the time of death—in consequence of rumours during the morning of her death, it being stated that myself and the midwife were instrumental in causing the woman's death, I declined to give the certificate of death, and intimated that I would rather have a post-mortem examination—I believe the rumours emanated from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you not think that blood was caused by a rupture? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A rupture was the cause of the blood in the belly, undoubtedly—it is morally certain that the turning of the child had nothing to do with the state of the injury, because the symptoms, which are recognised by all autho<lb></lb>rities in midwifery, as indicative of the occurrence of these injuries, were antecedent to Mrs. Lewis sending for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have heard of Mrs. Lewis's account of the change that took place, have you any doubt that that was when the laceration took place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing such an injury had been inflicted on Friday night, or early on Saturday morning, as, during the delivery, would cause the rupture, would that be inconsistent with her being in apparent health on the Sunday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all; the effects of the mischief would not be seen till the rupture actually took place, and probably not felt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant surgeon at St Bartholomew's Hospital—I made a post-mortem examination of the body of Mrs. Keefe—I have heard the evidence of Dr. Fowler, and entirely concur in it—I attribute Mrs. Keefe's death to the laceration which has been spoken of—I think it is in the highest degree probable that a certain amount of injury was inflicted at the time of the kick, which, when the labour came on, was greatly increased.</p>

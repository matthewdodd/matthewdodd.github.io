                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of Broadway, Barking. On 25th July the prisoner came in as a customer—my sister, Mrs. Harvey, fol-lowed him in, and made a communication to me; in consequence of which I sent to the station—a policeman came, and I gave the prisoner in charge for stealing some handkerchiefs—he said he had not stolen any; be knew nothing about them—as the policeman took him out, he put his hand under his smock and drew a bundle of handkerchiefs from it—I gave them to the constable—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner said nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and keep a draper's shop in Barking. On 21st July, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came, and asked to look at some cotton pocket handkerchiefs—I showed him some; he did not buy any—after he had left, I missed some silk handkerchiefs off the counter—there was no one else in the shop at the time—he stood in front of the counter—I followed him to my brother's, and a policeman was sent for—I did not see the handkerchiefs dropped—I have no mark on them, but I lost such, and believe them to be mine.</p>

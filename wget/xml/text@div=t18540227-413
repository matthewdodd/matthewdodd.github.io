On Friday, 17th Feb., I was the last up in the house—I made the house safe—the back kitchen window was safe, it was secured by a catch—there were some shirts and other clothes in that kitchen belonging to my uncle's brother—I went to bed at 12 o'clock, and got up in the morning about 7 o'clock; I went into the back kitchen, the window was a little way open, and a piece of glass taken out—when that was out any one could put in their hand and arm, undo the catch and open the window—the shirts, trowsers, socks, blankets, and a bag, were all gone.</p>

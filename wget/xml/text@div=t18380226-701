                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, living in SL John-street, Clerk<lb></lb>enwell. About six or seven o'clock on the 18th of January, the prisoner came for half an ounce of tobacco, which came to 1 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shil<lb></lb>ling—as soon as he had gone, I saw it was a bad shilling—I broke it in two pieces, and put it on the shelf—on the 31st of January he came again about seven o'clock in the evening, for half an ounce of tobacco—I served him—he offered a shilling—he went away—I did not recollect that the one he had given me before was bad—I put the last shilling into the till with two fourpenny-pieces and a sixpence—I gave that shilling to the officer Brown—I saw the prisoner searched by Brown—I gave the two pieces of the shilling to an officer at Hatton-garden—I saw some tobacco found on the prisoner, it was the same that I had sold him, and the change.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say on the 18th I came to your shop, what day was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect the day—you said you were going to Canada—I bent the shilling in two—I did not have you taken, as you were gone, and I thought you might have done it accidentally—I recol<lb></lb>lected your having given me the first, when I got to the watch-house—I cannot charge my memory whether I spoke of it that night, but I did the following morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Will you swear it was the 18th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I will not—I kept the shilling on a shelf by itself.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother, who keeps a tobacco-shop.

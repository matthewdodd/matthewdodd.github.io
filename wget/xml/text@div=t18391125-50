                  </hi>. I am pot-boy at the King of Prussia public-house. William Leather, jun., came into the tap room on the 22nd of October—he then went into the skittle ground and sat down—soon after his father came in and sat opposite—they seemed to be strangers to one another—the youngest had some beer, but did not offer his father any—soon after, an old gentleman named Mason came and spoke to the father—not to the son—I left my coat on the railings and went to clean the windows—the elder prisoner said to the younger, "Go, and fetch my pipe "—he said, "Yes, and I will fetch mine too"—he then went out, and several minutes afterwards the father followed—Mason sat down in the tap-room an hour or so—I went out to get my coat and it was gone—it had in it two handkerchiefs, a sixpence, three half-pence, and my club-book—I went to the pawnbroker's, but could see nothing of it—I went to Mason's, and as I was returning I met the younger prisoner, and said "Where is that coat?"—he said, "What coat?"—I said "That which you and your father took"—he said Hold your tongue, I will give it you"—he took me up Wilks's-place and said, "You go to No. 7, and ask my father to give you the ticket of it"—I said, "No, I shan't"—he ran off down Gifford-street—I had seen him once before.</p>

Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the younger prisoner running from the prosecutor—I followed, and overtook him—the prosecutor charged him with stealing his coat—he said he knew nothing of it—I took him to the station-house—he told me before that his father lived in Ivy-lane—he then said he lived at No. 6, Hoxton-town, and after</p>

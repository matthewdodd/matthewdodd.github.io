            . I saw the Prisoner with this lock, took him up, and committed him to the Round-house: I suspected him, because I thought such a child could not come honestly by the lock; and when he was in the Roundhouse, and also before the Justice, he confessed that he had it at Mr. Hodges's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodges's servant proved his master's property in the lock, and that Mr. Moore brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174509110030"></xptr> the lock and the Prisoner to Mr. Hodges's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I met two boys, and they desired me to sell this lock for them; I asked them how they came by it? they said, they found it; said I, I believe you found it before it was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am about twelve years of age.</p>
               <p>There was another little boy about the same age, who was an accomplice with him, and was designed to be an evidence against him, but on account of his being so very young, he was not admitted to give evidence.</p>

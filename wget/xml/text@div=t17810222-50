               <p>The prisoner came into my master's warehouse and begged the favour of me to help him up with the rope. He said my master had weighed it or seen it weighed; that it was bought and he was going to carry it to Lime-house. I helped him up with it in the warehouse, and he took it away. I asked him where the foreman was? He said he was busy. He went out at the back-door. I asked him why he did not go out at the fore-door? He said the back-door would do as well.</p>
               <p>To Davison. Was that rope bought of you by any person, or did you weigh it for any body? - No, I was at home ill.</p>

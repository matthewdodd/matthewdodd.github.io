On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160046"></xptr> the 30th of July, in the afternoon, the prisoner applied three times to me for nails. On the 31st, it struck me as extraordinary, that he should want so many nails. I went to his box to see whether he had the nails, and there were none in his box, and he was not at that sort of work that he could have used them. I communicated my suspicions to Mr. Hall. Before I told Mr. Hall, I placed myself in a situation to observe the prisoner. I heard him rattle the nails in his box, and put them in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the nails then - A. In his nail-box. I walked by him; he then came out of the place where he was taking these nails I then took the opportunity of looking in his box; there were no nails left, but a few old ones, I then told Mr. Hall.</p>

            . I am foreman of the carpenters in the ordnance employ. I followed the prisoner outside of the spur-gate. I called to him, and asked him if he had heard my body or seen any body taking any nails out of the boxes from the work; he answered, he had not heard any thing of it, he was sure he had not got any. He repeated it two or three times. The last thing I asked him, if he had taken any; he said, no. I put my hand into his pocket, and took out forty or fifty. I asked him, how he could tell me that wilful lie so many times, He said, I know I told you a lie, what of that; it was only for a job he had got to do. I then took him to the clerk of the work's office, in the Tower; there I made him turn the nails out, and he turned out about five hundred. These are them; they are nails furnished by the ordnance. There are seven different sorts.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. With regard to what they swore against me; I was at work at a public-house in Princes-street, Westminster, doing a job for myself two or three days before this happened. I had occasion to buy nails for the job; and when I had completed the job, I put the remainder on his bar. He said, take them, they may be of service to you; you have got a large family. I put the nails he gave me in my basket. I went to work at the Tower, and these nails I took there, they being with my tools; some I made use, and some of those nails, the nails I had in my pocket, I found among some old sail-cloth. I certainly did put some in my pocket; I was wrong in so doing.</p>

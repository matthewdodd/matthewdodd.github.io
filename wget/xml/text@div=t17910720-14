               <p>I took in this pair of breeches to pawn on Friday the 8th of July, about a quarter before nine; I live with Mr. Windsor, No. 130, Minories; I took them in of the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor said before the Lord Mayor, if I would give him the breeches<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200026"></xptr>and the prisoner would give him 20 s. he would make the matter up; but the prisoner at the bar, being a very poor man, could not possibly raise it.</p>

               <p>I lodged in this gentleman's house; I rented a room of him, and worked in my room; he gave me this pair of breeches to make, he gave me a matter of four or five pounds worth to work in my own room; being in great distress, I could not support my family without subsistence; I owed a little money where I used to deal, and they would not let me have any more till I could pay it; I took the liberty of pawning these breeches till I settled with my master on Saturday night, when I intended to bring back the breeches again. I am a stranger here, lately discharged from the 48th regiment, come from India; I am a poor distressed man.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. We would wish to know whether they were taken out of the room or out of the shop? - Out of the shop.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The breeches had been in my room six or seven days, hanging across my line; I took it as a choice to work in my own room, because it was lighter.</p>

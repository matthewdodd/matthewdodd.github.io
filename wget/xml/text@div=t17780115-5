I was stopped in the Staines stage on the 3d of December; we were stopped at about a quarter or near half an hour after six in the evening, by the prisoner West and another man on horseback; they came one on each side the coach; there was a little rain falling and it was darkish; there was no moon as I could perceive; it was near <placeName id="t17780115-5-crimeloc32">Bellfont turnpike</placeName>

               <p>Was it light enough to distinguish his person? - Yes, his face, which was not covered, was close to the coach; he held out his hand and I gave him a guinea and half and sixpence and some halfpence; I observed he dropped something out of his hand; I was also robbed of a stop watch, which is in the hand of a witness. West was afterwards taken at Bellfont; I saw him there at the sign of the Cock; I knew him immediately to be the person; I am very certain he is the man that robbed me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Staines. I was in the coach with the prosecutor; the coach was robbed opposite Mr. Cooper's house, by two highwaymen; one came to each door and demanded our money. I sat opposite Mr. Boult. West came to our side; he was dressed in a brown coat over a light coloured one; I could perceive something of his face, and his voice. I could see enough of his face to distinguish him among twenty persons when I saw him again.</p>
               <p>What expressions did he make use of? - He d - d his eyes and limbs if we did not deliver our money he would blow our brains out; the coachman looked at him; he told him that unless he turned his head he would blow his brains out. I saw Mr. Boult deliver his money; when he had robbed us he went towards London; Mr. Boult and I jump'd out of the coach and pursued him; we told the turnpike-man that we had been robbed; we went to Mr. Cooper's and got firearms, and got two horses and pursued them; we came up with Green; he swore he would not be taken alive; he snapped his pistol at Mr. Boult or me once or twice; it did not go off; my gun burst in my hand; then he rode off; we pursued after him as fast as we could; West jump'd off his horse, or fell off his horse; the horse went by us without a rider; the horses were afterwards stopped and restored to the owners; they had been stolen from Long Mead; we continued to pursue Green, but did not take neither of them that night.</p>
               <p>When Green nicked his pistol was you near enough to discern his person? - Yes, I could discern what sort of man he was, but not to swear to his face; I was almost close to him.</p>
               <p>Do you undertake to say that Green is the man that you pursued that night? - I really believe so, I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Green was not taken the next day? - No, he was taken at Hereford.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice of the face of West that night? - No, I did not; I was sent for the next morning about ten; West was at the Cock at Belfont.</p>
               <p>Was you in the room at the Cock as soon as Mr. Boult was? - No, but I heard him say he knew him before.</p>
               <p>When was Green taken? - On the 6th of last month, I pursued him to Maidenhead with Mr. Boult; we heard of him all the way down; we got a warrant of the mayor at Maidenhead; when I came to Maidenhead he was gone before some hours; I got intelligence of one of their boxes at the Rose and Crown; they told me there that he had lodged there a night or two, and they shewed me a box; the box belonged to Davis who was tried yesterday; we found a brace of horse pistols in it.</p>
               <p>Did Green lodge there as well as Davis? - One night he lodged at the Bull before Clack took Green and Davis at Hereford. I saw Green the week after before the magistrate; he pulled his cloaths off; we examined his back; he was very much shot.</p>
               <p>Did not your piece burst? - Yes, but Mr. Boult's went off; he was then about fifteen yards before us. Mr. Boult's pistol was loaded with shot No. 1. Green declared he would not suffer any body to dress his back; there were about thirty marks of shot; Davis said in the presence of Green that he picked three shot out of one hole himself.</p>
               <p>Did you recollect him there? - Not sufficiently to swear to his face. I thought he was the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712150007"></xptr>How near were you to West when you shot at Green? - I cannot say, they were both together when we came up; Green rode a black horse with a bald face, West rode a brown horse with a bald face.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to distinguish the black horse from the brown? - We could see they were both dark horses.</p>
               <p>How did you know which was West's horse? - We shot Green's horse behind; there were 100 holes in him; he was killed the next day.</p>
               <p>Was Green's horse disabled by being shot? - I think he went faster after than before; we examined the horse that night, and picked a great many shot out; it was a very bad horse.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When you got out of the coach was it wet or fair? - I believe it did rain when we got out of the coach.</p>
               <p>Mr. BOULT again.</p>
               <p>Give an account of what happened after you were robbed - Immediately after we had been robbed we jumped out of the coach, and ran till we came within fifteen yards of the turnpike; we called to the turnpike man to shut the gate for we had been robbed by two highwaymen; then the robbers turned off to the right over the common, and so went a back way, as we suspected, to come again into the Staines Road; I believe they were within thirty yards of us when we called to the turnpike-man; we then ran back to Mr. Cooper's, and desired they would help us to fire-arms to pursue them; I got a blunderbuss, and Mr. Bridger got a gun; I loaded the gun with large Bristol shot, No. 1. there might be a slug among the shot, I cannot say; I put my hand into the bag and loaded it in a hurry; we asked for a couple of horses. Mrs. Cooper sent her servant to fetch two horses; my horse had a bridle but no saddle; Bridger's had only a rope, we went down to the corner of the road that goes towards Richmond; we had not rode down there but about five, six or seven hundred yards before we perceived they were coming towards us; we could see the bald faces of the horses; the one was a brown, the other a black horse; Green rode the black one.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive the horses had bald faces when you were robbed? - Yes, I called out to Bridger here they come, mind them; West turned aside, and Green came by us; I bid him stop, or I would blow his brains out; he swore he would not be taken alive; he turned his horse short round and came on the other side of me; then I bid him stop again; he swore again that he would not be taken alive, and then I heard his pistol nick; he was then about a yard from me at my side; I desired him to stop afterwards two or three times; he kept swearing he would not stop; I took aim at his back and fired at him; I imagine I might be about a dozen yards from him when I shot; fourteen was the outside.</p>
               <p>Did you hit him? - I believe so, I thought so then; West was coming up, but he got off his horse, or his horse threw him, I do not know which; his horse passed us without a rider; we pursued Green but did not take him, but we took his horse; he had got from his horse and made his escape.</p>
               <p>What became of Bridger's gun? - It burst all to pieces; it was double-loaded; he loaded it thro' a mistake, not knowing that it was loaded before; we thought Green had concealed himself; we alarmed the neighbourhood and went in search of him, but could not find him; when we came to the town we examined the horse, and found him wounded a great deal on both sides his hips, by which we were certain we must have wounded Green; we were informed on the Friday following that a man had lain with such a kind of a man who was wounded and could scarce stand upright, and who was gone to Maidenhead; we went to Maidenhead, and were informed by one Davis that he was gone to Hereford; we heard Sir

            's men were after him, and therefore did not go any further.</p>
               <p>Did the man describe how he was ill? - Yes, he said he could not stand upright, nor walk ten yards hardly without sitting down; I saw nothing more of Green till I received an express to go to Maidenhead. I am certain Green is the man I shot at, I took a deal of notice of him while he was robbing the other side of the coach.</p>

               <p>Question from Green. What do you know me by? - By his face, by his clothes and every thing; I saw his face very plain then; I believe he had the same coat on he has now, and another coat over it almost of the same colour; it was a brown coat like that, it is not the same. I was at Maidenhead, and saw him strip'd.</p>
               <p>Green. When you was asked if I was the man, you said it was a dark night and you did not know me? - I did not say I did not know him, I said he was the man; there were a great many marks upon his back.</p>
               <p>Green. When I went into the room he came in and said Green how do you do, God bless you, and gave me his hand, and said he would never hurt me. - I went into the room and asked him how he did, and said God bless you; but I did not say I would not do him any harm.</p>

               <p>I know Green; he came on Wednesday the 3d of December to the George at Sunbury between nine and ten o'clock at night, and asked for a lodging; I have lodged there these nine months. I never saw him before to my knowledge; when he came in he said he was distressed for a bed, that he had fallen from his horse and hurt himself; the landlord said he had not a bed for him; I said if it was agreeable as he was in distress, and it was a wet night, he should lie with me, which he did; he called for some rum and water, and went up stairs; he put the candle out before he pulled his cloaths off; I heard the top of the measure go two or three times, but what he did with it I cannot say; he had the rum in a measure, and the water in a quart cup. I went to sleep, and slept till about four o'clock. He was very restless; we talked at four o'clock; I told him I had no work to do that day; he asked me to go with him; he said he had two bundles to carry; I told him I would, and went with him.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - He had a dark brown coat on, and a buff waistcoat. I went with him to Hanworth in the way to London; he was on foot; he said he was in great pain about his back; he said he was afraid it had hurt his kidneys; I did not see any wound he had; we went to Mr. Smith's at the Half Moon at Hatton, and drank a glass of brandy and water, and a glass of gin and water; we staid there about three quarters of an hour; it rained very fast then; I went with him across the country to the Coach and Horses, just on the other side of Cranford-Bridge.</p>
               <p>That is in the Bath and Oxford road? - Yes, he had no great coat on then; he got into a return post-chaise; I left him and the chaise, and went on to Colnbrook.</p>

               <p>I am Bridewell-keeper at Reading; I heard of this robbery at Staines; I was informed one of the men was shot and wounded in the back; I went in pursuit of them; I found Green and Davis at the King's-head at Hereford. I believe I had seen Davis before; I do not know that I had seen Green; I had such a description of Davis I could not mistake him; when I had searched Davis I went to Green; he said you know nothing of me I am sure; I said if I do not know your face, perhaps I may know your back.</p>
               <p>Had you any arms with you? - Yes, a long horse pistol in my hand.</p>
               <p>Did they see that? - I imagine so; Green made answer and said, be you up to that, old one? I said, yes, and a good deal more; he said do not use me ill, and I will give you no trouble; this was on Wednesday the 10th; I made a mistake yesterday when. I said the 7th. I searched him, and found a metal watch in his pocket; I put my hand down his breeches, and asked what he had got there; he said nothing that would hurt me, and put his hand in his pocket and gave me a brace of pistols. I did not see his back. I brought him to Maidenhead, where he was examined before the mayor. I went to Wickham to see after another of the party, and while I was gone he was taken to Reading. I found the prosecutor's watch on Davis.</p>

               <p>I lodge at the King's-head at Ashford. West slept there on the 3d of December; we heard of the robbery next morning; we took West and carried him to Mr. Read's the Black Dog at Bellfont; there being nobody up but a post boy in the stable, we took him to the sign of the Cock opposite. Mr. Boult saw him there, and said he thought he was one of the men that robbed him; he was afterwards brought up to Clerkenwell. West had a kind of a light coat underneath, and a Bath coat over it; they were rather of a brownish colour. I clap'd my hand on him, and said he was pursued; he said be I by G - d? where are they, when are they coming? then he asked me to put him over the wall; I took hold of him, and told him he must come along with me; he asked me what for; I said he had not paid his reckoning; he said what is it, I will give it you; I will give you all I have got if you will let me go. I told him the landlord was coming, I would not let him go; he was searched at the Cock, but I was not present at the search.</p>
               <p>West. When he came after me he caught hold of my shoulder, and asked me where I was going; I said to London; he turned round and said there was somebody pursuing me; I was afraid it was a press-gang, I had been pressed before; they took me before the Justice and searched me, and found nothing upon me. He came to me when I was in prison, and gave me something to drink, and said he would not hurt me; he said afterwards d - n the dog, I will hang him; instead of 40 l. we ought to have 50 l.</p>
               <p>Baston. I went to him in Newgate, and gave him a glass of wine, and gave him a shilling. I said I would be as favourable to him as I could; it was not in my power to hurt him. I mentioned nothing of the money.</p>
               <p>West. When I was taken at Bellfont, he said I was come to the worst place I could, for that they always took them. - I said no such thing.</p>

               <p>West came on foot to my house at Ashford, between eight and nine at night, on the 3d of December; he asked me to put him in the way to Hounslow; he wanted a place to lie in; I told him I had no such place; I have only a little cottage, I am a day labouring man; I shewed him to a public house, and we had two or three pints of beer; he desired me to come to the public house the next morning at about six o'clock and call him up. I went at six in the morning, and bid the girl call the man I was with over night; he was called up; I went a little way with him to put him in the way to Hounslow; he told me if any body enquired after him to tell them that he was gone to Kingston or some other way, and bid me leave word at the public house the same when I went back again.</p>
               <p>Did you do so? - Yes; I saw him at Bellfont when he was taken.</p>

               <p>I keep the Old White-horse public-house at Maidenhead. I have seen both the prisoners. Green lay I believe two nights at my house; I don't remember the time; he came as an acquaintance of Davis's, who lodged constantly at my house. Bridger came and enquired if Green had been there. I never heard of the robbery till he told me of it.</p>
               <p>How long before Bridger came might it be that he lay at your house? - I believe it might be a fortnight before. Green came on the 5th of December, and enquired if Davis was up; he went up to his room, and was there a considerable time; then he went away and went the road that goes to Maidenhead; and Davis went with the Oxford coach. Davis not lying there that night, my wife did not make the bed; when she went up the next day, she found a coat all wet and dirty in Davis's room; she gave it me; it is said to be much shot (it was produced in court) there were a brace of pistols found in Davis's box when the Justice broke it open. I expected Davis to return; he said he had a brother dead, and had asked his master to let him go into the country about a house.</p>
               <p>Had any body been in the room after he left it? - Nobody to my knowledge, but my wife; I took the coat and hung it out to dry; there was a yellow purse in one of the pockets.</p>
               <p>WEST said nothing in his defence.</p>

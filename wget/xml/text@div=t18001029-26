               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. When you returned from Bow-street, you found him in your shop? - A. Yes; I had desired my journeyman to take care that he should not go.</p>

               <p>Q. You had a very good opinion of him, I believe? - A. Yes, I had.</p>

               <p>- sworn. - I am journeyman to Mr. Moore; I was coming through the shop at the time Mr. Moore came in; I saw him take the money out of his pocket, put it upon Mr. Moore's counter, and say, that was all he had taken.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>

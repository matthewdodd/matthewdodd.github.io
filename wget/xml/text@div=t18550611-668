                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of Orange-street, Leicester-square. On Sunday evening, 27th May, I was returning from Lambeth to Hunger-ford Bridge; the prisoner and another woman spoke to me at the top of a turning—it was then about half past 1 o'clock, in the morning—I passed on and pretended I did not hear them; but as I increased my speed, they followed me up, overtook me, and wanted me to go home with them—they laid hold of my arms, the prisoner got in front of me, and the other put her arms round my neck, and told me not to be cross—I put my hand to my watch pocket, and my watch went out of my hand—I caught it in the prisoner's hand, and took it from her; she kept hold of the guard, and triad</p>

               <p>to wrench it—I called "Police!" three or four times—I had her hand in mine—a man came up, and represented himself as a policeman—T told him to take one of them, but the neighbours came, and he started off, the other girl after him, and the prisoner third—I ran after them, and called "Police!"—the man opened a door with a key, went in, and the other girl after him, and I caught the prisoner—I called "Police!" and she put her hand over my mouth—I gave her in charge—I had been to the house of a friend of mine, Mr. Morgan—I had been drinking very little—I knew what I was about, or I could not have run after these girls.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Essenhigh, of No. 41, Gran<lb></lb>by-place. On the night of 27th May, I was sitting at my window with my landlady, and saw the prisoner and another following the prosecutor; when they got to my window the prisoner and the other girl were talking together—I saw her put her hand to the prosecutor's watch pocket, and take his watch, as he stood talking with them—they talked together about five minutes—the other girl put her hands round him; he tried to halloo "Police!" and the prisoner put her hands over his mouth—I and my landlady hallooed "Police!" as loud as we could—some man came up, and asked the prosecutor what he wanted—he said, "I want a constable"—he said, "lama constable, let her go"—he said, "No, I will not; she has got my watch"—a policeman came up, and they ran off—I had seen the prisoner several times, but never spoke to her.</p>

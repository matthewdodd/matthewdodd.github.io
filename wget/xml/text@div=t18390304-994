                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Between four and five o'clock on the afternoon of the 11th of February, I was on duty at Acton, about one hundred or one hundred and fifty yards from the railway, and</p>

               <p>going into a meadow I observed the prisoner cutting up a plank—I went up to him and asked how he came by it—he said he found it—I told him it was the property of the Great Western Railway Company, and I should take him to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner in charge for stealing some sheets—I asked him if he lived at Acton—he said he did not know Acton—I took him there, and the sergeant recognised him as having taken the plank a week before—he gave his name as Lovegrove to me, but at the station-house he said Shepherd.</p>

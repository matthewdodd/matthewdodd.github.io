            . I am a watchman - my beat is in Piccadilly. On the night of the 9th of December, about a quarter past eleven o'clock, I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner come together out of the Yorkshire Grey - the prosecutor was very drunk, and said to me "Watchman, I put myself under your protection;" I was taking him to the watch-house, and had got as far as the Dane's house when Jones came up to me, and said "Mr. Woods is a particular friend of mine, and I will see him home;" he then took him from me. Mr. Woods had his seals then - they went away, arm in arm - the prisoner followed them but did not say a word to me - I saw nothing more till about half-past twelve o'clock, when the prisoner passed me - Mr. Jones was then ringing at the door of the Yorkshire Grey, and said to me "Stop that man, he has robbed my friend of his seals;" I sung out to him to stop, and went up to him and said "I have got charge of you;" he put his hand to his pockets, and said "I have no seals - I have nothing belonging to any one but myself;" Mr. Jones told me to take him to the Yorkshire Grey; I said I must take him to the watch-house - I saw the constable search him - there was nothing found on him but some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120046"></xptr>silver. I went to the place where I had taken him, and found two seals there, which I took to the watch-house - I went again with Mr. Jones, and found one piece of the ring and the key; next morning I found the other piece of the ring near the door of Mr. Woods' house, in Dorset-street, Mary-le-bone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Does the piece of ring correspond with the other part of it? A. I have not compared it - I only know that Jones lodged at the Yorkshire Grey, and he was there when he told me to stop the prisoner. The prisoner made no effort to get away - I called him twice and he stopped.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house between twelve and one o'clock, and given in charge to me, by Jones, for stealing some seals from a friend of his; I searched him twice, and then sent the watchman to see if he could find any thing on the spot where he took the man; he went and brought the seals, and then went again with the candle, and found the large part of the ring - Jones was still making the charge, and the prisoner said he would give him 4l. to make it up, which would cover the value of the property.</p>

            , and lodged at the Yorkshire Grey, about a month or five weeks before the 9th of December. I have known Woods four or five years; I came home that night about eleven o'clock, and found him holding by the door of the bar; I walked by him into the parlour, as the landlord wished me not to speak to him. I saw the prisoner there with him - the landlord and his wife afterwards said Woods was gone to the watch-house; I went and took him from the watchman and the prisoner, near St. James's-church; when we got on to Old Bond-street the prisoner came up to us again, and I said "I don't wish you to go with us - I would rather you would go along;" he said "I am a friend of his, and will go with him;" we went down Bond-street, and then went on to his lodging in Dorset-street; I took the key from him, and opened the door, and whether the prisoner tripped him up or not, I do not know, but when I turned round he was lying all along, and the prisoner upon him. I took him into his room, and took off his clothes, and said "Where are your seals?" he said he did not know; I came back again and found the prisoner walking in Bond-street, about four doors from Piccadilly; I told him my friend had lost his seals, and I suspected he had them; we then went on to the Yorkshire Grey, and I asked him in, but he would not go - the watchman came up, and I said I suspected he had robbed my friend of his seals - he took him to the watch-house - I afterwards saw the seals found on the very spot where I charged the watchman with him - the small part of the ring was found near Woods' door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At the time of this robbery were you out of place? A. Yes; I had been on the spot where the seals and key were found; I never wanted any money to get rid of the prosecution - nor ever asked for it - I was offered money, but I said I was upon my oath, and could not go from it - this is the person (pointing to Fletcher) who offered me money - he is a friend of the prisoner, and I believe he called him master. I never in my life, upon my oath, said to this man, or to any other person, that if he would give me 10l. I would be out of the way as soon as I got the money. The prisoner did not appear at all in liquor.</p>

            . I am a washer-woman. On the night of the 9th of December, I was coming past a public-house, near St. James's Church, a little after eleven o'clock, where I saw the prisoner - some person had pushed him, and his hat fell off; I know him again - he tried to pick up his hat and fell down - I turned myself round and saw a man, very similar to Mr. Woods, with a tall woman, who appeared to be a woman of the town, a little further on, towards the Church - they appeared very drunk - the man had pushed the woman down, and she lay on her back - the prisoner staggered towards them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you live? A. At No. 40, Great St. Andrew's-street. I was coming from washing - I did not do any thing to the prisoner - I did not go before the Magistrates, but on the Saturday week I went to my work at Mrs. Whitcomb's, No. 2, Brewer's-green, Westminster, and I related the circumstance to her. Had the woman not appeared to me to be a woman of the town I should have assisted her, but seeing the prisoner stagger towards them, I thought they were all drunk together. I saw something white, white appeared to be linen, fall from the woman's hand; she fell down; I did not go close to them, nor call the watchman - I saw the other person help her up and stagger on with her; I did not find out Mr. Joplin's, but the person to whom I related the circumstance made inquiries, and told what I had said.</p>
               <p>- FLETCHER. I am a builder. I now lodge at No. 27, Tottenham-place, St. Pancras. I have generally been a superintendant of workmen; I never, upon my oath, made any offer of money of Jones to keep out of the way- I never saw him but once.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you see him? A. Last Monday evening, at the Yorkshire Grey, when I went there with the prisoner's father, at his desire. I had not known the prisoner before, but I had seen an account in the Paper of the prisoner being in custody, and, as I know his wife, I called there, where I saw his wife, his sisters, and his father - his father told me that Jones lodged at the Yorkshire Grey, and he wished me to go with him to see the prosecutor, and the witnesses; he said he should like to know the particulars of the case, and he wished to know if they could not settle it without going to trial. I stated an objection, as it was a delicate subject; they talked about settling it, but I do not know that they mentioned trial; I did not know what was to be settled; I did not give it a thought; I went to shew the father the Yorkshire Grey; I knew the landlord very well; I saw Jones there, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120047"></xptr>asked him what it was all about, and if they could not settle the difference among ourselves; he stepped out at the door with me in a great passion, and said he would not settle it, but he said afterwards that, if he was remunerated for his expenses and loss of time, he would certainly settle it - there was no one there when he said so - it was about eight o'clock when I went to the house, and I got home about ten. I will swear I did not offer him any meney to make it up - no money was mentioned - I had no right to make any bargain with him.</p>

             I am a carpenter and joiner. I live in Durham - I am a freeman and freeholder of that city. I believe the prisoner is my son. I have seen Mr. Fletcher since I have been in London; I first saw him on Monday evening, while I was sitting at my daughter's house; I had not then applied to any solicitor. I said to Fletcher that I wished to see Jones, and we went to the Yorkshire Grey; Jones came in in about ten minutes; I wanted to know what he had to charge against my son - when Jones came in Fletcher said "There is Jones" - I said"Is that the person who has sworn my son's life away;" Jones and Fletcher then went out, and I followed them - Jones said "If you will give me my expenses, and 1l. that I have paid, and pay my loss of time, I will go off to-morrow morning, and you shall hear no more of me." I never desired Fletcher to offer him money - I only went to get right information, to know what it was about, that I might provide for my son. I was at some distance when Jones said what he did, but I heard Flethcer reply "You shall not have a farthing, nor shall you get any thing by swearing the man's life away." He then said to Jones "This is the young man's father;" Jones then came to me and said"Are you his father?" I said "I believe I am, and what is the meaning of your swearing a man's life away in the manner you have?" he said "I have no ill-will against the young man - I know very little about it - if you will go in I will treat you with a glass;" I said "You shall not treat me - I will toss you up;" we went in and called for a glass a piece, and I paid for them - Fletcher had a glass with us; he then said to Jones "Where is your friend Woods?" Jones said "He is at such a house, and we shall find him, and if you will pay me I will have nothing to do with it, and I dare say Woods will do so too." Jones then led us into a house to see a man whom I thought was an attorney - he had but one hand; I said "What is all this about - have you to do with it?" he said "Yes, I have a thing which I have made up;" I said "Let me see what it is;" the attorney then sent us down to another public-house, and while we were there Woods and him came in; - Woods said he would take the same money as Jones, if he could have the seals and ring - Fletcher said he would not give him a penny. I have not seen Jones since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Fletcher look in upon you accidentally? A. Yes; I went to know what was the charge against my son; I had not been anxious to go to Bow-street - there was no attorney employed by me - I did not go for the purpose of settling it - I told Fetcher I believed this was a fabricated story against my son - I did not know that Jones and Woods had been sworn; I had heard that no man can be committed except upon oath; it was from respect to Fletcher that I went and drank with those men, who I believed were guilty of perjury.</p>
               <p>COURT to JONES. Q. Did you ever say that if your expenses were paid, and 1l. given to you, you would be out of the way? A. No - it is utterly false.</p>
               <p>COURT to WOODS. Q. It has been stated that you acquiesced in that proposition? A. No. I did not - I have had offers made me by the prisoner's friends.</p>

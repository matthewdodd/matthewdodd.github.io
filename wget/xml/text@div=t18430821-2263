On Thursday, the 13th of July, about a quarter to seven o'clock in the morning, I examined the back window and door of my premises—I had not examined them before—the back door was safe, but the back parlour window thrown open and propped up—a square of glass was cut out, to undo the fastening—I had seen that window safe at two o'clock that morning, when I went to bed—I have a cheffonier on the right of the window of that room, and on it was a box containing five sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, 8 half-crowns, some shillings, franc-pieces, and a half-franc—I had had the franc about two months—it was very much worn, rather bent in and had a dark stain on it—I examined the premises at the top, leading</p>

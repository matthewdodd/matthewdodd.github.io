               <p>MR. WILLIAM AMORY. I live at Clapton. A man named Loveday, came into my employ in November 1815 or 1816 - I laid in fifteen quarter of oats-they went very quick, I told Loveday of it, I found the remainder lasted much longer in proportion - I discharged him. He afterwards applied to me for a character, which I refused-some time after he gave me some information about the oats. The prisoner was my gardener. I suppose I lost three or four sacks of oats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. I did not see the oats delivered; other people had access to the stable.</p>

            . On the 17th of September, I was Mr. Amory's servant. The prisoner applied to me several times for oats, saying, he used to get them from the other servant. In October he asked me again for some, I let him have them-he took them away in a sack-he gave me money sometimes for them. Wright passed by once when he was paying me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Some of the servants kept rabbits - I never asked Mr. Amory for a character. I did not tell of it to get a character, but because I repented.</p>

            . I am hostler at the White-horse, just by the prosecutor's, I have seen the prisoner pass through the stable-yard with an empty sack and return with about a bushel of something in it, and have seen money pass between him and Loveday.</p>

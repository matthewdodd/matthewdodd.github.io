                  </hi>. I am a mustard manufacturer, of Albion Mills, East Greenwich—on 17th October the prisoner came with a man named Turkin—the prisoner gave the name of Thomas Smith—he introduced Turk in to me, saying that he was a wholesale oilman, having nine shops in London, and that they had come down to buy some goods—they had one of my cards, and said they had had a recommendation from some one who had had goods before, and they wanted to purchase mustard, pepper, wash<lb></lb>ing powder, or anything of that sort—he said that he had several shops, and dealt largely; that he did not want credit, and the money would be paid as soon as the goods were delivered; that Turkin was just about pur<lb></lb>chasing some property at Norwood Junction, as an oilshop, and was going to settle for it in a week or two—Turkin agreed to take 252lb. of the best mustard, 198lb. of fine Durham, and 216lb. of common, 26 gross of washing-powder, and 38lb. of pepper—the bill came to 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were to be delivered on the 20th October at Turkin's shop, opposite the Alexandra Hotel, Norwood Junction—I was to deliver them there per<lb></lb>sonally, and receive the money—on the 17th, when that conversation was about the shop in Norwood Junction, they produced an estimate for some iron shutters for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had not got the goods made up, but I went down to Norwood Junction to see if it was correct, and I found Turkin had actually got possession of the shop—the prisoner said he was an iron<lb></lb>monger, I think he said at Highgate—I went down to the Alexandra Hotel on the 20th October, saw the prisoner and Turkin there, and dined with them—Turkin said that they were much disappointed that I had not brought the goods, as he was very much in want of some pepper for some shop at Pimlico—he volunteered to drive mo to Greenwich for it, and I consented to let him have it, and also the washing-powder; the bill for the whole was to be paid when the order was completed, on the 27th—I took the rest of the goods on the 27th to the Alexandra Hotel, where I saw Turkin and the prisoner, and dined with them again—I delivered the goods in their presence at the house opposite the hotel, and gave an in<lb></lb>voice to Turkin—the bill came to 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and Turkin gave me a cheque for 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the London and County Bank, Kensington Branch—I presented it at the Bank, but did not get the money.</p>

               <p>thirty-five was all I had—it was brought to me the following day in a van driven by Gosling—I bought it of a short dark man—I did not know his name, but I heard at the last examination that it was Turkin—there were three or four men in the room, but I do not recognise the prisoner as one of them—I paid from 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goods; that included three chimneypieces which I bought of Turkin for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he asked me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, I offered him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would not take it, and I left them—I got a receipt for the goods—these two receipts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are signed "Watkins"—the short dark man gave them to me—I paid him in gold and silver—I keep a banking account—these receipts are written on paper which is hawked about the street—they were not written at my house, but brought to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it not on one of your own vignettes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I had known Elsworthy before as the little dark man, but a man named Bloomfield asked me if I would buy the mustard and pepper, and if I could go on Sunday morning and look at it—I did so with Bloomfield—I saw Turkin and Elsworthy, they appeared friends together—they were in the parlour when I got there—I bought the mustard, the pepper, and the mantelpieces of the dark man.</p>

I am a hairdresser, of Old Street Road—I was at Elsworthy's house, and bought some cigars for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of a party very much resembling the prisoner and another man—I believe the prisoner to be the man; he gave this receipt, signed Anderson (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in the name of Thomas Watkins—he gave me the receipt in the name of Thomas Watkins—the signature on these three receipts in the name of Thomas Watkins resembles this—they are very much alike.</p>

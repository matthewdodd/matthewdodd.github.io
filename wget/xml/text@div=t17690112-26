I was gone backwards with two pigs heads, and left my meat in the taproom; when I came back, I missed a piece of sirline of Beef; he being in the house when I went backwards, I suspected him. I took him at the Old Mermaid alehouse with a bag in his hand; and my meat was in the bag. I know it well, having cut the fat out of it a little before.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I called in at a house at Hackney, where I eat my breakfast. Two men came in with a basket of meat. As I was coming out at the door, I met a man with brown clothes; he asked me how far I was going; I said to Edmonton; said he, I am going to Essex; and, said, he I have a piece of meat here, will you be kind enough to take it, and put it into your bag? I said, we shall go but a short way together; but he persuaded me to put it in my bag. We went into a public-house and called for a pint of beer; said, he keep it till I come, I will be with you directly; and he went out. I know nothing at all how he got it.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>
               <p>Whitenham Burgess. I am an Irishman, so is the prisoner. I can give him an honest character for two years past.</p>

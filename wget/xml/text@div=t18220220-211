               <p>Q. Just turn to where he speaks of the delivery of the parcel - A. He was asked whether he had a parcel to carry to Russell's warehouse - he said he had three to carry out that day, the 1st of December, 1820; that he received the parcel in question from Mr. West, Sir J. Perring's clerk - that he went to the Swan-with-two-Necks, and delivered the two others, and then went to Russell's office, with the third, the one in question, and got there not much after seven o'clock in the evening - that the first person he saw there was a working man, who loads the waggon, he desired to be served first - laid down the parcel, and came away - and was certain that the parcel he received from West was the same he delivered. He was asked, on cross examination,</p>
               <p>"Do you know a person named Nightingale - A. Yes, my Lord. Q. Is he a man with one arm - A. Yes. Q. And very red whiskers - A. Yes." He could not exactly say how long he had known him, not to be intimate with him - he first saw him about three years ago. He is then asked. Q.</p>
               <p>"He did not go to the waggon-office with you - A. No. Q. I mean at the time the parcel was delivered by you at Russell's office, was or was not Nightingale there - A. No." Nightingale was then called forward close to the witness, and he was asked,</p>
               <p>"Is that Nightingale - A. Yes. Q. Was he or not with you on the 1st of December, when you went to the office - A. He was not. Q. I understand you to swear positively, that he was not at Russell's waggon-office with you - A. He was not." He stated that Nightingale was in the habit of occasionally visiting him at Sir

I have here an account of all notes of Shields and Co. received that month; the whole amount is 1316 l.; and I find by the book, that on the 5th of December, 110 l., 130 l., and 50 l. of the same notes were presented and repaid.</p>

            . I am clerk at Russell and Co.'s waggon office, No. 12, Friday-street, and have been so nearly six years. It is my business to receive parcels and book them. On the 1st of December I recollect the defendant coming to the office with a parcel, and knew him before. He came about eight o'clock in the evening - we have no dial in the office, but I say it was near eight o'clock, because we were to have a supper that night at eight o'clock. He had a person with him, whom I afterwards saw at Guildhall - it was Nightingale; he had but one arm, and very red whiskers. I am quite sure he was with him. Painter produced a parcel to me, and paid 1 l. 2 s. 8 d. insurance on it. I locked it up immediately in an iron safe at the top of the warehouse, in the counting-house. I keep the key - there were four or five other valuable parcels there, worth 1400 l. or 1500 l. together. This parcel was insured for 450 l. I put it in the waggon, on Saturday afternoon, about four o'clock. I had kept the key all the time, and took it out of the safe about four o'clock, and locked it with the other valuable parcels in a strong box in the waggon, and saw the goods loaded over it - there was 95 cwt. put over it.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time Painter brought it, did any thing pass between you - A. Yes; two persons came into the office nearly at the same time as him, to enquire about a parcel from Bridport; I referred to the weigh-bill and found no such parcel. Painter blamed me for not attending to him first, and asked if I meant to keep him all night; he did not ask for any thing to drink, though he generally did on other occasions, and he used not to appear in a hurry - the waggon left our office, at five o'clock on Sunday morning, the 3d of December - Willis was the waggoner, and Bury the guard; it arrives at Plymouth in about ten days, there was nothing to be delivered till he got to Blandford, where he would arrive on Wednesday the 6th. I never heard any complaint of the loss of the other valuable parcels.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. The parcel was brought about eight o'clock in the evening - A. Yes; on Friday; I did not say, at Guildhall, that it was about seven o'clock; it was between half-past seven and eight - I did not say the key hung on a nail, that was the key of the strong box of the waggon. I did not know either of the two persons who called about the parcel; I never saw them afterwards - there were two people at the door, named Hodder and Maize, and who were examined at Guildhall.</p>

I consider it to be about six o'clock when I got there, and my motive for thinking so is, I usually take tea at five, which would last about half an hour, and I think it would take half an hour to go there; it is a chandler's shop - Nightingale was in the shop.

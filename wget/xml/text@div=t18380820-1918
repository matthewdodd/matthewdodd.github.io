                  </hi>. I am in the Tenth Hussars. I am valet and groom to Mr. Henry Frederick Bonham, who is a captain in that re<lb></lb>giment—he was quartered at Derby—I packed up his clothes and things—I put the watch into his portmanteau, with his shirts, waistcoats, and hand-kerchiefs, about the 14th of June—the trunk was to go by a baggage-cart, which was to go to Hounslow—it arrived at Hounslow, on or about the 22nd, I should think; the portmanteau I put the watch into was locked, and buckled with three buckles—I had the key—I am sure I locked it—when it arrived it was at an inn in the town—it was fastened down except the rivet which fastened the catch in the lock, but I could not tell that till I opened the strap over the lock—on opening it I missed the watch out of the sleeve of his pelisse—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I know it to be my master's—the prisoner belongs to the regiment, and was assisting me on the road—I did not go with the cart—I had to attend my master and to do the horses, and he assisted me-at Watford my master wished me to come on to London to get him a bed, and the prisoner was left to see those things put on the cart—I came to town with two of my master's horses—he was at Watford on or about the 22nd of June—I cannot say what time he had the loading of the goods into the cart, it was after I left Watford—I left at six o'clock in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the Tenth Hussars. I missed some money in the Kensington barracks, some time ago—I was searching the stall of the prisoner's horse, and a private, named Stevenson, who was with me, found the seals belonging to Captain Bonham's watch—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>being them</hi>)—I then took the prisoner into custody, and searched him—I found five sovereigns, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—on the 29th of July.</p>

Q.</hi> Had he been in Croydon from the time the watch was missed until you found these seals? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is impossible for me to tell that—he had a pass for Croydon—the stall I searched was at the barracks, at Kensington—that was accessible to the soldiers, but his horse stood there-other soldiers had been in the stall—I remember Burrell being taken up—I cannot say exactly how many soldiers had access to that stall—there might be one or two more, but only his horse stood there—the whole troop had access to it—I was examined before the Magistrate—I do not know whether my examination was taken down—I was not sworn—the prisoner was present when I was examined—I cannot exactly say whether it was read over to me.</p>

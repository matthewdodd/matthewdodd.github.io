On the 17th of May, about a quarter before one o'clock in the night, I was in the house adjoining - Grimes alarmed me - I went to my own house, and found him with the prisoner in custody, and found a bundle of my clothes on the ground in the street, close by him; I put them inside the house, and gave the prisoner in charge. I found my house all in disorder; the thieves had broken in at the back yard door; my shop-shelves were empty; the bundle contained three coats, ten waistcoats, a quilt, a stocking, a pillow-tick and case, a gown skirt, a shirt, a petticoat, a boy's dress, two gowns, an apron, and a handkerchief, all of which have my shop-mark upon them. I am a salesman. I delivered them to Pinnock.</p>

On the 17th of May I was next door - I had fastened the house up; I bolted the back door both top and bottom; when the alarm was given I found it broken open, and they had forced a button off the cellar door. I went into the shop, and found the goods moved; the back door was opened from within; they had entered at the cellar; an inner door was forced, which I had fastened; we were in the next house, as master was married that day, but he had not left this house.</p>

On the 25th of July Mr. Revell paid me a 50l. note, which I put into my pocket-book, with other notes; I kept my pocket-book in a book-case in the parlour in the daytime, and at night my wife always took it up to the bed-room; I had a key to the book-case; I saw the 50l. note last about seven o'clock on Saturday evening, the 12th of August; it was the outside note of some others; I missed it on Monday morning, about six o'clock, out of the pocket-book, which was then in my wife's pocket, under the pillow, in bed; I had not touched the pocket-book since Saturday; I saw it on the book-case on Sunday morning; before I went to church, and locked the bookcase before I went out, taking the key in my pocket. The prisoner had lived three months in my service, and left on the Friday week before this Sunday - she had given notice; I missed a key of the book-case, and some other keys, before she went away, and a few days after had the lock taken off, and a new key made, but whether the lock was altered I do not know; I expected the prisoner at my house at twelve o'clock on the day I missed the note, but, as she did not come, I went with a constable to Mrs. Stanley's, No. 26, Corbett's-court, Brown's-lane, Spital-fields, about two o'clock, and found the prisoner lodging there; I told her of my loss - she said she was surprised, or sorry to hear it; I said I wished to search her boxes, for I suspected her of having robbed me; she said we might, for she knew nothing of it; I found a box full of valuable silk-dresses - some silk-mercers and tavern bills - she was afterwards taken into custody. I cannot be certain whether I or my wife wrote Mr. Revell's name on the note - we invariably endorse them - I saw his name on the top of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You saw it in the bookcase at seven o'clock on Saturday night? A. Yes; I know that Mrs. Brooks took the pocket-book up to bed on Saturday and Sunday, but it was not opened after Saturday; I sleep with my room door fastened - nobody comes into my room before I am up. I had parted on good terms with the prisoner - she said she was going to Bath to see her friends. I had no other 50l. note from the time Mr. Revell paid this to me till I lost it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I generally take the pocket-book and purse every night from the book case to the bed-room, and remember doing so on Saturday, the 12th of August - I brought them down in the morning, placed them in the book-case, took them up at night from the book-case, and put them into my pocket under the pillow - I did not open the book; on Monday morning my husband missed the note; we keep the bookcase locked - nobody can get at it without a key - I had put this 50l. note into the pocket-book about three weeks before, when Mr. Revell paid it to me, and we had no other 50l. note in the house; I wrote his name on it, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you actually see the note in the book? A. I think on the Friday before it was taken; when the key was lost we had another made to the same lock; I never saw the prisoner at our house after she left till she was apprehended; it could not have been taken from under my head; I have the servant still with me who took the prisoner's place; she is not here, but the nurse maid is. When I came from church I heard the prisoner had been there.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. What time did you go to church? A. About a quarter to eleven, with my husband - we returned about one; the prisoner had told me she was going to Bath, but should return in a week, and would call. and, if I was not suited with a servant, would come back.</p>

            . On the 13th of August I was in Mrs. Brook's service, as nurse. Master and mistress went to church - the prisoner called between eleven and twelve o'clock; Butlin, the man servant let her in; I was going to clean myself, and asked her to go with me; we went into the second floor room, and in about five minutes, she said her stomach ached, and she wished to go to the watercloset, which is down stairs, and goes down two steps from the parlour door - she was down stairs about five minutes. When she went away she appointed to call next day about twelve or one o'clock, but did not come.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She was brought to your house on Monday afternoon? A. Yes; she was a very few minutes down stairs; I did not notice the time - she came up again to me, and returned into the kitchen - she was in the house about half an hour. I have lived there four years - master and mistress go regularly to church on Sundays.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you still Mr. Brooks' servant? A.

            , and live in Corbett-court. The prisoner came to lodge with me when she left Mr. Brooks. On Sunday, the day before she was taken, she came home with Butlin (I think it was about half-past two o'clock) - he spent the afternoon there, and between five and six the prisoner gave me a 50l. note to change; I changed it at the Golden Harp public-house, kept by Mr. Astle; I gave her the change - it was a 10l. note, some gold, silver, and a paper of half-pence - I told her where I got it - she owed some bills, and on Monday sent me to pay them; I cannot tell the amount - I fetched some things out of pawn for her. After she was taken up I took her child to her in prison; she always said the note was Mr. Brooks', and I asked her about the note; she said if I was afraid of the note I might shift it from the public-house, and I did. I went to Mr. Astle, by her desire, and took a man with me, who gave Astle gold for it; I had left Astle 19l. before - that was the remainder of the money the prisoner had left in the drawer - the man I took paid the rest, and Astle gave him the note - the man gave me 4l., which the prisoner has had at different times, as she wanted it. I cannot read or write.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were very much frightened about the note? A. I was when I heard Mr. Brooks had lost it; I was afraid of getting into trouble about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she say, "There is nothing wrong in it, but if you are afraid, let the note be shifted?" A. No; Mr. Brooks did not threaten to take me up; I have had her child four years, and have got it now; I do not know a 50l. note when I see it.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you tell how much money you got for it? No, it was counted into my lap; the prisoner told me it was a 50l. note; I was not taken up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot swear that the same note was given back? A. Yes; for we had no other 50l. note in the house; my husband put Stanley's name on it; I did not look to see whether any other name was on it.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Dividend-office, in the Bank. On the 8th of July, I paid a dividend warrant in the name of Revell, and among other notes, paid six of 50l., Nos. 4755 to 4760 inclusive, all dated the 26th of June, 1826.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the gentleman? A. No; I paid them to a warrant in that name - my book does not state the year the notes were dated, but we always pay dividends in notes of the current year.</p>

               <p>Mr. REVELL. This is the gentleman who paid me; I had no other 50l. notes.</p>

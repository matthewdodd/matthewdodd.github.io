                  </hi>. I am clerk to an attorney, and live in Rutland-street, Hampstead-road. On the afternoon of the 20th of November, I was in St. James's-park—a constable requested me to look round, and I saw Johnson struggling in a crowd with a constable—Johnson had a white handkerchief in his hand, which I identified as mine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable A</hi> 11.) I was in St. James's-park—I had seen the prisoners together previously in Parliament-street, noticing person's pockets as they passed, making motions to each other, and pointing to people's pockets—I suspected and watched them into St. James's-park—they were both behind the prosecutor, close together—I afterwards saw Webb seize hold of Johnson—Haslam directly drew himself back, and made his way out of the crowd—I laid hold of him—I believe he was near enough to see what Johnson did—I had seen them in Parliament-street not three minutes before, and saw them twice stop to try to get up to two individuals, but the crowd being so great they ran on—they went up to the prosecutor, and were not there a second before the constable took Johnson.</p>

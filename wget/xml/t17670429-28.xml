            . I live in Queen-street, Seven Dials; I lett the prisoner a ready furnished lodging, on or about the 9th of March; after that Mr. Pickering came and told me I was robb'd, and he had got the thief in the Round-house. I went there; I saw the prisoner. I ask'd him for the key of the room; then I went and look'd in it, and missed the things laid in the indictment: the prisoner own'd he had taken them, and went with me and the constable to the house where he had pawn'd the blanket and sheet; we brought them to the Justice (this was the 16th of March) then we went to another place for the pictures.</p>

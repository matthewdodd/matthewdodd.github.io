                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective N</hi>). I was patrolling with Detective Fletcher on the morning of the 13th May, about 4.45, when I saw the two prisoners together in Dalston Rise—I followed them, and saw Jennings go into the garden of a gentleman's house, and Johnson stood outside the gate until Jennings came out—we followed into Stoke Newington Road, and Fletcher took Jennings—Johnson ran away very sharply—I ran after him, and called out "Stop thief" and "Police"—Police-constable Baker ran after him, and I returned to the station, and searched Jennings—in his trousers pocket I found this mortice chisel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it would be used to go under a window to prise up a sash—I asked him to account for it, and he said "Find out; I am a carpenter"—I asked him where he worked, and he said "Find out"—I asked him where he lived, and he said "Find out; I shan't tell you nothing, I am not such a mug as that."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective N</hi>). I was in company with Armstrong when we saw the prisoners watching the houses as they were going along—Jennings went into the front garden of a gentleman's house in Amhurst Road—Johnson stood outside watching, and he came out again, and joined Johnson, and they walked very sharply up into West Hackney, by the church, and looked round, and when they saw us they walked off very sharply down Stoke Newington Road, and there we pursued them—I took Jennings, and Johnson ran away—I was present when Armstrong searched Jennings—when the chisel was found he said "Oh, that is nothing!"—we asked him to give an account of himself, and he said "Find out."</p>

I was in plain clothes about 5 a.m. on the morning in question when I heard cries of "Stop thief," and I saw Johnson running—I ran after him for about two miles, and caught him getting over the railway walls on to the railway—he said nothing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman N</hi> 42). I went to a Mr. Hogg's house in Lordship Road, Stoke Newington, and took this chisel with me—I found a window had been forced open—it had marks on it which I found by comparison exactly fitted the chisel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jennings's Defence</hi>. I met Johnson a little after five o'clock, and asked him the road. He said he was going the same way, and would show me. We turned the corner of Amhurst Road when two detectives charged us. I did not run at all, and they shouted out to a constable to stop the pair of us. It is an ordinary mortice chisel which I bought at an iron-monger's stall for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I took it and put a handle to it When I was taken in custody I said, "I am a carpenter, and have several others in my basket."</p>

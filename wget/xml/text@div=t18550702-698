                  </hi>. I am warehouseman in the employ of Messrs. Robert Schofield and others, No. 1, Gresham-street, City. We had been in the habit of receiving goods from Messrs. Chapman and Co., No. 68, Cheapside, on approbation—that is a customary thing in the trade, on sale or return—on 4th June we received a parcel of goods from them—the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>

"I have called for the goods you had on approbation from Messrs. Chapman' 1—I said, "Very well; count the number of pieces; how many do you make them?"—he said, "Fifteen"—I said, "Very well; sign your name here;" and he did, and took away the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Chapman and Co. On 4th June I sent some goods to the last witness's by the prisoner—he was then in our service—he was discharged on 5th June, and not taken on again—he was not in our service on 11th June, and had no authority to go for these goods—we never received them—when goods are sent to Messrs Schofield, we send for them back—we send round to the houses, and once a week take stock of what they sell, and the rest remain, or are taken back—till we have taken stock in this way, the goods remain on sale or return—the goods remain our property—when we find they have been sold, we make an invoice as being sold by us to them, but up to that time they remain our property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi>. You never did send for these goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—if goods are not returned, we do not hold the person to whom they are sent responsible till we enter them to him—if they are never returned, we hold him responsible for them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So long as these goods remain in possession of the person to whom you send them, so long you consider that person responsible for them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> These goods were delivered to Schofield and Co.; suppose they had been burnt down, would you not have held them responsible for them? A That is a question I really cannot decide—till goods are returned to us, we hold the parties to whom they have been consigned or sent, responsible for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You treat it as a deposit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Jury. Q.</hi>. When these goods are sent out, they are sent on sale or return? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; not entered up to the person—if they are sold after seven or eight days, they are entered by invoice—in case of the place being burned, we should make them responsible.</p>

Said I, what business had you in the shop, and now you want to go out again? He said he came with the little boy that went out. I told him, I believed he was one of those who had robbed me some time before, and I would take him before a magistrate; though I did not know at that time that he had robbed me of any thing. The great one was a little frightened, and said he did not take any thing, but at last he confessed, that they had taken two pieces off a shelf, and he shewed me where they took them from; (the little one was hovering about at a little distance) and when he had acknowledged the little one had taken something, I called out , Stop thief! and he dropped the goods, and was taken.</p>

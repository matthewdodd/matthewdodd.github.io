               <p>Were you a good deal alarmed at this time? - Yes, my child was crying and screaming; I must be sadly frightened no doubt, when the chap was threatening to pull her out of the chaise; it was just on dusk, but it was plain enough to distinguish one person from another; I know the prisoner Roberts to be the person that robbed me; he stood at the horse's head the whole time; I took particular notice both of his coat, and his face, I believe it was the same coat he he has on now; it was much the same colour; I saw the prisoner again in about an hour; he was in custody when I came to Highgate; immediately after they had got the money, they desired me to drive on, but the horse rather run back; says they, do not you presume to look back, for if you do you are a dead man; I touched the horse with the whip, and he ran back; says I, gentleman, I will be much obliged to you to take hold of the horse, and lead him on; Roberts did so, and they went back from London after the robbery; I came to town; I first saw the prisoner at the Bull, at Highgate; they were both in custody; I was immediately asked what money I lost; I described a new guinea of the year 1777, and some shillings, and they were searched, and on Roberts was found just such a guinea, and three or four shillings; I had only that guinea about me; I am sure of Roberts; I cannot presume to say that the other was the man that took the money from me.</p>

               <p>It was about seven, and getting dusk; you had never seen any of the people before, and very much alarmed for your little girl? - Yes, I dot not know I ever was at Finchley above twice in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Roberts. Did not you look at my guinea that I pulled out of my pocket, before you described the date of that you had lost? - I might turn over his guinea, but before I saw it, I said the date that was upon it.</p>

               <p>I saw some men come from a coach, about two hundred yards from the Bald-face-stag, and go and stop Mr. Morgan's chaise; I saw only two men; It was about a hundred yards from the Stag, as near as I can guess; after they stopped the chaise, they went to the coach again, and the coachman drove off as fast as he could drive; I followed them right round by Finchley church, it is about three miles round; and just as I got up to Highgate, these lads took them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What are you? - I am a labouring man; I did live with Mr. Bagley at Highgate; I am out of place now, and have been out of place about five weeks; I believe I was out of place at the time this happened; I worked for Mr. Bagley last, at Highgate; I followed them right round there.</p>
               <p>Why did not you give any alarm round there? - I gave the alarm all round Finchley, there was not a creature came out.</p>
               <p>What might you be doing thereabouts? - I had been at East Barnet about buying some pigs? - I take it, that the Horse Shoes, is about a quarter of a mile from the Bald-face-stag? - More than that now, between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240009"></xptr>the Bald-face Stag, and the Horse-shoes; there is a hill, they were not on the hill.</p>
               <p>If a man stands at the Bald-face Stag, can he possibly see what was done at the Horse-shoes? - That is impossible.</p>
               <p>So, that if a chaise was coming up the hill by the Three Horse-shoes, a man standing by this six mile stone could not see what passed? - It was but the half way.</p>
               <p>You know the hand-post that goes off to the Hog-Market? - I cannot say I do; I have been a labourer about two years.</p>
               <p>Do you know the road that goes to the Hog-Market? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One road goes by the Bald-face Stag? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was you when you saw this? - I was about, may-be four hundred yards from the Bald-face Stag.</p>
               <p>How far was it from where the coach stopped, that the chaise was stopped? - it might be five hundred, or six hundred yards, or more.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, can any man alive see from the distance of five or six hundred yards, on from the Bald-face Stag? - I was about the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>Will you swear, that a man standing in the middle way between the Three Horseshoes and the Bald-face Stag, can see to the hill; suppose a man was in the middle, between the Bald-face Stag and the Three Horse-shoes, can he see any thing that passes upon the hill that comes up from the Horse-shoes toward London? - What I saw I can swear to.</p>
               <p>It is a quarter of a mile? - It may be half a mile from the Three Horse-shoes, to the Bald-face Stag; I did not mark the ground.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was stopped on the rise of the hill, some distance from the Horseshoes.</p>
               <p>Court to Hall. Was the coach out of your sight? - Yes; I suppose it was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, before I met the boys.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Roberts. I refer it entirely to the Court; the principle witness I should have called, is at the point of death, which Mr. Sims can testify, he saw the people come by at the time the robbery was committed, and he said at Highgate to Mr. Morgan; why, you are swearing false!</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Sims. Did you hear that? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You know that Becket is ill? - Yes, he is unable to attend, he was sent for as an officer, he came down to the Office; he said, he saw some suspicious persons along with Hall; Beckett was in company with Hall, they had been together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Harvey. I leave my defence to my counsel; I am very innocent of the affair.</p>

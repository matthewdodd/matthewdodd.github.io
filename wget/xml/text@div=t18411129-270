                  </hi>. I am a Greenwich pensioner. I saw my watch safe on Wednesday, the 3rd of November, in my chest under my bed at Green-wich—I missed it on the Saturday morning—I had sent the prisoner to my chest on Friday, the 5th, to get some bread for tea, about six o'clock—I had seen my watch in the chest about two o'clock that day—she is a capmaker—she drank tea with me on the 4th and on the 5th, but did not drink tea regularly with me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He told me to pawn the watch—he was drunk. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not—I was sober, and was capable of walking as well as at any other time—I had no liquor that day—we had had the beer served out in the College, and had a pot or two of beer, which I gave the prisoner the money, to buy—I suppose she must have taken it when she went for the bread—she passed that night with me—I lived at Chatham, but I never gave her the watch to pawn, either at Chatham, or at Greenwich.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Sharpe, a pawnbroker.

I was with the prosecutor on the Monday after this happened—the prisoner came up in a state of inebriation, and gave herself up to me, she said she was the woman who had stolen the watch on Friday, and she had pledged it on Saturday, at Mr. Sharpe's, for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

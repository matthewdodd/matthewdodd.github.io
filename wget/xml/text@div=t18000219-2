               <p>Q. When had you seen them in that warehouse? - A. I cannot positively say that I ever saw them in that warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to having seen these identical numbers any-where? - A. I cannot; but my porter is here, who made a list of the numbers in the warehouse, and from which these were missing; on the 23d, I had observed this warehouse-door open about noon; I had seen it in the morning, when I was convinced it was shut; the door is not well hung, and unless it is locked, always swings open; I observed the door open about one o'clock that day; my Warehouseman Was then gone to dinner; I soon after went to the bottom of the garden in order to lock the door, but when I came there, I found the door was shut close; I clapped my hand against the door gently, it immediately gave way; then the warehouseman returned from dinner; I questioned him as to his being in the warehouse that day; he said he had not been there that day at all; upon further examination I found a nail put into the rabbit of the door, which operated like a spring, and kept the door close; on the day following the person to whom these books were sold came to me; I asked him a description of the man; I suspected the prisoner, and I took him to the place where the man lived; I found him at his lodgings near my house; he had worked for me from the 19th of December preceding, or thereabout; I sent for an officer and took him to Hatton-garden; the numbers are in Court; my servant has had them ever since they were delivered to him at the Magistrate's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me in that warehouse at the time you mention? - A. No; I never saw him in that warehouse during the time he worked for me.</p>

             sworn. - I am a bookseller in Baldwin's-gardens: On the 23d of January, about four o'block, the prisoner brought me, to the best of my recollection, one hundred and seventy numbers of Harrison's Classics for sale; he said he was going to Liverpool, he had been paying his coach fare in the City, and had no time to spare; I do not recollect what he asked for them, but I offered him a guinea, and he took it; he bought a bird and a cage of me for three shillings, and I gave him eighteen shillings in money; about six o'clock I looked them over, and found them to be odd numbers; I went to two booksellers to ask their opinion, and they were of opinion that I was taken in, that they were worth nothing to me but waste paper; but when I looked them over again, I thought there was something in it that was not fair, and I was determined to find out the proprietor; and I went about the next day form eight to one, till I found out Mr. Walker, and I delivered them to him; they were the same that I had bought of the prisoner; Mr. Walker took me to the prisoner's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; do you believe him to be the man? - A. I believe him to be the man, but my knowledge of him is but shallow.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the man that Walker took you to; have you any doubt then whether it was the same man? - A. An oath is a serious thing, but I believe it to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether that man was the prisoner at the bar? - A. He has every appearance to me of being the same; I have but very little doubt that he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to him, by Walker, in his presence? - A. Mr. Walker asked him what he had done with the money; and he said he had made away with it.</p>

             sworn. - I work for Mr. Walker, I take care of his work; the prisoner worked for Mr. Walker; these numbers were in a little warehouse adjacent to where he worked; I kept a list of those that were in bundles, and the odd numbers.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them last? - A. Some of them must have been there for a twelvemonth or more; I cannot speak to having seen them at any particular time; I had seen the bundles, but not to look them over, I kept the key of the warehouse; I was called into the parlour on the 24th of January, and there I saw the numbers, (produces them); I know them to be the same that were in that warehouse; there were eighty-seven of one number, and fifty of another; the next day my master and I went into the warehouse, and looked them over, and these two bundles were wanting; of No. 83, there are eighty-seven books, and of No. 118, there are fifty books, and a variety of odd numbers; eleven of No. 1, two of No. 10, three of No. 12, three of No. 13, and others; but I cannot speak particularly to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walker. I examined these bundles with the last witness, I marked them off as he called them over, and found these particular numbers, that he has stated, missing from the warehouse; and these numbers were found in the bundle that Tibbetts brought to me, they are worth about two pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I trust myself to God and yourselves, for the sake of my wife and children.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

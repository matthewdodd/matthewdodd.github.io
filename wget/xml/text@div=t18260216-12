            . I am an officer. I took up the prisoner on Sunday, the 15th of January; Sims said to him, "William, you know you have robbed my master" - he denied it. I went with Sims to Mr. White's, the Edinburgh tavern, Sweeting's-court - he was not at home, and I went again at two o'clock; I then found the shirt, which was claimed by Sims, on the prisoner - he said nothing about it. He was charged with robbing Mr. White, but nothing was found upon him.</p>

            . I live in St. George's East. I have known the prisoner from his infancy - he has been an honest faithful young man. I met the prosecutor at Bow, and heard him ask the prisoner if he was not going to return his things back which he had of him at "His high life below stairs," at his master's, at Upton-place.</p>

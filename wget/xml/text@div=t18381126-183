                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 146.) About half-past four o'clock in the morning of the 29th of November, I was on duty in Oxford-street, and met the prisoner carrying some clothes under his arm, between King-street and Blenheim-steps, near Marlborough-street—I called to him to stop, and asked what he had under his arm—he kept walking on, and would not answer me—I overtook and stopped him—he said they were tome old things he had got from a friend of his—I asked him who the friend was—he said, "Mr. Abrahams, a Jew, in Houndsditch"—I said perhaps he knew what was in the pockets of the clothes, if there was any thing—he said there was nothing in the pockets—I showed him the outside of the pocket with a handkerchief, and then he said there was a handker<lb></lb>chief in it—I said, "What is the colour of it, perhaps you can tell?" but he could not, and I took him to the station-house—I searched the things, and in the pocket of the waistcoat I found two rings, and a child's whistle in the trowser's pocket, and in the prisoner's own jacket pocket I found a pair of spectacles—he said they were his own, and his sight was very bad—I also found a pair of gloves in his pocket which he said were his own, with 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 9 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—he said perhaps Mr. Abrahams had made a mistake and left the ring in his pocket—he appeared quite rational, and as if he wished to account for every thing I taxed him with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Nag's Head-yard, Blenheim-street, Oxford-street, in the parish of St. James—my door is about two hundred yards from Blenheim-steps—I occupy two rooms up in a gallery—they are not in a house—there is no street-door—I go up stairs into the gallery and into my room—I occupy the two upper rooms—they have no communication with the rest of the building—I pay rent for them—on the 29th of November, I and my wife went to bed at eleven o'clock—we shut the door to, but as my son was absent at Lambeth, it was left unlocked for him to come in—the door was closed and latched, and could not be opened without lifting the latch—my wife alarmed me a little after four o'clock, thinking she heard a noise, I thought it was only her imagina<lb></lb>tion, but she continued to be alarmed, and I got out of bed about a quarter past four o'clock—I found the door wide open and missed my trowsers and what was in the pockets—I afterwards missed my son's coat and waistcoat, and two rings which had been in the waistcoat pocket—he had come home at a quarter past twelve o'clock, I believe, and went to bed in the next room—I had shut my door, but it was not locked.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am a registered medical practitoner—on Saturday morning, 6th June, I was fetched to 5, patriot Square, by a constable—I got there about 7; the inspector was there—I went to the first-floor front room, and saw a woman on a bed in the corner of the room on the left as you enter—the head of the bed was against the wall, and she was on the right-hand side of it towards the vial looking towards the bed; she was on the left side, on the side next the wall—there is a passage leading from the door of the front room to the door of the back room, and she was on the side next the passage; her head was resting on the pillow turned rather towards the wall; she had a chemise and stockings on, and to the best of my re<lb></lb>collection the lower two-thirds of the body was covered with the bed<lb></lb>clothes—I saw blood on the pillow and on the upper part of the bed<lb></lb>clothes, and there were some spots on the ceiling just above her head—she was quite dead—my opinion is that she had been dead the last three house; the arms and legs were cold, and the trunk had very little warmth in it; it is difficult to tell within halt an hour or an hour how long death has taken place—there was nothing in the room to lead one to think that there had been a struggle of any sort—it was not tidy, but nothing was upset—I was shown the flat-iron; there was dry blood on it—a poker was standing on the left-hand side of the fireplace—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the evening of the same day, and found six extensive cuts on the scalp, which in my opinion were inflicted by this iron—there must have been several blows, six at least; one cut was just on the middle of the scalp over the forehead, one over the left eye but in the hairy scalp, two behind the light ear, and two" towards the back of the head; the skull was fractured in two places; one was over the left eye and the other behind the right ear, and fissures ran from the fractures in all directions; the bone forming the right ear was literally smashed; there were other fractures in the base of the skull, and there was a large clot of blood corresponding with one of the blows—either of the blows causing the fracture would be quite sufficient to cause immediate insensibility—the pericardium, which surrounds the heart, was ruptured on the right side, and the heart was ruptured also—there was considerable bruising and abrasion over the breast-bone, such as might be done by blows with the iron, and the breast-bone was smashed into an indefinite number of pieces, quite indescribable; that must have been done by many blows—ten of the angles of the ribs on the right side were fractured and seven on the left, and there were external marks corresponding—a blow or a weight might have done that—the weight generally breaks the ribs, the cause of death, and rup<lb></lb>ture of the heart, either of which would cause death—I should say a</p>

                  </hi>.I am a printer, and the husband of the last witness—on Saturday, June 5, about 4.30 a.m., my wife called my attention, and I heard a slight knocking, a dull sound in the next room, the prisoner's room, as if a man was mending his boots—it continued about a second—I heard nothing else—there were about six knocks—I went to sleep afterwards, and at 6.30 the police knocked at my door; I was then just awake, but in bed—I then heard what had happened in the next room.</p>

                  </hi>.I am a looking-glass counter—on 5th June I occupied the back room first-floor at 5, Patriot Square, under the prisoner, but in the back room—I heard no noise during night of the 4th, but at 5 or 5.30 by the clock in my room I heard about five knocks, which sounded as if over my head—it was like hitting the bed—a quarter of an hour afterwards I heard some one come in at the door, and then some one went out.</p>

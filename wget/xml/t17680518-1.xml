            . After I was called to Mr. Jones's, he ordered me to go down the road; I looked over the bank, and saw the prisoner behind a bush on his hands and knees, skulking about thirty or forty yards from the house; I went and told Mr. Jones of it; then I went and found the prisoner about thirty or forty yards from the place where I had first seen him, lying on the ground; I went and took him; he said, pray, Sir, let me go, and I'll come here no more; he shook and trembled very much; the lead was found where I first saw him under the bush, (produced in court and deposed to by prosecutor;) it matched to the other lead where it was cut from.</p>

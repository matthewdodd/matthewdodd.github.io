                  </hi>. I live at No. 107, Union-street, St. Saviour's, South<lb></lb>wark, and am a shoemaker—I have another establishment in the New-cut—the prisoner was formerly in my employ for six or seven weeks. On the 22nd of April, I met him with George Rogers, who had been in my employ—I went to a public-house with them—I went to one or two pub<lb></lb>lic-houses with Rogers, and to one with the prisoner—I had something to drink, and was a little intoxicated—it might be about eight o'clock in the morning when I met the prisoner—I left the company of Rogers, went home, and went to bed between twelve and one o'clock, as near as possible—I do not think I was in the prisoner's company above an hour and a half, but I was with Rogers till about half-past twelve o'clock in the day time—I left him close by my own home—I was in bed at one o'clock, and slept through the day and the night; and about a quarter to one o'clock in the morning I was awoke by my dog barking—I was certain there must be somebody in the shop, by the barking of the dog which was in the shop—I was quite sober at this time—when I came down, I saw the prisoner in the shop—I had the gas burning—I gave an alarm backwards—I <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "Murder! thieves!"—I could see nobody in the shop but the prisoner—I was quite sure he was there—I was not the first person who got into the shop—I called out backwards, seeing the prisoner in the shop—while I was calling out, Mrs. Cox jumped out of bed, and flew into the shop—we got the street door open, and gave an alarm there—I sent my boy, Jenkins, with some goods to the other shop, in the New-cut, next day, and on his return he made communication to me.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. COX</hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On Wednesday the 22nd of April my husband came home and went to bed—he remained in bed the whole day—I shut up, and went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock—Jenkins, my boy, left at ten o'clock—before I went to bed I saw every place secure—I looked at the window-stall shutter—I saw it was fastened—the window-slides and the shutter-bolts—at one o'clock in the morning Mr. Cox awoke me, as the dog awoke him—he called out and said there were thieves in the place—I immediately jumped up, and ran into the shop—I saw the prisoner—he was the only person I saw in the place—he went down into the stall, and got out—I saw no more of him—I opened the street door and hallooed out "Thieves" and "Murder"—the policeman came very soon after, and he went down—I saw the bolt of the shutter next morning almost broken in two—the prisoner could get out, as the stall-shutter was unbolted—the street door was quite safe, as I had left it, bolted with two bolts and locked—he must have come in through the stall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. On Wednesday, the 22nd of April, I went on an errand for my mother, after leaving my master's to the Monument public-house in Union-street, about twenty yards from Mr. Cox's premises—I saw the prisoner and Rogers there, and two girls with them—the prisoner asked me if my master was at home—I said, "What is that to you? Yes, he is"—Rogers then asked me if my master was in bed and asleep—I said yes, he was—this was rather before eleven o'clock at night—I had left my master's at ten o'clock—next day I was sent by my master down to the New-cut, and on the road I saw Rogers with two other girls, by the side of Mrs. Slater's shop, where the prisoner works—I overheard a conversation between Rogers and the girls, and informed my master—I saw the prisoner in Mrs. Slater's shop on my return.</p>

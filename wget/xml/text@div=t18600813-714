                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Ladislas Kiss, warehouseman, at 93, Wat ling-street—he has no partner—I recollect Casabianca coming to me early in May—I had known him before as the agent of Messrs. Million, of Lyons—he said he had recommended a gentleman to us who wanted to buy some silk goods, and he thought we might very safely deal with him—this was on 5th May, I think—he said the order was so small that he did not think it worth while to send it to Lyons for execution, and that he knew the class of goods we generally kept, and that we could do the thing right for him—I inquired of him who the gentleman was—he said he was a very respectable man; that he had had transactions with Million and Co., and had always paid them—he said that he did not owe them anything then; and that we might safely trust him—he said nothing more at that time—I don't think he gave any name at that time—he said the person would call—he said he wanted about eight or ten pieces of silk—about two days afterwards the prisoner Honess called—he said that he was the person "recommended" by Mr. Casa<lb></lb>bianca—I don't remember whether he used the word recommended—it was either "recommended" or "introduced"—he said he wanted to select a few pieces of silk—he was shown some goods, and the goods were selected for him—he told us at the same time that he had had transactions with Million and Co. himself, to the extent of 8000 or 10,000 francs; or more than that, some 20.000 francs—he said he did not owe them anything then; he had not had transactions with them for some two months, or it might be more—he subsequently showed me some bills—he said he wanted the goods to ship them—I understood him to say to Hamburg—he named some foreign place but I did not take particular notice—he pamed some place in Germany</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186008130070"></xptr>
               <p>—he did not mention the name, I think, to whom he was going to send them—I went to his office in Moorgate-street chambers a day or two afterwards—we had not then parted with the goods; they had been looked at—I went to his office for the purpose of seeing what sort of a place he had got—he had got very good furniture and there was every appearance of respectability about it—I interrogated him as to his transactions with Million and Co., and he showed me then some bills of Million and Co. which had been drawn on him, and, I believed, paid; I had no reason to doubt it—I do not recollect the sums of the bills; I saw the name of Million and Co.—he confirmed those remarks which he had previously made, that he owed them nothing at that time—I asked him where he kept his account—he said at the Unity Bank; I decided eventually on allowing him to have the goods—it was principally the introduction from Mr. Casabianca, and subsequently the recommendation we received from Mr. Bellamin, that induced me to let him have them—if I had known that he had not an account at the Unity Bank that would have influenced me to some extent—I applied to Mr. Bellamin and had a state<lb></lb>ment made to me by him—he is clerk or manager to Messrs. Million of Lyons—the goods were sent and an invoice sent with them—4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the price agreed on for them—the amount of them was 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill that was given by Honess for the goods—it was dishonoured (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: dated "March, 1860: 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Drawn by Kiss upon Honess and Co., and accepted payable at the Unity Bank; at one month"</hi>)—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter that I received from Honess before the goods were sup<lb></lb>plied—I believe it to be in his writing from the knowledge that I have obtained of his writing—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "Moorgate-street Chambers; May 11th, 1860.

Yours respectfully, W. G. Honess and Co.")—The goods were sent on 12th May—I received this letter on 23d May which I believe to bein Honess's writing, (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "23d May, Messrs. Kiss and Co.—Gentlemen, having received a letter from my correspondent in Hamburg, stating that he is in want of about 21 1/2 yards more of black silk to complete his order, and if you have three pieces the same as last please send them in with bill as before—hoping you will be able to make some allowance on that small parcel, as you charged us one penny more than what we arranged, namely 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. instead of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

               <p>could venture to say that he is not, but I would not swear it—the prisoner did not, that I recollect, refer me to Mr. Bellamin at all—I inquired of Mr. Bellamin, and the result of my inquiry was satisfactory and recommendatory—very probably I left the office in Moorgate-street with a purpose, and stating my purpose, of making further inquiries; and I subsequently made those further inquiries—I believe I wrote a letter to the prisoner—I have not got my letter-book in court—the letter written by myself was, I believe, after I had received the letter from the prisoner which has been read—I might have been in the counting-house when the selection of the silk took place, but it was not under my direction—I do not know the quality of the silks that were selected—at the time the second parcel of silks was applied for I made an objection—I declined supplying them with a second parcel of goods unless the first goods were paid for, or unless he gave us good security—I expressed my willingness to receive a bill with the endorsement of a third party, if the party was respectable—a bill was then given to me, indorsed, I believe, by a gentleman named Parker—I was satisfied with that indorse<lb></lb>ment at the time—the terms are always arranged by somebody else in the establishment.</p>

Levick and received this letter in answer (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "14th May, 1860: from Robert Levick to Messrs.

Kiss—I received the silk from the porter, and my signature is in the book—Honess told me to take one of the pieces to Beunoch's—I did not hear what took place—I took the rest subsequently by Mr. Honess's direction—before that there was a man in possession of the premises—I recollect being sent to Mr. Kiss's about some goods; I was to fetch three pieces of silk from there—Mr. Kiss told me he had just sent them; I communicated that afterwards to Honess—he said that was quite right—I did not see the goods when I got back, most likely I should have seen them if they had been there—I told Mr. Honess there was a man in possession; he did not make any answer—the man remained forty-five days—he was in possession before the second parcel came; I don't recollect how</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you go into the employment of Mr. Honess? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In September, 1859—at that time I believe he was in partnership with Mr. Brunow—Mr. Brunow was there a great deal more than Casabianca—Brunow left to go to France; I don't think he went away unexpectedly—I have been with Russell, the police-constable, since this matter, three or four times a-week—I talked over this matter with firm from time to time—I think Brunow went about the beginning of November; I knew he was going beforehand because he was preparing his boxes—he told me he was going away and bade me good-bye when he went—the conversation between Honess and Casabianca took place in May, I am sure of that—I know it was in May because it was just before the time the goods came in—the words were "Have you been there?"—they were talking about Mr. Kiss afterwards—Mr. Casabianca said, "Where?" in answer to that question, and Honess said, "In Watling-street"—I afterwards heard Mr. Kiss's name mentioned, every now and then; I was not in the same room, the door was not open—I took the silk to Mr. Bennoch's—it was in parcels—I saw it folded up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that you were told that if Mr. Bellamin asked you about the goods you were to say they had not come; did not that refer to the silk that Mr. Bennoch had? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; not to anything that came from Mr. Kiss's—the silk that came from Mr. Kiss's never went out of the house till I took it—it was in the warehouse—it was in my sight—I had to go into the ware-house two or three times, and I could not help seeing it—it was there alto<lb></lb>gether nine or ten days; I went into the warehouse very nearly every day—the policeman came to me first at the end of last month—I did not take any paper out of the office and give it to Kiss—I did not do anything with the invoice Mr. Kiss sent with the silk—I never took that invoice out of the house; Mr. Honess told me to give it to him—on my oath I never took a paper, invoice, or anything else belonging to my master out of the house and gave it to Mr. Kiss—Casabianca came about four or five times a-week—sometimes he remained an hour, sometimes longer, and sometimes not so long—he would sometimes stop to write a letter there—there were three rooms at the office—I know there was something being done to Casabianca's office at that time—I don't know what it was.</p>

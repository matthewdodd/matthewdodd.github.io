                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 14th June, from information I received I watched the church of St. Martin in Martin's Lane, Cannon Street, with Tansey, about 7.50 a.m., I saw Hawksby and Richards leave the side door of the church, where they were at work—seeing that they looked bulky I followed them—they went to a coffee-house in Fish Street Hill, they stayed in there for about ten minutes; they then came out and I followed them on to London Bridge—I saw the lead inside their trousers before they went into the coffee-house, as I followed them, it was sticking out from the pockets; they had their waistcoats buttoned, and it was round their waistcoat, and their trousers had pockets like flap pockets, and I saw it outside from the pockets—they got on an omnibus at London Bridge; I and Tansey got inside—they got down at White Street, andas they were getting down I could see the lead between their trousers and waistcoat, just outside their shirt—when they got into White Street, Richards left Hawksby, and went in front of him about 6 yards, after saying something to Hawksby, that I did not hear—I saw him then go into Mrs. Jackson's, 22, White Street—Hawksby followed in about two minutes; the name of "Jackson, plumber and glazier" was over the door; they went into the shop, went through, and went into a little back parlour immediately at the back of the shop, a door with a glass window separates the shop from the back parlour; that door was half open—when I got to the shop door I saw the two prisoners go into the little room on the right hand side followed by Mrs. Jackson—this model (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I believe to be correct as nearly as possible—I was standing in front of the shop door when I saw them—they were in the little room a couple of minutes, they then came out and I observed that the lead was gone from their waist—they then went back to the church</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187608080004"></xptr>
               <p>before their time—I followed them; about 11 o'clock I saw Richards come to the wicket door of the church; <hi rend="italic">he</hi> looked up and down the street a second afterwards Hawksby came out, I saw that ho had got some head between his trousers and shirt, underneath—he was then alone—I followed him, he got on a 'bus—Tansey got inside the 'bus and I followed in a hansom—I saw him go into the same place, Mrs. Jackson's, Tausey followed him in, and from what he told me I went into the shop immediately and saw Mrs. Jackson in the act of coming out of the little side room, and Hawksby inside in the act of buttoning up his trousers; I told him I was a detective officer of the City police, and said "Where is the lead you have just brought up"—he said "I have brought no lead in"—I looked down on the floor just where he was standing and saw this piece of lead (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>), it was just by the scales, and there was the exact weight of it on the scales, 65 lbs.Z; I have weighed it since—it was not lying open on the floor, it was just knocked off the scales and a rag was thrown over it—I told Hawksby he must consider himself in custody for stealing this lead—I also told Jackson that I should take her into custody and charge her with receiving it well knowing it to be stolon—she said "For God's sake don't take me," or some words to that effect—I saw a cupboard in the little room with a padlock on it—I said "What is there in this cupboard?"—she said "Nothing"—I asked her to open it—she said she would not, there was nothing in it—I said "I know there is because I saw Hawksby and the other man bring some lead here this morning; if you don't open it I shall burst it open"—she then took from her pocket some keys which she gave me and I opened it, and in it I found about 1 1/2 ton of lead, all done up in the same manner as this, consisting of piping with nails driven in it for the purpose of supporting it by their belts inside their trousers—it was all new lead—these are the straps or belts which the prisoners were wearing when they were searched; Hawksby had his round his shirt inside his trousers, and the nails on the lead came against the leather and held it up—I asked Jackson if she could account for this lead; she said she did not how she had got it—Hawksby said to me "There are good and bad amongst you, and feeling men as well; I will give you a sovereign to just let me slip out at the back door, and you can <hi rend="italic">square</hi> your mate afterwards; I promise you no one shall know a word about it; I will own I have taken that piece," that was the 65 lbs.—I said "I saw you bring some there as well this morning with the other one"—he said "You don't expect me to <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on my mate"—he said "I brought a piece myself, but I would sooner suffer five years than <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on my mate"—we then took him and Jackson to the station—afterwards, about 12.20, I met Richards coming from the direction of the Borough over London Bridge—I told him I was a detective in the City police and I should take him in custody and charge him with being concerned with another one in custody in stealing a quantity of lead from St. Martin's Church, Martin's Lane, the property of his master—he said "You will have to prove it"—I took him to the station and told him that I had seen him at 8 o'clock in the morning with the other one take some lead to Mrs. Jackson's in White Street, Borough—he said he had not been there and did not where it was—I saw Richards searched and this belt found on him; I afterwards saw the lead taken to the church, and the foreman compared and measured it.</p>

               <p>had seen the lead through their trousers; I knew they had got stolen lead I did not take them, because I wanted to get the receiver—I knew the receiver did not live at the coffee-shop, because I was inside the coffee-shop while they were there—I did not go in as soon as they did, but they had not time to part with it—I got in just about a second after them—they were in there about ten minutes; I waited till they came out and then followed them to Jackson's shop—I did not lose sight of them, only just going inside the shop—I knew they had got the lead in their possession then; I did not go into the shop then; I knew the shop before—I believe I have given the same evidence to day as I did before the Magistrate as nearly as I can recollect—I don't think I said then anything about Hawksby saying he would sooner get five years than round on his mate.</p>

Tansey was not with me in the coffee-shop, he was outside all the time—I will swear he did not go in; I don't believe he did, I did not see him—I was not looking after him, I was looking after myself—I was quite close to the prisoners; I can't say whether Tansey saw what I did, they were sitting somewhere about the third box on the left hand side.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">STRAIGHT</hi>. The two windows that look out on White Street are windows you can see through; I swear that; I could see through them plain enough—the doors were open—there is a counter on the right hand side of the shop, and on the other side a lot of glass, painters' and plumbers' materials—when you get into the back room you have to go behind the door to get into the little side room, there was nothing in that room; the scales were there—the first time I got there was about 8.15; the transaction—inside did not take above two or three minutes—the second time I got there was about 11.30; Hawksby had just got in when I went in, he had just time to pass into the inner room; Tansey saw more of that than me—I was there about five, ten, or fifteen minutes before I took Jackson to the station—I believe she said "For God's sake don't take me, for the sake of my children"—Tansey said "You should have thought of that before"—she said "I did not know I was doing wrong, I only bought bits of lead"—she had got the key of the cup<lb></lb>board on a bunch in her pocket—I should like to say one word more; this model is not quite correct, there is a little side door which is the door Hawksby wanted to go out of when he offered me the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that leads round some passages, so that you can get out the back way.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detretive</hi>). On 14th June I was with Davis and I saw Hawksby and Richards about 7.50 come together from the church in Martin's Lane and cross King William Street—I noticed that they were bulky about their chests—I followed them to a coffee-shop on Fish Street Hill; they went in and remained there about ten minutes and another man with them; I watched at the door opposite, Davis was along with me—when they came out they went up the steps on to London Bridge, and got on the top of an omnibus, I and Davis got inside—they got off the omnibus at St. George's church and went down White Street, Richards about 20 or 30 yards in advance of Hawksby; they went into No. 22, White Street, Mrs. Jackson's—we remained there; Richards came out and Hawksby was going in at the same time, he subsequently came out, they were both very much thinner when they came out—they went to a public-house close by, and then went over London Bridge—about 11 o'clock I was with Davis in Camion Street and saw Richards look out at a door; expecting that he was</p>

               <p>coming out we watched, Hawksby then came out and went into King William Street, he remained there a few minutes, apparently waiting for some <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, he then went on to London Bridge and took an omnibus—I went inside, he got off the omnibus at Angel Court and went through the courts into 22, White Street, Davis was close by me in the street—I followed Hawksby up some" steps, through two glass doors and behind another door into a room, I looked through the aperture and saw Mrs. Jackson taking some lead from Hawksby, it was this large piece, she was stooping down apparently putting it on the weighing machine, it appeared to be put down by the side of the machine, Davis came in directly behind me and asked Hawksby where was the lead that he had brought—I referred to the machine, and said "It is down there," Davis stooped down and picked it up—Hawksby said he knew nothing at all about that lead—Mrs. Jackson was then questioned by Davis about the lead that was brought in the morning—there was a cupboard padlocked, Davis asked her what was in that cupboard, she said "Nothing"—after some little time the cupboard was opened, it contained a large quantity of lead wrapped up similar to this—Mrs. Jackson was told she would be charged with receiving this lead well knowing it was stolen—she said "Don't take me"—after some hesita<lb></lb>tion she was allowed to go upstairs to fetch her bonnet—I followed her up stairs—she there said "For God's sake don't take me, for the sake of my children"—I said, "You should have thought of that before"—she said "I did not know I was doing any thing wrong, I thought it was only a bit of cutting"—I said "You might be sure it was wrong for men to bring such things in their trousers"—she said nothing to that—we then took her and Hawksby to the station—I saw these belts, found one on each of the prisoners.</p>

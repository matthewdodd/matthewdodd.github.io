               <p>On Saturday, the 26th of February last, I was with Mr. Young, and coming to his house I saw a parcel of people at his door. When I went in I was told I had been robbed of a watch; my sister said, I have got the watch, she shewed me it immediately; I said, this is Mr. Young's watch which I had to repair: I had repaired the same watch for Mr. Young, about a year ago; the watch was delivered to Mr. Young in my presence, and Mr. Young produced it at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130042"></xptr>Sir Sampson Wright's office. I found the box and case much bruised, and the glass broke. The prisoner was taken to Bow-street that same night.</p>
               <p>Where did you see the man when you came home? - In my sister's shop, in the same place where I work.</p>
               <p>Can you tell me where the watch was before you went? - It was in my drawer, and there was another watch in the same drawer, separated, which I had not repaired.</p>
               <p>What time did you go out? - About a quarter before six.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that when you went out, that watch was in that drawer, and that the watch given you when you came home, was the same left in that drawer? - I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Was any body present in the shop that see this watch delivered to you? - Yes, the two witnesses, the man that took the prisoner, and the man that picked up the watch, were both in the shop at the same time.</p>

In about five minutes after I was at Mrs. Beadle's, Mr. Dove brought the watch in. I am sure that is the man I stopped.</p>

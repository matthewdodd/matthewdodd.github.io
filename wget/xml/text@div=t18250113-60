On the 11th of December I was in the shop, and heard and saw the window broken, and this watch was drawn out by a person outside. I went in pursuit of the party - I did not lose sight of the prisoner - I ran after him, and caught him - I did not see any companion with him; the watch was found in the street on our return, in the direction which he took, he pointed to it himself, and my brother took him to the Office.</p>

I turned my eyes towards Charles-street, and saw the prisoner, pursued by Mr Buttery; he overtook him, and brought him back - I followed them, and heard that a watch had been snatched from a window - I saw the watch laying down, and picked it up - I gave it to Timothy Buttery.</p>

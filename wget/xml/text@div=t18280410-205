On Friday, the 29th of February, I saw the three prisoners coming down Whitechapel in a cart: they went into a mews in Great Garden-street, Whitechapel; Ellis then got out, and the other two drove the cart into the stable; I waited about half an hour, then got Fowler - we went and found Ellis standing at the top of the Mews; we took him down to the stable, where we found the other two sitting on some straw; we handcuffed them all together; I had seen them before that day in the Mews, and knew they kept their cart there.</p>

            . I am carman to Mr. Emery, of Gun-square; I met Ellis in Whitechapel - I knew him by the name of Bullen; he asked, where I was going? I said, I had nothing to do; he asked if I would go with him to sell some old iron, and he would give me some beer - I went with him to McDowell's, and took the iron; there was a round plate and some other iron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ELLIS. Q. What day was it? A. I believe it was Wednesday - it was the latter end of February; your mother went by the name of Bullen - I have been in your loft and saw a pair of shafts there, I think you said, you were going to build a van with them in the summer for yourself; that might be three or four weeks ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was it before you went to the Magistrate? A. About a fortnight; I only judge of the time I went with him by master having nothing to do - it was towards the end of February.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ELLIS. Q. Was not the iron sold on the Wednesday week before I was apprehended? A. I think so; I was examined on the 17th of March, and think it was on the Wednesday week before that.</p>
               <p>MR. BUTTLER. I saw the shafts, they are mine, and so is the sweep-plate, and some pieces of the cart I can swear to; I know the shafts by some plates and some hooks on them - I had had the van about two years; I bought it - it has been mended once, and I also had done something to it myself; I had put some plates on the shaft, and there are several parts of my mending which I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ELLIS. Q. Did you ever take the sweepplate off? A. No, but I have looked at it many times.</p>
               <p>ELLIS'S Defence. He is a false swearing man, it is not his iron; I dealt in iron, and sold some there before - I was first examined on the 29th of February, and then Worgan said it was the Wednesday week before.(See Fifth Day.)</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do with the duplicates? - I went to two different pawnbrokers, one was in Princes-street; I found an handkerchief, in Princes-street, and I found a pocket handkerchief at the other pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lodged in this house? - About five months.</p>

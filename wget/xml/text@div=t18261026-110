               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was your view of the persons intercepted by bushes? A. No; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260072"></xptr>were bushes by the side of the path, but I could see distinctly who they were; they were twenty steps from me - I do not think it had struck five o'clock; it was quite clear daylight - I was rather behind them; I looked most steadfastly at Hutchings, who was nearest to me - the other was about eighteen inches before him - I went by the side of them for about two hundred yards - they did not run till I gave an alarm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HUTCHINGS. Q. How could you see what it was in the handkerchief? A. I saw it was something, and it proved to be the lamp.</p>

            . I am a carman, and live at Chelsea. On the 4th of October, I was in the Fulham-road, about five o'clock - I saw the two prisoners going at a kind of jog-trot pace; I did not see any persons after them; Plummer had a lamp in his hand, but not wrapped up; when I got a little further, they passed me, and I stood and looked at them - I saw Plummer throw it down: I picked it up; they then ran on - I did not see them taken, but I saw them in custody in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - I took the lamp to the watch-house; I am certain the prisoners are the persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the lamp was quite open? A. Yes, at first, but there was a handkerchief over it afterwards; they were five or six yards from me, on the other side of the road - I saw them about ten minutes in all; I did not know either of them; when I followed them, they were about twenty-one yards from me; they had got a good distance when they were taken; I did not see them stopped.</p>

               <p>PLUMMER'S Defence. I had been to Chelsea for clean linen, and I heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw a young man before me who dropped something; I went in pursuit of him, but he ran through the barracks and got away; a gentleman on horseback stopped me and this young man, and said, we had done something.</p>

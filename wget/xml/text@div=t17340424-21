            . Friday Morning was 5 Weeks, about 9 o' Clock, I met Mrs Pain, who said she was going to see the Prisoner at Stoke-Newington. An Hour afterwards, I saw Mrs Pain again, and she said the Prisoner was very bad; so I went to see the Prisoner. She was sitting up in her Bed, and I asked her how she did? She said, very bad at her Head and Stomach. When I came down, I asked Mrs Pain if she had seen nothing? For the Kitchen was in Disorder, and had been wash'd and sanded, and there was a Bloody-apron. She said she had seen something, and that the Prisoner had thrown something down the Vault. I stept over the Way, (for I live opposite to where the Prisoner lives) and told my Mistress. She bid me light a Candle, and look in the Vault. I did, and saw a Child there; but I was so frighted, that I could not take much notice. I sent for help to take it out, and then I saw only a little Blood on the Head of it. It was a Female, and seem'd to be new born.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe the Navel, or any thing about it, belonging to a new born Child?</p>
               <p>E. H. No. It was filthy with the Soil of the Privy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was it a Stone Kitchen?</p>
               <p>E. H. No. A boarded Floor?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I alone, or was any of the Family in the House?</p>
               <p>E. H. I don't know - I saw none but you when I first came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was the Child cover'd in the Vault?</p>
               <p>E. H. No. It lay clear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How deep was the Vault?</p>
               <p>E. H. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was it a slight Bruise on the side of the Head, or a large one?</p>
               <p>E. H. I did not search - A Midwife was sent for after the Child was found; but she did not come till next Day.</p>

            . The Prisoner sent for me by a Neighbour's Girl between 9 and 10 in the Morning. She let me into the Kitchen her self. I ask'd what ail'd her? She said, she was not very well, nor had not been well since Whitsuntide : That she had been very bad that Morning, and had been at the Vault; but was now something better, and could eat a little Water gruel. I made her some, and then she went to Bed, and bid me lock the outer Door, and take the Key. There was Nobody else in the House - The Kitchen was a little out of Order; I saw it had been mopp'd up, but I saw no foul Clothes. We did not let her know that the Child was found, till her Master and Mistress came down, and that was between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon. And then I asked her how she came to do so? And she said, the Devil prompted her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What did you understand I meant by saying so? - That I carried it to the Place, or that I murder'd it?</p>
               <p>M. P. I don't know what you meant.</p>

            , Midwife. On Saturday <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173404240013"></xptr> the 16th of March, I was sent for by the Prisoner, to free her of the After-birth, and I made her a free Woman and left her safe. I was sent for on the Friday, but could not go, - I saw the Child, it was as fine a Female as ever I set my Eyes on, and I don't question but it was full grown; for I believe it was 3 quarters (of a Yard long) and I believe it was born alive, for I can't think so large a dead Child could make it's own way. There was a great Bruise on this side of the Head?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Might not that come by a Fall at it's Birth?</p>
               <p>M. F. I can't say that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you take some Child-Bed-Linnen out of my Trunk.</p>
               <p>M. F. Yes; a Shirt, a Blanket, and a Night-Cap, a Biggin, and a long Stay; but these I did not see till Monday, and it's much to be fear'd, that you did not put them there; for indeed I was inform'd they were borrow'd of a Neighbour.</p>
               <p>Court. That's no Evidence - You must not swear what you heard, but only what you know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coulson, Surgeon. I found a large Contusion on the side of the Child's-head, which I believe was the Cause of it's Death. The Bruise might happen by the Child's falling from her, for a Child falls with a prodigious force.</p>

            . I built the Vault not long ago, and was sent for, to take the Child out; but it was taken out by Mr. Jordan. The Vault is but 6 Foot deep, and the Depth of the Soil was not above 3 Inches, or 3 and a half. The Breadth of the Seat is 22 Inches; there is no Cross-bars within. The Back of it lies open, and the Bottom is not paved, but is a soft Sand.</p>

            . The Child lay upon its back, and did not seem to be daub'd at all. I got a Ladder, and went down 4 or 5 Rounds, and try'd to take it with a Rake; but when I had raised it 2 or 3 foot, it fell down again, and that daub'd it pretty much. There was a Bruise and some Blood about it's Head, but the Skin was not broke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was taken very bad in Bed, between 5 and 6 in the Morning. I came down Stairs, and call'd for help as well as I could, but there was Nobody else in the House. The next Door was an Ale-house, and a Noise being there, I believe they could not hear me. And being violent ill, and in great Extremity of Pain, I was deliver'd in the Kitchen. I never saw the Child move, nor never laid Hands on it; but it got that Bruise on the Head by falling from me, and then in a fright I took it up and carried it to the Vault.</p>

I am a guard in the service of the South Western Railway Company—I was the front guard on the evening of 1st January in charge of the goods train which left Nine Elms at 6.25—the train consisted partly of trucks that were to go to Portsmouth, and partly to go to South<lb></lb>ampton—there were forty-two trucks—it was rather a heavy train—the proper time for arriving at Woking was 8 o'clock—it arrived there that night at 8.10—I should not suppose the train would go more than eight or from that to twelve miles an hour between Woking and Brookwood, as it is a very steep gradient; 1 in 326, from Woking up to Brookwood, or not so much as that—having to stop at Brookwood to put in milk, the train would not be able to go away from there more than at the rate of three or four miles for 200 or 300 yards, and then the speed would accelerate a little—between Frimley and Farnborough the pace begins to increase, because after you pass the Five Arch over Bridge, which crosses the line just before getting to Frimley, there is a decline then towards Farnborough—I saw the trucks, including the one in which the bacon was, before the train left Nine Elms—they were all properly covered up—it had the appearance of everything being in perfect order—when we got to Woking I passed part of the way down the train until T met my mate, who goes in the hind van—he looks at the hind part, and then we change over, and go up the 6-foot ride to see that everything is correct—all was correct at Woking, to the best of my belief—the truck where the bacon was, was eleven or twelve trucks from the front van—that would be in the front part of the train—I think there were about eleven Southampton waggons, and then came two or three Portsmouth ones—we arrived at Brookwood at 8.30, and left at 8.33, after taking in six or seven cans of milk, which we had to put out again at Farnborough—we arrived at Farnborough at 8.52, and remained there five minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I live near Frimley—in January, 1870, in consequence of what I heard some children had found, I went to a ditch, near the rail<lb></lb>way, and found two flitches of bacon in one ditch, and two in another, about 150 yards from the railway—I found some more in a ditch, about 300 yards from the other, about five minutes' walk from a cottage, where the two prisoners lived, with their mother—I afterwards pointed out the spot where I had found the bacon, to one of the superintendents of police—I took the bacon to a public-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a milkman, and am brother-in-law to the pri<lb></lb>soners—in January last year we lived at old Mrs. Bedford's cottage—I live at the opposite end, under the same roof, but not the same house like—I re<lb></lb>member seeing some bacon at the house one Sunday morning—on the Satur<lb></lb>day night before that, I was at the Rose and Thistle, public-house, about 10 o'clock, and saw the prisoners there—Warren Barnard, their nephew, came in while George was there—I stayed till the house was shut up—Barnard was not there while both the prisoners were there, only George—they went away about 10.45—John did not come there that night while I was there—I am quite sure about that—I have never said that John was in the tap-room—I stayed till the house was shut, and then went home, and went to bed—I got up at 4 o'clock next morning, and went milking—I did not see either of the prisoners that morning—I came back about 9 o'clock—they were then at home, having their breakfast—I saw some bacon in a barrel; there were about eleven flitches, I believe—the prisoners were not doing anything with it then—before I left, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon; to go milking again, I saw them putting some into a sack; one was holding the sack, and the other putting the bacon in—I don't know what became of it—I saw Barnard that Sunday morning before I went out at 4 o'clock—he was in the prisoner's room—he was not there when I came back, and I have not seen him since—the bacon was not there when I came back from milk<lb></lb>ing—I spoke to the prisoners about it, and they said they had put it away.</p>

I am Superintendent of Police at Frimley—on 11th January, 1870, I went to the Rose and Thistle, at Frimley Green—I saw the lad Heath there, who gave into my custody four fides of bacon; it was wet and muddy, as though got out of a ditch—when the dirt was removed I saw that it was branded "Shaw &amp; Son"—Superintendent Potter afterwards came and claimed it—on 14th March last George Bedford was given into my custody by Potter and Newland—he asked me what I believed would be done to him; would he get three or four years—I told him I did not know what he had done—as we went along to the station he said drink was the cause of it; he had got a glass or two, and Warren Barnard had come to the public-house and taken him away to the railway bank, and took away the bacon to Bedford's house, and when he saw what he had done the following day, he took it down and buried it in</p>

                  </hi>. I am Superintendent of the London and South-Western Railway Police, at Waterloo Station—I received informa<lb></lb>tion of the missing bacon on the 3rd January, 1870; I went to Farnborough Station, and from there to the house where the last witness lived, and there found four sides of bacon, in a dirty, wet state; it had, no doubt, been lying in the water some days—I examined each side, and found they were all branded "Shaw &amp; Son"—I met the witness Heath in the meadows near the railway, and examined the place between the spot where the bacon was found and the prisoner's house—I first examined the line, and I found two places on the gravel where something heavy had fallen; one on the bridge spoken of, and the other from 30 to 50 yards off—I then traced heavy footmarks from the bridge, across a meadow, to the prisoners' house, and also from their house backwards and forwards—I did not know, at that time, that the prisoners lived there—in consequence of what I learnt, I went and saw George Bedford, who was then in the Company's employ, working in a gang of four or five—I asked him whether he had heard any<lb></lb>thing of the bacon robbery—he said no, he had heard about bacon being found in the ditch—I asked whether he knew anything about it—he said "No "—I then asked whether he had any relation, or knew anyone employed at Woking or Nine Elms—he said "No"—I pressed him upon that point several times, as to whether he had any relation there—Warren Barnard was at that time employed by the Company, at Nine Elms, and was on duty there on Saturday night, 1st January, till 6 o'clock—in March, 1871, in consequence of information received from a prisoner in Horsemonger Lane Prison, I met Superintendent Newland at Farnborough, and went with him to Frimley, and found George at work on the line—I said "Bedford, do you remember my speaking to you last year about the bacon robbery?"—he said "Yes"—I said "And you informed me then that you had no relation at Nine Elms?"—he said "Oh, yes"—I said "I want you to go to your grandmother's with me"—I understood it was his grandmother, we went there, and as soon as the door was opened, his sister and mother were there, and he said to them "Do you say that I stole the bacon?"—his mother said "No, I did not say so; I told you when you brought it here that it should not stop here, and that is all I know about it"—I then asked the sister to point out to me, in the presence of the prisoner and his mother, where she had seen the bacon—this was in consequence of what she had previously told me—she took me to a small hovel, just outside the back door, and said "There "—I asked her how many sides of bacon she saw—she said, at first, she could not say, but afterwards, she should think about ten—I asked her</p>

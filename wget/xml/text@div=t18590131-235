                  </hi>. I was formerly an inspector of police—On the 21st January I went to the prisoner's house, No. 13, Denzell-street, Clare Market, with Mr. Bryant and other officers, about 8 o'clock in the evening—on entering I saw the prisoner in his shop, in his shirt sleeves, with his arms folded—it is a tobacconist's shop, and he sells a little stationery—when I went in, he unfolded his arms and placed his left hand on the counter—I lost sight of his right hand—I believe he put it under the counter—he stooped—I put my hand against his breast, and pushed him back against the back part of the shop—he put his right hand behind him, and placed his hand on this sword that was on the wall—he did not succeed in getting it down—I called to Mr. Bryant, saying if he did not seize him he would do some mischief—I got over the counter, and Mr. Bryant pulled him away—at that time this sword fell down between him and I, and he was then pulled from that part of the counter—I put my hand into a drawer-hole in the counter, and at the end of that there is a small hole which is sufficient to admit a person's hand, and in that hole, which is behind the drawer-hole, I found this bag, which contains five crowns, each wrapped up in separate papers; twelve half-crowns in one paper, and two florins in one piece of paper, and on the ledge of the drawer I found two florins, loose—Mr. Bryant and Serjeant Brannan took the prisoner into the back parlour—I said to the prisoner, "<hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> I have come to pay you another visit"—he said, "Yes, I wish you <hi rend="italic">was</hi> dead, you old b—r"—I said, "I have been instructed to pay you a visit for dealing in counterfeit coin"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "This is strong symptoms of it"—he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector.</hi>) I went on 21st January with Mr. Brannan to the prisoner's house—he was standing with his arms folded—as I entered I saw him put his left hand on the counter, and his right hand underneath—I was getting over the counter, and Mr. Brannan pushed him back, and called to me, "For God's sake make haste, he will do some mis<lb></lb>chief "—I saw him put his hand behind him, and he was trying to unhook this sword from a nail—I got over and seized him—he resisted violently—with the assistance of Sergeant Brannan I took him in the parlour—I found in his right-hand pocket a counterfeit florin, a halfpenny, and a key—I said to him, "You have got counterfeit coin in your pocket"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I left him in custody of other officers, and I returned to the shop, and found a packet containing twenty florins on the floor of the shop near the parlour door—that was the way in which we had taken him into the parlour—they were not wrapped separate, but were in one packet—I showed them to the prisoner, and he said, "I know nothing about them; you will find nothing in my place except what you put there"—the florin I found in his pocket, and the twenty which I picked up appear to me to be from the same mould.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

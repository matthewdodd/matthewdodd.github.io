On the 12th of January I had six pigs in a stye in my yard - I fastened them up with a cord at six o'clock in the evening, and about eight o'clock, I missed two, and the door was open - I made enquiries, and found one of them in the street that night - I found the other at Mr. Strickland's, at Chelsea, on the 20th of January - his house is more than a mile from mine.</p>

            . I am serjeant of the night, at Mary-le-bone. The prisoner is my son-in-law. On the 13th of January I came off duty about half-past eight, or a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, and found he had brought home the pig the night before - I asked where he got it - he said he bought it with the wages that his master owed him, and he had still 1s. or 2s. due to him - he had been living with Mr. King for seven or eight months - the pig remained there or was running about the street, and on the 20th, the prosecutor and the officers came and took it away.</p>

            . The prosecutor applied to me, and I went to Strickland's, where I found the pig in the privy - I asked the prosecutor if he could swear to it; he said he could by the marks, and the ring in the nose. - I took it away and have had it ever since.</p>

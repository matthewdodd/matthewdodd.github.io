                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the service of Henry White and Co., merchants, 17, Mincing<lb></lb>lane—on 21st February I got from my em<lb></lb>players these two warrants (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I recognised them by my writing—I took them to the wine and spirit department of the general office of the London and St. Katharine's-dooke—I left them with one of the clerks sit<lb></lb>ting one from the door, for the purpose of having fresh warrants made for part, and of getting delivery of twenty-one puncheons on one warrant—I cannot say who that clerk was—the name of Stevenson was not there when I left them—they were endorsed by the firm of Henry White and Co.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you get a receipt for them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not cus<lb></lb>tomary to do so—there was an endorsement on the back "Deliver twenty-one puncheons to our sub-order; warrant for remainder in our favour &amp;c." when I left them—there are probably sixty clerks at the office where I left them—I know these are the warrants—I cannot say what other means of identification I have then the endorsement—such warrants came into our office pretty frequently—I remember these warrants so particularly, because I remember endorsing them myself, getting them signed, and taking them down to the docks—I have endorsed the warrants—the endorsement is not all I have to go by—I know them by having endorsed them myself, taking them down to the docks myself and lodging them myself—I did not take a note of the numbers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ledger clerk in the service of the London and St. Katharine's-dock Company—on 21st February, the prisoner was in the employment of the Dock Company, but was, I believe suspended; that is he was not discharged, but was not allowed to come to duty; nevertheless I saw him in the general office on that day—he came into the division of the general office where I was engaged—I saw him looking over papers—they were documents lodged by the public, warrants lodged for delivery in the wine and spirit department—I did not see at what time he left the docks on that day—I saw him there about the middle of the day—I do not know how long he remained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What makes you remember this 21st February? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have many reasons for remembering it—I believe the prisoner was suspended on that day for absence—I don't know at what time he was sus<lb></lb>pended—I saw him there in the middle of the day—the wine and spirit department is a part of the general office—there are fifty or sixty clerks employed in the whole room, particular corners are called different premises—these clerks come and go wherever the course of business calls them—I am aware the prisoner had a drawer given him in the wine and spirit de<lb></lb>partment—I said that I saw him looking over documents lodged by the public—I was about six yards off—the desk was straight, and I, therefore, had a better opportunity of seeing then if it had been convex—I don't think he back after 21st February.</p>

I carry on business in Great Winchester-street, City—on 21st February the prisoner celled at my office—he pro<lb></lb>duced these two warrants and said ha wanted an advance upon them—my clerk brought in his name as Henry White—I said I couldn't make him an advance that evening, but that if he would leave the warrants, with me I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say he told you his name was Henry White? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His name was handed in to me by my clerk as Henry White—he made several statements which made me make inquiries about him—I understood him to say that he was negotiating the warrants for a friend of his, his partner, in the country—I had previously inquired as to the price of the rum—I said the cheque must be payable. to order, and must be endorsed—upon that he did not say, "I am not Henry White and Co., and cannot endorse it"—I swear that—T would not have allowed him to endorse it in my presence if I had believed him not to be Henry White.</p>

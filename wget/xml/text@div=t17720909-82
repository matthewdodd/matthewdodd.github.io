            . The prisoner came to me on the 2d of August, I live some considerable way from where the ship lies; he delivered to me twenty-four guineas, and seven pieces of foreign silver, a watch, a breast-buckle and a ring, and desired me to lay them up till he called for them. I knew him to be a young man that behaved well, therefore did not suspect that they were not his own. I was absent on Sunday at a place of worship; the chest was broke open by some people that came from Justice Sherwood's, and every thing was taken out.</p>

             M'Nabb, one of Justice Sherwood's men, deposed that when the prisoner was taken up, he took them to the place; that they waited two hours, and Coombe not coming home, he broke the chest open, and took out the things, and put the money in his pocket without examining it; that he took the prisoner immediately to a public-house; that then he looked at the money and found there was but twenty guineas, and seven pieces of silver; that then the prosecutor had received ten guineas, and he produced the other ten in court, and the buckles and seven pieces of silver, (which were deposed to by the prosecutor.) +</p>
               <p>+ The court ordered M'Nabb to pay the prosecutor four guineas, which were so strangely melted.</p>
               <p>- Farrel confirmed this evidence.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his defence said, that he took the things away in order to secure them for the prosecutor, as the chest was unlocked, and there were some common women on board the ship.</p>
               <p>He called the captain and mate of the ship, who gave him a good character.</p>

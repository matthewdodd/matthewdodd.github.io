               <p>Q. You cannot swear to the identical coin? - A. No; we found two half-crown papers in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This indictment charges the man with stealing your money in your dwelling-house, in the parish of Stepney; is it not in the parish of St. Lawrence, Stepney? - A. It is in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney.</p>
               <p>Q.Of these halfpence, a great many were bad? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say there were forty shillings-worth of Tower halfpence? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Twenty shillings-worth? - A. That is hard to say, Tower halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q.And you will not swear, I dare say, that the mere weight of the other halfpence would have sold for twenty shillings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his wife never come to the house? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Might you not have changed these bundles of halfpence? - A. I do not think I have changed any more than four bundles for these two months past.</p>

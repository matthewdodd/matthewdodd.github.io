On Sunday the 16th of January, I went to my agents, and my agent gave me only a shirt, a pair of trowsers, and a pair of stockings, and as I was going along Leadenhall-street with the clothes in my hand. I saw the prisoner; he is a Jew; he asked me if I would sell them; we agreed for the price; he said he would give me nine shillings for them. He asked me if I could change a one-pound note. I said, no. He took me up a court in Leadenhall-street, as if to get the money. He returned, and gave me three three-shilling pieces. I put them into my pocket. In about half an hour after I went to Mr. Williams's public-house in Maid-lane in the Borough; I called for a pint of beer; Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160039"></xptr>Williams said all the three three-shilling tokens were bad.

I found the prisoner again. The prisoner had a basket selling oranges when he was taken in custody. It was the same basket I had seen him with before. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I keep the Dyer's Arms public-house, Maid-lane, in the Borough. On Sunday the 16th of January, in the afternoon, the last witness came to my house; he called for a pint of porter; he gave me a three-shilling bit. I looked at it. I said, it is a bad one; he offered me a second, that was as bad as the first, and then the third, that was bad also. These are two of the three that he offered me; I marked them to know them again; the third three-shilling piece a young man cut it in two with a hatchet. He said he had them of a Jew selling oranges in Leadenhall-street.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday the 16th of January, I was sent for to apprehend Scarlett. I searched him; he had no money whatever. He told me he took the three three-shilling tokens of a Jew near the India house selling oranges; he said he should know the Jew was he to see him. I and Scarlett went to Leadenhall-street, and at the place he described we did not find him. We went nearer Aldgate. I told him when he saw the man to give me a signal; he gave me a signal, and I took the prisoner into custody. We took the prisoner into the Mitre public-house, Aldgate. The basket the prisoner then had answered the description Scarlett had before given me; it was an oval basket. I searched him and found on him silver that was all good. I then took him towards the Compter; in Leadenhall-street he struggled, and tried to get away from me.</p>
               <p>MR. HOMERSHAM. These three-shilling tokens are counterfeit and bad; they all came from the same die; they do not appear to have been in circulation. They are made to resemble the genuine three-shilling bank tokens.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus addressed the jury in behalf of the prisoner.</p>

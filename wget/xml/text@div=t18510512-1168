                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Fitzgerald. On Sunday, 11th May, I was in Whitechapel-road; I fainted, and stopped at a door—the prisoner came up, and asked me what was the matter—I said I felt very ill and fainting—she asked where I lived, and I told her—she said she would help me along, as she lived in the next street to me—she turned me up the first street we came to; she was going to help me, but I came to myself, and I said T did not want her assistance—she was taking me down her street, and I would not go—she said it was my nearest way home—I said it was not—she looked at me very hard, pulled my shawl off, and my parasol out of my hand, and ran as fast as she could—I was better then, and ran after her, calling "Stop thief!"—she saw a policeman coming, and threw the shawl away—a young woman picked it up—I saw her stopped—I missed 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my pocket.</p>

I heard a cry, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner running, followed by Fitzgerald, I caught her—she said, "Oh! for Christ's sake, I have not got the shawl," before anybody had said a word about it—I received a shawl from a female, who said, in the prisoner's presence, she had picked it up close by—the prisoner did not say anything.</p>

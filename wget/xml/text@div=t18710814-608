                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Grainger, at 108, Fen-church Street, and he has wine cellars at 25, St. Mary Axe—I have examined about forty dozen of wine, which was found in a stable, in Tillotson Street—I identify them as the property of Mr. Grainger—it is of different sorts—it was bottled at different times—it did not leave the cellars by the authority of Mr. Grainger, or myself—Hale has been in the employment of Mr. Grainger as under cellarman and porter—he would have opportunities for taking the wine away—I examined some claret shown to me by a Mr. Humphries about a week or ten days ago—it was part of the stock stolen from Mr. Grainger's premises—I did not give any authority for that wine to leave the premises—I have the entire management of the cellars—I never sold any wine to Mr. Humphries, of the Queen's Head, Whitechapel Road—I have never had dealings with Boulton.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer K</hi>). I went to No. 5, Tillotson Street, on 21st July, with Smith—I was let in by Boulton—I told him that we were officers of police, and had come there respecting some wine which had come in that morning—he said he did not know anything about it—a woman came in, and said "Have they come about the wine that came in this morning?"—Boulton directly took us to a stable on the left-hand side of the yard, opposite the back door of his house—he said "This is where the wine is; I let this stable to a man about six weeks ago"—he did not know his name then, nor where the man lived—he said the premises belonged to him; he rented them, but he had let the stable to someone else—we broke the hasp from the padlock, and went into the stable—we found about 560 bottles of wine packed round the stable, as though they were in a wine cellar—they were afterwards identified by Mr. Grainger as being his property—I told Boulton I should take him for receiving the wine—he said he was innocent—I believe he is an earthenware dealer—I saw a horse in one of the sheds, and a van in the yard—he told me after<lb></lb>wards that the man he had let the stables to was named Hill, and he lived in the Commercial Road—I have made inquiries, and there was a man named Hill living at Nelson Street Commercial Road—I have not been able to find him—Boulton said he received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for the rent of the stable, and he had let it about six weeks.</p>

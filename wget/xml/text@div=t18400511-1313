About half-past seven o'clock, on the evening of the 23rd of April, I was between Cowley and Dray<lb></lb>ton, near the railway bridge, and met the prisoner carrying this bag on his back—it appeared rather bulky and heavy—I said, "What have you in the bag"—he said "Nothing but a few rags and bones"—I said, "You have something more than rags and bones here"—he said, "There are tome bits of old leather, for which I gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "To whom?" he said he did not know that he was a general dealer, and it was not his business to ask persons questions from whom he bought goods—I took him into custody, and found he had these articles.</p>

On Lord Mayor's day the prisoner sent me out on a message that he might have an opportunity of stealing my things; he sent me to the Prince Alfred public house, and told me that he had left threepence there for me to get a pint of beer, as he knew I was short of money. When I came there I asked the landlord if such a person had left threepence for me? he said he had not, and when his wife got up I asked her and she said he had not. When I went back to my room I found the things in the indictment, missing from the place where I live and work, it is in a garret, the prisoner slept and worked in the same place; after that I was obliged to open a subscription among some acquaintances to buy some more things; I was in great distress at that time, I never was in such distress in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do to find these things? - That happened a fortnight after or very near, on a Sunday evening my witness saw the man very near our house and he charged the man with an officer, knowing him to be the person that took my things, and when he was brought before the justice he was asked where he had pawned the things, he said he did not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I thought you meant the things that were stolen out of the room, I did not think that you meant the kit.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were none pawned at all, the runner Blackiter found them in his possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I first came he worked for Mr. Hardy, and he spent all the money and pawned his coat, and had not a farthing of money left to support himself, and he owes me money to this day.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This man lent me a few halfpence.</p>

               <p>I was sent for the eighth of November, after he was taken into custody and they asked me if I knew this Mr. Ward? I said yes. He worked for me a fortnight and one day after he took these peoples tools; he had among them tools which he worked with in my house, this same poor man's tools.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the prisoner brought the tools to your house? - He worked for me the 8th of November till the 25th, which happened on a Saturday night; he had no tools when he came first, I lent him some to work with, but afterwards he had these tools and worked with some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he begin to work with the tools? - I cannot say. When I went up to justice Colquohon's they asked me where he lodged, and I told them, and we went and searched the bedchamber to see if any tools were there, and there were none, and we went to look where we put our own tools of a Saturday night, and these tools were found there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my tools, every one knows his tools.</p>

               <p>Mr. Ward came to work with me; I carry on business with my father; the prosecutor is my uncle. On the 10th of November I was informed the things were missing, the man left my house and lodgings; on the 23d, I gave him in charge of the officer on suspicion of stealing the things, he denied them positively, he said he had not stole them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You swore that I stole the sheets out of the room.</p>
               <p>Court to Witness. Is what he says true? - I know nothing at all about it. When he came before the justice he owned he had pawned the things; I went to the office again and there I saw the tools, and I knew they were my uncle's tools. The hammer and pincers have been in our house these ten years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This man is a jacobin.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you got any thing to ask him respecting this robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I gave the prosecutor the handkerchief to make up the matter.</p>
               <p>Witness. He had a silk handkerchief which he desired me to take care of before we went before the justice; I told him I would take nothing in charge before I went before the justice. Mr. Blackiter has got it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor owed me one shilling and tenpence; his brother would not pay me nor his nephew, and they would not trust them over the way for a red herring. I worked with this man and he owed me the money, and he told me he should not stop long for he could earn but very little money, and he had a good mind to go to the parish, and he let me have the tools to work with because I was so good as to lend him money when his brother would not.</p>

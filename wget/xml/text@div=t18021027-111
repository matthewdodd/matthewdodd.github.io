             sworn. - I am a hair-dresser, in White-hart-yard, Drury-lane, and have known the prisoner about a year and an half; he told me he was rider to Mr. Morley, to whom I have delivered up some brushes, horn combs, and cases, which I purchased of the prisoner at different times; the last I bought was about nine weeks ago, and he said he had commission to sell from his master; on the Friday before he was taken up, he told me his master and he had had some words concerning some sponge, and begged I would say nothing about dealing with him, as he was going to settle in the neighbourhood; I said I would not; next day I saw Mr. Morley, and told him what I had bought of him; he said there were none of his goods, and he walked away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The prisoner staid in his lodgings till he was taken up? - A. Yes, he was taken in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you never had these things from the prisoner? - A. Never; I told his master first, I never dealt with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Justice you had not those things from the prisoners? - A. Never; I was much alarmed, and when I had paid the value of them it was natural to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. You expected to be taken up? - A. No, I was alarmed at the scandal, although I thought he came honestly by them.</p>

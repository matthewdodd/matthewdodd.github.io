            . I keep a plated warehouse. I know the two men at the bar; I have known them about two months. They were at my house on the 7th of May last, they came about four o'clock; Macdonald came in first; then he had a bundle with him; he asked for weights and scales. I did not produce them. My wife went out at the back door, according to the directions I had given on the previous day. I had dealt with the two prisoners before. I considered them to be both interested on that occasion; they were both present. During the absence of my wife, Carey came in; he placed himself in a chair; he did not say any thing to Macdonald, nor Macdonald to him. My wife returned with some persons, the two Mr. Turner's. She then went out a second time, and brought in a man named Jeffkins; when she returned then, Macdonald and Carey were in my parlour. When the Turner's came, I informed them that I had purchased plate of the prisoners on the 16th of March, and I had reason to believe it was stolen; I said that in the presence of the prisoners. One of them said, he could give a very good account of how he came by it; but if it was stolen, he would recompence me to give him his liberty; it was Carey said this. There was nothing more passed then. The officer was sent for, who, when he came, searched them; it might be a quarter of an hour before Limbrick came. When my wife was returning with Jeffkins, Macdonald slipped out at the door, and Jeffkins laid hold of him, and brought him in. Carey attempted to run out before the officer came in. Young Turner came in I think first. The bundle of plate was secured.</p>

Macdonald came to my house on the 7th of May last; he brought a bundle; it was about four o'clock in the afternoon; he walked right through the shop into the parlour, and asked for Mr. Parker; presently my husband came in, and as he came in, I went out, I went out to bring in Mr. Turner; I had received directions from my husband to do that if either of the prisoners came. I did not hear a word pass between my husband and Macdonald. He did not ask me for any thing before my husband came in. I returned with some of my neighbours in a few minutes; the youngest of the Turners came immediately, and the father followed. When I returned, I was informed Carey was there. When I came back, I did not see either of them until I saw them brought through the shop to be taken to Hatton Garden; Limbrick took them through. I locked up a bundle in the presence of a neighbour of mine;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290042"></xptr>she kept the key until that bundle was delivered to the officers.

My husband bought something of them; as soon as my husband bought that, they went away together, and they had come together.</p>

I first saw him at eight o'clock, at breakfast; I left there about half past ten; I came back at a quarter before eleven; he was then cleaning shoes and brushing coats. I saw him at dinner and saw him until dinner, a little before one. He was in the shop serving clothes with his wife. He went out at about twenty minutes past two; a person came in with a parcel; I was present. He asked my uncle if he would carry a parcel, and my uncle said he would, and he put on his hat, and went out immediately with the person who came in; that was twenty minutes past two.</p>

On my last birth-day, I was at the prisoner's shop, about two o'clock; I saw the prisoner there; but not at first. I dealt for an article; not agreeing about the price with the first person I spoke to, the prisoner came out, and concluded the article for nine shillings and sixpence, and I gave him six shillings, as I had not so much silver. On the Thursday, I called again, and paid the ballance for the pantaloons, and took them. Mrs. Carey then called me in, and told me something which had happened, and that brought to my mind the exact time I had been there. While I had been there, I recollected a man coming into the shop, who said, Carey, I want you to go on an errand for me, to take a parcel where you have been before; Carey said, he would go with him immediately, and in about three or four minutes went with him. On the next day but one, I heard he was taken up.</p>

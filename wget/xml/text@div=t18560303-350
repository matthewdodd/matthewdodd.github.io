I am ostler at the Bell and Three Mackerel, in Mile End-road—that is about a mile from Cannon-street-road—a man came there with a gray horse—I could not swear to the man nor the horse, but I was called to put the horse in the stable—I scarce saw the man—I came out, and he immediately went up stairs—I agreed to find him in stabling—he wanted to know what time he could have the horse next morning—I said, "About six"—he said, "That will do"—I said he must go to the bar to inquire for lodgings—he went, and they could not lodge him, and he got on the horse and went away—he went into the door of the Fountain, which is nearly opposite, and that was all I saw of him.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you seen them since? - A. Yes; I saw them taken out of a ditch, between eleven and twelve o'clock the same day; I did not know any thing of the prisoner, I saw him when he was taken in a lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say he would shew you where he put the things, or where the things where? - A.He said he put them there.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive of that? - A. Yes; they asked him where the hamper and two bundles of things were, and he said he had none; he got over the hedge, and then they took him, and he confessed where he put the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they charge him with having put the things any where? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he said he had put the things there? - A. Yes.</p>

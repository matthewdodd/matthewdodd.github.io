On Saturday, the last day of July, I saw the prisoner, Shevill, there; he appeared to be buying cloth; he sat down by a sample of wool, which my brother had brought there; he asked me if I would sell the lot of wool; I told him I should be glad to sell it; he put some in his pocket, but no agreement was entered into at that time; he said, he should pay with ready money, or bills as good as ready money. On the Monday following, I went to Wotton-under-Edge, and saw him there with a Mr. Gardiner; Mr. Antill was with me; he told him I was ready to sell him the wool; we there agreed for the price; it was to be about twenty-pence farthing a pound, the stone is about fifteen pounds and a half; he was to have all the wool that I had at Gloucester at that price; it was in twenty-nine packages, in the possession of one Mr. Lewis, till Friday morning; Shevill told me he was an agent for five houses in London; he told me he was to have an hundred pounds a year from one, and a guinea a week from another, and a guinea a day for every day that he went out; he said he should draw bills upon the house of Felton Hutchinson, Esq. in Suffolk-lane, Cannon-street; he said, when the peace came, he took a coach and four, and went to Deyonshire to buy fish, and that that journey cleared him between two and three thousand pounds for one of his houses; he said, Mr. Hutchinson was a merchant to send goods to America; he said, he was able enough to pay these bills, when they became due, if all the shillings were guineas; I was paid in bills on the 4th of August.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at those bills? - A. I received these bills from Shevill; they were drawn in my presence; they are eight pounds short of the price of the goods, and there was five pounds besides for the packages; my brother received the thirteen pounds in Bank of England bills, that made up the whole amount; he said, he should have the wool worked up into cloth in Chalford-Bottom; Mr. Gardiner was to work it up; the wool was to lie in the warehouse till I was satisfied of the goodness of the bills; I remained there till Friday morning; I gave an order to Mr. Lewis to deliver the goods the same day that I received the bills; Mr. Shevill made application for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Corrick before? - A. Not till latterly. I returned on the Tuesday following, in consequence of a letter I received from Mr. Lewis, and found that the wool was gone; I came up to London on Thursday morning; I went first to the Bell, in Warwick-lane, and found seventeen packages; I went to the Swan, Holborn-bridge, four or five days afterwards, and found twelve packages more; I saw Shevill the very day I came to town; I saw him at the Bell, in Warwick-lane, in the yard, with the prisoner, Corrock; I told the book-keeper not to deliver the wool; there was another man with them, who said, he was a lawyer, and he would have the wool, and offered to pay the carriage; I said, it should not be delivered till the bills were paid; I told Shevill I did not think they were worth any thing; when I came to London, they told me the man they were drawn upon was not sufficient; Shevill asked me if I should like to see the man, and we made an appointment to go to the Swan, at Holborn-bridge, that evening; I went, and saw Corrock, and two or three others, the lawyer was one of them; he said, they wanted fifty pounds, and they would give up the goods; he said, that was for his trouble and expence in the country; I saw Corrock several times afterwards, and had conversation with him; he said, he had come to make up the matter between me and Mr. Shevill; I did not like to speak to him much; he wanted twenty-five pounds for Shevill's expences in the country, and I was to have the wool back, which was worth about five hundred and sixty pounds, but I would not pay it; I did not see Shevill again till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Shevill write the drafts - look at these letters, and say whether you believe them to be his writing? - A. To the best of my belief, they are his writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley, (Counsel for Shevill.)</p>
               <p>Q.Shevill was introduced to you by a friend of your own? - A. Mr. Gardiner and Mr. Antill introduced me to him.</p>
               <p>Q. They had been dealing with you before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no immediate adjustment of the contract? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. You went twenty or thirty miles after him for the purpose of inducing him to buy this wool, which he had resused to buy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At Wotton-under-Edge, he told you he should pay you by bills upon London? - A. Yes, or ready money; the bills were drawn at Gloucester, and I received them on the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. That afforded you an opportunity of sending to London to enquire after the person on whom the bills were drawn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you remember making a further demand for the packages? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did he not then desire to break off the bargain, and say he would not give any more than he had bargained for; and, if you would return him the bills, you should have the goods? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed, (Counsel for Corrock.) Q. You never heard of, or saw the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260043"></xptr>soner, Corrock, till you came to the Swan? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was the lawyer who wanted you to repay him a sum of money? - A. Yes, a man who said he was a lawyer.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEWIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.You are a wharfinger, at Gloucester? - A. Yes. The latter end of July last I received thirtyfour packages of wool, addressed Thomas and Peter Jarman; they were to remain with me till further order: On the 3d of August, Mr. Shevill came to inspect the wool, and had it weighed; Mr. Jarman was with him, myself, and my porter, and Mr. Antill; I afterwards saw Mr. Jarman and Mr. Shevill at my warehouse; Mr. Jarman afterwards shewed me the bills; I expressed a doubt whether they were good or not, and advised him to take one of them to Turner and Co's banking-house, and get it sent up. After Mr. Jarman had left town, Mr. Shevill came to me, and produced me an order for the wool; Mr. Shevill went away; he returned again, and said, he had seen a gentleman to whom he had sold the wool, and he gave orders respecting it; in consequence, he gave me an order to direct it to No. 4, Suffolk-lane, Cannon-street; he wanted me to return the first order.(The orders read:)</p>

               <p>Lewis. On the evening of the 4th of August, Mr. Shevill asked me the best mode of conveyance from Gloucester to London; I told him the cheapest was by water, but he said that would be too tedious; upon turning his eye, he saw a waggon in my yard; I told him it was going to London, and I could forward part of it with that waggon, and the remainde the next day, and he said that would do; I accordingly sent twelve packs that night; they were not directed; I gave the waggoner a way-bill where to deliver them, at No. 4, Suffolk-lane, at the same time giving him a caution that waggon went to the Swan Inn, Holborn-bridge; I wrote a letter the same evening to Mr. Jarman, to inform him of it; the next day I sent seventeen packages by a waggon that goes to the Bell Inn, Warwick-lane; Mr. Jarman came the Tuesday following, and I went with him to the Bank to see if the bill was returned, and we found it there.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that? - A.This is the bill.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the way-bill that arrived with the waggon? - A. Yes; Shevill came before the wool arrived, with two or three other persons, but I am not sure that Corrock was present on that day; Shevill enquired for Mr. Jarman, and saw him; I saw Corrock on the day the wool arrived, and a person who called himself an attorney; Jarman said he would not have the wool delivered till he was satisfied of the value of the bills; Shevill offered to deliver up the wool if he would return him the money back he had paid Mr. Austin, and fifty pounds; I believe Corrock was not present then; Corrock came the Monday after, to know what was to be done about the wool, and Jarman said the same as before; Corrock said he would come with Shevill next day, but did not; Shevill was to have come on several days to settle it, but never came after the first time.</p>

               <p>"Yours of Monday night's mail came duly to hand, and you will please to inform my friend Binford that I have bought to the amount of nearly 5000l. but they cannot possibly be got ready in less than three weeks, none of the manufacturers having any on hand finished; those are agreed to be paid for by bills on Hutchinson, or Gover and Co. Nothing whatever can be done here with C.'s bills, and I assure you it is almost (at some places that Sedley took me to), impossible with Abraham Newlands' to do business; the people at Chalford, &amp;c. have been, they say, completely swindled by a person of the name of Hayes, &amp;c. and how any man could be so foolish to take me to such a place I am lost to know; however, if I have my health, much business may and shall be done, if it is properly conducted at the office, and I supplied for expences, which I am now without. I go this morning for Gloucester, to meet a manufacturer, who has a large parcel of goods, and doubt not but I shall besuccesful; Sedley has not been with me since Saturday morning, believe he is going to Hayes; so Mr. Gardiner informed me.</p>
               <p>"As, of course, enquiries will be made at the office, it ought to be put into a better trim, and my things taken out with all possible speed, and the office properly attended to. I am waiting your reply, and am, with great respect to Mr. B.</p>

               <p>"Yours of the 3d ult. received this morning; I did not shew letter to B. but communicated the contents; he was struck at it, and having built upon stopping the demands on him from the resources you were to send, he will be completely fixed, and is free to confess he must get out of the way; he can get no money to send you this week; has 500l, to pay next, besides near 100l, more to publicans, butchers, bakers, &amp;c. &amp;c. at home, therefore you will act accordingly; Hardham not having had the 25l. I inclose 20l. reserving 5l. for H. as F. has not done the note, and he has not any money; and Mrs. Ching, about the house, expects the fixtures to be paid for immediately, before she gives the house up, which amounts to about 10l. but as this 25l. is applied otherwife, I cannot have the means to comply, and think some of the articles overcharged, therefore waved, without your concurrence, paying the money, but would give her what she wished on account, which she did not chuse; and unless you instruct me further, it will remain until your return. I observe, in your letter to your wife, what you have been doing, but you must say where you will have them deposited, and what done with them; I have just heard that Myers is completely done up: I have not heard or seen any thing about the business of 
               <persName id="t18031026-77-person629">C. </persName>
            since my last, and when I do, shall advise you, but he will be clamorous for money after Monday; B. has only given me 2l. so that I have been obliged to borrow of Mrs. S. as I was much distressed; she begs her best love, and hopes Providence will return you in health, and the sooner you come home the better.</p>
               <p>"I am, yours sincerely,</p>

               <p>"Dear Sir, "Aug. 4, 1803.</p>
               <p>"Yours, bearing date 2d ult. directed to Wotton, with contents, has this instant come safe to hand, and have noted the contents. In reply, I really think (though I will do my best) I shall not be able to make any cash with C.'s paper here: to keep C. sweet, you had better write him (never date any letter or note you send him, and only the initials of your name, and mind, never send per post, only by a porter; and you should not acknowledge before any of his friends that you or any one but H. has any thing to do with his paper,) as his business is in a train, which may be successful, but cannot be accomplished for some days; that to accommodate him he may if he pleases draw on Mr. Huchinson for thirty or forty days for 1000l. or 2000l. or more: should this take place, you know the bills ought not to be accepted, and returned directly, as 
               <persName id="t18031026-77-person630">H. </persName>
            is supposed to be in the country; but if 
               <persName id="t18031026-77-person631">C. </persName>
            draws, and pays them away, they will then come regular to the office: should 
               <persName id="t18031026-77-person632">C. </persName>
            draw, get him to send a letter of advice to the office, what he intends to draw, for this ought to be done without fail; it will shew they do business together; this is all I can at present say on the subject: I hope you see the necessity, and that you will keep Mr. H. as sweet as in your power; he must have a few pounds, if he accepts for C. and should I draw on him, no delay whatever must be attached to any bills that come in for acceptance, but you must see him as soon as possible after, say, after you shut up the office; should it so happen that any bills come in from me for H. s acceptance, and you cannot get them accepted in time, tell the person that calls that they are sent to H. and will be accepted. In respect of my drawing on Pearce, it will be of no use; I could sooner negociate H.'s<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260045"></xptr>bills than, his. H. living in the City, the house founds more respectable man in the country, but it will not be in my power to get cash on either of their bills, I thesefore hope you will beg Binford to sand me a supply without fail, for I am now stuck fast, and have none.</p>
               <p>I am respect to Mr. Binford,</p>

               <p>"You had better ask Binford if he can get Gover and Co. or any other respectable houses, to draw on to buy with. If this can be done, hand them me with all speed. Pray call on Mrs. S. before you write this post."</p>

               <p>"In the transaction of the wool, Sheyill wrote from the country that he purchased some to the amount of 500l. or there abouts, and should send it up; he came to town before it arrived, and after he had come, he asked me if the bills, he had drawn, had been sent to the office, to which I told him, no; he, in the course of a day or two, sent me to the inns to enquire after it, and I brought him word back that the waggon in Warwick-lane was expected in the latter end of the week; I called again by his orders, and I was informed it would be in on Friday, at twelve o'clock; he sent me with the money to pay the carriage, and I went and asked for it, having consigned it by letter from Mr.

            , according to the note I shewed; the person at the office replied, that he had orders not to deliver it to any body, and he should not, until he had heard from the country; I returned to the office, and acquainted Shevill with it, and he replied, what was to be done; I answered, I did not know; he asked me if I knew of any attorney to go to; I replied, no; after some time, he said, he would go to Mr. Hall, in Queen-street, Fowler's attorney; we went, and he stated the business, and shewed him the papers; Mr. Hall said, he would go with him, which he did, and we went to the inn when the owner of the wool was there; Mr. Hall asked what was the reason the wool was not delivered; the owner of the wool, Mr. Jarman, said, because he was not satisfied that the bills were good, and no such person as Mr. Hutchinson was to be found, and it should not go till he was; Shevill then said, if he was not satisfied, he did not desire to have the wool, but was willing to come to terms of accommodation, according to the agreement entered into, but Mr. Jarman would not consent, and Mr. Hall, Shevill, and myself, came away; Shevill consulted with Mr. Hall what was best to be done, and Mr. Hall advised taking opinion of Counsel, which Shevill waved, and here it rested. In the mean time, two of the bills came in, and were accepted by Hutchinsoti, by Shevill's orders I went to enquire after the other wool, and was informed the waggon was expected in a few days; I returned, and acquainted him of it; he then desired Mr. Fowler to go with me, which he did, on the day they said it would arrive; Shevill sent me with the money to pay the carriage, and I went and asked for it, it having been consigned by shevill, according to the note I shewed; the person at the office replied as at the other inn, on which I acquainted Shevill with the result; Shevill, on the next or following day, went to the Swan, to propose a settlement; which was; the money he had advanced to be paid him, the notes given up, and the agreement not being fulfilled, the forfeiture, he said, he had an undoubled right to; Mr. Jarman objected to the whole, adding, who was to pay his expences and loss of time. Nothing decisive was done; they parted to meet again. After Shevill had returned to the office, he drew out an account of what was expected to be paid, which he ordered me to copy, and carry to Mr. Hall, and appoint a time when to go, which was done; and Mr. Hall and myself went with it. On its being stated to Mr. Jarman its contents, he entirely objected to it, and added, that Shevill had charged fifteen pounds money advanced, when only eight pounds were had. It was agreed I should acquaint Shevill of it, and to meet again to endeayour a settlement, which I did two or three times; I called at the inn, and Mr. Jarman was out once, if not more; Mr. Fowler was with me; at last Shevill said, what was to be done? I answered, why settle with the man, and give up the wool on his payment of the money you advanced, but he says it is only eight pounds; have the bills back, the rest come to any terms fair and reasonable. He replied, no, I'll never do that, you must get the agreement stamped, and I will agree to take half the penalty. I answered, you may depend he will never do that; he then said, call and tell Jarman I will meet him on Saturday morning; one o'clock, which I did, and left word with the master of the inn, but I had previously made the appointment; when I returned, he said, now what am I to do? Do as I advised before. No, that I never will, he added. I tell you what you shall do; you shall make oath before a Magistrate that you bought the wool of me, and after that is done, I will provide you with vouchers and documents that shall secure it to you so certainly, that nothing shall get it out of your hands; after which, you shall attach it, and then they may do their worst; I would have paid two or three of their bills, but when you have done that, I won't pay one. (When he had done,) I answered, not for the world. He replied, what then am I to do, lose the wool, the profit of it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260046"></xptr>the money I have advanced, and the fifty pounds forseited. I replied, that is nothing to me, come to terms of accommodation, and settle it somehow, that is the best way; consider at what expence Jarman is while here, for you will never get him to comply to any terms of paying any money; on the contrary, he claims a right to some amends being made to him for all the loss he has sustained. After this conversation had ended, and he continued in the office slent, he went out, and returning shortly, he desired I would go up either in the evening or next morning to Fowler, in Tottenhamcourt-road, and tell him he wanted to see him at the office about ten o'clock the next day, or soonet if he could, about some business, but not to mention any thing to him about what had passed between him and me. I must add, that when I refused to comply to swear the wool my own, he said, if he had known that, he never would have sent it to me, as he could have consigned it to one or two that would have done it. For answer, I said, that's nothing to me. In the morning, by his orders, I went up to Fowler, and told him Shevill desired to see him at the hour stated, as near as he could; he asked me what the business was; I told him, and that he had strongly pressed me to do it, but I would not, and advised him not by any means to consent when he came, and to take no notice of what I had said to him that he like wife wished him to go with me to settle the dispute, if possible, about the wool; he replied, that he would do in the morning; when Soevill came to the office, I told him Fowler would be there about the time; he came, and when he went in, Shevill ordered me out of the office; and after a long conversation it was then proposed by Shevill that he should endeavour to dispose of some cloth he had bought and paid for, to enable him to pay a bill he had accepted for him; Fowler undertook to do so, and took patterns with him, and the price Shevill said he would have, and in the course of the day, or the next, came to the office and acquainted Shevill of what he could get for them, and took an opportunity to acquaint me, but I do not know whether it was that day or the next, that Shevill had proposed the same to him of swearing to the wool, and had offered him some money to engage him to do it, and for him to then attach it, which he had refused. On the Saturday Mr. Fowler, myself, and Shevill, set out to go to the Swan, and at the end of Fleet-marker, next Holborn, Mr. Shevill said, go you and see if the parties are there, and I will wait till you come back; Fowler being before me, I went over with him to the Swan, and we both sat down; I then came out and turned towards Holborn-Hill, went a little way up, and came down to Fleet-market, where I saw him, and told him the parties were there; he said he would step a little further, adding, to the York Coffee-house, and if he did not come to me, to put off the settlement till Monday; I returned, and we were taken into custody; Shevill several times proposed to himself to arrest Jarman, but said he should, he thought; be able to settle it without."</p>

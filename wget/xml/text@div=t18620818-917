                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>, Q.C. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A very important question was asked you, which you answered incidentally, as to whether you knew Mr. Williams before he entered into business on his own account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did two years previously—our firm then consisted of my father, myself, and my brother Samuel—when I became acquainted with Williams, he was in the employ of Page and Welch, leather factors, of Bishopsgate-street, as one of their leather warehousemen—I know Mr. Page—he is in Court—my brother Samuel ceased to be a member of the firm on January 1st, 1860—as a leather salesman, or agent, Page had sold leather to our firm—I cannot say whether we owed Page and Welch a debt of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should certainly say it was 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it exceeded 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by some hundreds, but at this distance of time it is impossible to fix it to a few hundreds—it was for leather he had sold for us, and for raw goods as well—I should think the leather was about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the raw goods about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—of course I am not fixed to a hundred or two—we paid every farthing of it—in the panic of 1857 we had an extension of time, and at that time we owed Messrs. Page and Welch only 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the debt afterwards increased to 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when Mr. Williams was with them, and then we reduced it—Mr. Williams left in 1857—our debt at that time was, I should think, much less than 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it is impos<lb></lb>sible for me to swear it without reference to books, if I had my books here, I could give you the exact figures—Page and Welch insisted on our diminishing that debt—that was, I should think after Williams left—they never mentioned his name to us at all, nor do I think he complained to us that he had been spoken to, for trusting us to so large an amount—when he started in business, we introduced him to the London and Westminster Bank, where we kept our account—before he went into business, we told him most distinctly that we would support him—he went down to Leeds after he left, Page and Welch, and we corresponded as friends, and promised him our support—I never used to go down and see him—he set up in business in 1858—I do not recollect any service he did us before he set up in business—he did not give us letters of introduction to houses in Glasgow and else<lb></lb>where—I will swear he did not introduce us to firms there—he was with the firm of Richard Mitchell, large tanners, near Leeds—he never intro<lb></lb>duced us to them, and we never had a transaction with them—we had not introductions to a firm at Glasgow to my knowledge—I do not know whether my father is here—he is my partner—he did not refuse to prosecute—I consider him as a prosecutor—I have never been to Glasgow—my father went there, and we had a transaction with John Slater, and lost money—I</p>

               <p>was at Margate at the time—it was in August, 1858 and Williams set up in October—my father was at Glasgow two or three days—he went to Leeds, and from Leeds to Glasgow—Williams was very intimate with my family—he came and stopped at my father's house before he set up in business—he and his family were at our house three or four months, and then they started when they had got a house and furnished it—I believe my father is not here—he assists me in managing the business, and is a very active man—he appeared at the police-court—he has never given evidence—Williams came up to town with the express intention of starting in business, and my father assisted him in finding a place, and was very active—long before this circular was sent, Williams and I had conversations about his doing business for us—it was our custom to draw bills on him before the goods were actually sold, but I cannot tell whether that was mooted before the circular was sent—I never proposed to him that he should accept accom<lb></lb>modation-bills for us, nor did my father—my father never accepted bills, and never drew them—I drew the bills—the arrangement in the trade is, that we can draw for two-thirds of the value of the goods—that arrange<lb></lb>ment was never put in writing—it was no privilege at all—it is the custom of the trade—if we drew a bill at two months, and the goods were not sold for six months, we always gave him the money to meet his bill, to recoup himself—I am aware that he started in business with no capital; in fact, our object in drawing on him, was to give him the benefit of our money in effecting sales—we were to draw, and he was to accept, before the goods were sold—there is no such thing as a maximum price.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In one of these there is "At 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">d.;"</hi> that is maximum and minimum, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The instance you refer to is the N.

Brooksbank—he suc<lb></lb>ceeded in selling them, and we never consigned him any more—he sold them, and then he bought the whole bulk, and the whole were invoiced to</p>

               <p>him—he had very nearly 2,000—I have come into possession of all his papers—I have not looked for any paper in which these Petersburgs were invoiced to him—I have not heard before of the statement he has made that that transaction was as a factor—I did not recollect this suddenly—I, of course, knew what you meant when you referred to the transaction—I cannot say what the amount of his sale was, without looking at his ledger, or my own books; they are in Court—I have no doubt that it was somewhere about 557<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a large transaction—we allowed him three months' credit—it was paid by bills—I have not got my bill-book here—he was made a bank<lb></lb>rupt at the end of February this year—I was chosen trade assignee at the end of March—the other assignee was Samuel Barclay, a leather-dresser—the charge at the police-court was made in May, two months after his bankruptcy—Mr. Barclay consented to my making the charge—I know that Mr. Barclay is dead—I swear that he did not refuse to prosecute—he was ill when he was chosen assignee—he was taken to a sick bed and died, and I never came in contact with him, and never consulted him—I went before a Magistrate to get a warrant against Williams on Saturday night; and, I believe, instructions were given that he was not to be apprehended till Sunday—I heard that he was apprehended on Saturday evening—he was taken before the Magistrate on Monday morning—he was not living with his wife and children; he was up at Islington, and his wife was living with her friends—that was after he had become bankrupt, and I and the other assignee had taken possession of his property—I appeared there on Monday—the charge was dismissed three weeks afterwards—I went before the Magistrate three times—Mr. Knights was called as one of my witnesses—he was a customer of Williams—part of the consignment of 23d August is not sold to William Knights; it is to Leonard Harriss; nor is it so in the consignment book.</p>

Paul and Turner assisted me—I caused Williams to be taken in custody a week or two before the adjournment day—Mr. Paul is here—the purchasers whose names I have given are all here; Thomas Simeon, James Gidden, Alexander Macleod, Eaton, Harriss, and Smerdon—they were not all before the Magis<lb></lb>trate</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In 1858, I understand there was a slight deviation in the terms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we were to pay cartage—that was perhaps twelve months afterwards—that was never reduced into writing, but it was a matter privately understood between us and Williams—although there was a bankruptcy, I took no opportunities of examining Balch or Williams, for special reasons—we did not learn that we could not make out any indictable offence against Williams, unless we included Balch—one party advised one course, and one another—we had two or three courses submitted to us—we were told that we should not have so good a chance of convicting Williams unless we included Balch in the indictment—I was told that it would help me to introduce Balch into it; but I should most dis<lb></lb>tinctly have done so without that—I swear that—I believe there is no separate indictment against Williams—I may take my solicitors' statement, and say that there is not.</p>

GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after you became assignee did you inspect the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Immediately; and I had not been at them an hour, before I discovered a fraud; and I informed the solicitor to the bankruptcy, Mr. Linklater, and afterwards applied to my present solicitor, Mr. Humphreys, and in his company took the advice of Counsel, and acted by his advice—the variation in the terms was, that we were to pay cartage, the same as others—the London factors charged about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton, which we consented to, and paid on the subsequent account sales—when I called it private, it may have been mentioned in conversation between us; he may have said, "I find that Poppleton and Beer are paying those charges," and we consented—Mr. Barclay was ill when he was appointed, and never acted in the matter; he did not even appear in Court to sign the paper; he died about six weeks afterwards—he never to my knowledge expressed any disapproval of the course I was pursuing; nor did I ever hear that suggested till to-day—they have not appointed another yet—Williams knew that we had the Petersburg kips—we sent him down a sample, with which he was so pleased that he bought the whole lot—it was a purchase out and out—the amount was paid by acceptances, which were drawn and paid on their becoming due—Miss Wil<lb></lb>liams has been married two years, and our firm continued to deal with Williams down to the date of his bankruptcy—I never heard till to-day any suggestion of their discontinuing to deal with us on account of the coldness of the lady—my father was at the police-court—there is no truth in the suggestion that he disapproved of this prosecution; he decidedly pays part of the expense of it, and not only he, but the other creditors—I am not aware of his having been introduced at Leeds or Glasgow by Williams, or of any arrangement by which my father was to draw bills, which the prisoner was to accept for my father's accommodation: it is impossible—every penny of our debt to Page and Welch was paid years ago—we stopped payment in 1857; we procured an extension of time, as we could not realize stock during the panic—we prayed for four, eight, twelve, and eighteen months—we did not pay interest; we were not asked—I do not know where Mr. Knights is now—he was bankrupt, and his examination was adjourned <hi rend="italic">sine die</hi>—I did not interfere with the execution of the warrant, or give instructions one way or other—our goods shrink according to the weather, and there is sometimes a difference in the weight—they absorb moisture very readily, and, therefore, they afterwards recover their weight again.</p>

               <p>which there were warehousemen—there were transactions of purchase and sale as well as brokerage occasional transactions as a merchant as well as a factor—all those transaction were entered in the, sales journal in the same way—there were "charges" in those cases as well—I did not know whether? all the transactions were brokerage, or purchase and sale transactions; they were both entered in the same form, whether it was an absolute sale or not—I received 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—Balch had 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first, and it was afterwards reduced to 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was the head clerk:—neither of us had any interest in the business beyond our salary—I know that Williams and the Barrows were on the most intimate terms—I have heard Williams say many times, "Barrow will take so much for these goods; enter them at that price,"</p>

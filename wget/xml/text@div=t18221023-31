My coat was in a room near the stable; it was safe in the afternoon of the 1st of October, in a box on the ground floor. About nine o'clock at night I missed it. I found it in pawn on the 4th, in Fore-street. The prisoner occasionally worked in the yard. I had not seen him there that day.</p>

            . I am a labourer at Mr. Dixon's. On the 1st of October, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in the yard, he had no particular business there - he could easily slip into the room where the coat was. I saw him go down the yard about half-past five o'clock with Parker's coat on his back - I knew it to be his by seeing him wear it. I thought he had borrowed it of Parker, and said nothing to him. Next morning I heard it was stolen, and told Parker what I had seen. I saw him next night talking to Parker at the public-house; I do not know what passed. I saw the coat at the pawnbroker's afterwards, and know it is the one I saw on the prisoner's back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was not the prisoner generally there on sale days - A. Yes. The room the coat was in was open to anybody in the yard. I never heard of the workmen playing tricks with each others' coats. The 1st of October was a sale day, but it was after the sale that I saw him go out.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of Cripplegate. I apprehended the prisoner on the 4th of October, in George-yard, Grub-street. I told him it was about the coat - he confessed that he stole it, and said he would get it out if he would not prosecute him. I took him to Russell's, where it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not take him to the pawnbroker's, to swear the duplicate was lost - A. He requested himself to make the affidavit. He told me he had pawned it to treat some girls, and would show me the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>"Mind you do, and if you don't, you shan't work in my yard any longer." I found out where it was next day, and went to the prisoner - he said I should have it again if I said nothing of it. I did not tell Mr.

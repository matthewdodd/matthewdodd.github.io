             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the constable; I apprehended the prisoners last Wednesday evening; I think it was nigh the hour of ten; we went to the Black Dog, in St. Giles's, there we found the two prisoners, and the evidence, and another man who was cleared; there were several other people in the house.</p>

               <p>Did you observe any thing passing between the two prisoners? - I do not recollect that any thing particular passed; we secured them immediately.</p>
               <p>PRISONER FATT'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I know nothing about it; before the Justice they told me, if I did not say something I should be hanged; and the evidence cannot say I knew any thing at all of the fact; this young fellow and me went to buy a pair of shoes, and stopped at the Black Dog.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was a voluntary confession.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these men were sharing money? - They had money in their hands; it was halfpence; there were three of them together, and a man named

             was with them; and we did not take him; going out again, I saw the other sitting with a woman in the box.</p>
               <p>Was Vandereast sitting in a box when you went in? - He was sitting with a woman.</p>
               <p>But he was not sharing this money? - The other that we have not got, and the prisoner Fatt had money in their hands.</p>
               <p>But this man Vandereast had no money in his hands? - Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Nor he was not near them? - They were sitting, and he was sitting in a box when we came out; I did not distinctly observe him when I came in.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I do not think I should put him on his defence, there is no evidence at all against him, but the accomplice.</p>

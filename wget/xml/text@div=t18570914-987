                  </hi>. I am a guard on the North Kent Railway. I have been on the line ten years next Nov., and have been a guard seven years—on Sunday, 28th June, I was the head guard of a train which left Strood at 9.15 at night—a person of the name of Hughes was the underguard—the train consisted of fourteen carriages—it was due at Blackheath at 10.17; we arrived there at 10.32—that was a station at which we ought to stop with that train; we took in and let out passengers there—the train was nearly full—we remained at Blackheath about three or four minutes, I could not say which it was—my mate started the train from there, by having the signal from me—I got the signal to start it, from Mr. Chapman, the station master; I gave the signal to Hughes, and he would give it to the driver—I occupied the tail end of the train, and Hughes the former part—the next station from Blackheath up to London is Lewisham—that was not a station that this train ought to have stopped at—after getting away from the station at Blackheath, a little way before coming to the first bridge, I saw the distance signal, the red light—that was the signal at Lewisham; when I observed that, my duty was to apply the break and to stop the train—I applied the break slightly on this occasion, and the steam was turned off, and the train ran up to the distance signal—we pulled up very nearly dead; I do not think we did quite stop dead at the distance signal, we did at the station signal—the end of the train had got ninety yards beyond the distance signal—the station signal was at red also, that is danger; a good red light is the danger signal—we did not draw the train up to the platform—when the train was stopped, I got out of my break where I sat; I was informed that we were waiting for the "All clear" signal—when we had stopped there six or seven minutes, I heard the whistle of the engine belonging to the Beckenham train—I did not see the Becken<lb></lb>ham train pass; it would come on the main line before us, and run up the same line that we were to run up—after I heard the engine whistle I came close up to my break, and stood on the "six foot," thinking it was our engine whistle, and that we should start, as we had staid there five or six minutes—the "six foot" is the space between the up and down rails—I expected to go on, but we did not—when I found that we did not go on, after standing at the break for a minute or two, I went back past the distance signal 140 or 150 yards—I should say we had then been there seven or eight minutes, or more; I cannot say now; I did not notice the time—I went down the line about 140 or 150 yards past the distance signal—I took a red lamp with me—when I saw the train coming I ran towards it, and whistled and waved the lamp—the light was in my hand before I saw the train coming; I had it all the time; it was a hand lamp of my own—I did not take the tail lamp off; that stopped on the train—there was one red tail lamp to my train—after I whistled and waved my hand the other train passed me—when it came opposite to me, I shouted out as loud as I could halloo for them to stop it—when it went past me I should say it was going at the rate of twenty miles an hour—after it had passed me I heard a collision—I then went towards my train, but before I got to it I thought of the other train, and I went up towards the Black<lb></lb>heath station, to stop everything up—I saw the station master, and made a communication, to stop all the trains coming up—I did not notice the distance signal as I went down the line from Lewisham towards Black<lb></lb>health;</p>

               <p>when I came back from Blackheath, I noticed it then; it was a red light—I went back, and rendered assistance at Lewisham.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. (with <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>.). <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This train that you were driving came from Strood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from Black<lb></lb>heath to New Cross it would be an express train—we should not stop at Lewisham—there were fourteen carriages in my train—it was a very crowded train—we were about fourteen or fifteen minutes late at Black<lb></lb>heath—we were not as much as thirty-two minutes late there—it was due there at 10.17 and arrived at 10.32—that was just about the time we ought to have been at London Bridge—it was due there at 10.45—we arrived at Blackheath at 10.32, and we ought to have been there at 10.17—I do not know why my train did not go on further, that has nothing to do with me, the station master has got the control of the train when I am stopped at a station—we were not as much as 200 yards on the Blackheath side of the Lewisham platform—I should say we were not more than 100 yards—I am speaking of the tail end of the train—the engine was within five or six yards, or more than that, it might be—the tail end, by my calculation, was over ninety yards within the distance signal—I cannot say how long I have been on that particular line, because I have been changed—I have been on the main road, and on several of the branches—I have been on that road sufficiently to know it well—I have served five or six yean on it—from the Blackheath station, going to Lewisham, there it a decline, right down to the distance signal, I believe; and from the distance signal to the Lewis<lb></lb>ham station there is a very slight ascent—the train that came in on ours and caused the accident, was a very heavy train—I believe it was the weight of eighteen carriages, though it only consisted of fifteen—there were some composite carriages—I should say we waited, altogether, seventeen of eighteen minutes at Lewisham, from the time we drew up to the time of tile collision—if everything had been clear and right on the line, we ought not to have stopped at Lewisham that night—I should say that the Lewis<lb></lb>ham junction, where the Beckenham train would pass, is about 140 or 160 yards from the Lewisham station, but I do not know for certain; it is a good deal over 100 yards—the ordinary trains are allowed three minutes from Blackheath to Lewisham, and to put down and take up passengers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the ordinary course of things your train was causing an obstruc<lb></lb>tion to the up line, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They do not call it an obstruction, only waiting for the "All clear" signal; it may be an obstruction, but we do not work it as such—I know the Company's seventh rule, and also the third rule, under the heading of fog signals—I did not act upon the seventh rule, it was not my business to do so then—no fog signals were shown—we started from Strood at a quarter past 9 o'clock, and were fifteen minutes late at Blackheath—I was aware the 9.30 train would follow us, and that its time was up—I was not talking to a gentleman when this accident happened—I do not know Mr. Heath—I do not know whether any of the passengers were examined on the inquiry in the court below—I do no know that a gentleman of the name of Wilcox was examined—I have heard say so—I do not know whether Mr. Shaw or Mr. Spratt was examined—I did not hear them examined—I know that certain passengers were examined—I am prepared to swear that I was not talking to any passenger as the 9.30 train came up—there is a person of the name of Hughes connected with my train—I was not talking to a passenger when I heard the sound of the approaching train, nor did I call out "Hughes, Hughes!" and then run back as fast as I could—the time I called out for Hughes was when I heard</p>

               <p>the Beckenham train start—that was seven or eight minutes before the other train came up—I did not run back just at the time I called out, "Hugher;" it might be about a minute or so—I went back to where I started from—I did not hear any train, and did not know any train was coming—I did not know the train had started from Blackheath—our rules are not to start, and I did not know she was coming—we were waiting for the "all clear" signals at Blackheath, the same as we were at Lewisham, and at the Dockyard, and Charlton—we had been detained five minutes at each station—we were waiting for orders to go on at each, the same as at Lewisham.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the engineer's office of the South Eastern Railway. I have measured the distances in question on this line—from the London end of the platform at the Blackheath station to the first bridge is 545 yards, that is the Love Lane bridge—the width of the bridge is 8 yards—from that bridge to the bridge just before you come to the Lewisham station it is 370 yards—the width of that bridge is 5 yards, and from that bridge to the distance signal is 53 yards—from the distance signal to the station signal is 281 yards—from the station signal to the platform at Lewisham station on the up line is 20 yards—the total distance from the two platforms is 1, 285 yards—the 9.15 train had fourteen car<lb></lb>riages, and an engine of the ordinary length—its total length was 103 yards—supposing that train to have stopped 13 yards short of the station signal, there would be 165 yards between the tail end of the train and the distance signal—the distance from the Blackheath end of the Lewisham platform to the junction of the Beckenham railway is 442 yards—the plat<lb></lb>form is 107 yards long—when I say that, supposing the train to have stopped 13 yards from the station signal, there would be 165 yards between the tail end of the train and the distance signal, I measure from the Black<lb></lb>heath end of the platform—the Beckenham line comes in at the junction, and runs upon the same line of rail—starting from Blackheath platform, there is a fall of 1 in 528 for about 187 yards—that is a moderate incline—from there, for about a distance of 484 yards, there is a fall of 1 in 132; and from there, through the Lewisham station, it falls 1 in 352.</p>

               <p>I to be filled with the average weight of passengers—I started with my experimental train from Blackheath station towards Lewisham—we had attained a speed, as near as I can guess, of about eighteen miles an hour before we endeavoured to stop it—I go, of course, from the driver's opinion of speed in preference to my own, he being more accustomed to it—my judgment coincided with his—we then shut off the steam, and endea<lb></lb>voured to stop the train—we were about seventy yards from the first bridge, the Love Lane bridge, when we shut off the steam, and applied the breaks, on the Lewisham side—when we stopped, the funnel of the engine was under the Lewisham bridge—the total distance from the point where we turned off the steam until the train stopped dead, was 300 yards—you can see the distance signal all the way from the Blackheath station—the state of the rails was not favourable for stopping at the time I made this experiment—it had been raining the greater part of the morning, and had stopped for about an hour or so before the experiment was made—that made the rails very greasy.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am station master at Lewisham. I was on duty there on the night of the accident—the 9.15 train was stopped at our station—it would not stop there in the ordinary course—I noticed the distance signal at the time that train arrived—it stood at danger—it also stood, at danger when the 9.30 train came in—the 9.15 train stopped, I suppose, about twenty yards from the platform—it did not come up to, the platform at all—there was no room in it for any passengers—a good many passengers were waiting to go to London—I noticed the Beckenham train come in on that line from the branch—I was on the platform when the collision took place—several persons were killed—I afterwards went down to look at the distance signal—I found it on full danger to Blackheath—I saw. Perry after the collision, and had some conversation with him—he did not make any complaint to me of the state of the red light—we make a point of adjust<lb></lb>ing that red light three times a day, and oftener, if required—it is operated on by means of a wire which works on a lever—the wire is apt to he, affected by the atmosphere—it had been rectified that day.</p>

               <p>and looked to—I cannot say that they have been cleaned out—it is my impression that they have been cleaned out under my direction—the gas pipes have certainly been cleaned out under my directions, to improve the light—I am not aware that they have been cleaned out and brightened since the accident—I was not present—I really cannot say that they have—I am the station master there still—I have not been suspended or blamed, not the slightest—I have not been complimented or praised that I am aware of—the 9.15 train was stopped at the station very nearly twenty minutes, I should say—I was aware that that train was considerably past its time when it arrived at the Lewisham station—I was aware that the 9.30 train had to follow it, starting from Strood a quarter of an hour after it—I did not take any steps to give warning to the 9.30 train that was coming—a great number of persons were waiting at my station to go on to London—I should suppose not far off 100—I believe the distance between the Lewisham platform and the Lewisham junction is about 440 yards—the 9.15 train was standing right on the platform of the Lewisham station, between that and Blackheath—I knew that the 9.30 train was going to stop at Lewisham—it would have been totally against orders and usage to have taken the 9.15 train on to the space between the Lewisham junction and the station—I have not said that the reason I did not do so was because I was afraid that the people waiting at the station would get into it; the reason I did not draw it up to the platform was, to prevent parties rush<lb></lb>ing and attempting to get in where there was no room—the only reason why it was not drawn past the platform was, that it was against all orders and usage—I am not aware that there is any written order which says that I shall not place a train in safety under such circumstances—if I had allowed the train to have gone past my station, it might have gone across the junction crossing, and there was no signal man there to stop it; the engine might have gone over the cross road, nobody would have control over it; we trusted entirely to the telegraph and the road signals—then was a danger signal up at the junction, but he might have got across the line, and still hare been beyond the signal.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I n your judgment, would that have been a dangerous proceeding? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I knew that the 9.30 train was to follow this in due course—I knew that according to the rules and regulations it could not start from Blackheath without the signal being made that all was clear from Lewisham—I also knew that the red signal of danger was up at Lewisham—the complaints made to me about the state of the distance signal were mere passing remarks, that the distance signal did not stand light—those complaints were attended to immediately, and it was set to rights at once—it is turned by a wire that is worked by a lever; if the wire gets stiffened or contracted it does not turn it perfectly square round; it would, perhaps, be a little oblique, so that the next time it was looked at it would not be square—that was always remedied by altering the wire—there is a coupling for the purpose, so as to admit of the wire being shortened or lengthened—it is so with every distance signal, and every station signal; it is lighted by gas—I cannot say how often it is looked to by the gas workmen, it is occasionally looked to—after this accident occur<lb></lb>red, I sent for the gas man usually employed, and desired him to look to the light—I did not myself see anything that he did—after he had been there he returned to me, and told me there was nothing the matter—that is all I know about it—I do not know of any such operation as brightening gas pipes.</p>

            . I live in Fleur-de-lis-court, Spitalfields. I have a truck stands in the next yard to mine; when I opened my door in the morning, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner was there breaking up a truck - he did not live there; I asked what he was breaking it up for; he said he would sell it to me for 15s. - I said I would have nothing to do with it, and asked why he was breaking it up - he said it was too small for him, and he was going to build a larger one; the board, with the prosecutor's name on it, was thrown into my yard - I did not see it come off the truck, but when the officer came and asked for it I found it; I saw the same truck at the station that morning.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 18th of August, between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner came to my house, and offered me a truck; I said I would have nothing to do with it, and asked where he got it - he said it was all right; he had not got it with him - I asked where it was; he said in Essex-street, which is in Whitechapel - I accompanied him there, and saw the truck; I thought it was not right, and would not buy it; I asked what he wanted for it - he said 12s.; it was worth 25s. or 30s. - I walked home; he followed me, and offered it for 5s., then 4s. 6d., and then walked away.</p>

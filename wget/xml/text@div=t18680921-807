                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Burwash and Sons, notaries, of 23, Birohin Lane—on Saturday, 11th July last, the prisoner called at my office and brought with him this bill of exchange and said I was to do what was necessary with it—he gave me a card repre<lb></lb>senting himself to be a member of the firm of Pardo &amp; Company, dealers in jewellery and precious stones—I sent one of my clerks to get it accepted, and my clerk brought it back with the answer "Gone away, not known"—I then drew up the protest—on the bill was written "In case of need to be presented at Jameson &amp; Son's"—they are the correspondents of Messrs. Keller &amp; Sons of Stutgardt—the bill was paid by them under protest—two days after the prisoner came for the money—Jameson's had paid with a crossed cheque,—I handed the prisoner the cheque and he demurred at taking it—he said a few days previously he had received a crossed cheque which had been returned to him—I told him it was the custom, and I could not help him—I met him later in the day, in Gracechurch Street, and asked him if he had received the money, and he said he had—when he came on the Saturday he handed me Messrs. Pardo's card, and I handed him one of ours in return—I never knew him before—on the 2nd August I was fetched to the Bank of England and saw him there—I identified him as the person who brought me the bill—Foulger showed me the bill and asked me if the prisoner was the man who brought me the bill to do what was necessary with it—I said he was—the prisoner then said I had never seen him, and he had never seen me.</p>

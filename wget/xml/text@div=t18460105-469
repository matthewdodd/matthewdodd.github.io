                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant L</hi> 8.) On the 9th of Dec. I saw George Sanders in the London-road—I followed him into the New Kent-road, nearly facing the clock-house, and back to Duke-street, Westminster-road—I there lost sight of him—on the 15th of Dec. I went to Mrs. Tubbs, in Hunter's-place, about four o'clock in the afternoon, with Manser—Mrs. Tubbs directed me to a room there—I found Elizabeth Sanders there—I found a bag hanging on the bed-post—I took it down, and found three packages in it—I opened them—one contained thirty half-crowns, another ten, and the other two, all counterfeit—on the side of the bedstead, between the mattresses, I found a paper with three counterfeit shillings—under the bed, on the floor, I found this spoon, this cup, and some plaster-of-Paris in a bag—this spoon had some metal in it—I found two bands—the woman said these things belonged to her husband—I found 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in good money, which was given up to the prisoners at the police-court.</p>

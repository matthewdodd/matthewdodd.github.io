               <p>Q. Had you observed any Mocoa coffee in that warehouse. - A. Yes, and there was one bale cut, and there seemed to be three or four pounds gone; as he was going out of the door I said I was going to rub our gang down, he appeared confused in my rubbing him down, in two small pockets hanging quite behind, I felt something like coffee, I told him he must go with me to the elder's office, he immediately answered, pray Mr. Soul do not take me there, for God's sake, do not; on being taken there an officer was sent for; in his pocket was found one pound seven ounces of coffee.</p>
               <p>- BURGESS sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the King's locker. - A. Yes, I found the coffee in the possession of the prisoner, it weighs one pound seven ounces, it is Mocoa coffee.</p>

In the morning I hung up my coat about eight o'clock, I never was nigh it till after three o'clock, I know not how the coffee was put in my pocket, there was nothing in my pocket when I hung it up; I said for God's sake do not say this coffee is in my pocket, it is unknown to me.</p>

                  </hi> the younger. I am the son of Thomas Silverwood, of Oxford-street. About ten o'clock on the 30th of September, I received information which induced me to go into Portman-street, Portman-square—I saw the prisoner there with this merino under his arm—it was covered with this paper—I had never seen him before—I took it from him—it is my father's—I came out of the shop and followed George Bateman—I went up Green-street, into Norfolk-street, into a mews—the prisoner was running—we came up to him, and walked between us down into North Audley-street—I then returned home—the policeman then took the prisoner to the station-house—I said nothing to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an errand-boy. I was passing, and saw the prisoner take a piece of merino from Mr. Silverwood's door—it was on the step just inside the door—a young woman went in, and gave information—the last witness cane out, and I told him he had turned the corner—he took the goods from him—the prisoner then ran across Park-street, and down Green-street—we came up to him—I told him if he would return with me to Mr. Silverwood's, he would do nothing to him—he then returned with me, and Mr. Silverwood and the policeman took him.</p>

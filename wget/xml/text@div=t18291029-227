I went down there about the 17th or 18th of October, and found him at his father's house: I gave him into custody, and had him brought here - (looking at a watch produced by Wild) this is one of the watches I lost, and the chain to it; I have had the watch about eighteen months; I am not the maker - it is my own gilding; I am quite sure of it - there is no maker's name on it; it was in this state when I lost it.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker, of Chiswell-street. I received this watch in pawn from the prisoner on the 30th of September, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and lent him 30s. on it; I never saw him before, but am quite certain of his person - I gave him what I supposed amounted to 30s.; he came next morning, and said I had given him a 7s. piece instead of a half-sovereign - I said, "I gave it you for the watch you pawned last night, did not I?" he said Yes, and I gave him half a sovereign for it - I am quite certain of him.</p>

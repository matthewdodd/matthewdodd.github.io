They cut the String of my Breeches and tyed my Hands behind me, and one of my Legs. I desired them not to throw me down, because I had lately broke my Arm. So they laid me down gently. R - said, Be easy, and one shall come in five Minutes and release you; and if any body else offers to meddle with you, say that you have spoke with Mr. Jones. I suppose that was a Watch Word, but I told him it could do me but little service after I had been rob'd of all. He said I need not complain, for if he should be taken I would have no mercy on him. So he fired a Pistol over my Head (which I thought was a silly Action) and then they left me - I believe that tall ill-looking Fellow, the other Prisoner, was another of the Gang, but his Face was muffled - One of them had a long Knife like that as was taken upon Mac Cray. And R - gave two Pistols to the other two - This is my Wigg, it was taken upon R - Head - I lay bound in the Lane an Hour by St. Paul's Clock, and then I made shift to get loose.</p>

He said he had lost two Guineas, and a half Crown. But we went from thence to The Magpye Tavern at Bishop's Gate to share the Booty, and then they produced only a half Crown and two half Pence, and said, the Gentleman was a lying Rogue for saying that he had lost two Guineas. Next Day Vaughan and R - - disposed of the Watch for a Guinea and a half, as they told me, and then they knock'd the Coat of Arms out of the Ring and sold the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173507020010"></xptr> Gold for four Shillings six Pence, five Shillings six Pence, or six Shillings six pence, I can't say which, but there was an odd six Pence) to a Gold-Smith in White Chapple - and the Buckles. - </p>

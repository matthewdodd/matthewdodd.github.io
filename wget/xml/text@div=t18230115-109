On the 2d of January, between nine and ten o'clock, I was coming down Tower-street, rather intoxicated, and passing by the prisoner I heard her say that she was in a most deplorable state, and much distressed, and if Captain Rule was in London, she should not be in that wretched state - she was talking to herself, and appeared much distressed. I asked her if she knew Captain Rule, she said Very well, I said so did I, and I would give her something to drink - I took her into a public-house, in Tower-street, and sat down in the same box with her; she had some rum and water. We left there, and she walked with me to the corner of George-street, Minories. I had a purse with eleven sovereigns in it, when I left the public-house. She told me she was quite distressed, and asked me to get her a lodging. When we got to the corner of <placeName id="t18230115-109-crimeloc608">George-street</placeName>

               <p>"I have left some things at a certain house, and shall lose them if I don't return for them;" she then left me. The next minute I missed my purse, and about eight days after, I found her at the Police Office. I am certain of her - I have not recovered it. I found her in custody about eight days after, in consequence of an advertisement. She always kept on the side my purse was on.</p>

            . My husband is a coal porter. I have known the prisoner three months; she owed me 7 s.; she came down to me at Shadwell, on the 2d of January, at a quarter to one o'clock at night, and pulled out a handful of sovereigns - I said I thought they were not her own, and I would not take the 7 s. She had left some clothes with me. I went to her next morning, and took her a gown - she said she had met an old friend very much in liquor, and took his purse from him, took the money out, and threw the purse away.</p>

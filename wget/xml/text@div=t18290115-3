On the 19th of December, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I went out to buy a candle - it was dark: I left nobody in the room; I locked the door, and when I came back I had a candle - I got it lighted before I went into the room; when I got to the room-door I found it partly open, and saw the prisoner in the room - he told me some man had been into the room: I asked what business he had there - he immediately rushed by me, and ran down stairs; I followed him, and when he got to the street-door it was shut - he opened it: I followed close after him - he tried to shut the street-door, but I caught it in my hand; I went out to my father, who was in the stall under the window, in the street - it is a shoemaker's stall- I told him; the prisoner ran towards Wardour-street, and my father followed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who does your father hire the house of? A. Mr. Hammond, of Marlborough-street, who does not live in the house; he collects the rents himself - nobody belonging to the house lives in it; there are lodgers on the second-floor, and at the top of the house; there is a private and a shop-door- I locked the room-door, and took the key; I did not lock the street-door, but left it shut - my father and all the lodgers have a key of the street-door; my father does not pay taxes: I found no marks of violence on the door- it must have been opened with a key; I had lighted the candle at my father's stall, before I returned - when I ran down I spoke to my father immediately; he directly ran out after the prisoner - I could see him all the way he ran, but not till he was taken; I did not run after him: I did not lose sight of him for five minutes -I never saw him before; there are two gas-lights opposite the house - I had been gone about ten minutes for the candle. No property was missing.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LAWRENCE. I am thirteen years old - William Lawrence is my father. On the night in question I was playing at marbles before my father's door, and saw the prisoner come out of the house; he ran towards Wardour-street - my sister went to my father, and said there had been a thief in the room; my father followed him - I ran to the corner of St. Ann's-court, and saw the prisoner coming towards Wardour-street again, running fast; I laid hold of him by the tail of his coat, but could not stop him - I fell down, and called Stop thief! St. Ann's-court is in the way from our house to Wardour-street: I had been playing at the door about a quarter of an hour, but did not see my sister go out, or any body go in - I saw the prisoner stopped in Chapel-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen your sister go out? A. No, I was over on the other side of the street once, and came over again; I was not near my father's door -I could see the door on the other side; Chapel-street is about five minutes' walk from our house - I caught hold of the man by the tail of his coat, and fell down; I got up and followed in a minute and a half, but had not lost sight of him - he ran across the road, and then kept going along Wardour-street; I kept him in sight till he was taken - I lost sight of him for about a minute, while I was down; a good many people ran when I cried out, but he was the first of them - he is lame, and cannot run very fast; he kept before the people who followed: I went before the Justice the same evening, and told all this, and was examined again next day - nobody told me what to say; my father told me to say what I had seen, but did not tell me what.</p>

            . I am the father of the witnesses. I keep two rooms on the first-floor at No. 10, Edward-street, in the parish of St. James, Westminster; Mr. Hammond, the landlord, does not occupy any part of the house - it is all let out to lodgers; I have a key of my rooms, and a latch-key of the street-door - I have also a stall under the window. On the 19th of December my daughter came out of the door, and gave me information- I followed the man, whom she pointed out, towards Wardour-street, across the street, into Ship-yard; I ran round into St. Ann's-court, and then into Wardour-street again - I did not see him taken: I afterwards went home, and examined my room; the lock of the front door appeared to have been picked - it was not forced open, as there was no mark of violence; the bolt of the lock was back - I examined a drawer in the room, and found it had been cut open; the wood-work, where the bolt of the lock goes, was cut out: there was wearing-apparel in the drawer, but nothing was taken away; I had another drawer in the room, with money in it - that was partly cut open; others were cut, but not sufficient to open- nothing was taken; it was about half-past six o'clock: there are two gas-lights opposite the house, which enabled the boys to play at marbles.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in your stall all the time? A. Yes, at work - I saw nobody go in or out; the prisoner was searched, but no instrument was found on him: the drawers appeared to have been cut with a chisel- the door appeared as it would have been if my daughter had left it open. I saw the prisoner running when my girl alarmed me. almost directly he ran out of my door; I did not see him leave the house - other people were running.</p>

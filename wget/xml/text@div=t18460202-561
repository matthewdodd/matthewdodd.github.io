I was on the Southwark side of London-bridge on the 17th of Jan., about three o'clock in the afternoon—I saw the two prisoners making from the Borough—I followed them, and saw Freeman try a gentleman's pocket on the bridge—he put his hand under and lifted it up—they went on, and in King William-street Freeman attempted a gentleman's pocket, but he did not succeed—Phillips then stepped forward, and lifted the pocket and took a handkerchief out—he wont down a little street—I followed him—he saw me at the corner, threw the handkerchief down,</p>

               <p>and ran—I pursued and took him—I came back, and the handkerchief was gone—I went on the bridge and found Freeman—I knew them before by sight, and had seen them together.</p>

I was going over London-bridge, and the policeman came and said he thought I was in bad company; I had never seen this lad before; it is not very likely I could throw a handkerchief away without somebody seeing it.</p>

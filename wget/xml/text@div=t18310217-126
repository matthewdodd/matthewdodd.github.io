            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I remember the prisoner being at my master's house; he went out just after nine o'clock in the morning - he had no breakfast; he took a glass of gin at the bar - I made the bed over night; it then had a pair of sheets on it - I missed one sheet just after he left the house, and my shawl, which I had left over night in a drawer in the kitchen, which is up stairs - he would have to pass that to get down to the tap-room; he stood at the bar to have his gin - he did not pay for his bed; it was a large size sheet, but he might conceal it about his dress - when he went away his dress seemed very tight indeed; I did not observe his dress over night - I gave 5s. for my shawl; it was a cotton one and a smallsize - the sheet was worth about 6s.; the table-cloth, which was missed, had been in the same drawer with my shawl; that was worth 7s. - I had seen them both safe over night, just before I went to bed; no one had been in the kitchen, to my knowledge, that morning.</p>

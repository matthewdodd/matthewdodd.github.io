               <p>Q. Were you the only waiter serving there? - A. There was another servant there; I do not know whether he was present at the time; I put the muffin on the tea-board; I did not miss the things, I did not know of it till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take away the tea-board? - A. No, I went home.</p>

             sworn. - I belong to Bow-street: I took the prisoner at the bar on the first of May, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, at the New Hummums coffee-house, Covent-Garden; the waiter told me he suspected him having something about him that was not his own; I searched him, and found a pair of tea-tongs, a silver salt-spoon, and a silver tea-spoon; they were claimed by Mr. Moule; there is the name at full length on them all three; information was sent to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290020"></xptr>the Rainbow; he said he hoped I would not take him into custody, if I did it would be the ruin of him; I found a number of other things upon him. (The property produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and gentlemen of the Jury, my defence will be short; I shall not detain the Court long; I had been out the day this offence was committed, and had drank very freely; I was in a state of intoxication, and I had an appointment to meet a gentleman at the Rainbow coffee-house upon some business; I went there in order to meet the person; the person that I was to meet called upon me, after I had ordered the tea, and said that he had made a mistake in the house that I was to meet him at; it was another house, which was the Hummums; the things mentioned in the indictment were found on me I will admit of; but how they came on me, or in my pockets I know not; I was in such a state of intoxication that I was not able or capable of knowing what I was about; and in the morning, when the officer came to me in the watch-house, I did not even know the charge that was against me; I never was charged with a criminal matter in my life before; this is the first time that ever I was brought into a Court, therefore I shall humbly beg leave to throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Humphreys.) Had he the appearance of a man intoxicated? - A. No, I thought him mean and shabby.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Akess.) At the time you were called upon to take the prisoner into custody, did he appear intoxicated? - A. Not at that time; in taking him to the watch-house he wished to make himself appear so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it real intoxication or pretended? - A. It appeared to me pretended, I do not think he was drunk at all.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bottle-dealer, in partnership with my father and brother, in Spitalfields. The prisoner was in my service in October, as carman, and had been so for seven years—in consequence of information I applied to the police to have him watched—I sent him out on the 12th of October, with a cart, loaded with bottles in baskets—he left the premise about three o'clock—he was to leave them at various customers—I did not see him again till he was brought back, about half-past seven o'clock, in custody of the policeman, who said in his presence that he had watched him from the time he left the premises, and saw him take phials out of various baskets, and place them in a spare basket—that after he had been his round, he drove to his own house, in Windmill-street, and took the basket at of the cart, and as he was in the act of giving it to his wife, he took him, and asked him how he obtained the bottles—he said from Mr. Richards—the prisoner then said to me, "For God's sake, Mr. James, don't appear against me, I have only taken (or stolen) a few bottles"—I said, "I shall give you into custody," which I did, and identified the phials—about ten shillings' worth were found on him—he had 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

On the 12th of October, in consequence of directions, I followed the prisoner when he went out with the cart—I was in plain clothes—a brother officer and another man went with me—he went out about five minutes after three o'clock—I followed him to several places—he stopped at five places in Long-acre—he drove very slow, and holding the reins with one hand, with the other he kept taking bottles out of different baskets, and putting them into an empty one, until he came to St. Martin's church—he drove to other places, and left baskets—he then drove pretty fast to two places, and in Piccadilly again drove slowly, took more bottles, and put them into the same basket—he called at two other places, and then drove home to King's Arms-court, Windmill-street—the cart stopped there—he looked very cautiously round him, then jumped on to the wheel, and took out he basket, and took it to own house—I followed, and overtook him just as he got in at the door—his wife was about the centre of the room—he was reaching the basket out to her—I seized hold of him, and said, "What have you got in this? where did you bring them from?"—he said, "From Mr. Richards's"—I said, "What are you going to do with them?"—he said, "To sell them"—I said, "Did Mr. Richards authorise you to sell them?"—he said no, he</p>

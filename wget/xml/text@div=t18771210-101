I am one of the firm of Henry King and Co., bankers, Cornhill—we have a strong room exactly underneath my room, the only entrance to it being by a staircase which descends from one corner of my room—my room is usually swept out by the porter in charge I occupy it jointly with my father—I keep one set of keys, and my manager another set—I put mine into a patent cylinder desk which was kept locked—after the robbery I found that my desk had been opened by a person's fingers being inserted at the bottom of the cylinder—I tried and found it could be so opened "without forcing—the lock back and shut up again as if it had never been opened—I also with an expert examined the strong room, but did not find that any violence had been used, the locks being in perfectly good order—I kept in the strong room jewellery, plate, money, and securities of all kinds in chests—some of the jewellery belonged to my own relations, but the greater portion belonged to customers who deposited it for safe custody when they left the country for a short time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It required some skill to open the desk, and there must be two people to do it—I think Mr. Danks was with me when I opened it—it was done in five minutes simply by the fingers—I think Fisher was our porter about a year—the three windows of my room would look out into a court—it is en the ground floor—there are two doors to my room, nearly close together—one leads into a passage, both doors lead to the outside office—there is an ante-room, but no door from it into the passage—Fisher stayed away for his own convenience, and I told him he must leave for mine—I do not know if a character—was given him—I should have had no objection—the manager has the supervision of the porters—the robbery was first brought to my knowledge in October, 1876—we had then no suspicion that the pro<lb></lb>perty was taken from our premises—the prisoner left in December, 1876—we believed that the jewels had been extracted from a railway train.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 33, Tracey Street, Kennington Road—I was porter to Messrs. King and Co. prior to July, 1876—I went there is February, 1875—the prisoner was also employed as porter—I used to go at 7.30 a.m. and sweep and dust the room—the prisoner came at the same hour to sweep and dust the room opposite—there were two desks in the room, one belonging to Mr. King, the other to Mr. S. King—about Christmas, 1875, or January, 1876, the prisoner showed me a round box with a turquoise bracelet—he said "This is how I have property placed under my care," and asked me if I knew where to sell it—I told him "No"—he showed it to me the following day in the basement, and asked if I had found out where to sell it—I told him "No, I had not troubled about it"—that was about 7.30 a.m.—in the afternoon he again asked me if I knew who would buy it—I said I would try and sell it—he gave it to me then—I took it to Mr. Mosedale's, at the Golden Horse, in Aldersgate Street—Mosedale told me where to sell it, and I went to a Mr. Farnham, in Charles Street, Drury Lane, who offered me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I brought it back as Draper directed me, and afterwards took it to Farn<lb></lb>hain's and received the amount—I gave the money to Draper, who gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of it—Draper afterwards showed me a gold watch—that was in the basement—he asked me to take it to Farnham's—we both went—I was not present when he sold it, but he told me that he had sold it—I do not remember the amount—in January or the beginning of February, 1876, Draper said he had heard that there was a great amount of pro<lb></lb>perty in the safe, and asked me if I knew where the keys were kept—he said he would not mind doing anything against Mr. King—he had a little ill-feeling against him, I believe—I told him I believed Mr. Danks took the keys away with him every night—Draper on several occasions during the day, when we went to have some beer, asked me if I could find out where the keys were kept—I told him "No"—one morning he came when I was cleaning out Mr. King's office—we talked about the safe—we noticed the desk was not fastened properly—you could see that the bolts had not gone into the catch properly at the top of Mr. Seymour King's desk—we pulled the top of the desk, and it came open—we saw the keys just inside—I said "I suppose those are the keys"—we went down and unlocked the safe—we did not take anything then—the next morning we got the keys in the same way—we took a box containing jewellery—Draper went into the safe while I listened at the door at the end of the stairs—Draper broke open the box and emptied the contents into a handkerchief—we had also fastened Mr. King's door to prevent any one coming upon us—I saw a diamond ring with three stones in it, and other things which I cannot remember—Draper did the box up again, and put it back—we locked the safe up, and put the keys back—we went to Farnharn's and arranged to meet him in the City Road, and then go to Draper's house, at 43, Nicholas Street—we met Farnham with another man whom I don't know—the things were shown to Farnham at Draper's lodgings—</p>

               <p>Draper said to Farnham "We have got a lot of stuff—we want you to price each article separately"—Farnham refused to do that—Draper said "You won't have it at all, then"—Farnham went out—we had some drink and then parted—I afterwards took the things to Mosedale Draper was not with me then, but he went in the afternoon—Mosedale said he could very likely sell it to a relation of his in the country—he would take it the following morning, and if we called in the evening he would tell us the price—we went the following day, when Mosedale offered 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—Draper said he would not take it, and took the jewellery away—in the beginning of the next week he said "I am short of money—we had better get rid of that stuff—it is dangerous to have it about"—he gave it to me, and I took it to Farnham's, and sold it for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—part of "the money was paid then and part on the following week—I met Draper, gave him half the money, and kept the other half—two or three mornings afterwards we again went to the strong room—having locked the door, the same as before, I listened at the door while Draper went to the safe—he brought out a dressing-case, broke it open, and took out some rings and a lady's watch, and did the case up again and put it back—Draper said he would not let Farnham have any more because he was chiselling us, and that he had found out a man who would buy it, and give us a better price for it—the case was taken to Draper's lodgings—I went there after I had done work, about 7 or 8 p.m.—I saw Draper and the man Mason who is here to-day—Draper said Mason knew a man named Oakley, of a public-house in Hoxton Square—he did not say the name of the house, but I think it was the Prince Albert—Draper and Mason went in first, and then came and told me it was all right, and Mason held open a side door—we went upstairs into a concert room—the public-house is near Shoreditch railway-station on the North London Railway—Draper produced the jewellery and showed it to Oakley, who offered 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and part was paid then—Mason had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me, and Draper gave him some—we went into Mr. King's safe four or five times altogether—on one occasion this square leather box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), containing a tin box was, broken open and some rings, silver bracelets, and silver brooches taken—the box has Captain Tullock's name on it—this is the bracelet—it has turquoise stones in it—Mason said "Don't let Oakley have the bracelet; I can get more money than Oakley can give you for it"—he did not say what he would do with it—I left Mr. King's employment in June, 1876—I saw the prisoner several times since—he used to come where I worked—he came once in my dinner time, and told me that a desk had been sent into the country, and that when it arrived it was discovered to be opened—he saw me again, and said that a case which he had mentioned to me was insured for l,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he said "That's the one Farnham had"—he came to me day after day—he said they were all being watched, and they had to be very careful what they did.</p>

I have been brought here from Pentonville Prison, where I am undergoing a sentence of 10 years' penal servitude for coining—I shall be 30 years of age on the 25th of February next—I was first convicted when between 16 and 17 years of age, and sentenced to six months' imprisonment—I was since sentenced to seven years, and served every hour—before I was last sentenced I was living at 5. James Street, St. George's Road, Holloway, and before that at 5, John Street—after my last conviction I made a statement and gave it to the Governor, in consequence of which Sergeant Brett came and asked me questions—I know the prisoner—I became acquainted with him at a beershop in Mary Street, Hoxton, which was kept by Thomas Jackson—about April, 1876, the prisoner spoke to me about jewellery, and in consequence of what ho said I met him at the corner of a street where his lodgings were,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100046"></xptr>
               <p>and went with him to his lodgings at 43, Nicholas Street, New North Road—the prisoner, in conversation, asked me how much I thought the jewellery which he showed me was worth—I told him about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—each article was wrapped in tissue paper, and as I looked at them one by one he wrapped them up and put them away in a high hat—this was about 6.30 p.m.—the prisoner made an appointment before I left to meet him the next day in Bishopsgate Churchyard, and take the jewellery to a person who would buy it—he did not come—I went to his house to inquire about him—I met him at the corner and asked him why he did not keep his appointment—he said the jewellery was sold for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after I had been there some time I heard two knocks, and a man the prisoner called Mr. Fish came—that was the first time I saw Fisher—that is the man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to—Fisher</hi>)—Fisher brought a brown-paper parcel—the prisoner opened it—it contained a great deal of silver plate and knives and forks and spoons—the prisoner asked me to take them away and try them, and I took them to Mr. Oakley's public-house in Hoxton—I sent Fisher and Draper round to a private door—I went through the bar, and Oakley and I let them in—I had been the day previously to Mr. Oakley—we all went to the concert room—two gold watches were shown to Oakley, but he and the prisoner could not come to terms as to the price—Oakley wished to buy the cases by weight, but Draper and Fisher would not allow the insides to be taken out—they asked 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—Oakley did not buy them, but they made an agreement that Oakley should give 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce for the gold, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the silver—the prisoner then left Fisher and Oakley and me there, and went away and brought back the silver plate and jewellery that I had seen at his lodg<lb></lb>ings—everything was sold but the watches—part of the money was paid that evening—Draper gave me two sovereigns—on that evening he also gave me two gold watches, an Albert with turquoise pendant, and a pair of earrings with drops set with turquoise, and 13 rings—I took them home—afterwards I sold them to a Hebrew I knew in Houndsditch for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for myself—I met Draper and Fisher at Oakley's in the evening, and gave them the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—upon that evening they brought another parcel—it was opened and contained all descriptions of jewellery—there was one gold necklet—there was a coin larger than a sovereign, and they were seeing how many sovereigns this coin would weigh down, that is what made me notice it particularly—it was all sold to Oakley except the silver bracelets, which were given to me to pawn or sell, and get as much as I could for, as I said I could get more than Oakley would give by weight for them—my wife pawned the bracelets the next day, and I pawned the brooch—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two bracelets—I gave them to my wife or my sister, I cannot tell which, as I was tipsy—the brooch was set with the same stone—I took six rings from the prisoner that evening—we were both drunk, and I stole them from him—Fisher had gone home—I sold the rings to the same Jew who bought the watch—these are two of the rings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but I cannot say whether they are part of the 13 which were given to me to sell, or part of the six I stole—a few days afterwards I went to Oakley's again, and saw Draper, and told him I had pawned the bracelet and the brooch—he told me to tear up the tickets—I did so—the prisoner never told me where the things came from, but I believed it was somewhere near Cornhill—Draper told me that Fisher knew where the keys of a strong room were kept, and</p>

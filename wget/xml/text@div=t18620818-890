                  </hi>. I reside at Rupert House-terrace—on Friday, 25th July, I fastened the window of my dining-room at about half-past 11 or from that to 12 o'clock at night—I was called down by a servant next morning about a quarter past 6, and found that an entrance had been made at this particular window—I missed from the dining-room some counters, a pair of Balmoral boots, a coat, a cream-ewer, a sugar-basin, and cake-basket—two of these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are not mine, but the rest belong to me—the value of the property altogether is, I should say, about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some of the articles were in use the night before—my house is in the parish of Chiswick—I was the last person up, and barred and bolted the dining-room back window.</p>

I am cook in the service of Mr. Bridges—on Friday night, 25th July, I closed and fastened all the windows and doors, at a little before 11, except the dining-room window—next morning I came down a few minutes after 6, and found the room all in a disorderly state, and the window open—I roused Mr. Bridges directly—the window of the hall back-door was also broken—the dining-room window was the only place at which a person could get in—I found this iron gardening instru<lb></lb>ment in the dining-room.</p>

               <p>morning, the prisoner came and asked whether we purchased plate—I told him we did sometimes, but I should not buy any of him unless he brought a note from the person to whom it belonged—he went away, and returned in shout a quarter of an hour with this note (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "James Connell. Sir, please to take the plate, and send a note back by the bearer, J. Council, 7, Marlborough-street, Chelsea. John Smith, bearer." <hi rend="italic">Envelope addressed,</hi> "Mr. Vincent")—he brought all this plate with that note—it was wrapped up in cloths, just as it is now—we did not buy it—I detained it, and sent for the police.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, T</hi> 25). On Saturday, 26th July last, about half-past 8 in the morning, I went to the shop of Mr. Vincent, and found the prisoner there—I said, "I understand you have brought some plate to pledge"—he said, "Yes, I have"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "My brother-in-law sent me with it"—I asked him who his brother-in-law was—he said, "He sent a note by me; if you look at that note, you will see who he is; he has two or three brick-carts in Marl<lb></lb>borough-road"—I then asked the pawnbroker for the note, and he gave it me—I went to the address given of James Connell, and tried every place, and there was no such person living there, nor anywhere round the neigh-bourhood—the prisoner had on a pair of nearly new double-soled Balmoral boots when taken to the station—he got rid of them on the remand from Saturday till Wednesday—they were not quite new—there was a stitch or two loose in the side.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector</hi>). On Saturday, 26th July, the prisoner became very violent at the station-house, when Birch had been sent to make inquiries about Connell—I thought it right to place him in a cell—on searching him, I found in the pocket of the coat which he now has on, this handle of the cream-ewer, and these counters—I observed a pair of Balmoral boots on his feet—I asked him how he came possessed of them—he said he bought them second-hand from off a barrow at Lincoln-fire, which means some place, I suppose, I don't know—in the evening, after he was examined at the police-court, I went and examined the prosecutor's premises at Turnham-green—I found that some one had got over the garden-wall at the rear of Mr. Bridges' premises, broken down the ivy, come along the garden-path, tried the kitchen-window, and out out a square of glass in a glass door that leads from the passage to the garden—there was a slight mark at the bottom of the kitchen window-frame—further on I found that a pair of glass folding-doors had been forced open, the bolt forced away and the shutters forced off—there were marks of paint on this instrument, and I fitted them exactly with the paint on the shutters and on the glass, doors that lead from the dining-room to the lawn.</p>

I was called to Mrs. Ray. nor's on the 21st of Jan.—the prisoner was charged with stealing a blanket and other articles—she at first denied it, but afterwards said she had pledged the blanket, and produced a purse containing the duplicate—in the way to the station she dropped some duplicates, and I found some in her hand—there were nine in all, but none of them relate to this property—Mrs. Raynor produced some other duplicates, which led to the discovery of the whole of the property she lost, except the saw, but the pawnbroker could not identify the person who pawned them—those duplicates were not found till last Saturday, after the prisoner was committed.</p>

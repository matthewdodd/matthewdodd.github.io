                  </hi>. I live in Exmouth-street, Euston-square, and an foreman to John Walker Williams, a builder. This grafting-tool belongs to him, and was left in the vault of an unfinished building—it is branded-"J. W. W."—the prisoner had nothing to do with our concern's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I had asked him for a job before—I know if the master had been there he would have lent me the spade—I worked in Camden-town about two hundred yards from there. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He called once and asked for a job, but my employer refused to give him one—the place he describes is about half a mile off, but I never saw him but when he called to ask for work—I am sure he was not engaged to work for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was in distress and could not buy a spade to go to work with—I went to this place to borrow one—it is general among the Irish to borrow spades of each other—I could not make away with it, for it is marked, and I did not intend to do so.</p>

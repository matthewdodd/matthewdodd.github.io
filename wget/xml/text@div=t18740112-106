                  </hi>. I am a cook, and live at 6, High Street, Islington—about 12.30 on Saturday night, 27th December, I was in High Street, passing Parsley Court, and the prisoners came out of the court and pushed me from one side to the other, and Leary struck me with his list on my</p>

               <p>nose, and made a snatch at my chain—whilst he was doing that, Henessey was pushing me towards the shutters—my uncle, who was with me, called out "Police!" and two constables came up—Hennessey knocked my uncle down—the prisoners went down the court with others, and we followed them, with the police, to a house on the left side of the court—we knocked two or three times and the light was put out—the door was opened at last, and we went into a room where we found fourteen or fifteen men—Hennessey was taken from under a bed, by a constable—Leary was behind a screen, which was hanging down; he had a jug in his hand, and said "You can see it was not me, because I am pouring out beer"—they were taken in custody, and I went to the station and charged them—I had done nothing to provoke the attack—I am certain they are the men—I have known Hennessey eight years by seeing him about.</p>

I am a house decorator, of St. Alban's Place, Islington—I was with Porter, my nephew; the prisoners came up and struck him in the eye, and made an attack upon his watch chain—I went to his assistance, and Hennessey struck me on my nose, and again on my eye, and I tripped and cut both my knees—eight or nine people came out of the court—we called "Police!" and they all rushed down the court; we went after them to the house—as soon as we knocked at the door the light was put out—we gained admission, and found twelve or fourteen people playing at cards and drinking beer—I saw Leary fetched from behind the bed, and Hennessey from behind a screen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 3, Parsley Court, Islington—that is the same court where the prisoners were taken, but not the same house—I have known Hennessey for the last six years—he lodged in December with a person named Kennedy, in Parsley Court, right fronting my door—I am a lodger—I have come here to tell you that on the 27th December Hennessey was in my company for an hour about midnight—I also saw Leary run into a house in the court; no one was with him, but the police was after him—for an hour before that Hennessey had been in my company at No. 4—that is the house that Leary ran into—the police came up, but I don't think the door was shut in their faces—I heard a knocking—the light went out because it was knocked over—it was picked up and lit immediately, and then the police came in—the door was only latched—I had been there with Hennessey for an hour before Leary ran in—the police came in, and then the prisoners were taken—I was playing at cards with Hennessey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw Leary get under the bed—I do think that was right—we were in an up stairs room—I did not see Hennessey behind the screen at all—he was pouring out the beer just as the police came in—I did not notice any screen—he was sitting at the table, but whether he got up while the constables were in the room I do not know—I call myself an agricultural labourer—I work at Bexley Heath—I generally go into the country in the fruit season, at other times I do nothing, and get a little subsistence from the parish, and from the industry of my wife—a good many persons were looking at us playing at cards, but they are not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a woollen-draper, and live in Leicester-square. I had a fire at my house on the 30th of November—I lost the articles stated at that time, from the second floor bedroom—the fire did not come up in that direction—people would have an opportunity of going to that room in consequence of the fire—the articles produced are my property.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 115.) I was on duty in Leicester-square about half-past ten o'clock, and saw the prisoner come down stairs from Mr. Delmar's, just after the fire was over—he came out of the private door—as he passed, he said, "I have done all I can, I will go"—he passed on up the street—I saw something bulky in his coat pocket—I walked after him, and asked if he had got any thing—he said, "No, I have not"—I took hold of his coat pocket, and said, "You have something here, what is this?"—he said, "Some things I am going to take to a friend of mine"—I then brought him back to Mr. Delmar's, took him into the room, and found four pairs of stockings in his hat, and a pocket-handkerchief in his coat pocket—I found a tin box, containing the necklace, two brooches, and several small articles, which have been identified by Mr. Delmar.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner wet? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not observe it—MR. Bolton's public-house is nearly opposite Mr. Del<lb></lb>mar's—I stopped the prisoner a few yards from Mr. Bolton's, across the road, not directly opposite, about five or six yards out of the direct line—there were a great many persons coming in and going out of the house, but about a quarter of an hour previous to the prisoner coming out, an order was given by the firemen that no more things should be taken out—I did not see the prisoner go in—I do not know how often he went in, or whether he had been to Bolton's, or whether the glass was there—this is the first time I have heard it—I heard Mr. Goodridge say so yesterday morning—I saw Mr. Goodridge at the house—I did not take him into cus<lb></lb>tody—I asked the prisoner what he had got—he said nothing more, than that he was going to take it to a friend's across the way—I swear that—when I first stopped him I asked if he had got any thing—he was getting through the crowd, toward Lyon-street—I had seen him come down stairs ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before with three bottles in his hand—MR. Goodridge said to him, "Put them down, you will cut your hands"—he put them down on the table—he did not put these things into his pocket and hat in Mr. Goodridge's presence—I did not know him—I did not hear him say he was in the service of Moyes and Barclay, printers, of Castle-street, and had been working for them that day—I do not know that he had the opportunity of taking things twenty times the value of these—I did not go into any of the rooms myself—I was at the door—I only went into one room, where I searched him—I do not know whether it was a parlour or bed-room—it was a small place—there were no drawers about—there were beds about—these stockings have been darned—these have Mr. Delmar's name on them—the prisoner did not tell me he had been assisting at the fire—I did not see the glass removed—some of the things were taken opposite I believe, and I heard that some were taken to Mr. Bolton's.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the house on the night of the 30th of No<lb></lb>vember, where there was a fire—there was a large crowd—a great number of things were taken out, and carried to different persons for safety—I rendered what assistance I could—I saw the prisoner in the upper part of the house several times, and I saw him on the leads over the shop-window afterwards—he was doing all he could to render assistance, so much so, that I thought he belonged to the premises—I took down a large chimney-glass, and handed it to a person very much resembling the prisoner, but I could not swear to him—I desired him to take it to Bolton's public-house, very nearly opposite—I went to Bolton's to ascertain whether it had come there, and saw it in the back parlour—I know of no means of its getting there without the prisoner took it—the last time I saw the prisoner he was helping down with a chest of drawers, and taking them out—I said, "There are orders given by the firemen that no more things should go out," and he took them into the back parlour—he had the opportunity of taking pro<lb></lb>perty to a larger amount than those produced, and when these were found in his hat I heard him distinctly say to the policeman that he was going to take them over the way where he had been taking other things—I had myself sent thousands of pounds' worth of cloth over the way.</p>

            . In October, 1830, I was letter-carrier at Enfield. I remember receiving a letter from Mrs. Jelly that month, with a string round it, perfectly well - I packed the letter with the rest of the packet, and put it in a bag - I tied the bag, and conveyed it safe to Edmonton - I sorted the letters out regularly at Edmonton, and tied them in separate packets, according to what they were - this letter was sent to the chief office in Lombard-street - I heard of a letter being missed in the course of two or three days; when the officer wrote to me respecting it, and I wrote him an answer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have been asked if you received a letter with a string round it - perhaps my friend has called your recollection to it by mentioning that? A. I am always very particular in remarking such letters - I have a perfect recollection of the string - I think it was a red string, but I will not be positive - there was sealingwax on it, and I think it was red wax - in fact, I am positive it was - I have not a shadow of a doubt of it - I have a recollection of such a letter with a string confining it - as to the colour of the wax, I cannot be positive, not to swear to it - as soon as they wrote to me from the office, it brought every thing into my mind - that was in 1830 - my memory has not been refreshed about it since that, till very lately - it had entirely escaped my memory till I came to be asked about it, when the officer wrote to me about it.</p>

               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. Is this the letter you wrote about it? A. (Looking at it) Yes, this is my writing - this brings the transaction to my recollection.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is there any thing more in the letter than your saying you recollect the missing letter? A. I gave no statement in that letter about the string - I recollected about the string at the time I wrote that letter - I could not tell whether it was requisite to mention it in the letter or not - I gave every information I could - I do not think I have got the letter which this is an answer to.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You received a letter about a missing letter? A. Yes - that letter came from the Post-office.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you have a memorandum to enable you to say you were on duty that day? A. Yes - the signing-book, which is here, I have looked at - the riding-boy for that district would bring six bags, and he brought six that day - I know by the memorandum, that I was on duty, and if I had not received the six bags, I should have reported it to the proper officer.</p>

            . I am a letter-carrier in the Postoffice: I have been so about thirteen years. The prisoner was formerly a letter-carrier, and was so on the 1st of October, 1830 - I made this memorandum (looking at it) within the last fortnight - I got it from a book, where he signs in one column, and I in the other - the book is here - (looking at it) these entries are signed by him - I have seen him write many times, and can take on myself to say, he was a letter-carrier in the employ of the General Post-office, on the 1st of October, 1830 - his walk was Finsbury-square - he delivered the twopenny-post letters in Finsbury-square - No. 22, Finsbury-place, was in his walk - if a letter had been sent from Edmonton, about three o'clock in the afternoon, it would come to St. Martin's-le-Grand between five and six o'clock, and would be sent out by the seven o'clock delivery, and should be delivered before eight, or about eight o'clock - it was Nichols's duty to make the delivery at that place that day - we have a regular mode of changing duty, and at seven o'clock at night, he takes Finsbury-place and square, and the right of the City-road - he was my assistant, and I took another part of the walk - here is his own signature to show he was on duty that evening - I am well acquainted with his manner of handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those notes - here is, "John James, John-street, Stepney" - can you say whose handwriting that is? A. That I verily believe to be in the handwriting of Nichols - they are both alike - I believe both to be his handwriting - he left the Post-office on Saturday morning, the 2nd of October, a little before eight o'clock, to make the eight o'clock delivery - that would be over about ten or a little after - he left the Post-office finally on Tuesday, the 5th - he went out with the letters that morning, with the eight o'clock delivery, and never returned - I did not see him again till he was apprehended in September last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He stayed on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and morning of the 5th? A. Yes - the third was Sunday - he did not undergo any examination about this letter in the course of that time, that I know of - we were both called to the desk to give an account who went to the Finsbury-place district at a certain hour - that was an inquiry - that inquiry was made on the Saturday or Monday, I am not positive which.</p>
               <p>Q. Show me the prisoner's handwriting in the book? A. This is it - here is a line with "Finsbury-square walk"- you will find he has written, " R. Nichols."</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him write any thing but his name? A. Yes - there is no writing of his in this book besides his name - I should not be involved in any difficulty by the loss of this letter, that I am aware of, further than an inquiry - I should not have to make any payment on account of the loss - I was not suspended - I underwent an examination at Mr. Peacock's office, after the prisoner left - it was only once - I am the letter-carrier - he was my assistant - I did not appoint him or pay him - I have the stopping of the wages as charge taker - he does not look to me for his wages - I account to the Post-office for the payment of his wages - I do not think he was in debt to the Post-office at that time, as he was on duty - I am not aware that he was threatened to be turned out of the office if he did not make up some payment - I have no recollection of his being in debt at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the two notes, and at his signature in the book - do you mean to say they are both alike? A. It appears to me, there is a great similarity, only one has been done with a pen more worn than the other - my conclusion is not so much from seeing his name in the book, as from other writing of his which I have seen on letters - the writing on the notes is like his ordinary way of writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he left the Post-office, had these notes been seen? A. I am not aware of it - I never saw them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the notes shown to you when you were questioned - before the prisoner went away, did you see the Bank-notes? A. No - I first saw them at Mr. Peacock's office, three or four weeks back.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When was the last time you saw the prisoner write? A. It might be the day he went away - it was about that time - we occasionally see one another write on letters.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. About how long had he been in the service of the Post-office? A. I do not know - he had been my assistant five or six months - I knew him a long time before, in the Post-office, but he did not work with me - while he was my assistant, I saw his handwriting seldom less than three times a day - if any addresses cannot be found, or letters are refused, or the party are gone away, we have to write that on them, and have to get answers to our letters, and write the answers on them - I have frequently seen his writing in that way - I have no doubt the handwriting on these two notes is his handwriting.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Nobody is taken into the Post-office without an inquiry into his character? A. No; very strict inquiry indeed is made.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the Post-office, as inspector of letter-carriers. The prisoner was a letter-carrier, in the employ of the Post-office, on the 1st of October, 1830; his district was Finsbury-square - he was on duty for the evening delivery, on the 1st of October - a letter, put in at Enfield about three o'clock, would be delivered on the same day - on Monday, the 4th of October, I recollect a lady coming to the Post-office to inquire about a letter - I cannot recollect Miss Dorey's features exactly - two persons came - she gave the name of Miss Dorey - she gave me the numbers of the notes - I took them down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160008"></xptr>correctly from what she stated, and have the entry here-(reads) - "A - 10 note, No. 743, dated the 6th of September, 1830; a - 10 note, No. 11, 120; a - 5 note, No. 1848"- the two last are without dates - I questioned the prisoner on the subject on that Monday evening very strictly - that was the first time I mentioned it to him - I told him there had been inquiry for a letter addressed to Finsbury-place, and asked if he had such a letter or not, and what he did with it - he stated positively he had not had such a letter - he would have to take out the eight o'clock delivery next morning, which he did, and he never returned to the Postoffice - he assigned no reason for his absence, and I do not think he returned any letters - he never returned - I have seen him write several times - my business was to examine the directions of letters brought back - I believe the words,"John James, No. 10, John-street, Stepney," on these notes, to be his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is his ordinary mode of writing, is it? A. It is - the letters from Enfield or Edmonton are conveyed by riding-boys - I have not the means of telling who was the riding-boy that day - all letters put in at Enfield or Edmonton would, in the ordinary course, come through the hands of the riding-boy; they would be sealed in a bag, and put into his bag at Enfield - he could have access to them by breaking the seal, which would be observed on his arriving at the office - I cannot tell whether he is now in the employ of the office - I do not know who he was - it is not in my duty - that duty is done in the sorting office - perhaps Simms can tell.</p>

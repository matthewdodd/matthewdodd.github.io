                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Sinclair Puckett, of Rosoman-street, Clerkenwell. On Saturday evening, the 3rd of Feb., I went with my child into the parlour, with a lighted candle, and saw the prisoner standing by the side of the fire-place—I saw his face—he asked if Crawford was there—I screamed out, and he got out of the parlour-door—I followed him to the street-door—it was three or four yards from where he passed me, to the street-door—I had my candle in one hand, and the child in the other—the street-door was shut—he opened it after about two minutes—he was feeling up above the lock—I screamed, and put the candle in his face, which put it out—he escaped—I called "Stop thief," but did not go after him—he jumped off my step into the road, and went towards Lower Rosoman-street—he was brought back by a policeman and the person next door—I saw a black mark on his face, about an inch long, like the snuff of a candle—some one said they thought he got in over the area—he said he had not been there before at all—when he was brought back I missed a silk frock off the screen in the par<lb></lb>lour—I afterwards missed a pair of trowsers and a piece of calico from the back parlour—they were in a bundle which bad not been there before—they were safe half an hour before—when the policeman brought him back, he said, "Please don't give me in charge"—I found some matches in both rooms, and in the front parlour burnt matches, which had been struck, but not lighted—these are the things—they are ours.</p>

                  </hi>. I work in Upper Rosoman-street, next door to the prosecutor. I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and ran out at the street door—I saw the prisoner jump off the steps of the prosecutor's house on to the pavement—I ran after him—he ran nine or ten yards, then fell, and knocked an old lady down at the corner of Rosoman-street—I caught him in Whiskin-street—he said he was not the man—I said I would believe my own eyesight before any one—I did not lose sight of him—I was not above two ox three yards from him the whole time.</p>

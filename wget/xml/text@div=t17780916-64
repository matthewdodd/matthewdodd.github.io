They broke the locks of two doors; one goes out of the cellar into the passage, and the other out of the passage into the tap-room. I lost seven bowls and six gallons of gin out of the bar; the gin was in casks. I heard no noise in the night. The prisoner confessed when he was taken that he went into the yard to get a light, and let in a dog that disturbed them; he confessed the fact to

               <p>I am a Marshalsea-court officer. I apprehended one Mason for robbing one Mr. Price's warehouses in the Borough, and he confessed being concerned with Farmer in this robbery, and told me where the bowls were. Mason was an evidence against Farmer at Guildford; I lodged a detainer against him, but he was discharged. I found the bowls, by the direction of Mason, at one Millan's, who is convicted, and on board the lighters. The prisoner said before the justice, that Mason and he broke the prosecutor's house open, and the prisoner wanted to be admitted an evidence. They both of them confessed it; they said it was done at one o'clock, and that there was 2 dog in the yard.</p>

               <p>I apprehended Mason, and he took me to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160045"></xptr> Farmer's lodgings at Chelsea. Farmer let us in; I found nothing there but a few of their own things. When they were before the justice they began quarrelling which should be admitted an evidence, and both confessed the robbery. One of them (I believe Mason) said it was done at one o'clock; they said there was a dog that disturbed them.</p>

               <p>I did not make any confession; I know nothing of the robbery. I have no witnesses. I hope you will take it into your consideration, these men are officers, and will swear my life away for the bounty; therefore I hope you will not pay any regard to what they have said.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. Why is not the lodger here who was first up? - He is a journeyman; I did not know that he would be wanted.</p>

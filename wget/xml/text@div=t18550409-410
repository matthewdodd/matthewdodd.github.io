                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Kerry, a draper, of Bishopsgate-street; the prisoner was in his employment for about five or six weeks before this occurred; he had been in the employ several times during the illness of our regular porter. On a Wednesday morning in March, about two days before I was examined before the Magistrate, I have no note of the day, we missed some dresses from the warehouse under the shop—they were ladies' summer dresses, composed of silk and woollen, worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Kerry gave information to the police—on the Thursday, the day after, I went with the police to the prisoner's lodging, in Hunt-street, Mile-end Town—Mr. Kerry had sent for him in the morning, and he consented to have his place searched, and we went with him—his place was searched in my presence—I found these five lawn handkerchiefs in a drawer in the room—they are all in one piece—Mr. Kerry's private mark is upon them—I asked the prisoner if he knew that they were there, and he said he knew nothing about them—they are worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the officer found another handkerchief upon the prisoner when he was searched at Mr. Kerry's house—I have compared it with the five, and it has been torn from the same piece—we never tear them,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090013"></xptr>
               <p>we always cut them—this kind of material always tears in the same way, along the thread—the border pattern is the same—there is nothing uncom<lb></lb>mon in that border.</p>

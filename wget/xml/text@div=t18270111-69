I was talking to a person, and saw the prisoners going along - Davidson had the coat on, and was drunk; I thought he was one of our watchmen; I heard the cry of Stop thief! and went up; I saw the prosecutor with the prisoners - I took them- Davidson was certainly drunk, but he made great resistance.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

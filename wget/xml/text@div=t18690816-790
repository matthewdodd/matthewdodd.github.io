                  </hi>. I live at 17, Upper Hill Street, Peckham—on 17th July, about 8.30, I watched the prisoners, in Walworth Road, and saw Lever take something from his pocket, in tissue paper, unwrap it and give it to Brown, who passed it to the man not in custody, who went over to Bernasconi's, a confectioner, in Walworth Road—the prisoners remained on the opposite side—I communicated with a man next door, and followed the prisoners—Brown left the other and went back to the shop—I walked behind and heard him say, <hi rend="italic">"Jot</hi> has put the piece down, and has got away"—the officer secured them—the person I spoke to went into Bernasconi's.</p>

I am a confectioner, of 131, Walworth Road—on 12th July I served a man with a bottle of ginger beer—he gave me a sixpence—I gave him fivepence change, and put it with four other sixpences, in the till—a neighbour came in and made a statement to me—I found a bad sixpence in the till, and gave it to the constable.</p>

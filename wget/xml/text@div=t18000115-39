             sworn. - On Saturday the 28th of December, I had the prisoner in custody, and having heard of this affair before, I went to Mr. Weldale's, and desired the young woman to come down, to see if she knew her, and as soon as she saw her, she immediately said, that was the woman that had taken ten pieces of silver from her.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MUMFORD sworn. - I was with Treadway when he apprehended the prisoner, and I had her in custody, while Treadway went for the young woman; when she came in, she knew her directly.</p>

I never saw the young woman in my life, till I saw her at Bow-street; I get my bread by hard work; I never was brought up to fortune-telling in my life; I go a harvesting, hay-making, and hopping in the summer, and in winter, in making mats, and carrying them about, with toasting-forks and meat-stands.</p>

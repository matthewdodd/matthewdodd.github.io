               <p>When you was before the Justice, was not you asked what cloaths the prisoner had on, at the time the robbery was committed? - I said, I could not rightly tell, I believed it was a snuff coloured coat.</p>

               <p>Court. In the year 1575, there was a message sent from the Star Chamber to the Lord Mayor of London, to know what was the meaning there was so many criminals in Newgate, what answer was sent we do not hear, it is not reported; and they put down two hundred ale houses in London, and an hundred ale houses in Westminster; which in 1575 was a very little place, and the fact was, there was not one criminal in Newgate the next sessions; that you will see in Stowe's account of London.</p>

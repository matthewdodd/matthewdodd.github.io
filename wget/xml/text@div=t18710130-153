                  </hi>. I am a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers—in October last I was looking about for a pair of horses, for riding and driving—my attention was called to this advertisement, in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, on 14th October—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Horses—together or separate. One of the handsomest pair of Brougham, landau, phaeton, or riding geldings in London; six years old, fifteen hands 3in. high, step exceedingly well together, equally good in single harness; colour, a beautiful rich brown, with breeding and sub<lb></lb>stance; good hunters; masters of sixteen stone; one a perfect charger, and carries a lady; owner a private gentleman. Will give a written war<lb></lb>ranty. Allows twenty-three days' trial, and accept a moderate price when approved of. Coachman, 28, King's Mews, South Street, Park Lane, Hyde Park, W.")—In consequence of that advertisement I went to King's Mews, South Street, Park Lane, on that same day, Friday, 14th October—I saw the prisoner Wilson in the mews—he gave the name of Davis—it was between 12 and I o'clock in the day when I went there—I asked Wilson where 28, King's Mews was, and then I said I had come for some horses that were referred to in this advertisement—I had the advertisement with me, which I had cut out of the paper—he took me to the stable, opened it, and said those were the horses referred to—there was nobody else in the stable besides Wilson then—I went in and looked at the hones—in a few minutes afterwards the prisoner Milton came in, and Wilson introduced me to him, saying "This is the owner of the horses "—I told Milton I had come in answer to that advertisement, and should like to look at the horses, upon which he showed me the horses in the stable, and asked me if I would like to see them come out—I said "Yes"—they were taken out suc<lb></lb>cessively, into the mews, for my inspection—Wilson took them out—I had some conversation with Milton as to what the horses had been doing—he said they had lately come up from the country, and that he wished to dis<lb></lb>pose of the horses, on account of the death of his father, one of the firm of Scott &amp; Co., the well-known bankers—at the time Milton made that</p>

               <p>statement, Wilson was in the stable; he had just brought one of the horses in—Milton said his father had lately died, and his mother and he wished to dispose of the horses on account of that death—I asked the price of the horses—he said 100 guineas—he said I could take them home on trial, and he urged me to do so, for twenty-eight days, saying he would give a written warrant ry with them, and that if the horses were not approved of before the end of that time, the money would be returned—this is the warrantry he produced; my name and the date were not then filled in. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Received of Mr. J. J. Curling the sum of 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for my pair of geldings, which I warrant sound, six years old, and free from vice; quiet in double and single harness, and to ride; good hunters, and quiet to carry ladies. If the pur<lb></lb>chaser should not approve of the horses within twenty-eight days, he has the option to return the horses to me, and I agree to return the purchase-money in full" Signed, "Alfred J. Scott; October 14th, 1870.") Milton was about to insert my name; there was some difficulty about spelling the name, and I wrote it for him—I then gave him a cheque for the amount—he produced pen and ink—I produced a blank cheque, which I always kept in my pocket—I was about to cross the cheque, when Milton requested me not to do so, as he wished to get the money immediately—in consequence of that request I did not cross the cheque—it was payable to bearer by my bankers, Cox &amp; Co., of Craig's Court—I should say I was there altogether about twenty minutes—I requested that the horses might be sent home by 3 o'clock that afternoon, to my house, 10, Stanhope Gardens—the horses came a little before 3 o'clock—I had given directions to my coachman to take them to some stables that I had engaged, in the Brompton Road, as my own stables were not ready—I went to the stables in the Brompton Road, that afternoon, for the purpose of trying the horses—they were put into a break; my coachman went out in the break with me, and some man stood behind, one of the persons from the livery stable—I drove the horses myself—I had considerable difficulty to begin with, in getting them to start at all; my coachman tried first, and failed, and then I tried; after getting them to start they started off at a good round canter, for a little distance; I then drove them round by the South Kensington Station, about half-a-mile, and before I had gone that distance one of them <hi rend="italic">roared</hi> very much; I then just drove round to my house, a distance of about three-quarters of a mile altogether—they were entirely unfit for my purpose, or rather one horse was unfit, being an evident <hi rend="italic">roarer</hi>, and that spoilt the pair—being dissatisfied with them I sent them back to the stables, and next morning I went to South Street—I did not see either of the prisoners there—I left a note for the coachman, Wilson or Davis, requesting him to come and take the horses away, and on the next evening, about 8 o'clock, Wilson came, with another man—he was shown into my study—he said that Mr. Scott would be very sorry that the horses did not suit me, and that he would take them away—I requested that a receipt might be given for the horses, which I wrote out, and requested him to sign—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was unable to write, and I wrote his name, and he put his mark—he gave me the name of Thomas Davis. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "15th October, 1870. Received from Mr. Curling, of 10, Stanhope Gardens, two horses, bay and brown geldings, the property of Mr. Scott, of 20, Aberdeen Place, Maida Hill; also their clothing. Thomas Davis, X his mark.") Milton had told me that he had a house close to there; but he and his mother were now living in lodgings, at 20, Aberdeen Place, Maida Hill—the horses were taken</p>

               <p>away from the stables—I went to 20, Aberdeen Place, on the Saturday afternoon before this interview with Wilson; failing to find the coachman at the mews, I drove straight there, being anxious to settle the question at once—I inquired for Mr. Scott, but was not able to see him—in consequence of that I wrote a letter on that same Saturday evening, and received this in answer. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Liverpool, October 20th, 1870. Sir,—I am sorry to hear the horses did not meet with your approbation, as I am compelled to remain here with my mother, who is dangerously ill. In all probability I shall return on the 25th, and will call on you the following day and fulfil my agreement with you by placing 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at your bankers, to your credit. Trusting this arrangement will not inconvenience you, I am yours, A. J. Scott.") I did not have the 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. placed to my credit, nor have I ever received any amount—I wrote again, and received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Liverpool, November 2nd, 1870. Sir,—I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 24th ultimo. I shall return to town on the 14th or 15th of this month, and should prefer to pay you then, rather than forward my cheque in a letter. However, if this arrangement should greatly incon<lb></lb>venience you, please to inform me per return, and I will adopt some other plan. Yours, A. Scott.") I have never received a penny of the money—I gave the cheque to the prisoner, believing his statement that he was a gentleman, and the son of the late well-known banker, Mr. Scott—it was upon that representation that I parted with the cheque—finding I could not get the money, I was advised, in the beginning of January, to go to South Street again—I went disguised, with whiskers and moustache—I saw both the prisoners there—I am certain they are the same men that I had seen there on 14th October—a statement was made by the prisoner's Counsel before the Magistrate; other than that, I have no doubt whatever that they are the men.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. As far as I could judge, one of the horses was sound; I did not examine him carefully—if sold alone, he might have been worth 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I bought them as a pair—the other was a <hi rend="italic">roarer;</hi> I believe <hi rend="italic">roarers</hi> are sometimes very good horses in other respects—the interview on the 14th lasted about twenty minutes, it took place partly in the yard, and partly in the stable—I think there was another man in the mews at the time, there was nobody else in our party—there is a row of stables there—it was between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day; I am sure about the time, it was as near 12.30 as possible; I left the War Office at 12 o'clock that day, and went straight up there—I was not talking to anybody else in the yard besides these two men, nor in the stables; I went the wrong way in the mews, at first, and I had to ask my way—I had never seen the men before—when I went on 6th January, and saw Milton there, he did not represent himself as Scott, but as Milton—he gave me some warranties, signed "Milton," not with his address—I went through the form, exactly as I did before, of asking for the horses, and asking for a warranty—I went to see what warranty would be produced, and he showed me a warranty signed "Milton"—I think on some, "Milton's Livery Stables" was on the top, and on some not; I think the warranty shown me was without that, but I cannot speak positively as to that—the letters from Liverpool, and the warranty of 14th October, are evidently in the same handwriting.</p>

I live at Finchley—Milton was in my service as coachman—he came about June last, and continued till Christmas—he left on account of losing his eyesight—I am in the habit of driving into town almost every day, to my place of business at King's Cross—I generally leave home between 11 and 12 o'clock, and arrive at King's Cross about 12 or 1 o'clock—I believe in October I came to town in my carriage every day, or nearly so—the prisoner drove me in—(<hi rend="italic">referring to a book</hi>) on looking at this book I am able to say positively that, on 14th October, Milton drove me in; at least, that I was there—nobody else ever drove me in—I believe I was always driven in in October—I believe I drove in on the 14th—after arriving in town, Milton's ordinary duty was to take his horses out and groom them, and clean the carriage, and he dared not leave the place, because I might go home at 2.30 or 3, or 4, 5, or 6 o'clock—he was bound to remain on the spot to receive his orders—I never found him absent when I required him—he wore a livery—I could not say what time I left town on the 14th.</p>

I am gardener to Mr. Thorley, at Finchley—Milton was coachman there from June to December—I keep the keys of the two gates—I remember on 14th October Mr. Thorley left in his carriage, about 12 o'clock—Milton drove him, and he was home about 7 o'clock, or a little after—I know it was the 14th, because I marked it down—I lost two pigs that day—it was on a Friday—Milton was <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> my fellow-servant about the pigs, and saying he would get the <hi rend="italic">sack</hi> on the morrow, Saturday—the pigs were lost about 4 o'clock on the Friday; at least that was when we found it out—my under-man had orders to shut them up at a certain time, and he came to me about 4 o'clock, saying he could not find them—we told Milton about it, as he was cleaning his horses or harness—Mr. Thorley drove up nearly every day in October, except Sunday, and Milton drove him—it was generally about the same hour, within ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—he generally returned about 7 o'clock; sometimes about 6 o'clock—he did not go by rail during that month—since that time he has gone; since it has been frosty, and the coachman has left; but he did not go by rail before October; if he did it was very rarely.</p>

I live at 9, Curtain Road, Shoreditch—I get my living by clipping horses, in the winter, and I travel on the Continent, or any part of England, in the summer time—I know Mr. Curling—on 14th October I was in the King's Head Mews—I was in the stable, just finishing clipping a black horse—the man who had the stable then was named Davis—there were two horses in the stable—the other was a dark bay—Mr. Gulling asked me whether there was a pair of horses on sale—I told him there was, and pushed the door open, and showed him the horses—he looked at them, and asked me where the coachman was—I told him I had not seen the man that day—that was Davis—while he was looking at the horses a very short gentleman came up—I don't think I should know his name—he came and spoke to Mr. Curling—they had a communication together, and they asked me to pull the horse out, and I did so—I pulled the cloths off them, and ran them up and down the yard, and Mr. Curling looked at them—I think the other gentleman's name was Scott—I am not certain—Mr. Curling purchased them, and I saw him give the other a paper, and he gave him another paper—Mr. Curling asked me whether I could take the horse to his place, in some sort of gardens, No. 10, I think it was—I did so, about 3 o'clock—I saw a servant standing on the step at the door, and Mr. Curling came out to me—he said "Wait a minute"—and he then went back again into the house and fetched me two 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces, to pay me for bringing the horses there—I told him the horses were very fresh, and it would be desirable for him to put them into a break previous to putting them into his chaise—he told me to take them to the back part of the house, and tell the coachman to put the harness on—I did so—the next day I saw Davis, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he said to me I went with him to Mr. Curling's place, about 4 o'clock—he was not at home, and we went again about 6 o'clock—I saw him there—Davis and Mr. Curling went down to the bottom of the passage, into a little room—I remained there a few minutes, and afterwards Mr. Curling and Davis came out, and Mr. Curling went into another room on the left-hand side—Davis afterwards came out, and said "The gentleman has given me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it, to pay me for waiting—I then went to the stables, and fetched the horses from the place where I had taken them to—during the whole of that time Wilson was not in the mews at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know Milton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have known him for the last fortnight; I never saw him before—he was not there on 14th October.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was never in Milton's father's employment—I know Mr. Fyfield, who keeps the "Two Brewers"—I did not clip horses for the Miltous—I have not been long in King's Mews, only backwards and for<lb></lb>wards, to do a horse—I am not employed at the mews in Brick Street; I have been there to clip a horse—I never clipped a horse for Milton, or for Davis, or Gray, or Bullock, or Fyfield—the first I knew of the prisoner</p>

               <p>Milton was in the last fortnight—I don't know anything of his father at all—I have seen his brother, but I know nothing of him; I should know him if I were to see him—I have seen him only now and then, once within a fortnight or three weeks, I daresay—I will undertake to swear that I am the man that trotted the horses up and down for Mr. Curling, at the request of the man who gave the name, of Scott—I believe I was in the stable when Scott made the representation to Mr. Curling—Milton was not present when the horses were sold to Mr. Curling, it was his brother, I believe—it was not the prisoner, it was his brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had seen his brother before October, but only just for about two days—I believe it was he who represented himself as Scott; I am sure it was not the prisoner—I had never seen the brother before, to my knowledge—I have seen him since; I saw him about three weeks ago, at King's Cress.</p>

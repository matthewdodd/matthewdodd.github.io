I went out about ten minutes before nine o'clock, after putting the plate safe away, and returned about half-past nine o'clock. I had told him not to go out whilst I was out.

            . I am groom to Mr. Chitty. I came in about half-past eight o'clock. When the butler went out, the prisoner sat by me in the kitchen; after that, he left the kitchen and shut the door - I did not see him again, nor hear him go out. Nobody came to the house, until the butler returned; I let him in. I knew the prisoner was out, as the parlour bell rang half an hour after the butler went out, and the maid answered it. No friend of the butler's was in the kitchen.</p>

            . I am a police officer of Gloucester. In consequence of a description in the newspaper, I apprehended the prisoner at the Crown, at Gloucester. I found his waistcoat and one cotton jacket at his lodgings; and he had his hat on. I found a coat and jacket, at the pawnbrokers; there are stiches on the shoulder of the coat, which appeared as though the epaulette had been taken off. He told me, as we came up on the coach, that he heard the bell ring: went to the door, and saw a girl whom he knew, he took her to the butler's pantry, and asked her to have something to drink - that he went across the square, and fetched a pot of porter - when he returned, she was gone, and the plate missing. He went to look after her, and not finding her, he was afraid to return.</p>

             re-examined. The clothes look like the same that he had - the shoulder of the coat has marks of the epaulette. When he left, he had his black livery on; the hat has the same maker's name in it, and is like his. I heard no bell ring, nor any girl come down. I should, if it had happened. We found no porter pot about the pantry. I never saw him after he left the kitchen - he then had his black livery on. I must have heard the bell ring, as it rings just over the kitchen door. A person can go into the pantry without going through the kitchen. He did not have two jackets on.</p>

             re-examined. The clothes are the exact pattern and colour; I believe the coat to be the same, and the hat - the jackets are only worn in the morning; the waistcoat is what he wore with the black coat. I found no porter pot about; he was washing up the tea things when I went out - the plate was worth above 50 l.; and the clothes were worth 9 l. when they were stolen, and the hat 23 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The butler said he was going out; there came a ring at the bell, which I answered. I found it was a woman whom I had seen at a public-house, and who had told me she was a soldier's wife, and asked if I wanted any one to wash for me? I had told her where I lived, and said she might call; she called that evening - I took her into the pantry, and took a jug to get her the porter, from the Bedford Arms. When I returned, I found the door wide open and she gone: I went in pursuit, and was afraid to return. The coachman swears, that the bell did not ring - it is well known, there is a hell which must ring every time any one goes out; it rung when I went out, and when the woman came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bishop's Hope, Yorkshire, and have rooms at 18, Davies Street, Berkeley Square—in June last the prisoner came to me there, and said she wanted to get a girl, Mary Johnson, niece of a farmer at Bishop's Hope, into the Home for Incurables at Brompton, and asked me if I would help her to do so—she said she had enough money to get her there, but required 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the outfit—I gave her a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and</p>

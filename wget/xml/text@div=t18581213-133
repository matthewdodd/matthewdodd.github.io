I live at 27, Princes-street, Chelsea. 2, Elizabeth street, Chelsea, is my sister's house, it was to let in June last, and the prisoner applied to me to become the tenant—he said that his name was Alfred Smith, and that he was a house decorator—he referred to his landlord, Mr. Badgery, a builder of Church-street, Chelsea, in a house of whose he was living in Wellington-place—I called on Mr. Badgery, who said he had been a tenant of his for three years, and he had only to write for his money and he had it—in consequence of what he stated, I let the prisoner the house—I could find no such place as 1, Wellington-place, Clapham—I saw the postman, and asked him if there was such a place, he said, "No"—I am sure the prisoner said Wellington-<hi rend="italic">place</hi>, he wrote it down—the prisoner signed this memorandum, and took the counterpart away with him—since the rent became due, I called at Mr. Badgery's and the house was shut up.</p>

I live at 27, Bryanston-street, Portman-square, and am the owner of the house—I am in the habit of letting it furnished—I was desirous of letting it in March last and advertised it—the prisoner called on me about the middle of March, and said that his name was Cruse, and that he was an agent—he gave me a card similar to this—"A. Cruse, 7, Maddox-street, Regent-street"—he asked the rent of the house, I said that it was 250 guineas a year—he said that he would give 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he had a gentleman who the house would suit, a Mr. Davis, M.P., an indepen<lb></lb>dent gentleman in Cambridgeshire,</p>

               <p>who was stopping at the Ship hotel, and was very anxious to get the house; that he had estates in Cambridgeshire, and a great deal of property in London; that he had known him a number of years, and had taken several houses for him, one in Cavendish-square, and and another in Albany-street, Regent's-park—he said that he would send for Mr. Davis; and on the next afternoon, at 3 o'clock, Mr. Davis came alone; he viewed the house, and said that he liked it very much; that he left the house business entirely to his agent—they met one evening at 9 o'clock to draw up an agreement—Mr. Cruse drew it up in the drawing room, and I signed it—it was written on Mr. Cruse's paper, and he took it away, saying that he would get it stamped at Somerset House, I have never seen it since—the prisoner came on 30th March, that is the day that the tenancy was to commence—Davis also came, and the agent came and took the inventory; he called himself Cruse's agent, his clerk—I gave him up the key, but they never got possession—I got possession by the assistance of the police some time after; I never got the keys—I left the house that night, leaving the prisoner there—I found on the night following that the house was deserted—it was agreed that Cruse was to pay me three months' rent in advance, and before I left the house he said that he had some of Davis's rents to collect, and he would pay me tomorrow morning, at 13, Quebec street, at 11 o'clock—I went there and waited all day, and he never came—I had agreed to pay him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent commission as a house agent—he never claimed that—I saw him in custody months and months afterwards.</p>

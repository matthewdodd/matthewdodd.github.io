                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the George, Queen Ann-street, Mary<lb></lb>lebone. On Saturday evening, 4th Jan., the prisoner came in, between four and five o'clock, for a bottle of pale brandy—I served him; it came to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he gave me a sovereign; I weighed it; it was good; I gave him a half-sovereign, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., charging 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the bottle—he asked the price of the brandy; I said, "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" he said he was only to give 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, and he said he would go back, and see if it would do—I returned him the sovereign, and took up the change—he took the sovereign into his hand; he then put a sovereign down again, and said he would take the change, and if the brandy did not do, he would return it if I would return him the money—I took the second sovereign up, and weighed it; it was a great deal lighter—I said, "This is not the one you gave me first"—I am sure it was not the same—the change was at that time on the counter; I took it up, told him to wait a moment, and took the sovereign to Mr. Betts, who keeps a silversmith's shop—I could go there without coming out of doors—while I was there I saw the prisoner pass by—I pointed him out, and Mr. Betts went and brought him back; an officer was sent for; he was taken into custody—I gave the officer the sovereign that the prisoner put down the second time.</p>

            . I am an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present at the searching of this woman's box in the garret in the house. - A. I was; she unlocked the box herself; in the box at Mr. Newberry's house were two pieces of cambric muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there a great quantity of articles in the box belonging to the prisoner. - A. Yes, it was full of clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present at the time these things were found. - A. Yes; and the time Mrs. Newberry claimed it, she said they were her own property, that she had bought them five or six years before. I had a search warrant to search a room No. 96, Charlotte place, Rathbone place, Mr. Sutton keeps the house; the prisoner had a box there. I found in that box two pieces of cotton velvet; Mrs. Newberry was with me, she claimed these; the prisoner was present, she said she had these about two years, she bought them for a bonnet or a spencer; they were taken to Mr. Newberry's house to match with the piece he had at his house; it is a fawn colour, it seemed to match in colour, and as near as possible it could do where it was cut off the piece.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, it appeared so when put together; the two pieces formed one piece. - A. Yes, as near as I could tell.</p>
               <p>Q.to prosecutor. First look at these two pieces of velvet - what is the quantity of them. - A. About three yards and a quarter the two pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether it is yours or not. - A. I compared it with what I have in my pocket, they are exactly alike in colour, I have the piece here; I laid them strait; it matched as to form or shape to that it had been cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. That is as you suppose. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the cambric muslin. - A. I believe they are mine, I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel; called five witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

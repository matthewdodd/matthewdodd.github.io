                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Colls and Sons, builders—they employ about 1,000 men, and are engaged on some buildings in Great Eastern Street, Shoreditch—I employed the prisoner about June—he is fairly skilled in making staircases—his wages were 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per hour-<lb></lb>the piece-work arrangement was for him to have, I think, 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for preparing and fixing stairs—the materials were Colls's—he worked on our pr mises, and had men under him—he engaged workmen subject to the general fore<lb></lb>man's supervision—that arrangement was put an end to by his overdrawing—the arrangement was then for him to go on day-work, and finish them as cheaply as he could—he was to draw 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour for himself, and whatever he paid the men we would pay him—the foreman had said to him, "You have made a pretty mess of this; you have considerably overdrawn; how<lb></lb>ever, you can go on day-work if you like"—he said, "I hope you will let me pay the men as usual, because I think I can get the work done cheaper"—I said "Yes"—it was early in September when piece-work was changed to day-work, and from that time it was usual for Jemmett and Taylor them<lb></lb>selves to make the return on the time-sheet, and for Hickey to make his return on his time-sheet—Mr. Devonport vouches the time-sheet at the yard, and Mr. Tripp at Great Eastern Street—Mr. Tripp is foreman at the job; his duty is to write his name on the time-sheet and and return it to our offices—that goes to the principal office at Camberwell, where the pay-sheets are made out in conformity with the time-sheets made out by Tripp, and then I send cash down to pay—from September Jemmett, Taylor, and Hickey were paid four weeks at Great Eastern Street and one at the yard, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>—I know Hickey's writing—I did not know that he was putting in the figure 9 on Jemmett and Taylor's time-sheet—T. 1 is Taylor's time-sheet and J. 1 is Jemmett's—C. H. 1 is the pay-sheet for the week ending 4th October,</p>

               <p>to which these time-sheets refer—T. 1 shows 49 hours at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I find on the pay-sheet Taylor's name for 49 hours and Jemmett's time 47 hours at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he was paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on two occasions at the yard—T. 2 is Taylor's time-sheet for the week ending 11th October, and J. 2 is Jemmett's—C. H. 2 is the pay-sheet for that week; Taylor is there carried out 47 hours at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per hour; that exactly accords with the time in the rate-book—Jemmett is down in the pay-sheet for 52 1/2 hours at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2., exactly as repre<lb></lb>sented on the sheet—T. 3 is Taylor's time-sheet and J. 3 is Jemmett's for 18th October, and C.

"—he said, "Good God, Mr. Hamilton, you would never do that! "—I said, "I shall, indeed, and there is the man in blue "—I had a policeman waiting—I asked Jemmett and Taylor in Hickey's presence what he was paying them—they both said 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour—I showed Taylor Hickey's bill for 29th October, and said "Is that figure 8 on Tuesday your writing? "—he said that it was not, and that he had only charged 3 1/2 hours—Jemmett said that he had only charged 4 hours—Hickey said that he would take the responsibility from the men—he had no authority to charge a higher rate than he actually paid, and the printed table with the rate on it distinctly shows that he knew he had no right to put his figures on Jemmett's or Taylor's paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have known him since June, when he came to ask for work—he produced a letter, which purports to come from an architect, but I find it is only from his clerk, Mr. Dudley—I have not heard that the archi<lb></lb>tect was ill—Hickey entered into a verbal contract to do the stairs for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was obliged to employ his own men, and to draw money on account from time to time—he had another contract on at the same time for our firm at High Street, Shoreditch—that was for stairs—I do not think there was an agreement in writing at first for that (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">here put in the agree<lb></lb>ment</hi>)—he had the superintendence of the men who fixed the stairs—Tripp had the daily superintendence of them, but the actual work was done by Hickey—this was the only piece-work in the shop—if Hickey had bolted with money which he had drawn on account, I should have considered myself bound to pay Jemmett and Taylor for the credit of the firm—I should never let any work man go without his wages—I should have been bound to pay the men if Hickey had bolted with the money we had advanced, because his contract had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180075"></xptr>
               <p>expired—in course of time the stairs wanted alteration; from somebody's blunder they had to be converted from <hi rend="italic">dog-leg</hi> to <hi rend="italic">well-hole</hi> stairs, which caused expense—the contract of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not anything like pay for the stairs when they were completed—when that contract was finished and a new arrangement entered into, Hickey was still to pay the men who worked under him—Jemmett and Taylor were not skilled men—Hickey did not ask me to allow him to employ his own men on his own terms and draw their wages and pay them what he liked; he simply requested me to let him pay them—they were under his control subject to the approval of Mr. Devonport—that was the only piece-work in our shop—those were not the only men Hickey had, he had others occasionally—he was looked upon, at his request, as the sub-contractor for that particular department of the stairs—it is not an everyday occurrence in jobs like this for a sub-contractor to employ men, draw money, and charge 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour more than he actually pays them—I know Mr. Moore, he is an architect and surveyor, who has been more than 40 years in the trade—I do not know Mr. Quinn, a builder, or Mr. Pell—if a sub-contractor employs men and pays them 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour, drawing 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from his employer, it is a fraud—although Hickey took the full responsibility upon himself, he denied making the alteration from 3 1/2 and 4 1/4 to 8—he kept a tally in his book—Jemmett and Taylor returned 3 1/2 and 4 hours, and that was sanctioned by Tripp—if Hickey was not there he could know by applying to Tripp how long the men worked—Tripp was there the whole day—there were 21 men on the premises that week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. This is the paper with reference to the stairs at High Street, Shoreditch: "To preparing and fixing four flights of stairs 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Michael Hickey"—that was to do the work, not for the materials—I do not think there is a memorandum for the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. job—this is piece work—we did not permit him to devote his time and energies to any other master—he does not keep a shop or carry on any business—I could direct him to go to work where I pleased—I could discharge Jemmett or Taylor; I always reserved the right to discharge any man—I have never heard till to-day of a superior workman charging a fictitious amount with the sanction of his employer for the wages of the men employed—he said nothing to me about being allowed to do so, he was to receive 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour and we were to pay only the exact amount he paid his men—that was said in words, with a caution that as there had been so much robbery going on, we should prosecute any man who did other<lb></lb>wise—I have never known of papers being falsified with the master's consent, and it would have been quite impossible for him to have done it if Tripp had sent the papers in—I do not know Hickey's writing sufficiently to say that this "9" is his—Tripp has to check the time of every man on the work, going in and coming out—he endorses the documents—we do not require any signature where the word "Yard" is, because there is no foreman at the yard, but on the Great Eastern job, where Tripp was foreman, he signed and he vouches the pay sheets as well there.</p>

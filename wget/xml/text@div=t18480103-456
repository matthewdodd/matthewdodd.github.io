                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the issue department in the Bank of England. On 29th July I received these four bank notes, and the letter marked "c," from Mr. Marshall, by the porter—I was afterwards sent for into Mr. Marshall's room, and saw him on the subject—I had the notes with me—I saw the boy Walker.(<hi rend="italic">The notes being read, were "No. N.

                  </hi>. I live with my father, a matter carpenter, at Wood-street, Westminster—I am between thirteen and fourteen years old. One day in July I was near the Coach and Horses public-house, in our neighbourhood, kept by Mr. Glanville—it was the election day, and that was the meeting—room—whilst I was standing there, the prisoner came and asked me whether I would go to the Bank for him to take a letter—I said I would—he said, if I met him in five or ten minutes, at 3, Smith-square, he would give it me—I afterwards went, and saw him standing against a post in Smith-square—he give me a letter, and told me to take it straight to the Bank, and they would give me some money, which I was to bring to him at the Committee-room, and he would pay me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went directly, and delivered the letter at the Bank—I did not see it opened—they did not give me any money—they kept me there about half an hour, asked me where I lived, and then told me to go and tell the man to come himself—as I returned, I met the prisoner in St. Paul's Churchyard, coming towards the Bank—he asked me if I had got the money—I told him that they said he was to come himself—he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and told me to go home—I went home, and he went towards the Bank—I did not see him again till I went to the Post-office, one day, a good while after—I do not remember the day—it was the third time I went to the General Post—office—I went into the solicitor's room—there were five persons there, besides me and Mr. Mullens—I knew the prisoner at once when I saw him—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a charge-taker at the Post-office at Kensing<lb></lb>ton. In consequence of directions, I made inquiries to find if a person named Headlow lived at Spring-cottage, Kensington—I found there was no such place or person—letters intended for Kennington frequently come to Ken<lb></lb>sington—I remember one letter addressed. "Mr. Headlow, Spring-cottage, Kensington," passed through my hands in July last, and I believe that two did, but I cannot say positively as to two—those that passed through my hands I returned to London.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter-carriers at the Post-office for the London district. Letters addressed "Kensington" are often missorted to "Kennington," and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>—if letters are returned to the General Post-office from Kensington, in consequence of the parties to whom they are addressed not being found, they are sent to Kennington for trial-if a letter was addressed to Kensington on 23rd July, and returned to the Post-office in consequence of the party not being found, it is possible that it would go to the Kennington district the same night, but certainly the next morning—it would certainly find its way to Kennington before the 27th—I believe the 23rd July was on Friday—the Sunday intervening, it would make it Monday 26th—if a letter sent on 27th went through the same process it should reach Kennington before 29th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the superior charge-taker at the Newington Branch-office<lb></lb>that includes Kennington. The prisoner has been employed there as a letter-carrier and sorter upwards of five years—he delievers letters in the Kennington-road, and other places about there—I have frequently seen him write, and am acquainted with his writing—if a letter were mis<lb></lb>directed to Kensington and sent to Kennington, it would come through his hands at any time when he was on duty—he is relieved at the two o'clock turn in the day—I have not our book here; but I can say, from an extract I made, that he was on duty the whole of July, with the exception of the 7th—I firmly believe these three letters marked "a, b, and c" to be his writing—letters directed to North Britain occasionally come to Brixton<lb></lb>North Brixton is part of the Kennington district—I firmly believe this check, with the exception of the signature, to be the prisoner's writing—I cannot speak as to the signature.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184801030057"></xptr>
               <p>that kind of thing—I have seen him write "Not known in Princess<lb></lb>square, Kennington," or "Not known in the Kennington-road"—there is a particular style about the M's and N's—I may have seen those letters more frequently than others—these figures are similar to his—I have repeatedly seen him write figures when signing the book—I feel satisfied that these letters are his writing, the style is exactly the same as the check—I am equally satisfied of them—I have no doubt about one more than the other—the check is written in rather a more slovenly hand than the letters—there is a peculiarity about these letters in the words "Kensington," and "Bank of England," which occurs in two or three place—they are just his style—I have seen him write similar to both—I consider them both to be his natural writing—the book would show what time he left on the 29th—he was only off once in July, and I am confident that was the 7th—while the election is going on in the district there is always a great deal more letter work—on a bust day he would have from half-past eleven or twelve to half-past four to himself—when the election was going on in our district the men were kept on till two—that was not the day of the Westminster election—the Lambeth election was going on then—that certainly affects us.</p>

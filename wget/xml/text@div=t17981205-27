On the 26th of October I sent ten pair of boots to this garret, and on the 10th of November following, a person came to me one Saturday evening, to know in what manner I marked my boots; I told him, I marked them with the initials of my name; in consequence of his information, I went with him to his house, where the boots were, his name is Supple; when I came there, I found four pair, all of them marked with my initials; he then produced me some more boots that he had bought of the same man a fortnight before, in all six pair; I found three pair in Monmouth-street, but that man is not here; I found three more pair in Broad-street, St. Giles's on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - A. Yes, he worked for me in the back garret at that time.</p>
               <p>- SUPPLE sworn. - I am a shoe-maker: On a Saturday night, about a month ago, I did not take an account of the day of the months, I bought three pair of boots of the prisoner; about a fortnight intervening, he came with four pair more on a Saturday evening; when I came to look over the boots, I found some letters upon the straps, which, upon looking at, I found to be B F; I then suspected they were Mr. Ford's; I sent to know his initials; he came down in consequence of it, and claimed them to be his; I had sold one pair of them; I shewed him in all six pair; I have had them from that time to this.(Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the boots you received from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give you any account of them at all? - A. He told me had bought them at Knightsbridge, that he got a small trifle by them, and I ought to have given him something more for them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a shoemaker, No. 47, Broad-street, St. Giles's; the prisoner brought me three pair of whole boots on Saturday the 10th, I think, of last month; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050039"></xptr>bought them of him; he told me he had carried them a great way, and had only got six-pence profit by them. On the Monday after Mr. Ford called upon me, and I told him I had bought such things; they had the initials of B F upon them, and Mr. Ford claimed them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ford. I missed fifteen pair, there were only four dozen and nine left out of six dozen; they are all second hand boots; these are all mine, I have my initials on them.</p>
               <p>Q. This property was found at the distance of about a fortnight after you had put your initials upon the boots - had you sold any of them? - A. No, I had never marked any till I had marked that six dozen; I had not sold any that I had marked.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner worked for you? - A. About three months.(Rogers produces three pair of boots.)</p>
               <p>Ford. These are marked in the same way.</p>

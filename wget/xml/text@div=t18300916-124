            . I am carman to Mr. Weston. This bill is my account for the week, ending the 28th of August last, and ought to have been paid to me that day; the prisoner was in the habit of calling on me on Saturday night to settle, but if I was out or engaged I used to go to him on the wharf on Monday morning, and get it; he did not pay this bill that Saturday - I went on the Monday to the factory, and asked him for it; he said he had unfortunately lost the money in coming home, but he would make it up in the course of the day; I said I wanted the money to make up a bill, I was a man with a family as well as he was, and I made up my accounts on Saturday; I went to him again on the Tuesday, and he said he would go out and get the money, for he had lent it to a friend - he was then sober; when I first asked him, I said I must be under the necessity of going down to Earl-street - he went out, as he said, to get the money, and came back drunk without it.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE to MR. WESTON. Q. How long had he been in your service? A. About two years, and conducted himself very well; he had put down the 2l. 6s. 3d. in his book to see what he should want, and I gave him the two sovereigns.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell him to pay Hudd that night? A. Yes; I saw him again on the next Saturday - I was out of town that week; he has never yet paid me the money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

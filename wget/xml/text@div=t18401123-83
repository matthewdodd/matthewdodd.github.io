                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 156.) On the 17th of No<lb></lb>vember I saw Wells with a load of clover-hay on the Uxbridge-road, in the precinct of Norwood—I stopped him, got on the wagon, and found a quantity of corn and two trusses of hay extra, which was not bound in with the load—I put a quantity of tickets into each truss—I merely got up, as if to ride, and he did not see me do it—I got down, and dressed myself in private clothes—I afterwards went to the Coach and Horses public-house—the prisoner stopped there and baited his horses outside—I</p>

               <p>saw him take one truss of hay from the load, carry it to the steps of the loft, and saw Smith the ostler receive it from him at the top of the ladder—I staid there till Wells put his horses to, and went on the road—I then went and stopped him, and asked what quantity of hay he had on his load—he said, "All that I am allowed by my master"—I said, "I am a po<lb></lb>liceman, and insist on knowing what you have"—I found only part of the truss I had put the tickets in—I asked what he had done with what he had on the load, previous to coming to the Coach and Horses—he said that was all he had which was on the load—I said, "Do you remember a person getting up on the road?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Well, I have seen you leave a truss at the public-house"—he denied it—I took him back to the house, and met Smith, and said, "Where is the truss of hay you received from this man?"—he said he had not received any from any body whatever—I said, "I am a policeman, and demand the key of your loft, and will show you where it is"—he denied it—I at last got the key, went into the loft, and picked out the truss, with others, with my tickets in it, with my name and number on them—I brought it down, and Smith said, "You are under a great mistake in bringing Wells back, for he is master of the team, the wagon, and the whole concern"—Wells heard it, and did not deny what he said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Wells.</hi> I put the truss in the loft, and the corn and chaff with it, ready for my coming back next night, instead of taking it to London—I left it under the ostler's care—I fed the horses with part of the other truss.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Smith.</hi> He left the truss with me as he always did, against his coming back from London—he asked where he should put his hay and corn, I said, "Put it in the loft, where you always do;" when the policeman came back, he brought the hay down—I said, "Why not take the corn and chaff and all of it together?"—he said, "No, the truss of hay is enough for me." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He did not say a word of the kind, and I saw no corn or chaff taken up—there was corn and chaff, on the top of the wagon, when I examined it first, but I found none in the loft—the pri<lb></lb>soner's master is too ill to attend here.</p>

I am a hay binder—I know Joseph Flaxman of Chetham—I bind hay for Mr. Taylor, who sells to Mr. Flaxman—I loaded the wagon with hay on the day in question—it was hay he had purchased of Mr. Taylor—I put seventy-two trusses into the wagon, and bound them on with a rope—Wells was the driver,—after that three trusses more were put on, two were meadow hay trusses, which he brought from home for his horses, and he said he would have one truss of hay from the heap as well.</p>

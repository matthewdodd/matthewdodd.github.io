               <p>What happened to you? - After that, they drew my watch out of my pocket; after one had got my watch, he ran away, and the other laughed in my face.</p>
               <p>Did you pursue them? - I took the man that stole my watch by the collar.</p>
               <p>Did you keep him? - He was too strong for me, and he got away; I cried out stop thief in English.</p>
               <p>Was the man taken in consequence of that? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you got your watch again? - I have seen it; the constable has it.</p>

               <p>I was coming home about eight, on the 31st of March, in the evening, and I heard the cry of stop thief in Hart-street; two men ran; one was the prisoner, the other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180099"></xptr>was a short man; the thick short man was pursued by the patrol; I halted, to let them run by me; presently after, I was told they were taken; there was some little conversation; I said, you had better search the man, or take him away; the prisoner said yes, certainly you are very right, you had better search me, and they took him away; but between the place where he passed me, and the place where he was taken, there I found the watch on the ground; I took up the watch, mud and altogether; I went to Bow-street, and found them there; I left the watch with Mr. Bond.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there any other people running in the same manner, in the same place? - None that I saw.</p>
               <p>In the place where the watch was found? - None that I saw; I do not know that the watch was dropped by the prisoner; this was about eight at night; I am sure the prisoner is the same man that passed me, and he confessed it; he carried his hand under his coat, which I described, and he said, the reason was because he was lame; as he passed me, his hand was concealed either in his pocket, or under his coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you at a considerable distance? - I was not.</p>
               <p>You have a little mended your recollection since you was before the Justice of peace? - It is not a matter of consequence to me.</p>
               <p>Court. But it is a matter of very great consequence to the prisoner, because his life is at stake.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You see I have not provoked you to pertness yet; if it is a long time since, it is not likely you should be more accurate now; you said before the magistrate, that one of them turned up Phoenix-alley, and the other, whom this informant believes to be the prisoner, ran up Hart-street, and passed this informant on the right, with his hand under his pocket; you heard this foreign gentleman examined before the interpreter? - I was not present at the second meeting.</p>
               <p>At first you suspected this might be some fun in two idle fellows? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In point of fact, was not the prisoner's hand covered with one entire flannel bag? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of it? - Now I recollect, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Had not be a very bad hand indeed, three fingers shattered in such a state, as to produce great agony? - Probably it might.</p>
               <p>You are a sail-maker? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did not you hear the foreigner say no force was used, but that his watch was taken most dexterously and politely? - I heard him say no force was used, but not that his watch was taken most dexterously and politely.</p>
               <p>Do you mean now to swear that he was one of the men that run past you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were there many persons who joined in pursuit? - Only one, which I afterwards found to be the patrol; the men were all strangers to me; the man that went up Phoenix-alley was never taken that I know of.</p>
               <p>The foreigner, before the Justice, I believe, gave this account, that he was robbed by one man, who delivered the watch to another? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect which hand he said? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Phoenix-alley between the place where the person passed you, and the spot where this prisoner was taken, or beyond the spot? - When the prisoner had passed me, he had got past Phoenix-alley; he was stopped within some few yards of James-street.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to the government patrols that do duty at the play-house during the plays; at eight at night, going up the passage to Hart-street, all was quiet, and in three minutes I heard the cry of stop thief, towards Bow-street; I saw the prisoner run<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180100"></xptr>past me the contrary side of the street; I run after the prisoner; there were two people turning the corner of James-street, and they stopped him; the foreign gentleman came up and called watch, watch; and pointed to the prisoner; I understood by the foreign gentleman's motions, that he was satisfied that the prisoner was one of the men; the foreign gentleman went to the interpreter; I took the prisoner to Bow-street; he wanted me to let him go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You understood it as well as you could, as a man that could not speak English? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You call yourself, I think, a government patrol? - I am paid by government, and I am the patrol.</p>
               <p>Who gave directions for this indictment? - One Townsend was sent with me.</p>
               <p>He is a better lawyer than you; he knows how to make out a highway robbery better than you; it was at night, and you tell us, that at eight at night, Hart-street is particularly cool and quiet? - I tell you the street was quiet, more so than I ever saw it.</p>
               <p>Perhaps there was no performance at the play house that night? - I told you it was the 31st of the month; I should not have been there, if there had not been a performance.</p>
               <p>Do not be angry, keep your temper? - I heard the foreigner examined; I saw the the interpreter; I did not enquire his name, I never saw him before nor since; this <rs id="t17870418-96-viclabel466" type="occupation">Frenchman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17870418-96-victim854 t17870418-96-viclabel466"></join> described a great deal of violence that had been offered to him.</p>
               <p>Did he say they knocked him down before they took his watch? - I heard no such discourse.</p>
               <p>How did he describe it? - He said he was asking his way to his lodgings, and he had it written down on a card, and he met two men, and one said one way, and the other said the other; and the one snatched the watch out of his pocket; he did not say it was taken so dexterously, that he knew nothing about it till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Was it done with great politeness? - I was not taken up much with his evidence.</p>
               <p>What state was the hand of the prisoner in when you saw him? - I did not take notice, there was a mob about him.</p>
               <p>Was not his hand enclosed in a flannel bag, and three fingers smashed? - That has always been the case; I saw his hand tied up as usual.</p>
               <p>Court. did you ever see this prisoner before? - I have often seen him about the play house, and he is one of those that by name and looks, I was told to take care of; I have only been three weeks on that duty; I have known him all the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, upon your oath, has this man been in custody for any offence of any fort; that is a dangerous question to put to a thief-taker? - Not to my knowledge; I go by my orders.</p>
               <p>- GROVES sworn.</p>
               <p>I was present when this man was examined in Bow-street; I heard the Frenchman examined; I put the question to him, he said his watch was taken from him with great politeness; and the man smiled in his face, and took his watch, avec grande politesse, et tres legerement; that is with great politeness, and dexterously and slightly; he said likewise, that the man who received it from the other, received it avec la main gouche, with his left hand; he at that time told me over and over again, that he could not say that the prisoner was the man; it appeared to be a common pickpocket transaction, no violence in the least.</p>
               <p>You remember they have crammed into this information, that the prisoner was the man, which the foreigner had struck out? - I think it ought to be set right; it was by the mistake of a Dane who could not speak English not French.</p>

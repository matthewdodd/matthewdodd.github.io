On Sunday night last, the 14th of February, I lost a mare out of my stable - I left her there at nine o'clock, after giving her some hay and water; the stable was not locked: I had seen the prisoner before, but did not know him - he did not live near me, to my know ledge; I saw my mare again on Tuesday morning, at Stoke-common, Buckinghamshire, seven or eight miles from Harefield, in possession of Archer, a constable; I am quite sure it is mine - I had had her three months, and bought her at Maidenhead fair; I took her home next day.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Stoke-green. I and Mason were together between three and four o'clock last Monday morning; the prisoner passed through our parish, riding on this mare - we pursued and stopped him, after consulting together; we did not make use of any threat or promise to him - I told him I considered it our duty to know who he was, and where he was going - he said he was a native of Uxbridge; he was riding towards Maidenhead, and said he was going to Maidenhead on business - he was on the high road, near Farnham-royal - he said he was going there on business, but the nature of his business he would not mention; we detained him and the mare, and took him to Stoke-green, to the constable - we kept him in custody till Pearson came on the Tuesday; Archer searched him, in my presence, and found a knife, a coarse cloth apron, and 4 1/2d. on him.</p>

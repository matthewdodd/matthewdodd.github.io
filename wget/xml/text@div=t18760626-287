                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). On 30th May, at 5 o'clock p.m., I went to 3, Graham Street, Walworth Road, with Sergeant Roots and Detective Barrett—we went to a backroom on the ground floor; I <hi rend="italic">found</hi> it fastened, we burst it open and when we got in we saw the prisoner standing in the middle of the room alone with his shirt sleeves turned up—the front of his shirt and flannel shirt were open, and he was in a state of perspira<lb></lb>tion—he had a clasp knife in his hand and raised his hand as if he was going to stab me, but I caught his wrist and took the knife from him—I gave him into Roots' custody and examined the room—there was a very strong fire on which was this ladle with metal in a melted state—on the table were these two moulds, and a double mould for sixpences, one of them was so hot that I could scarcely hold it—there were three shillings and two sixpences with the <hi rend="italic">gets</hi> not removed, and four shillings and nine sixpences unfinished; they are not milled—there was one good shilling on the table and a complete battery charged for silvering the coins; also a bag of plaister of Paris and some bottles of liquids, pincers, and files—I said "Kelly how do you account for these"—he said "My name is not Kelly, my name is Edward Bryant, I suppose somebody has put me away, I have been very ill lately"—I took him to the station.</p>

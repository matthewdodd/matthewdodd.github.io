               <p>Q. What do you accuse him of? - A. Of taking five shillings out of the till, on the 29th of August, and on the 30th; I marked thirteen shillings and sixpence, and a five-shilling piece; out of which I missed, on the 29th, two shillings, and on the 30th I missed three shillings, which made the five; I had reason to suspect the lad; I went up stairs to his box, I found it locked; I saw a constable, and spoke to him; he opened the box, and in his box there were five of the shillings; I had marked a letter T on them all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this boy been with you? - A. About seven months; I had always found him an honest lad, I am sorry this occurred.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his parents? - A. His mother is a widow woman that keeps a public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You say he was apprenticed to you about seven months ago? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And a small premium of ten pounds was given to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And his mother is a good sort of a woman? - A. I believe she is.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no reason to doubt at all of his honesty till then? - A. Not till then.</p>

               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Look at the money? - A. They are the same shillings, and the same mark on them.</p>

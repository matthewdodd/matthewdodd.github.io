                  </hi>. I am called Minnie Wilson—a person called Thomas Howard was charged before the Magistrate, and I attended as a wit<lb></lb>ness; not upon the first occasion. I am the person whom Howard was charged with taking away—in March, 1862 I was living with my father. I met How-ard at that time near St. Paul's Churchyard—I had been to an office to look for a situation—he ultimately induced me to go to the Haymarket, and told me that he would marry me. He said first that he knew a lady who wanted a young girl to serve in the shop—believing that, I went to the Haymarket, and I was there introduced to some lady—I stayed with Howard after that I had some cake and wine in the afternoon, and then I felt stupified and powerless, and in the morning, when I woke, I found myself in bed with Howard—my clothes were taken away—I remained with him some time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186405090057"></xptr>
               <p>after that He afterwards charged me at the police court with robbing him—the Magistrates dismissed the charge, and directed a warrant to issue against Howard—he was taken into custody, and I was subpœnaed as a wit-ness—I was to appear on the Thursday following, and I did not. I had a summons—I have not got it now—I think it was on the 26th March—I first saw the prisoner while Howard was on remand—I first saw him on the Tuesday as Howard was remanded the Saturday before—I had never seen him before that—I saw him in Coventry Street, about three in the afternoon. He asked me if my name was Minnie Wilson—I said it was—he said, "I have come from Mr. Howard; do <hi rend="smallCaps">YOU</hi> intend appearing against him?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Oh I don't appear against him; you shall have as much money as you like, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." and he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out some gold—I cannot say how much—I told him. again that I should appear, and he asked me if I would meet him that night about nine o'clock in the Haymarket, No. 51, where Howard lived, and I was to think whether I should appear against him—I did not go, but I saw the prisoner again the next day—he came along Coventry Street and met me—he asked me again if I intended appearing against Howard—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Let me beg of you again, with tears in my eyes, not to appear against him; you will blast his prospects for ever"—he said, if I would not, he would give me money to go down to Hereford that night, and he was sure Howard would marry me—he offered me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I was to go to Hereford to be a long way off, so that I should not go against Howard—he said Howard's, friends lived at Hereford—I knew that before—I did not agree to that—then he told me that Howard was almost dying, and that was the reason I did not appear against him on that Thursday, that was the day after the conversation—I did not appear because I believed Howard to be very ill—I saw the prisoner afterwards with Howard's friends, but I did not speak to him—he came up to me once and said I should have to give evidence against him, or something of that sort, but he would <hi rend="italic">lick</hi> me—I saw him on the Thursday at Howard's place, but I had nothing to say to him then—I was going by, and was called in by a man in the shop—that was the day I ought to have appeared—I went down stain and saw the prisoner and some other gentleman, who said he had come there to take possession of the place—no conversation took place between me and the prisoner then—Sergeant Appleton came down stairs and saw the prisoner on that occasion—I appeared as a witness against Howard on the Thursday following—I don't know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was it you heard he was dying and did not go? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the day before I ought to have gone up—it was the next day week, the Thursday week, that I gave evidence—it was in the street that he pulled out the money—it was about three o'clock in the afternoon that I saw him on the second occasion—he pulled out money then—I only went to Howard's house in the Haymarket once between the time he was taken into custody and my appearing against him—I am now living in Upper Char-lotte Street, Fitzroy Square, at the same place I was living when I was here before—I am pursuing the same course of life—I cannot tell exactly whether I intend to pursue it—some society prosecuted Howard for me—I don't know the name it; I think the Marquis of Townshend is the head gentle-man—nobody from the society has been to see me since—I never saw any of the society till I called upon the Marquis of Townshend one day—that was two or three days after Howard was convicted—I did not receive any-thing then—I went to ask him if he would do anything for me to get me</p>

               <p>out of this life—he said he would see or send to me, but he did not—I don't know whether the same society is prosecuting the prisoner—Howard was convicted nearly a month back—I was not walking with any other young lady when Tiptaff met me—I always walk by myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of police—I was instructed in the case of Howard—he was taken into custody and brought before the Magis-trate—I forget the date—I think it was on the 26th—I did not take him myself—he was remanded by the Magistrate on that occasion for a week—the Magistrates make an entry of every remand on the charge sheet generally—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Orridge objected to any evidence being given from the charge sheet, and to oral evidence of a remand, and the Court took a note of the objection</hi>)—the case was remanded for a week, I think—he was first brought up on the 26th March—then he was remanded till the following Thursday, the 31st, and then again to 7th April. On 31st March, I went to Howard's house, between nine and ten in the evening, and saw the prisoner and the last witness, Wilson, in the kitchen of the house. I asked the prisoner who he was—he told me his name was Tiptaff—I told him I should take him to the station on a charge of tampering with the witness Wilson, and trying to persuade her not to appear against Howard—he said nothing then—when at the station he was asked his name and address, and the inspector on duty said to him, "I am sorry to see you here; I have cautioned you about this before; I have seen you in Howard's house"—the prisoner said, "I am very sorry; I have lost my place through it; I did it all out of kindness; the money I received from Howard was in order to get him out of trouble and arrange his affairs"—he said he was a warder at the House of Detention, and I found that to be so—he was a temporary warder there on approba-tion—I have seen him there in uniform—Howard was confined there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Joseph Henry Hembury, who lives at No. 2, Bedford-street, Bedford-square—his stables are in Tavistock-mews. On the 5th of December I missed two lamps—Dr. Arnold had part of the stables—my master's gig was in the coach-house—I saw it last about nine o'clock in the morning—the lamps were locked up in a place separated from the coach-house—I missed the lamps in the evening—I had left it locked at one o'clock, and found it ajar at seven o'clock in the evening—there did not seem to be any mark of vio<lb></lb>lence on the lock—it must have been picked—the lamps were gone—I had seen them at nine o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner at one o'clock in the stable helping Dr. Arnold's coachman.</p>

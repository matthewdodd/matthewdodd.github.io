                  </hi>. I am a single woman, living at 18, Greenhill's Rents, Smithfield—on the 2d June, about 10 o'clock, I was coming through White-chapel; I there met the prisoner—I had never seen him before—I asked him the way to some place; he then asked me if I was Irish? I said I was, and he said, "So am I"—he walked a little way with me, and then he caught hold of me, and took a gown and bonnet which I had in my hand and ran away; these are the things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I was on duty on this Wednes<lb></lb>day night, in Laundry-yard, and saw the prisoner there; I had heard screams before that—he had been running, and was very much exhausted when I stopped him; he had this gown and bonnet in his hand; he could not speak he was so exhausted; the prosecutrix then came up.</p>

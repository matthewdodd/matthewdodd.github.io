                  </hi>. I have been two years and a half in the prisoner's service, on and off. On 2nd Aug. I went home with him to Pimlico in the horse and cart; we had stopped on the road, and got home about 8 o'clock—I went to the stable for a quarter of an hour, and took the harness off the pony; I then came out, and met Mr. Lacey, as if he was coming into the stable—he was talking to Hillier—he told me to go and put the cart in; I was going to do so, and he began to call me a lazy vagabond; I said I was not, and he told me to go away from his place—I went away, and sat with Hillier on the bank in front of the garden, about six yards from the palings—while we were sitting there, the prisoner came out of the garden two or three times, and wanted me to go in; I told him I would not go in till he was in a better temper—I had been sitting there some time, and he came to the gate—I did not see anything in his hand; but he stepped back a step or two, and fired; the shots came into me like a lot of stinging-nettles, and knocked me down the bank; and as I was rolling down I saw the flash of the gun—I found my neck was all blood—Hillier was struck too; he ran down the road, and I after him—I gave information to the police.</p>

               <p>up—I was afraid to go in that night—I have heard him say that he has been in the Navy; and I have heard that he has a tin plate in his head, but I have not seen it—I had got into a <hi rend="italic">scrape</hi> a fortnight or so before, about some osier grass, and the prisoner bailed me out of prison, and became security for me till the Monday, when I was discharged; he did all he could to help me—he sometimes keeps his gun loaded—he had not been treating me too much on this occasion; he only gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get a pint of beer before we came home—he stopped twice on the road, but I do not know what he had been drinking.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Landsend, Fulham. On 2nd Aug. I was sitting on the bank with Elliott—I saw the prisoner come out of his house; he told Elliott to go in; he said he would not till his tern per got better—I did not see the prisoner do anything with a gun—I and Elliott were struck with some shots—I did not see any flash as I was sitting <hi rend="italic">perpendicular</hi>, but I heard the shot of a gun—I was wounded, and went away for the police.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, V</hi> 34). On Tuesday night, 2nd Aug., between 11 and 12 o'clock, I went with sergeant Gosling to the prisoner's house—I saw him in the garden, and said, "Is that Mr. Lacey?"—he said, "Yes," and came up to the gate—I said, "We want you for shooting two men;" he said, "Two? are they hurt?"—I said, "Yes; one is your servant"—I asked him to open the gate—after a while he opened it, and we went in and asked him where the gun was; he said, "In the house"—we went into the house, and saw the gun in a corner of the room—it had the appearance of having been recently discharged—I found a canister of powder and a canister of shot—the prisoner said, "Is it serious?"—Gosling answered, "I do not think it is"—after we had got a short distance from the house, he said the gun went off by accident; he intended to have shot over their heads—after he had gone some distance he asked again if it was serious, and he was again told that we did not think it was—previous to getting to the station, he said, "I hope it is not serious; I do not care if it is;" and afterwards he said, "She is a good old piece, she never misses fire"—after the charge was read over, the prisoner said, "I shot at them to separate them"—I went to the fence next morning—the place was pointed out to me where they were sitting—I found the tops of the palings splintered with shots in various places, and the top of a young laburnum tree was shattered to pieces by shots—it is about six yards from the fence to where the men were sitting—the shots had come in a slanting direction.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at Walham-green. I examined Elliott, and found several gunshot wounds on his head, neck, shoulder, and back—on entering, the shot had gone from right to left; I extracted some of them, and some I could not extract—I examined Hillyer—one of the shots had grazed his leg, and another had entered his head—when he took off his jacket, several shots fell from it.</p>

I was standing in my own shop, I saw Meek open the door and go into the back yard where Whittaker lodges, and presently the wind blew the door open, he went and shut the door to. I said to my husband, I will go and see what that man is doing in the yard. I went, and I saw Meek in the one pair of stairs back room. Young said, D - n your eyes, come out; Meek was throwing the things through the window, and Young was outside of the yard; my husband came over and took Meek as he was coming over the pales.</p>

            . I am a carpenter: I was at work opposite. I went over; I saw Mr. Miller take hold of Meek; I, with the assistance of another, took Young, as Mrs. Miller said he was an accomplice; he begged to be let go, we did not let him go; then he begged to go over to the public house to get a character; when we went over the publican knew nothing of him, he went out of the house, we went after him, he saw us coming after him, he ran into a shop, we caught him; he is the same man.</p>

               <p>- I live in Dean Street. On the 13th of July, I saw this man go by my door; I shewed him a letter from my husband; he went with me to Old Gravel Lane. Coming round at the top of the lane we saw a mob, he went away from me, I saw many people take him, they tore the coat off his back. I immediately went and told his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of this is true: he did not go into the public house when they took him. - A. No, not as I know of.</p>

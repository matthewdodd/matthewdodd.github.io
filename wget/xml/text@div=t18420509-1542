                  </hi>. I am assistant to Philip Hooker, a timber-merchant, in Raven-row, Mile-end. The prisoner has been in his employ three or four months, as a sawyer—he has been to the yard se<lb></lb>veral times since he left, to ask for employment—on Easter Tues<lb></lb>day last, between twelve and one o'clock, I was at our yard gate, and observed a person dressed like the prisoner, with a mahogany plank on his back—I could not see his face—he was coming from a yard belonging to my father, within forty feet of where I was—he dropped the board and ran or walked quickly away—I helped to pick up the plank, and carry it into the yard—I saw no one else there—all the wood in that yard belonged to my father.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Mr. Hooker. On Easter Tuesday, about half-past twelve or one o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming out of the gate of my master's yard, with a mahogany board on his back—he saw me, threw the board off his shoulder, and walked away very sharply—I knew him well, and am sure it was him—I was standing at my master's gate.</p>

               <p>but my master was talking to a gentleman inside the gate—I told him, and he then came and looked out—the prisoner had the board on his back then—I called after him three times, "Hoy," and he would not look round—it was against the gate that I saw his face—he was standing side-ways—I am sure I saw his face, and that he is the man. <hi rend="largeCaps">

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 20, Quaker-street, Spitalfields. On 18th July, 1853, I was present at St. Philip's Church, Friar's-mount, Bethnal-green, when my daughter, Hannah Eliza Waite, was married to the prisoner—she is in court now—she has been living in Booth-street, Brick-lane, Spitalfields; I forget the name of the court—she has not been living alone—they lived together for a fortnight after their marriage; she then left him—they came together again two months afterwards, and then he left her at my residence—she has not been living with him since; it is eighteen months ago.</p>

On 28th May last, I was present at St. Matthew's Church, City-road, when the prisoner was married to Ann Dacey—I was considered as bridesmaid—I knew he had been previously married, but I understood his marriage did not stand legal, because of her being married in her wrong name.</p>

               <p>I was married to the prisoner at St. Matthew's Church, City-road—I knew from the first of his being married before, but he told me his first wife was married in her wrong name, and the marriage did not stand good, and she told him she could leave him when she thought proper; that was the reason I married him—I believed what he said.</p>

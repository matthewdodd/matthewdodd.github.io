               <p>Baxter. No pretence at all. The silk was in a white paper upon the counter, and presently I missed the silk, and I was frightened out of my wits; and I run out of the shop after her, and cried out, stop thief! and she threw it down a baker's cellar.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, if you please, I will tell you how it was, from the beginning to the latter end. About two months ago I was ill of a fever, and I had an acquaintance in the Prince of Wales's nursery, and she advised me to go into the Hospital, and I was six weeks there under the physicians hands; and I went that day to the Prince of Wales's, and as I was coming down this street, with the child in my arms, a woman, with a white cloak on, slipped behind the counter, and took something out of the shop, and Mrs. Baxter took hold of me, and gave me a slap on the face, and I gave her another; and as I was not guilty, I did not know why I might not give her another.</p>

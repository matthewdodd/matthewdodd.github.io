                  </hi>. I am waiter at Wood's Hotel, Furnival's Inn, Holborn. About half-past five o'clock, on the afternoon of the 17th of July, I was in the coffee-room, and observed the prisoner waiting outside the hotel door—Host sight of him for about a quarter of an hour—I went to look for him, but could not find him, and I put the alarm-bell on the hotel door, which rings when any one comes in or goes out—I afterwards heard the bell ring, and saw the prisoner leaving the door with a bundle under his arm—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him to No. 11 in the inn—I asked who he had been to see in the hotel—he said, "Mr. Reynolds"—we had a gentleman of that name in the hotel—I told him to follow me, and I would show him to Mr. Reynolds—I took him to him, and asked if he expected any clothes from the tailors—he said he did not, and he did not know the prisoner—I then brought the prisoner out of the room, and made him untie the bundle—it contained the articles stated, belonging to Mr. Hayne, of Southampton, who had come to the hotel that day—he claimed them—the hotel is in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn.</p>

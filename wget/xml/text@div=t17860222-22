               <p>(Deposes to it.)</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know they are yours? - By the tickets.</p>
               <p>What is the value of them? - Three pounds, I saw these gauses about ten minutes before the theft was committed, I never saw the parcel opened till now, since that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. How many partners have you? - None.</p>
               <p>You deal very largely in gauze? - I deal in gauzes, not very largely.</p>
               <p>This gauze is a very common sort? - Yes, I have sold quantities of it.</p>
               <p>Do you ever sell goods with that mark upon them, Sir? - I always send them with the marks on, and with particular tickets.</p>
               <p>If you had seen them three pieces of gauze, in any shop twenty or thirty miles out of town, a day or two after, should you have known them from your shop mark to be the gauze you lost that particular day? - I should have known it to be my own mark, I should have known it to have been gauze that was in my shop at that time.</p>
               <p>There are other gauzes of that sort? - I do not know that I should have known it unless the tickets were on.</p>
               <p>Now from the probability of knowing these figures, can you take upon you to swear they are yours? - I think I could, I can swear to the hand writing of my young man who made these figures.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you safely to swear that you would know the figures of your clerk in distinction to others? - I could be pretty sure, I do not know I could swear to it.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any doubt about it? - None in the least.</p>
               <p>Is the mark the same as your shop mark? - The figures are the same, here is one of my own figures, I could not be sure it was my gauze, unconnected with this story.</p>
               <p>Or that it was gauze that was in your shop, at that particular moment that you describe? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had seen these figures at any other particular place, should you have known them to be yours? - I should.</p>

               <p>What became of the parcel? - I took the parcel, he delivered it up to me, I found it upon him, I carried it home to the warehouse; this is the parcel.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you know the figures on these gauzes? - Yes, some of them are mine, I know by the figures they are the same gauzes that were in Mr. Parr's warehouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, residing at Limehouse.

From what Holland said to me, I went after the prisoner about twelve o'clock on Sunday night or Monday morning (the prosecutor lost his money on Sunday morning)-about twelve o'clock at night I received information, went to the prisoners lodgings, and found him in bed, and found a half-crown, a half—sovereign, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and some copper in his pockets—it was a new half—sovereign I found, which I was told it was—he said that was all he had left out of his week's pay.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. When you saw me in liquor why did you not search me pro<lb></lb>perly?—that money belonged to me—I kept an old man that was not right in his head, and on Saturday night I received 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the policeman went to where I work, and heard of it. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

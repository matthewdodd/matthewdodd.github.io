             is my sister, and lives with us. The house is let out in tenements. On the 11th of June, soon after two o'clock in the afternoon, I locked my door, and went out, I left no person in the room; I was gone about ten minutes; Folkes went out before me; her watch hung up over the mantle-piece. Folkes came to me while I was out, I gave her the key; we went home together - She went up to the room first, and called me several times. I heard two persons run down stairs-one of them was my sister; she called out stop thief! I ran up and missed her watch and our silver spoons, which I had left in the cupboard, it was not locked; in about half an hour I saw the spoons and watch at the watchhouse-the prisoner was in custody.</p>

            . I am Mrs. Stanforth's sister, and was living in her room. About two o'clock in the afternoon, on the 11th of June, I came home with her, took the key of her, and went up stairs; just before I got to the room door I saw it open, and called my sister several times, but she did not answer; as I was going in at the door, the prisoner came out of the room - He was quite a stranger to me. The outer door of the house is generally left open. The prisoner asked me if Mr. Mulls lived there; there was no such person living there. I called out stop thief! he ran down stairs, and I followed him, still calling out - He was secured near the house; I never lost sight of him. I went home and missed the watch and spoons. I had left the watch in my sister's room when I went out, I saw it again at the watch-house, and knew it to be mine; there was no force used to the door. The prisoner continued running as I called out stop thief!</p>

            . I am the keeper of St. Pancras watch-house, the house is in that parish. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house; the watch and spoons were delivered to me, and Stanforth and Folkes claimed them. I went to the house with the picklock keys, two of which opened the door very easily. I produce them.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in Little Charlotte-street, Goodge-street. I heard the cry of stop thief! and saw two of my neighbours in pursuit of the prisoner. I am sure he is the man. He was stopped in John-street, which is next to Windmill-street - he was running. I assisted in taking him to the watch-house, and took the spoons out of his pocket, and saw the gentleman take the watch out of his hand. I saw the prisoner thrust his hand into his left-hand pocket, I thought he was going to throw something away, and put my hand in and took the spoons and skeleton keys out-they were wrapped up together in his pocket-handkerchief; he did not say how he came by them. Those produced are the same.</p>

            . I came through bridge on the first of this instant, about half an hour after ten at night, with a lighter to Paul's-wharf; after I had moored her, coming on shore about eleven o'clock, over Mr. Cousins's craft, I thought I saw something move; I called, who is there; no body answered; coming a little farther, I saw the prisoner in his boat, which lay along-side the craft, and a sack of oats standing on the gunnel of the barge: I said to the prisoner, what are you going to do with this sack of corn; he said, nothing at all, he was only going to get into his boat; at that time his feet were in his boat, and his backside on the side of the barge; I put the sack of corn in its place, and went on shore to a public-house, and staid about ten minutes; Samuel Robinson, was along with me when we were going to go home to Horsleydown. When we were on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170003"></xptr> top of the stair-head, I saw the prisoner pulling the sack, and heard it fall into his boat; then I jumped down, and took hold of the head of his boat, and sent Robinson to call Mr. Cousins's man; then the prisoner said, lend me a hand to chuck the sack in again, there is no harm done as long as the sack is in again; he said he never did such a thing before in his life. Robinson and Mr. Cousins's man came, then we took him in custody; there were four bushels of oats in the sack.</p>

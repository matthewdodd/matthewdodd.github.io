            . I am employed by the Gas Company. The property was found at my house, in Mulberry-place, Upper Charles-street; it was brought to me in the space of a year and half, by the prisoner, at different times, he gave them to me. I had known him two years and three quarters, and knew he lived with the prosecutors - he asked if I was married, I said Yes; he said if he thought so, he would make me a present towards housekeeping - he said he was in the habit of having small presents from different manufacturers, who supplied his master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What are you - A. A brazier; I work for the Gas Company. I used to attend at the prosecutor's warehouse, four time a week, to burn the air out of the pipes. I was only there a few minutes, and Mr. Burnell was generally there - I was taken up, and immediately said he gave them to me. Mr. Palmer, junior, was examined, and said he sold the prisoner some things which he had brought me - I did not think them stolen.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. I went to Otherly's, on the 1st of January, with Mr. Burnell, and found two quart decanters, six tumblers, five wine glasses, four salts and stands, all cut glass; two cruets, two pair of cups, with silver tops, six china cups and saucers, which the prosecutors claimed - they were on a sideboard. He said the prosecutor's servant brought them there at different times; he gave his account without hesitation, he thought he received some small things from them at a public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not young Mr. Palmer say he sold him some of them - A. He identified some small articles, as having sold them to him - Otherly was kept in custody three or four days.</p>

            . I am book-keeper to Messrs. Burnell and Palmer. I only know that the articles are the property of the prosecutors. I believe them once to have been theirs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He had things with your permission - A. He had two vinegar cruets, a mustard pot, two pepper castors, which were found, he had from me, and I sold him two decanters, twelve wine glasses, six tumblers, six goblets, four salts, a wine bason, and chamber pot, and sundry other articles, of which I made no memorandum - he has paid me for part of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he is charged in your books for them - A. No; I never entered them - the prosecutors were not aware of it; it was an account between me and him, some of them were sold twelve months ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever tell your masters, that you sold him the things - A. I do not recollect mentioning it. I intended him to pay for them - I did not enter it in any book, and cannot tell what he owed; the decanters produced, are a different sort to those I sold him, they had rings round the necks - I believe I never sold him those, I will not swear it, I positively swear I never sold him the decanters.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. You swear it - A. Yes; these are cut glass - I entered some things on a slip of paper twelve months ago, (producing it) they were sold at three different times within twelve months - I have put no dates to it, I speak from my memory, that they were ring decanters. I have frequently sold things, and not entered them but when I receive the money, I give credit for it - if they are bought on credit, I enter them, but if paid for, I enter the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not enter Capper's - A. They ought to have been weighed, to ascertain the price, which I had not time to do, it was inconvenient - I cannot say these were ever the prosecutor's property, or if they were, that they were never sold.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You sold them to him at three different times; do you mean to say, that this memorandum was written at three different times - A. Yes; I kept the memorandum in my desk a long time, and then loose in my pocket - the first entry was made about four months after the second.</p>

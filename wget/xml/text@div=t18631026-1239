                  </hi>. I am a milliner, of 116, Shoreditch—on Friday morn<lb></lb>ing, 9th October, about 2 o'clock, I was called up by the police to look at the shutters of my shop—I found on the lower part of one of the shutters an impression, which had been apparently fresh done—I had not seen it before—I had property in my window worth about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On the morning of 9th October, about ten minutes to 2, I saw the prisoners together, about twelve yards from the prosecutor's premises—I walked along on the opposite side; some<lb></lb>thing aroused my suspicion, and I returned and placed myself in a court, tight opposite the prosecutor's—I saw Moore come to the end of Calvert-street, and look right and left—he then went back to Crawley, came back again, and again looked right and left—he then went back to Crawley again, and stood halfway—Crawley went on his right knee and placed something to the prosecutor's shutters; what it was I could not see at the time; I distinctly saw him put something against them—he might have been about a minute doing that—Crawley was standing right in front of him at the time—they then walked up High-street, Shoreditch, and went into a coffee-shop in Kingsland-road—I met H 34, and we took them into custody—Crawley dropped this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> from his left-hand side, underneath his coat—I picked it up—he said, "That is nothing; that is not mine"—I was ob<lb></lb>liged to hit him with it on the left arm to keep him quiet—when at the station-house he said, "That is mine; I don't deny it," and I can buy it at any marine store dealer's for 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Harrow, of 44, Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell. On Monday morning, 26th May, about half-past 5 o'clock, I went to his house to call him—I called him, and then saw the prisoner, whom I knew before, come down Clerkenwell-green, go to his brother's house where he used to work, come out again, and then go into Mr. Jackson's passage, the door of which was open—I called my master's attention to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, William Harrow, at 44, Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell. On 26th May, at 20 minutes to 6 o'clock, in consequence of information I watched the prisoner through the parlour-window, and saw him open the window facing ours, and jump in—he remained there a quarter-of-an-hour and then came out—I went to the door, and he said, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">Bill,</hi> are you not at work?" and he then went down the Green—I gave information to Mr. Jackson.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a marine-store shop, at 45, Turnmill-street. On 25th May I went to bed at 12 o'clock; the house was safe then—I got up at 8 the next morning, and found the kitchen-window open—my parlour-window is directly opposite Harrow's, and the kitchen-window farther back—from Harrow's you can see both—the glass of the kitchen-window was broken a day or two before, so that a person could put their hand in and undo the catch—there is a dust-yard close by, from where they are always throwing over things, so that it is of no use to mend the windows—I missed four brass taps, worth 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I had seen safe on the Saturday; on the Thursday following these four were brought to me by Downes—they are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father and mother, at 50, Turnmill-street. On the Monday after these things were stolen I found them behind a door in Lamb and Flag-court, where it was dark.</p>

I asked what for, and he said, "For entering his dwelling-house;" I said I had done nothing to go out of the way for; and he said, "Well, that is all I know; my father has told you to go out of the way;" I was there all day Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evening, passing Mr. Jackson's backwards and forwards, and he never said anything to me; I saw the prosecutor's daughter on the Monday morning, and she said nothing.</p>

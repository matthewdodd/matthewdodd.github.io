I saw the prisoner's hand through the window, and a loaf in it, and as I opened the door, he ran away. I followed, and took him twenty yards off with a 4 lb. loaf in his possession. I found the glass cut out of my window - it was perfectly whole an hour before; he denied cutting the window, but acknowledged taking the loaf - it was quite dark. I never lost sight of him. I rent the shop and parlour, and sleep there; the landlord does not live in the house.</p>

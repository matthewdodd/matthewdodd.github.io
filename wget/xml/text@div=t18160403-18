            , In the course of September last, I was in the service of Mr. Soppet, of Thames-street, I there became acquainted with the prisoner; he courted me, and it was settled between us to be married after Christmas. He brought some articles of linen drapery to us at different times. It was about Michaelmas; he told me he had bought them of Mr. Man. He brought me two pair of sheets the first time; he next brought me some table cloths, also a pair of sheets again, and some small jack towels? that is, he brought me the linen, and I made it into towels. He brought me a shawl, which he told me he gave Mr. Man three pounds for. There was a scarf of which he made a present to my sister, but he did not say where he bought that. We were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030022"></xptr>to be married after Christmas. He told me about two months after Christmas, that his father was very ill in the country; and he said he should lose two or three hundred pounds if he did not go into the country to see his father. He told me he would rather give my company up, and go into the country up for good; and if I would give him eight pounds for the linen I should have it.</p>

               <p>Q.What reason did he assign for asking you only eight pounds - A. He said he would let me have them for that, as I had the trouble of making them. He told me they stood him in about twelve pounds. Upon this, I went and told my aunt, Mrs. Rogers, what had passed; and in consequence of something that had passed between me and her, I took all these things to Mr. Man's.</p>

               <p>ANNE ROGERS. I am the aunt of the last witness. She came and disclosed to me something which she said had passed between her and the prisoner, and gave me the things, and I called on Mr. Man after I disclosed to him what had passed between me and her, he received the things from me.</p>

            . My house is in the parish of St. Margaret, within the Liberty of Westminster. The prisoner had been <rs id="t18160403-18-deflabel109" type="occupation">porter</rs>

I think it was the 23d of February, or a day or two before that, the last witness came to me, and I received from her the articles stated in the indictment. I went to her house and saw them there, and there received them. The greater part is made up into sheeting and towelling,&amp;c. but on the fags belonging to them, there is my mark. I think I may say one or two; but on one, I am certain. I never sold these things to the prisoner. I wondered he never bought any thing for his own use; but he never did. If our men have any thing, we indulge them by letting them have it at prime cost. I never sold these shawls to him, (property produced), that shawl (pointing to one produced.) did not cost me less than five pounds.</p>

               <p>Mr. Man, I lost exactly such a shawl as that. The same pattern; and I believe that to be the shawl.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you the care of her trinkets. - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q.

Three shifts, and a number of gloves I left in the house. Two silver tea-spoons and a sugar-tongs belong to myself, they were left in the drawers; the drawers were locked, and I left the keys locked up in town. I returned to town on the 14th of October, and on the next day I went to the drawers with the key, I could not open it. A smith was sent for, he opened the drawers, and then we missed all the articles that you have been speaking of.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer of Bow-street. - A. I am; on the 29th of October I searched Carpenter's apartment, in North-street, Manchester-square. The prisoners were all brought to Lord Aylesbury's house, by Mr. Lisle. I went to Carpenter's house, in company with Mrs. Knapp and Mr. Lisle; his wife was out. She came in in a few minutes, and then we began to make our search. We found two of her Ladyship's shifts, with a quantity of gloves and other articles, which are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any pawnbroker's duplicates. - A. A great number in a bag, and a piece of poplin. I went round with Mrs. Knapp to the different pawnbrokers. The things that were found by the duplicates, are in the possession of the pawnbrokers, who are here.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any occasion during Lord Aylesbury's absence from town, to send any men to his house to work. - A. Yes, the prisoner, Carpenter, was my journeyman,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050027"></xptr>and the two lads are my apprentices. I sent them to the house to do work in June, they worked there three weeks or more. After Lord Aylesbury came to town, I was applied to on the subject of this robbery. I brought the three prisoners to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing you said to either or both the boys, were you directed to an apartment next to which they sleep. - A. I was directed by Noys to my house, 158, Bond Street, to a room leading to Noy's bed-chamber Noys went with me and pointed out a drawer, which contained some ladies gloves, and a pinchback locket, of small value. They were given to Mrs. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. These persons at the bar were sent by you to Lord Aylesbury's house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were there you said, about three weeks. If they had been so disposed, could not they have taken them at different times. - A. I beg your pardon, Cooper was not with me at that time, Carpenter was there three weeks; and, during that time, these articles might be taken at different times. Carpenter was there at work a day and a half when the boys was not there. I mean this young lad, Noys, he has been with me two years, he deserves a very good character. I was very much astonished that he should have known of it, and not acquainted me of the misconduct of the other.</p>

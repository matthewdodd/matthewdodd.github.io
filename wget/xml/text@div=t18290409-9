The prisoner was employed there, to look after the pupils in the play-ground - he lived in the house; he left last Monday week: I knew he was going away - he did not sleep in my room, but had access to it; I missed two shirts the day after he was gone - I saw them at Bow-street, in Stevens' possession; I missed three - he went to my room when he chose: they have my mark on them, and are Nos. 10 and 1l, which I missed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not been on very intimate terms? A. I had; I once asked him to lend me a cloak, but did not use it - I once lent him a shirt, and I lent him a portmanteau; when he was going away he gave me the address of the place he was going to- it was Dorchester: I cannot suppose it possible that my shirts could get intermixed with his.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you in May last deliver him that bill for the purpose of receiving seven shillings and nine-pence of Mr. Wallis - A. I did; on Saturday the 20th of May, I delivered him that bill along with others.</p>
               <p>COURT. This bill you receipted it, he was to bring you the money or return the bill - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you authorised him to make out any bill - A. No; I never suffer any one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you permit him to write, paid, and substitute his own name instead of your bill and receipt - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he bring you back that bill among others on the Saturday - A. He did; that led me to believe the money was not received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did he ever pay you the seven shillings and nine-pence, as the money he had received of Mr. Wallis - A. He never accompted for the seven shillings and nine pence he received of Mr. Wallis, I made some enquiries and he absconded.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming home on the Saturday night and all the money I received I put in this coat pocket, and coming along Poland-street my pocket burst, and all the money I received fell out; I gathered up what money I could, but I could not gather up all; the people came around me; I was deficient; I made that bill thinking I could get the money.</p>

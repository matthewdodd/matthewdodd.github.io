                  </hi>. I am a potman at the Old King's Head, 282, euston-road; Mr. Rhodes is the master—about a quarter-past 5 on the morning of 20th April I was in bed, the prisoner came to my window and opened it; when he saw me lying in bed he made his escape as soon as be could, I saw his face distinctly—he ran across the leads, and jumped over some pales and I heard a loud crash of glass; I did not see him any more.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you asleep when you heard something at the window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that woke me up, and I saw the prisoner looking in—I had seen him before, and spoken to him in the yard belonging to the public-house—he did not remain at the window a moment.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, S</hi> 270). On the morning of 20th April, about a quarter-past 5, I was on duty in the Hampstead-road—from infor<lb></lb>mation I received I went to the Grafton-yard, and saw the prisoner there endeavouring to make his escape from the premises of Mr. Ells, a ladde-maker—he saw me; I got up on to the ladders and on the leads, and pursued him across the leads past Mr. Young's and past the King's Head—he there turned round and got over a low fence, and I there lost sight of him—I went back to the low fence and found this coat, ten collars, two boxes and a halfpenny lying on the leads by the side of Mr. Young's window in the route the prisoner had taken—I found Mr. Young's window open, and also the window of the King's Head—I took the prisoner into custody about a quarter-past 10 the same morning; I told him the charge—he said, "I know nothing about it"—on the way to the police-court be said, "It is got up for me, they are trying to put me away, but I will put some of them away."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you ever remember that expression before to-day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never mentioned it at the police-court—I have known the prisoner seven or eight years; he has never been in custody before that I am aware of—these leads are on shops projecting beyond the backs of the houses—when I first saw the prisoner he was about twenty yards from me, endeavouring to come down—I got closer to him—the leads are fifteen or twenty feet high, they are level with the first floor windows.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 280, Euston-road, and am a clothier's assistant—about ten minutes past 5, on the morning of 20th April, I was lying awake, and heard a loud crash of glass, on looking up I saw the sky-light broken—I looked across the leads to another sky-light and saw the prisoner making over a wall between some ladders—I heard the witness Holmes call out, "There is somebody going across the leads"—I got up and met the constable, and went with him, and just saw a head and hat dis<lb></lb>appearing across the wall—I afterwards saw the prisoner at the station and picked him out from seven or eight—he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the others dressed in a totally different manner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the policeman told me that a party had been apprehended who was on the leads; he did not point the prisoner out to me; they were standing in a circle—I turned him round to have a good look at his side face, that I should not be mistaken, but I was certain of him at first.</p>

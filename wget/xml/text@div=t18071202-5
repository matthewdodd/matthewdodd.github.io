                  Ann

            . - A. I do, she is my laundress. On the morning of the 29th of October I gave Mrs. Woodbridge half a guinea to purchase fourteen pound of soap. I put three private marks upon the half guinea; I told her to go to the shop about half past four in the afternoon, at the time we went to dinner. I looked at the till a few minutes before I went up to dinner, that was exactly at four o'clock; there was about twenty shillings in the till in silver and halfpence; there was no gold in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner at the bar was a <rs id="t18071202-5-deflabel31" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18071202-5-defend92 t18071202-5-deflabel31"></join> to your brother. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the custody of that till. - A. He had; there was a younger brother of mine, he used to serve in the shop, he had access to the till. In the course of the evening I went to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18071202-5-person95">Edgar</persName>
             the constable; when the constable came I related my suspicion to the constable in the presence of the prisoner; I said there was money lost from the till, and I would have every one searched till the money was found. The constable searched the prisoner in my presence; that identical half guinea that I had marked in the morning was found upon him, with some silver and a few halfpence. The constable asked him how he came by that half guinea; he said he took it out of the till, but he had put silver and halfpence into the till for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that at four o'clock you searched the till, and found twenty shillings in silver and halfpence, when did Mrs. Woodbridge give you any information about it. - A. Immediately I came down from dinner I sent my little brother off to know whether she had been and purchased the article; I searched the till again a quarter before five; I found two shillings more than I left.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the practice of your house to make an entry of what is sold. - A. It is a practice, and very regularly done; I have my journal here, there is no entry of the half guinea, nor of the fourteen pound of soap; there is an entry in the book of about two shillings, the money that was taken till I come down from dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose custody did you deposit the half guinea. - A. The constable; he would not let me lay hold of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of looking at it. - A. I had; I have no doubt of it being the half guinea I delivered to Mrs. Woodbridge, and that I had marked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The half guinea has never been found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. There is good reason for that; the constable has the half guinea, and says he has lost it now.</p>
               <p>Heseltine. When the constable took it out of the prisoner's pocket, he laid it on a sheet of paper; I saw the mark on the head side, and two marks on the other; I know it was the half guinea I had given to Mrs. Woodbridge. I gave the constable directions to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are talking about a thing that is not to be seen; the jury are to be the best judges of the marks.</p>
               <p>- EDGAR. Q. Have you this half guinea. - A. No, I had the half guinea; when I took it from the prisoner I let Mr. Heseltine look at it; then I wrapped it up in a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a constable of what place. - A. Of Cripplegate ward.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you constable or beadle. - A. I am ward beadle. On the next morning I went to fetch the prisoner out of the Compter, he requested that I would give him the silver back that I had at the time I folded the half guinea up and put it in my pocket, and went before the alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce it before the alderman. - A. No. The reason was, because Mr. Heseltine requested that the prisoner might be remanded for a week, and upon that account it was not shewn to the alderman; I kept the half guinea in my pocket three or four days, and then I put it in the bureau; whether it was in the paper when I put it in the bureau, or whether it had slipped out I do not know, I never unfolded it. I put it up with the paper, as I supposed, but there was a hole in the paper and a hole in my breeches pocket. You may think I put it out of my pocket to hinder the prosecution, but it was no such thing, because Mr. Heseltine was endeavouring to prevent the prosecution at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. The prisoner confessed that he took the half guinea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Unless you have the half guinea for the jury to see whether it was that half guinea, you cannot bring it home to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to Heseltine. What were the very words that passed at the time when the prisoner was taken with the money upon him. - A. I told him that money had been missed from the till; the constable immediately said, your master has missed a great deal of money; I said search Mr. Holland, and all in the house shall be searched till the money is found. When he was searched we found a half guinea; he was asked how he came by it, he said he found it in the till.</p>
               <p>Court. This confession does not go so far as to say - this is the half guinea I took from Mrs. Woodbridge.</p>
               <p>MRS. WOODBRIDGE. Q. You do not know the half guinea do you. - A. The half guinea had a dot on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Heseltine point out any marks on the half guinea. - A. Not to me.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you give that half guinea that you received from Mr. Heseltine. - A To Mr. Holland.</p>
               <p>Jury. The constable is highly culpable.</p>

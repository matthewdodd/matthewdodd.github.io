                  </hi>. I am assistant to Thomas Benn Sowerby, pawn<lb></lb>broker, Hoxton Old-town. On the afternoon of the 24th of Nov. I was sent for, went to the shop-door, and saw the prisoner running from the shop—I went after her, and saw her throw something over a wall—I overtook her, and said, "I have got you now"—I took her back, and gave her in charge—I afterwards went back to the place, and found this gown, it belongs to my employer, and was safe a quarter of an hour before, on the door-post, pinned to a carpet with three pins—this flannel petticoat is also ours, and was safe at the same time, inside the door, pinned to another article.</p>

                  </hi>, I am the wife of John Porter, of Huntington-street, Hox<lb></lb>ton. I was going into Mr. Sowerby's shop, and saw the prisoner unpin the dress, and drop it on the pavement—she then took it up, and ran away with it—I gave notice to Liebrccht, pointed her out to him, and he pursued her.</p>

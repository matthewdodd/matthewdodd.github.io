                  </hi>. I belong to the schooner <hi rend="italic">Darlington</hi>, lying in the Thames, opposite Union Stairs. On 31st Dec. I was out late; I came on board about a quarter past 1 o'clock in the morning of the 1st Jan.—when I got on the deck I saw a man come out of the forecastle—it was one of the prisoners—I cannot tell which—I did not lose sight of that man till he was in custody, almost immediately afterwards—I saw another man at the bul<lb></lb>warks, who was the other prisoner—I could not see his face—that man was</p>

               <p>taken into custody directly afterwards—I did not lose sight of him till he was taken—the man who came out of the forecastle went towards the bul<lb></lb>warks, where the other man was, and I saw him heave something over our bows—there was a boat lying alongside, but we did not see it till afterwards—I called a man and a boy out of the forecastle—with the exception of that man and the boy, and myself, there was no person on board, except the two prisoners, only us five—the man who came up was Bradley—he followed the two prisoners, and I saw him struggling with Taylor on board the inside vessel in the tier, and I saw Donovan on board that vessel, forward, hidden under some ropes—I am sure he was the other man, whom I had not lost sight of—the police boat was going by, and the prisoners were given into custody—I went down into my own ship, and also into the boat of the <hi rend="italic">Auckland</hi>—on going into that boat, which was moored to our bows, I found these two pairs of trowsers.</p>

I heard a cry of "Police!" and went on board a vessel—I saw Carney and Bradley holding the prisoner Taylor—I went forward, and found Donovan concealed under some rope on board the inside schooner—I am sure he is the man—after pulling him out from under the rope, he made a violent kick at one <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the men—I asked him how he came there—he said he came there to sleep—I asked Taylor how he came there, and he said he came off in a boat—I asked how he came in the boat, and he made no answer—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Auckland</hi>, and received these two pairs of trowsers.</p>

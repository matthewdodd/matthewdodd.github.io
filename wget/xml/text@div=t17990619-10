               <p>Court. Q. Who was the last up in the house? - A. I don't know, we were all a-bed between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you over-night in this room, where the windows were open? - A. Nobody sleeps there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they made fast or not? - A. I cannot say whether they were or not, I have nobody to prove it.</p>

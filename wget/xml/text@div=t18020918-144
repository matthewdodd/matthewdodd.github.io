             sworn. - I am servant to Messrs. Day, carmen: I took a puncheon of brandy from Summer's-quay, to Mr. Peters's, at Holborn-hill; he kept a liquor-shop there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner? - A. I met him on that day; I cannot say what day it was; he met me in St. Paul's Church-yard, when I had a load in my cart; he had worked for my master about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at all employed by them at this time? - A. No; he followed me to about the middle of Ludgate-hill, and there I missed of him; after I had put the puncheon ready to rack the liquor out, at Mr. Peters's, I saw the prisoner inside the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time desire him to go, and receive the cartage for you or your master? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of his going at any time? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bit of paper, and see if that is your writing, or if it was written with your knowledge? - A. I wish I could write as well, it would be of great service to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know of its being written? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the cartage of this would have been? - A. I believe, three shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>ALICE HORDEN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I was servant to Mr. James Peters, of Holborn-hill, on the 19th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect a cask of brandy being brought to your master's house by Mr. Day's cart on that day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; he was at our house that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Peters alive now? - A. He is dead since; he has been dead about a fortnight; the brandy was drawn off at the door in cans; the prisoner chalked down the number of cans that came in; about three days after he came again, and brought the bill to receive the money for the cartage of the brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the bill that he brought to you? - A. Yes, this is the bill; he said he came to receive the money for the cartage of the puncheon of brandy; he said he came from Mr. Day's; Mr. Peters was out; I said I did not know whether I was to pay him or not; he said, it was all the same, as if Mr. Day came himself; in consequence of his saying that, I paid him the amount of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you belive that he came from Mr. Day? - A. Yes; about a week, or a fortnight after, Mr. Day called himself, and we found it was paid to the wrong person. (The bill of parcels read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Who signed that receipt? - A. The prisoner.</p>

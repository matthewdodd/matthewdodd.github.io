                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser, of Dover Street, Southwark—up <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Monday, May 20th, the prisoner was in my employment—I gave him notice on the Saturday previous to leave in a week; instead of that he left on the Monday night, when I was absent—I saw him on the Tuesday, talking to the errand-boy, just as he had closed up the shutters—I told him it was very unhandsome of him to leave me in the way he did, he ought to have stayed the week—I said "It would serve you right if I gave you a months' imprisonment for so doing"—he went away, and told me he was going to work at Barnes—my shop was closed a little after 10 o'clock that night, with, a lock, two bolts, and a piece of wood jammed in as well—I saw it fastened—about 1 o'clock I was called up by the police ringing the bell, on going down I found the inner door of the shop open, which I had locked before going to bed—I missed about a half-dozen bottles of perfume, and about a dozen 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bottles, twenty-two hair brushes, a dozen brilliantine bottles, and a quantity of hair which had been tied up in paper and in an old apron of my wife's—I also missed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money and some small articles—on the Saturday following, in consequence of information, I went to Mr. Thomson's, a hairdresser, in Goswell Road—I had not been there a minute before I saw the prisoner offering the hair for sale—I identified it—it is worth about 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound—it is natural hair—as the prisoner passed me he said "All right, Mr. Wheatcroft"—a policeman was there, and took him off in custody—the total loss of property was about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are eight brushes of mine which are produced by the police, and which were in my shop, and these scissors which had been ground the week before—the prisoner had been with me two or three months, he lived in the house and knew it well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went to a music-hall on Wednesday night, and came out about 11 o'clock, and met a young man in Leman Street; he said "Do you know Mr. Wheatcroft?" I said I did, and he gave me that bag, and says "Wait &amp; minute." I waited an hour, and a policeman said "What are you waiting for?" I said I was waiting for a young man who had given me the bag, and I went home at 1 o'clock. I did not look at the bag for two days; I then looked, and the eight brushes, the scissors, and apron, and hair, were all packed together. I went to try and sell the hair.</p>

               <p>GEORGE TYLER. I am a constable, on the 13th of last month about a quarter after five, I was sent for to Mr. Everth's, he gave me charge of the prisoner on suspicion of stealing this kit of cod sounds, the property not being found he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the property found - A Yes, I went to the Sir John Falstaff public house and there I found the property, secreted in a corner by the side of the bar, I left the property in the landlord's hands, and was going to tell Mr. Everth I had found the property, I met the prisoner at the corner of Pudding-lane, I watched the prisoner, and he turned into the Sir

            , he peeped out at the door, he asked me if I was going to take any thing to drink, I said it is you I want you scoundrel, I told him I had found the sounds, he must go with me. He offered me half a guinea to let him go. I secured him.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL COOPER. I am servant to Mr. Gedge in Thames-street, opposite to the prosecutors. On the 13th of March I was standing at Mr. Gedge's door, I saw the prisoner come from the prosecutors with a kit of cods sounds under his coat, I went over to the prosecutors and asked them if they had sold a kit of cods sounds, and in a few minutes the prisoner returned; I asked him what he had done with the kit of cods sounds, he at first denied having any, he afterwards said he had returned it, and then a constable was sent for.</p>

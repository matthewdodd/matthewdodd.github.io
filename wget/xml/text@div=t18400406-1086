                  </hi>. I live in Chandos-street. On the 28th of February I went to Messrs. Willis and Co., in St. James's-street—I left my coat and hat at the end of a board, where the porters brush the clothes, between six and seven o'clock in the evening—I returned between nine and ten o'clock, and they were gone—my handkerchief is here, with a letter which was written to me from Liverpool, and two pieces of tape which were in my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Can you identify all the articles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can identify the handkerchief and the letter—I have once or twice corresponded with the writer of this letter—I cannot swear to his hand-writing—I swear to the letter, by its being directed to me, and it is written in blue ink—here is a mark on the handkerchief—I was at work in the front-shop, where the men work—the men are in the habit of going backwards and forwards for their jobs to the place where these coats were—I cannot say how many men were there then—there were more than twenty—I cannot tell how many of them had access to where the coats were—there is a little hole in one of the corners of this handkerchief, by which I know it—when the policeman came to me he did not show me this handkerchief, but only the letter—he showed me a handkerchief which was not mine, and the next day, when before the Magistrate, he produced this handkerchief—the place where these coats were is in a line with the front-shop—there are always</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060058"></xptr>
               <p>persons on the premises—they can see from the back to the front, but not from the front to the back—there are looking-glasses which reflect—it is not usual to take things out of the pockets of coats at that place, if coats were sent to be altered—I should not take things oat of the pocket, but if any things were in the pockets they would be returned—I had not made use of the letter that day, but the lining of my coat was torn, and the letter went down between the seams—it could not have got out without being taken out—there is a narrow passage at the back of the premises which is no thoroughfare—there was a dog on the premises, but when he is not tied up he does not bark—he is not above two months old—he was in the back-room, but was not tied up—I think these article were not secreted on the premises, as we looked for them for half an hour, as I did not like to go home without my coat—I and three or four more persons looked in every place where they might have been mislaid—there was a gas-light on the middle counter, and these things were placed at the end—when the persons were at work in the front they could not see these coats, as there is a projection just before you turn into the ware-room—the policeman showed me all the articles which were in my coat-pocket, except the gloves—I cannot say that they were in the pocket when the coat was stolen, they might have, been taken by different persons.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Newton-street, Holborn. On the 28Ch of February I was at work at Messrs. Willis's, in St. James's-street—I left my hat and coat in the porter's room, between two and three o'clock, and in the evening, between nine and ten o'clock they were gone—there was a bit of wool and some wadding in the pocket of the coat—the wool and wadding have been found—these are them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> It is not an easy thing to swear to wool, is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but I have a particular mark on this, this bit of green worsted—if the worsted was not on it I should not have known it—it is not tied to it, it is loose and mixed with it—here is no mark on this worsted—I do not know the wadding by the quantity nor colour—I bought it in Windmill-street, Hay<lb></lb>Market, and had it about a fortnight—I use if in my business—I put it into my pocket at dinner-time—any thing might have been put in or taken out of the pocket, without my seeing it, when the coat was there—a great number of persons have access to where the coat was—I went in the back way—the door was open—there would be no difficulty in a person going and taking these things without being seen by the persons who were trans<lb></lb>acting business—these things were two or three yards from where the per<lb></lb>sons were—I was in the office, which is in front—I could not see the coats—I cannot say that this is all the wadding I had in my pocket—there was a very small dog there—I do not know whether they are in general more watchful than others—the dog was about a yard from where the coats were left—he did not bark at me when I went in—I did not search for my coat when I came away, but every part was searched—these articles might have been taken by a person without his taking the coats.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner standing against the gate of No. 6—I asked what was his business—he said he was waiting for a boy who had gone in with tur<lb></lb>nips and greens—I waited some time, and no boy came—the prisoner was talking about the stars, what time I was relieved, and so on—he then wished roe a good night, and went off—I rang the bell and made inquiry—I then went after him, and said I would take him to the station-house—he asked what for, he had done no harm—I took him—he kept eating some pieces of bread, and at the comer of North-street he dropped a lan<lb></lb>tern—a boy picked it up—he said it did not belong to him, but to the boy—I took the prisoner to the station-house, and found on him 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a sur<lb></lb>gical instrument, two pieces of tape, this wadding, this letter, and some memorandums in his bat—I asked how he came by these things—he said a woman gave them to him—I took this handkerchief out of his hand, but by some means he got it again, and I took it again the next morning.</p>

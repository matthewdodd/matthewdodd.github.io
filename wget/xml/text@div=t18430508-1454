                  </hi>. I am a mason, and live in Cornelia-place, Brook-street, New-road. On the 17th of April I went to spend the evening at Mr. Triggs', Nathan-court, Church-street, Somers-town—between one and two o'clock in the morning I was coming down stairs to come away, and at the bottom of the stairs I saw the prisoner—she lives in the parlour of the same house—I had been with a party up stairs—as I was going out at the street-door, the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "My dear sir, are you going?"—I said, "What is that to you?" she then caught me round the waist, pulled me into her room, and put her hand into my right-hand trowsers pocket—I caught hold of her arm to pull her hand out—she pulled it out herself—I felt in my pocket and missed half-a-crown—I said, "Give me my half-crown"—she said she had not got it—I said, "You have got it"—I had felt it in my pocket five minutes before I came down stairs—some of the company then came down into the room—I then went up stairs, came down, and asked her again for it—she said she had not got it—I went up again, she followed me up, and abused my friends—I went down again, to, see if she was there—she was gone—I ran after her down Church-way, and found her—I said, "Give me my half-crown"—she said she had not got it—I met a policeman, and gave her in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Drunmond-crescent—I was at Nathan-court, and remember the prosecutor leaving the room, and going down stairs—I followed him down, and beard a noise in the passage—I opened the prisoner's room door, and saw the prosecutor pulling the prisoner's hand out of his right hand pocket—I saw half-a-crown in her hand—she at first said she had not got it—then she said, if she had she would stick to it—she came up stairs and abused the company, then went out—the prosecutor followed, and gave her in charge.</p>

I live in Langley-street, Long-acre—I was at Nathan-street—we missed Anslow from the room, I went after him—the prisoner's room door was pushed open—Peake went in first—I followed and laid hold of Anslow, took him out of the room and up stairs—he said he had lost half-a-crown, and would have it or have her taken to the station—the prisoner came up and was abusive—she went down again, came up, abused my friends again, then went down and went out—the prosecutor and Peake followed, and I followed her into Church-way—she was then in custody, and put into a cell—a woman was sent to search her, and there was a scuffle in the cell—I looked through the door, and saw half-a-crown in her hand—she was making towards the water-closet, and said she was going to put it down—the searcher prevented her.</p>

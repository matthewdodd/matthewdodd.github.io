On Saturday, 7th Feb., I went to bed at 12 o'clock, having shut up my shop—the fan light was safe—I was called up between 7 and 8 o'clock, and found the fan light broken—I missed a boot which had hung close to the fan light, and which could be reached through it by means of a stick and hook, which have been shown to me by the constable—the shop</p>

On the morning of 8th Feb., I was on duty in Gray's Inn-road, in plain clothes, and about 20 minutes to 6 o'clock saw the prisoners outside the prosecutor's shop—I watched them till about half past 6 o'clock, and then asked them what they were doing there; they both said that they were waiting for a man coming from the railway; another policeman came up, and we took them both—I found on Smith the boot produced, he said that he found it at the station; I found on Harrison this treacle plaster—I went to the fanlight and found it broken, and dirtied with treacle plaster, which is used to prevent the glass from falling and making a noise—at a quarter before 6 o'clock Harrison had this stick, with this hook (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) attached to it; but when I took him the hook was in his pocket.</p>

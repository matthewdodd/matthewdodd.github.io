                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Physicians, and have been for many years resident medical superintendent of Penley House, Hackney, which is a house for the reception and care of lunatics—I have from 140 to 150 lunatics under my charge there—on 19th April, I went to Sion House, Turnham-green, with Mr. Lutwidge, one of the Lunacy Commissioners—we saw Mrs. Leander there—we conversed with her on the subject of the establishment, and received information from her—we heard from her that she was keeping the establishment—there were about eighty persons in the house according to her statement—I examined several of them—one was Juliana Robinson, another was Sarah Medwin; also Susan Gladman, Elizabeth Stewart, and Mary Burgess; those I specially had conversation with, and the whole of them I found to be decidedly of unsound mind—Mr. Leander was present at the time I was having the conversation—I made myself conversant with the arrange<lb></lb>ments of the house, partly from inspection, and partly from information I derived from her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you the proprietor of the lunatic asylum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am the licensed superintendent—I am not the proprietor, and have no pecuniary interest in it—I am not paid by the number of patients who go there—I receive a salary—Mrs. Robinson was the first person I saw, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186406060033"></xptr>
               <p>then Mrs. Medwin—we went into a room and had a special conversation with her, from the way she was running on—I spoke to several patients, but did not make special notes—I should suppose Mrs. Robinson's age to be about fifty-three—she is subject to delusions—I call a person subject to delusions of unsound mind—in the ordinary acceptation of the word there is a very broad distinction between persons of weak intellect, and persons who are insane, but there are so many circumstances surrounding every case, that I cannot give you an answer.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Persons of strong intellect may be insane, may they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there a difference between a person called insane, and a person of weak intellect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I should hardly like to affirm that there are a great number of persons whose intellect is so weak, though hardly insane, that they could be hardly trusted to take care of themselves—there are certainly a certain number of persons of weak mind who you would not leave to take care of themselves—it is a question of degree—you are to understand that I call persons who are too imbecile to take proper care of themselves, lunatics—I am not aware that there are a class of persons who would be received in a lunatic asylum, who are yet quite unfit to take care of themselves in ordinary life—one of Mrs. Robinson's delusions was, that she never slept at night, as by the will of God she was prevented from doing so—persons do sometimes sleep badly at night, but I am putting it as she put it to me—another of her delusions was that the people about the neighbourhood of Stratford insulted her, and that in consequence of their insults, she was locked up in the station-house—it is not probable that the whole neighbourhood would insult one individual—I have not taken the trouble to ascertain whether she was locked up to prevent her being insulted—the (act of her being locked up, may not be a delusion, but the course, must, I think, be a delusion—she was gen<lb></lb>erally incoherent—she stated that it was intended that she should have been a governess; she was never educated for one, but by the will of God she was prevented from being a governess—I did not ask her what she was brought up to be, she stated it without—I have not ascertained whether she was brought up to be a governess—there was no other delusion that I took notice of—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTIN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">passed over Mrs. Medwin's case, she being a person whose detention in this asylum would not be justified by law</hi>)—in Susan Gladman there was a total loss of memory—she could not answer me any questions I put to her—I asked her how long she had been in the house—she said she did not know—I asked her if she had been there a year, she did not know; if she had been there a week, she did not know—her memory was quite gone—it is impossible to say her age, but about thirty—I should add that she was subject to epileptic fits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is not lunacy, is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It assists—it very frequently assists in breaking down a person's memory—the next was Mary Burgess; she is idiotic, and totally incapable of understanding at all—she is in the ordinary term silly—she is subject to epileptic fits, and dribbling at the mouth—I am taking the statements from the patients themselves—she did not tell me that she was subject to epileptic fits, but those about her did—I do not take the statement of one lunatic as to another—a person told me she was Subject to epileptic fits, and I also took it from her appearance—the next person I found insane was Elizabeth Stewart—she was labouring under chronic mania with excitement—I do not by chronic, mean that she was never without a lucid interval—she became excited while I was talking to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186406060034"></xptr>
               <p>her—she talked incoherently, and said that she was confined in consequence of falling in love with her brother's servant's brother—it was impossible for me to judge whether those persons were all of the poorest class, but I should think they were not the lowest class—I did not go on any other occasion, nor is there, to my knowledge, any other medical man who did—I was there between two and three hours.</p>

               <persName id="t18020602-44-person355">Q. </persName>
            You are the brother of the prisoner? - A. Yes; he lives at North-End, near Fulham; he buys and sells horses: On Saturday, the 24th of April, about half-past five in the morning, as high as I can guess, I got up, and my brother came to the door, and told me he was bid money for a horse yesterday, but did not choose to take it; he had since thought he would take it, and was going to Smithfield to see if he could find the person; I went with him; and, at Stamford-bridge, very near Walham-Green, a man came out of a lane with a bag upon his back, and asked me if I would buy a coat and waistcoat; my brother said he wanted a waistcoat; and then the man pulled this waistcoat and these breeches out; my brother gave him eight shillings for them; I attended at the Magistrate's after my brother was taken up, but I was not asked any questions about it; I am sure these are the same things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifton. Q. Where do you live? - A. I am a butcher, and live at Walhamgreen, about a mile from my mother's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the 24th of April? - A. Yes, I recollect it, because it was on a Saturday; and I was coming to Newport-market, upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180206020019"></xptr>my business, and my brother was taken up the Sunday-week following.</p>
               <p>Q. You have the man here, I take it for granted, from whom you bought these things? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020602-44-person356">Q. </persName>

            Because I don't know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Your brother is a horse-dealer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. No other trade? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he once lived as groom with Mrs. Bachelor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020602-44-person358">Q. </persName>
            Has he been no servant with her at all? - A. I believe he has.</p>
               <p>Q. You attended the Magistrate to give evidence, but did not give yourself the trouble to tell your story? - A. I was asked no questions.</p>
               <p>Q. You chose rather that your brother should be committed to Newgate for trial, than give yourself the trouble of telling your story? - A. I did not wish him to go to Newgate; I told Mr. Jepson I had seen him buy them, and he said I should speak, but my brother was then taken away.</p>
               <p>Court.

            When was in your brother lived with Mrs. Bachelor? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did he live with her? - A. As coachman; I cannot say whether it is two or three year ago.</p>

            When did he leave Mrs. Bachelor? - A. I cannot tell; I entirely forget.</p>
               <p>Q. You and your brother must have been upon good terms; when did he first become a horsedealer? - A. I knew him buy and sell horses eight or nine years ago, when he was in a gentleman's service.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a married man? - A. Yes, he has been married, I believe, five or six years; he has got a boy three years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether he wore a livery or not? - A. To the best of my recollection he did not.</p>

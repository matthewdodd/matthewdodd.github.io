                  </hi>. I keep an outfitter's shop in the Minories. The pri<lb></lb>soner came and represented himself to keep a tailor's and outfitter's shop—he said he had to get a chest of drawers and a washing-stand for Captain Clark—that he lived at No. 6, Lincoln's Inn-fields, and we were to make the drawers—he said he was making clothes for Captain Clark—I said I should like to see Captain Clark, in case he would like any alteration—he came again in a day or two, with a drawing of the drawers and a signa<lb></lb>ture—I got on with them, and he ordered me to send them a week after<lb></lb>wards—believing that he had an order from Captain Clark, I sent these things—I have inquired, and found the prisoner keeps a cabinet-maker's shop in Lincoln's Inn-fields, not a tailor's and outfitter's—I have not found Captain Clark.</p>

I was employed by the prosecutor to carry the drawers on the 14th of Septem<lb></lb>ber to No. 6, Lincoln's Inn-fields—it was a lawyer's chambers—I made Inquiries, and could find no such person—I returned with the drawers, and on the 16th I went there, and the prosecutor said, "I have sent two boys with the drawers; I want you to go and see them delivered safe"—I went, and saw one of the boys with a truck—the prisoner was pushing behind—he said, "How is it you did not bring them up last Wednesday?"—I said, "I was up here, but could not find you"—he said, "It is up here, and it was No. 6, Bear-yard—there was no shop at No. 6, Lincoln's Inn-fields.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, at 85, Rupert-street, Pimlico—Saturday afternoon, 2d October, about half-past 3, I was in Barbican, at the Aldersgate-street end—I saw two men fighting, and stopped to look at them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186510230021"></xptr>
               <p>while doing so the prisoner came and pressed against me as close as he could, on the right hand side, and I felt a jerk against my waistcoat pocket—I had my watch suspended by a chain—I looked down the moment I felt the jerk, and found my watch gone, and looked across the road and saw the prisoner running as hard as he could—I followed him, and called "Stop thief!" several times—I followed him out of Aldersgate-street into Carthusian-street, as fast as I could; I am not a very great runner—an officer saw him running and pursued—he was stopped in Charterhouse-lane—a boy picked up my watch and gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there other people looking on at this fight besides you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—no one came near me but the prisoner—there was no pushing at all; some of the people might have passed me, but the watch was gone then—the moment I felt it gone I looked across the road, and saw the prisoner running.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, at Britannia-place, Islington—on Saturday afternoon, about twenty minutes to 4 o'clock I was in Long-lane, and saw the prisoner come round the corner of Charterhouse-square, coming up Charterhouse-street, as I was going down from the corner—as he was running I saw something go out of his hand—it was a watch—I stopped the prisoner—a lad picked up the watch, and put it into my hands—an officer came up in a moment or so, and the prosecutor afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the watch fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was thrown not three-quarters of a yard or a yard from the prisoner's hand—he had just stepped on the kerb as he threw it against the wall—there were no other people running at the same time; not for half a dozen yards behind him; he had got ahead of them all; they had not turned the corner—when I stopped the prisoner he said, "It is all right; let me go, it is nothing."</p>

On the afternoon of 7th October, I saw the prisoner running at the corner of Carthusian-street—I followed him—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" as soon as I started after him—he got into Charterhouse-square, and ran through into Charterhouse-street, leading into Long-lane—I got up to him after he was stopped by the last witness—this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was handed to me—I found nothing on the prisoner.</p>

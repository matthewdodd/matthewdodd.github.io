                  </hi>. I carry on business with my brother James, as engineers, at the Southwark Iron-works; the prisoner was in our employ. On the 21st of April I saw him go into the Fox public-house—I followed, and noticed him go into the back-yard—told him I had been informed that property had been concealed in the premisse in the back-yard—he said he knew nothing about it—I said I should search him, which I did, and found nothing—I said be might go home, I would wait and search for them—he ran away—I pursued, and took him to the station—I found this article on his person—I did not see him leave my premises.</p>

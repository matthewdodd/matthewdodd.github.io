                  </hi>. I am a baker. On the 25th of August, about a quarter to ten o'clock at night I was at the prisoner's house—he is a publican—I called for a pot of half-and-half, which he brought, and did not leave it with me, because he asked for the money before he would de<lb></lb>liver it—he took it back immediately—I had no quarrel with him about that—I called for it again—he brought it, and said the same again—I showed him sixpence and threepence, and said if he would give it to me I would pay him for it directly—he took it back again—he came into the tap-room after, without the beer—I said to the waiter, "<hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, bring me the pot of half-and-half"—he did so—I drank it—the prisoner made no objection to it—that was almost directly after—It was the same pot that the prisoner had brought—he left it standing on the bar—I was in t he tap-room, close against the bar—I asked the prisoner to drink, and he would not—I asked him again, two or three times—I then told him if he did not drink, I would throw some of it over him, and I did so—there was not much left at that time—four of us had drank—I do not think there was half a pint left—he was standing close by me at the time, against the tap-room door, about half a yard from me—I threw it over him, in to his face, and he directly stabbed me with a knife—he did it the instant I threw it over him—he stabbed me with his right hand directly—I did not see where he got the knife—he did not fetch it from any where—there was no time for that—It was done at the instant—the wust have had the knife in his hand—I was stabbed on the side of the nose—the knife remained in my nose—after he stabbed me I turned round—he had run at me, and caught hold of me by the face—there was a bit of a seullle—I directly turned round and said to Harris, "See what the raseal has done—he has stabbed me"—Harris tried to pull</p>

               <p>the knife out of my face, and then I tried, and pulled the handle off, but the blade remained in my face—I directly ran to Mr. Watts the chymist—It was there pulled out with a pair of pincers—after he stabbed me, he had ran and caught hold of my face—I tried to get from him, and struck him in the face, to get away from him—we had no scuflle before I was stabbed, but what I have mentioned—I had known him for about two years, but never had a quarrel with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the prisoner's house on the night in question, near Floyd, in the tap-room—he called for a pot of half-and-half, which the prisoner brought and put down—Floyd asked him to trust him—he said he would not, and took it back—Floyd called for it again—he brought it and took it back again—the waiter came in, and Floyd got it from him—we all four drank round—I was sitting with him—the prisoner saw me drinking—Floyd asked the prisoner to drink, but he would not—he asked him a second time—he would not, and then Floyd threw the remainder over him—he had said, if he would not drink, he would do so—the prisoner was very close to him indeed at that time, and as the prosecutor threw the beer in his face, the pot went within nine or ten inches of his face—they then immediatly both closed in a fighting kisd of manner, in a kind of rally—I saw Floyd throw the prisoner on the seat, and stike him several times in the face while he was down on the seat; and all on a sudden, Floyd jumped back and said, "Look here, look here"—I had seen no sign of stabbing until that time—I was quite close to him—when he turned back and said, "Look here, "the knife was in h is face—I did not see it until after the scuffle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Nathan Hart. We keep a general shop at Wellington-street, Woolwich. On Monday, 3rd March, a man came to the shop, and asked for three-farthings-worth of tobacco; I told him I did not sell less than a pennyworth—I sold him a pennyworth, and he gave me a sixpence—I gave him fivepence back, and put the sixpence into the till—there was no other silver there—in an hour or an hour and a half, I looked at it again, and discovered it was bad—there was no other sixpence then in the till, and no one had been to the till—on the Wed<lb></lb>nesday I marked it, and gave it to the policeman—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am related to Mr. Wood, a grocer, in Woolwich, a few doors from Mr. Hart's. On Tuesday, 4th March, I was attending to Mr. Wood's business—the prisoner came in and asked for a penny-worth of tobacco, he gave me a sixpence—I told him it was bad—I bent it, he said he did not know it, and wanted me to make a half-penny worth of tobacco—I said I could not—I gave the sixpence to Mr. Wood, who sent for an officer—I afterwards went to the station, and when I returned to the shop, I found two bad sixpences in the basket of onions which the prisoner had stood close to—I took them down to the station and marked them—these are them.</p>

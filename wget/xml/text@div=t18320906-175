             - we keep a marine-store shop in Portpool-lane. On the evening of the 8th of February the prisoner came and brought a little pocket-globe for sale - he asked 8s. for it; I said I would not buy it - he then asked if I would oblige him with the loan of a shilling on it till the next morning; he said it was for another young man - I lent him 1s.; he left it, and went away; the Policeman came in about ten minutes, and I gave the globe to him - the prisoner never called again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When was this? A. It was in February, about the 8th, I think; it was on a Tuesday; I had not seen the prisoner before; it was by his dress I knew him - he had at the Police-office the same dress.</p>

             (Police-constable G 67). On the evening of the 8th of February I was near Tannam's shop- I saw the prisoner and two others near the shop; I did not see any one enter the shop; after they were gone I went in - I received this globe; and took the prisoner on the 19th of July; I had seen him once before in Cold Bath-square, but I had a prisoner in custody, and could not take him; I knew the prisoner by sight and by name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot say he went into the shop? A. No; I had been looking for him at different times - I had had him in custody before, I think a little before Christmas - I had been looking for him at different times in the neighbourhood of Old-street; I went into the Jolly Butchers, in Old-street, where I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JAMES CHILD. I believe this globe to be mine; there is a mark on it, under the maker's name; I had such a one, and lost it on the 8th of February from my shop, in <placeName id="t18320906-175-crimeloc977">Amwell-street, Pentonville</placeName>

               <p>ANN TANNAM re-examined. Q. What dress had the prisoner on at the Police-office? A. A long coat, and I knew his face.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has he the same dress on now? A. I cannot say; I believe I said at the office that it was a blue coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say he had an old blue coat on, with the pockets outside, a black waistcoat, blue trousers, and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060083"></xptr>round cap? A. No, only the blue coat and black waistcoat; he had the same sort of dress on before the Magistrate, but I could not tell the colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day-light? A. Yes; I looked at him before the Magistrate, and knew him immediately - I know he had the same sort of dress, but I do not know the colour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The clothes I now have on my master gave me the money to buy; I had not one thing then that I have now.</p>

            . I keep the Three Jolly Butchers, in Old-street-road - the prisoner was in my service for some time - he came in January or February, but I paid him weekly, and cannot say exactly when he came to me - I think it was in February; I think he had been with me three or four months when he was taken - I gave him money to buy some clothes, and he has them on now, excepting, I believe, a dark waistcoat, which is now with me - he had been three or four months with me before he purchased them; he used to go publicly about the street - he did not conceal himself; he used to take my children about.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What clothes did he come in? A. I cannot exactly say - he had a dark coat on; it might be blue or black; I believe he had a dark blue coat - he had several pairs of trousers - I cannot say whether any of them were corderoy; I never saw any - he had a brown pair, and an old green pair; he had a dark waistcoat and a light one; I do not know whether his coat had pockets - there was no pocket outside; there might be the cape of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live at No. 67, Old-street. On the evening of 23rd Dec. I left my house about 25 minutes past 6 o'clock—I left no one in it—the doors and windows were all fast and secure; I am very particular—I was fetched home at near 7 o'clock—I found a large mob, and the house in possession of the police—I went inside, and was shown the things that were taken away; two pairs of trowsers, a coat, a waistcoat, a shawl, and a piece of cloth—I had left them in the back room—the coat was hanging up, and the trowsers, waistcoat, and shawl were in the cup-board—I did not miss those things till they were produced—the prisoner was in custody—I found a pane of glass broken in the window of the back room where the cupboard was—there were several persons in the place before I got there.</p>

TALFOURD SALTER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the breaking in the back parlour window large enough to admit a man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but a man could put his hand in, and lift the catch up, and then he could lift the window—there is a little yard at the back of the house—anybody getting out of the house could get away—they had to get over a little wall to get into the yard—there is a gate that had been opened—it had been fastened by two bolts, one at top, and one at bottom—the cupboard that some of these things were in was not fastened.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, G</hi> 74). About 7 o'clock in the evening on 23rd Dee. I was called to the prosecutor's house in Old-street—I was placed in the front, and the sergeant went to the back—there were a few persons in front of the house—I stood there two or three minutes, the prisoner rushed out, and nearly knocked me down with the rush—I took him into custody—he said, "You need not hold me so tight, I have not done any<lb></lb>thing."</p>

I went to the prosecutor's house that night—after posting the last witness at the front door, I went to the back—I got over the wall, and going into the back yard I found the window had been broken, and was up—there were two of the neighbours in the yard in their shirt sleeves—I found this coat, and trowsers, and shawl, and piece of cloth in the yard—the prosecutor has identified them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> We two neighbours went into the yard at the same time that you did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They went with me—the wall is about five feet high.

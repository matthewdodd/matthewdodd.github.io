                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Albany, who keeps a se<lb></lb>cond-hand clothes shop in Castle-street, Bloomsbury. At half-past twelve o'clock on the 4th of May I left home, and returned about ten minutes to six—I found I was wanted at the station, where I saw this gown and the prisoner, who was in custody—it is my gown:—I had left it safe hanging for sale, on an inner door.</p>

On the 4th of May, about six o'clock in the evening, I was standing in George-street, St. Giles—a young man came to me and said, "Stop that man," meaning the prisoner—I went and stopped him, and took the gown, produced, from under his arm—I said, "I want you"—he made no answer—I took him to the prosecutor's shop—I did not ask</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector K</hi>). On 2nd November a man named Morris Cohen was brought to the Bethnal Green station, and I entered the charge, which was unlawfully receiving a pianoforte, value 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which bad been obtained by fraud from Jules Gautier—he was brought up at Worship Street on that charge on 3rd November, and remanded till the 10th; bail was accepted, but it was not obtained till, I think, the 8th or 9th—there were three remands, and the last hearing and committal was on the 24th, and on the 25th the depositions were completed—on 4th November I went to Cohen's premises in the Minories, which had the appearance of a wholesale dealer's in boots and shoes, but inside the warehouse I found a large quantity of goods of various descriptions, and musical instruments—on 10th November Ann Hardy attended to give evidence with reference to a piano of hers, obtained by false pretences, but there was no charge entered against Cohen with respect to that—I first went to the City Bank on 10th November, and saw one of the clerks there—I went again on 12th November, and saw the defendant Gliddon there, the manager—I went there in conse<lb></lb>quence of this letter received from him. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Private. The City Bank, Aldgate Branch, November 11th, 1876. Mr. Inspector O'Callaghan. Sir,—re M. Cohen. I am sorry I did not see you here yesterday, but I shall feel much obliged if you will call upon me here on Monday between 11 and 12, or Tuesday the same hour. The fact is, that, believing in the entire innocence and integrity of the prisoner, I have agreed to be a witness as to his character, but if he be a well-known receiver of stolen property, and known to the police as such, I should prefer aiding the police to obtain a conviction than to assist one of the worst kind of criminals. I shall be pleased, therefore, to tell you all I know, and would only urge you to thoroughly investigate the character and conduct of Cohen that the real truth may be arrived at, and if he be bad, I should, of course, prefer not being mixed up in it I am, Sir, yours obediently, A. Gliddon, Manager.") I alluded to the receipt of the letter, and he said he was at the police court when I called on the 10th, and had not returned—he asked my opinion about the case—I expressed a belief in Cohen's guilt, and said "There will be a number of other charges with regard to a man named Francis, goods obtained by him having been found on Cohen's premises, and taking that into account, and having regard to all the facts, I have no doubt of Cohen's guilt"—he said "Of course you must do your duty, but you must remember what will be the fate of his wife and daughters if he is convicted, and not press him more than you can help"—he said "Cohen has done only what is done every day in the City, buying goods without asking too many questions, or something like it, but one of the clerks expressed his dissent from that remark—I told him I had not called about Cohen, but about a man named Francis, who had dealings with Cohen, and had an account at the same bank—understood him to say he had no account, but only paid in enough to meet cheques as they were drawn—I found him in John Street, Minories—I was serving a warrant at the time, and I told Gliddon so—on 17th November I was at the police-court—the case was then in the hands of Mr. Wontner, on behalf of the Treasury—when I was at the police-court on 10th November, Danziger was sitting in the solicitor's box, with Cohen's wife and daughters, and Mr.</p>

               <p>Gautier's solicitor applied to the Court to allow his client to withdraw from the prosecution—that was at the opening of the case, and Mrs. Hardy had not given her evidence—three pianos had been found on the premises that morning, and J told the Magistrate that there would be other charges forthcoming, and I put forward Mrs. Hardy, and having heard that, the Magistrate declined to allow the case to be withdrawn—I had seen Mr. Barrett, the salesman of the Anglo-Continental Company, and the manager, also; neither of them appeared at the police-court on the 10th or the 17th, they had been summonsed to appear—on the 19th Mrs. Hardy's evidence was gone into, and the case was remanded to the 24th—Gliddon and Danziger were present on 17th; I cannot speak positively about Lazarus—I think they were all three there on 25th, when Cohen was committed on both charges—the case of Mrs. Hardy's piano was proceeded with in this Court.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. I have produced this charge-sheet—the charge is "Morris Cohen, 28, St. Peter's Street, Mile End Road, shipper and leather merchant;" I took that description from him—I put Jules Gautier, as of 62, Camden Road, St. Pancras, pianoforte manufacturer, under the head of person charging—he was the only prisoner at the time—under the head of charge how disposed of by Magistrate, and what offence proved; I have entered that there was a remand to the 10th, 17th, and 24th, and then tried Central Criminal Court," that means, the Magistrate committed him for trial at that time; I found that Gliddon was the acting manager of the Aldgate Branch, of the City Bank, the clerk asked my name and address and I told him—I made inquiries about Francis' account and mentioned Cohen's name in connection with him, I then received the letter, and on the Monday, I think the 12th, I went to the bank and Gliddon told me that the bank was opened in May, 1876, and he had been manager since then—he also told me he had been manager of the branch at Pad<lb></lb>dington, he did not say that Francis' account had been opened by a previous manager and not by him—he said that he had not seen Francis that he could remember except once—the clerk told me that a good many inquiries from banks had been made in regard to Francis, and Gliddon told me the same—he mentioned Mr. Hillman, the previous manager, and said that Francis had a respectable reference—I do not remember whether Francis' account was opened by him or not—it is my impression that he said "Buying goods without asking too many questions," and the clerk differed with him—he told me that he firmly believed in Cohen's innocence, but he said "Of course you know more about him than has been given in evidence"—I did not see Francis' account; I asked the state of it and they said that he had no balance—Cohen's account was not shown to me, and I did not inquire about it—I understood him to say that Cohen had been an old customer of the bank, but he could not be of that branch as it only opened in May.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jules Gautier, a pianoforte maker, who was defrauded out of a piano on November 1—I gave evidence before the Magistrate on 3rd November with reference to the charge against Cohen—I remember seeing Gliddon and Lazarus there that day, but not Danziger; we had no conversation—the case was remanded till the 10th and on the evening of the 9th. Gliddon and Lazarus called, but my husband was out—Gliddon asked how long he would be; I said that he might be in a few minutes—he waited some time, and then said "Could I see in the morning?"—I said "You will have to be very early, because we have to attend at the police-court."—he said "'That is just what we have come about; it is a dreadful affair altogether about Mr. Cohen; I have known him myself for twenty-five years and I know he is quite innocent, and this affair has put bis family in great distress of mind, and we have called on you to-night to see your husband to induce him not to prosecute, him as I know he is innocent of the charge"—I did not ask him who he; was he gave me his card—he said "Do you know whether he has instructed a solicitor?"—I said "I think he has instructed some one"—he said "Do you know who it is? "I said "I think it is some one in Gray's Inn Lane, but I don't know the name—he said "Do you know the solicitor's private residence?"—I said "I do not"—he said "We can see the solicitor, which will save your husband the trouble of going to the court in the morning"—he said "What did you pay for your instrument?"—I said "25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said 'Weil, we will pay you the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the piano, and you must have been at some expense, we will pay all your expenses besides, and see you are not out of pocket by it"—I told him I was sorry, as he knew Mr. Cohen was inno<lb></lb>cent that he had got into trouble, and I hoped he would be able to prove his innocence—when he said there was no occasion for my husband to appear in the morning, I said "But what about the Anglo-Pianoforte Com<lb></lb>pany? "—he said "We have settled with them, and they will not appear"—he stayed a little while waiting for my husband, and had some private conversation with Lazarus, perhaps a dozen words, and he said "I can't stop any longer, I shall be at Paddington to-night, if you want me you know where to find me," and he went away, leaving Lazarus, who remained till</p>

               <p>my husband came, about 8 o'clock; they had a conversation, but I did not hear it all because a customer came in and spoke to him—my husband went for a policeman, as Lazarus would not give his card—I heard my hus<lb></lb>band say "I believe Cohen is a rogue, and you are another; you want me to compound a felony, and I would not do it fur 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," or words to that effect—I went to Worship Street next morning and saw Gliddon and Lazarus, but I am not sure Danziger was there—he was pointed out to us one day at Worship Street; I don't know which—they had no conversation with me that morning—the case was heard and remanded to the 17th, and on the evening of the 16th Gliddon came with one of Cohen's daughters—I do to him "What about the old lady?" meaning Mrs. Hardy, who I heard give her evidence on the 11th—he said "We have seen Mrs. Hardy, and she will not prosecute, and you will be left alone, and it will be a great expense to you and cost you a lot of money"—he said he would return at 9 o'clock, as I said I thought my husband would be in then, but instead of returning at 9 o'clock he came at 8 o'clock with Miss Cohen and saw my husband—on every occasion he said that if we could get Cohen out of trouble it would be a good thing for us, as Cohen was a large shipper of pianos and would recommend us—we went before the Court next morning, the 17th, and the case was remanded to the 24th—on the evening of the 23rd Gliddon called with Miss Cohen and Danziger; he introduced Danziger as Miss Cohen's intended and said they were to be married, and said what a pity it was this had happened, and there was the same proposition as before—Gliddon asked whether we had received a subpoena—I said I did not think so—he said "Because if you have had no subpoena, there is no occasion to appear"—he also said there was no doubt that the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. could be put in some one's hands until the case was over, or something like it—he went away, but Danziger and Miss Cohen staid till 10.30 and then left without seeing my husband—we went to the Court the next morning, when I believe the depositions were read over and we had to sign them.</p>

I did not know Mr. Gliddon before November 9th—he gave me his card with "Manager of the City Bank, Aldgate branch," on it—he did not say that Cohen had solemnly declared to God that he was innocent—he said that the family were in great distress of mind, but he did not say that they had applied to him—he said he had known him for twenty-five years, not that he was well known in business for twenty-five years—he said "I have known Mr. Cohen myself twenty-five years"—I was present when a great number of witnesses were called to Cohen's character, gentlemen of respectability, Common councilmen in the City, and men who said that they had known him many years as an honourable man—the case relating to the pianos was tried on the following day following the other case on which he was first convicted, and even after the first convic<lb></lb>tion I believe many gentlemen came forward to give him a character—Cohen's daughter came with Danziger on the 21st and 23rd and remained with him some time after Mr. Gliddon went away—I believe she said that she kept the books and that the entries were correct and regular—she seemed in great distress about the matter—my feelings were strongly appealed to as a mother—she said "I suppose you have a family yourself?"—she said that she had kept the books since her eldest sister was married and she knew all the business—I was quite aware that my husband had engaged a solicitor before I saw Mr. Gliddon—when Mr. Gliddon said that there was no reason for my husband to go next morning if he had employed a solicitor, as lie</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pianoforte maker, of 62, Camden Road—on 2nd November, I gave Morris Cohen in custody on a charge connected with a piano of mine—I had watched his house, 28, St. Peter's Road, the previous night, with my son Lewis—on 3rd November, I attended at Worship Street police-court, and gave evidence—I did not see the present defendants there that day—on 9th November, the day fixed for the re-hearing, I went home at 8 o'clock and found Lazarns sitting there, and my wife said this is the gentleman who was here with the bank manager—she turned to Lazarus and said "This is Mr. Gautier"—he greeted me in the usual way and said that he had come to speak about that unfortunate affair of Mr. Cohen, it was a most unfortunate affair for him, but he was a very honest upright man—I said "You may say what you like about his honesty, but if it had not been for my son following the van I should have lost my piano"—he said "Oh,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187706250050"></xptr>
               <p>that is very possible, but nevertheless you must admit you were hasty in giving him in charge"—I said "The reason I gave him in charge was because he told me so many falsehoods this morning"—he said "What falsehoods?"—I said "Well, he told me that the piano had gone in the first place to his house, back to the Minories, and back again to his house, whereas we know very well that the piano did not go to his house, but went to a public-house, the Devonshire Arms"—he said "Oh, that is where the mistake is, I can easily explain that to you, it is quite true that the van stopped at the Devonshire Arms, but while the men were there some of the men went to Cohen's house"—I said "I thought that might be the explanation given of that," and rose from my seat—he asked me to sit down and listen to him—I said "No, I have beard quite enough will you oblige me with your card"—he pointed to a card lying on the piano; I picked it up and found it was that of Mr. Alfred Gliddon—I asked my wife whether that was this gentleman's card—she said "No, his friend gave it to me"—I asked him for his own card—he said that he had none—I said "Then give me your name hand address, will you?"—he said "No, I won't, I don't see why I should, in fact when I came here I thought I was coming to speak to a gentleman, but I find I have made a mistake"—I said "Well, I want your name and address, and if you don't give it to me I shall lock you up"—he said that I had no right to demand it—I said "Well, I will show you," and locked the door and went out—I also said "You and your friend have come here for the purpose of compounding a felony, and under those circumstances I consider I have a perfect right to know who you are"—he appealed to my wife and a gentleman who was there, and said "What have I done, I have said nothing—I fetched a policeman, and when I got to my house again Lazarus was coming down the steps, and said "You have imprisoned an innocent man, you will repent if it costs us 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I replied "I believe Cohen is a thief, and you are another"—he said "And so are you"—next morning the 10th, I went to the police-court, and Mr. Gliddon spoke to me outside the Court—he touched me on the shoulder and said "Are you Mr. Gautier?"—I said "Yes"—I knew who he was, because he had been pointed out to me—I said "What for?"—he said "On behalf of Mr. Cohen"—I said "You had better speak to my solicitor," pointing to a gentleman with me—I stood close by, and Gliddon said to my solicitor "I can assure you Mr. Cohen is a very honest, upright man. There are many men here, some of them influential City merchants, ready to speak well of him. This is an unfortunate affair for him; he has been made the dupe of either Mr. Harris or Hart"—that is the man who took the piano off the premises—my solicitor said "What is it you want my client to do?"—he said "Well, let him keep away, he has no need to appear"—he said "I cannot advise him to do that"—Gliddon said "Well, you do as you like, but you will find that we are so thoroughly satisfied with Mr. Cohen's respectability and innocence that we shall spare no expense in his defence, and we shall obtain remand after remand, so that it will be a source of trouble, expense, and anxiety to your client"—he also said that the Anglo-Continental Company had withdrawn from the case, and written a letter to the Magistrate to that effect—my solicitor said "The only thing that can be done is to make application to a solicitor, asking his advice whether ray client had not better withdraw the charge"—Mr. Gliddon then said "Oh, that will do, we don't want anything illegal or irregular, and if you do that,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187706250051"></xptr>
               <p>that is all we want you to do"—I afterwards went into Court, and there was another remand—I heard an application made for permission to with<lb></lb>draw the charge, but in consequence of another charge being made against Cohen the Magistrate declined to allow me to withdraw from the prosecution—on 16th November, the evening before the further hearing, Gliddon came to my house with Miss Cohen, and said what a pity it was for Mr. Cohen to have got into this trouble and bother, and it was a bad job for those daughters of his, and he could assure me that he was an innocent, upright man, and no doubt, after he got out of his trouble, he would be a good customer of mine, and would recommend me to his friends, many of whom were shippers or merchants; that the Continental Company had been settled with, and had received the price of their pianos, and would not appear, as they had withdrawn from it altogether, and that Mrs. Hardy also would not appear, as they had arranged that, and there would be no one there; I should be the only one—I replied that those considerations could not have the slightest influence on my conduct in the morning, because if I found myself left alone, the better course for me to pursue would be to cause the application to be made again—Danziger was at my house once; he came with Miss Cohen after the committal.</p>

                  </hi>. On 14th Nov.

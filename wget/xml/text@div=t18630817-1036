I am an outfitter, of 77, St. George's-street—on Saturday, 25th July, about 12 o'clock, I was at the Blue Anchor public house—the prisoner was there; she was a stranger to me—she stabbed me in the chest without making any remark—I had no altercation with her, but I had with some one else—I do not know whether it was a friend of here—they asked me to give them something to drink, which I did—I trod on a female's dress in front of the bar, and said, "I beg your pardon"—she caught hold of me in a very improper manner, and I threw a little liquor over her out of a glass—the prisoner then stabbed me through a thick coat and shirt.</p>

I live at 15, Back Church-lane, St. George's, and know Mr. Jacobs—I was with him in front of the bar, and when we came outside the door I saw the prisoner strike him on the breast, but do not know what with—I pulled him away, and saw that he was stabbed right through the lappelle of his coat—I found the prisoner fighting with the last witness.</p>

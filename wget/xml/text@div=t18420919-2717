                  </hi>. I am a widow, living in St. Martin's lane. On the 13th of September I was sitting at work in ray master Mr. Wood's front parlour, in North-street—the prisoner came in between six and seven o'clock for some work—it was not ready—she was told to sit down on a chair behind me—she left at twenty minutes to eight—when she had been gone about ten minutes I missed my scarf from the back of the chair—in about five minutes I received information from a little boy—there was a young woman sitting opposite me at work, but none behind me—the scarf has not been found—it was safe when she came in.</p>

I took the prisoner between eleven and twelve o'clock the next day—I called about ten at her lodging, and knocked—she answered me—I asked if Miss Medburst lived there—she made no answer—at the same moment the landlady came out into the area, and I asked her if Miss Medhurst lived there—she said there was no such person in the house—I went again, and took her at half-past eleven o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 63, Ernest-street, Regent's-park, and manage the business for Mr. Goodburn, who lives at Islington. I open all letters that come there, whether addressed to Mr. Goodburn or not—I was at home on the Saturday evening; no letter came to me or Mr. Goodburn, from Mrs. Holderness, of Eton—I was there when Mr. Sculthorpe called, and for four or five hours before.</p>

                  </hi> I am a pawnbroker. The house, 63, Ernest-street, Regent's-park, is my house of business—I was not there last Saturday—I never received the letter.</p>

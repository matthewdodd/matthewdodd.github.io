               <p>prisoner in Mr. Anderton's, the grocer's shop—he bad got the deceased woman in his arms, apparently getting her to the shop-door—he had his arms ex<lb></lb>tended in front of her—when be got her near the door, his front was in front of her, and her back was towards the door, coming out; the door was open, this was after 12 o'clock—when he got her to the door he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her out, pushed her—there is one step from the door—she fell on her back on the flags—she did not catch hold of anything—there was a long board on the left-band side of the door as you go in, and her right arm struck that, or the band that she had a basket in—I made use of a very obscene word to the prisoner, and said, "Don't <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> the woman out," and one of the persons present struck him—he did not assist in taking her up, but he wished it done.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, living in Baldwyn-street, Old-street. On the night of 13th Sept. I was in Old-street, opposite Mr. Anderton's shop, sod saw the prisoner push the old woman out of the shop—she was standing in front of him at the time, rather in a sidling position—he pushed her with his bands—she fell down the step and on to the pavement—I went across the road, and struck him—I assisted in carrying the woman into the shop—the prisoner said that the old lady had called him a cheat, a rogue, and other aggravating words, respecting the change of a sixpence—she did not attempt to strike him at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Clare, and sister to the prisoner. I happened to be at Mr. Anderton's on the Saturday night when the old woman was there—she was in the shop, abusing him, for nearly three-quarters of an hour, making use of very bad language—he desired her to leave the shop, which she refused to do—he came deliberately from behind the counter, and put his hand on her shoulder to push her towards the door—he did not push her; he laid his hand on her shoulder behind to put her towards the door—her back was towards him—when she got within about a foot of the door she laid hold of a board, which was temporarily fixed at the left-hand side of the door, it gave way, and she fell back—I was close behind him all the time—I saw her catch hold of the board—she was after<lb></lb>wards carried into the house and died.</p>

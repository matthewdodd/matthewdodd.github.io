On the 19th of April I was at the prisoner's house, in Well-street, with Burrows; I found him and his wife in bed, I told him to get up and dress, as I had come to search his house; they did so. I called up Burrows who identified the bed-gown his wife had on, and the sheets on the bed. He said he could prove how he got the gown. Mrs. Thrupp was fetched, and the property stated in the indictment found.</p>

On the 20th or 21st of February I saw the prisoner buy these things of a country looking man, dressed in a smock-frock; there was a counterpane, a pair of sheets, gown, shift, and a pillow-case. I saw the country dealer buy them for 2 l. 10 s., and immediately saw the prisoner go up to him and give him 2 l. 15 s. for them;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182205220042"></xptr>he asked me if they were a bargain - I said no, or I should have bought them myself.

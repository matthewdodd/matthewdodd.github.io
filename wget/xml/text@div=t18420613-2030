                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live in Long-lane, Bennond<lb></lb>sey. In consequence of directions from Mr. John Marks, I went to a person named Jones, in Rosemary-lane, and got a copper boiler—I put it into my stable—it was safe there about eleven o'clock on Thursday night. the 26th of May, and it was missed at ten minutes past seven' on the Fri<lb></lb>day morning—I know Maddox—Close keeps a horse and cart in our yard—I have since seen the arm of a boiler, and, to the best of my belief, it is part of the boiler we lost that night—it is the property of John Marks. o</p>

On the morning of the 27th of May I was in the back<lb></lb>room at Mr. Burney's, talking to the child—this copper was put into the shop, but I cannot say by whom—Burney was not at home—I went and put the copper into the back-place—I then went out, and saw Close in a cart, driving off—there were several other carts in the street—Burney came in afterwards at the back-door.</p>

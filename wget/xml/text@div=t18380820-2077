                  </hi>. I am a lighterman and wharfinger, at Horsleydown, and reside at Sydenham. On the 20th of July I saw two of my tarpaulins doubled up—I gave orders for their being put into the punt named the Hope, under my own eye—it was lying in the lighter-road, Horsleydown—the punt was shoved off, and remained there till the following Tuesday, when I received some information, and went along-side—I went to where the tarpaulins ought to have been, and the small one was gone—one of them is here, and it is mine—the prisoner is a lighterman—I do not know that he works any where—I have seen him at George Stairs—the premises ad<lb></lb>joining these stairs—I never let or lent any one the tarpaulin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know a man named Stemp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw him till at the police-office, when he was in custody, as I was informed—I saw him at the bar—the prisoner and the wharfinger's man were in custody—I do not recollect that the prisoner said a word—he was not asked in my hearing of what size it was-at the first examination I asked the Magistrate as a particular favour to let it stand over—I was present during the first and second examination—I was not absent during any time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the prisoner asked whether that was the Mr. Stemp to whom the property was consigned, and did he not say he was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I can most conscientiously say that he was not asked one single</p>

               <p>question, and that he did not say that during the examination—he did not say that was the Mr. Stemp that was present—I saw this tarpaulin last on the 20th of July on my own barge deck—I gave orders to two of my ser<lb></lb>vants to fold it up, and put it on board, as I stood on the bage—we had a great deal of corn landing at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames-police surveyor. About half-past six o'clock on the morning of the 23rd of July I was on duty in the river—I saw a barge at Bellmont-wharf, Nine Elms—some coal-heaven were carrying something up in sacks—I landed at the railroad, and went on the wharf adjoining Messrs. Frances and White's wharf—I could see into the bottom of the barge—I went into a granary, and found some wheat I had been looking for—I then went into the coal-heaver's lobby, and found this tarpaulin, which the prosecutor has identified—it has his same in full length upon it—it was in the back of the lobby, with some sacks in front of it—you could not see it without going into the lobby—I was at the Bellmont wharf between two and three o'clock that same afternoon, and saw the prisoner come on the wharf—he walked up towards me—I asked him if he was the lighterman that brought up the wheat in the morning—he said he was—that he brought it for a Mr. Stemp, and he was employed by a gen<lb></lb>tleman he did not know, whom he met at Shad Thames—he asked him if he would take a barge with seven quarters of wheat to Bellmont-wharf, and get it landed for Mr. Stemp, and meet him on the day after at the India-house, and he would settle with him—I asked him what barge he brought it from—he said the Thomas, which was the barge I had seen—he said he did not know to whom she belonged—I asked him whether he had any covering to the wheat—he said "No"—I asked him how he came by Mr. Dudin's tarpaulin—he said he had forgotten that, he did not know it was Mr. Dudin's, but he knew him very well—Mr. Dudin's name was upon it—I asked him whether he could read—he said "Yes," but he did not look outside the barge to see the name—I told him Mr. Dudin's tarpaulin was well marked, and he made no answer—I took him to the India-house and no one was there—he said the tarpaulin was with the wheat-in leaving the India-house, I asked him what he thought of his friend—he said he was led into the trap, and was too old to be caught.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not the wharfinger examined? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The stable-keeper was who had taken charge of the wharf—the wharfinger was there-his name is Norton—he was asked whether Stemp was in the habit of having consignments to him on that wharf, and he said he was.</p>

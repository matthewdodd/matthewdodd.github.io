Doughty Street—on 18th October, about 9.30 p.m., I went out for some beer, leaving the door and windows fastened, and when I got to the next house I heard our door closed—I went back, and on looking through the keyhole I saw the prisoner walk<lb></lb>ing on tiptoe through the hall—I went in and fastened up the door and found the prisoner in the back parlour—I said, "What do you want?"—he laid, "I have made a mistake. I wanted Miss Wilson, of Mecklenberg Square"—I called a gentleman down from the drawing-room and said, "This is a man I know nothing about," and he detained him while another gentleman fetched a constable—the next morning I found this key (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>), it opens the front door—I am sure I left the door shut—there were several lodgers in the house.</p>

            , he lives in the same house; I work at Mr. Scott and Quinton's glass manufactory in East Smithfield; I went out of my room at seven o'clock in the morning, I did not return till six at night, I left no one in the room; when I went out I locked the door and took the key with me; I returned at six in the evening, I found the door open, it appeared to have been bursted open; the hasp is loosened and part of it off.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up in the room, did you miss any thing - A. Not till the next morning; my landlady desired me to look over the things; I then searched the box, I missed a shawl and a handkerchief, I had seen them on that day, before this young lass broke the door open. The prisoner nursed a child in the house while the mother went to work. Mrs. Terry's sister, the prisoner, was in the house after I came home at night; at ten o'clock in the forenoon of the next day I came home; I spoke myself to the prisoner about it, and then Mrs. Terry spoke; I asked her how she came to break the door open; she strongly denied it, she said she would tell my landlady, the landlady would not tell her father, he would beat her. I do not know what further passed; they went out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What are these things worth - A. Between four and five shillings.</p>

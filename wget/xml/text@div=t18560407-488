                  </hi>. I reside in Park-street, Kennington, and am a painter. On the night of 23rd March I saw the prisoner Rose, and was induced by her to go to a house in Granby-street—I went up stairs into a room with her—it was just before 12 o'clock—we had not been in the house more than two minutes before she blew the candle out, and immediately I heard a knocking at the door—she went down stairs, and I went after—she opened the door, and let Hedges in—I could see him, and I have no doubt about his being the man—he struck me at the door—he said nothing to me; nothing passed—I do not know that they said anything to one another—it was all in such confusion—Rose went rapidly down the stain, and I after her—when I was coming down stairs I had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. safe in my pocket—I had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when I was in Waterloo-road, and I had given Rose 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the room, before she blew the caudle out—I had that 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my waistcoat—the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had put into my trowsers pocket, and buttoned it—when Hedges knocked me down, I was knocked almost senseless, and I felt the hand of one of them at my trowsers pocket, but I could not tell whose hand it was—I felt for my money at the door, and it was gone—when I felt my money had been taken, I got out of the house, and ran down the street, and Hedges ran after me—he came up with me, about nine or ten houses down, and struck me again, and then I lost my senses entirely—that blow brought me to the ground—I do not recollect anything being said by either of them—I kept calling the policeman—I was not drunk—I had only had a pint of beer the whole evening—when I lost my senses, I was carried down to the station, and the doctor attended me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 168). I was on duty in Waterloo-road, at nearly 1 o'clock, on the Sunday morning—in consequence of Mrs. Miller's communicating something to me, I went to the top of Granby-street, which runs into the Waterloo-road—I found the prosecutor lying senseless on a stretcher, and four constables with him—I do not remember seeing Robert Collins, the railway policeman, there—in consequence of other information, I went to No. 73, Granby-street—I there found Hedges in bed—I told him he must get up, and go with me to the station, respecting a man who had been ill used in the street—I said, "You must go to the station, till the man comes to his senses, to see if he can identify you"—Rose had followed after me into the room, and, when I made that statement, she said, "He does not know anything about it"—she said that the man had given her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when I took Hedges to the station, the prosecutor was not sensible—it was after 2 o'clock before he came to his senses—when he did, I intro<lb></lb>duced Hedges to him, and he identified him, very shortly after he raised himself up, but he was some time before he came to himself—Rose was brought in afterwards by another officer, and the prosecutor identified her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the constables of the South Western Rail<lb></lb>way. Between 12 and 1 o'clock on that Saturday night, I heard cries of "Police!" in Granby-street—I saw the prisoner challenging the prosecutor to fight—I went out of the gate to see what it was, and saw the prisoner challenging the prosecutor—I believe the prosecutor struck the prisoner first, and with that the prisoner knocked him down—I saw that distinctly—the prisoner attempted to lift him up, and a bystander said, "Don't ill use the man any more, you have done quite enough to him"—the prisoner said, "As often as you get up, I will knock you down"—the man appeared in quite a senseless state—I sent a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man for the police—Hedges said to the prosecutor, "You have got as much as you can put up with for half an hour"—the police afterwards arrived, and the prosecutor was taken on a stretcher to the station—I was called there between 2 and 3 o'clock, and I could identify the man—I heard the prisoner say, "If you have a mind for anything, come on: what were you doing in that house? what were you doing with that girl?"—it was then the prosecutor struck the prisoner in the face, and then the prisoner knocked him down.</p>

               <p>I went out between three and four o'clock on the 5th of January. I was not above twelve minutes before I returned and found my door unlocked. I went up to my room on the one pair of stairs, and I saw the shadow of somebody going up stairs, higher up than my room. I went into my room and saw a hat box, in which I had a gauze-cap open, and the cap gone. The prisoner was stopped in coming down stairs; I taxed her with the robbery; she had no apron on; Mrs. Waterloe called out, that she had dropped the things at her door. When she was in my room, she was shuffling her cloaths, and she dropped a key which would unlock my door; the constable came and searched her, and found five more keys upon her, and a piece of iron, fit to open small locks; the things were in her apron.</p>

               <p>I live in the fore-garret in the same house with Mr. Cavill. I heard somebody come up stairs and knock at the back-garret door; I opened my door, and saw the prisoner drop the cloaths. She wanted to get away, we made her go down stairs, and she was stopped going down.</p>

               <p>I went to enquire for a person in the garret; as I was going up stairs a woman pushed by me as fast as she could. I never was in Mr. Cavil's room; the apron was not mine; I never wore a coloured apron in my life. The keys I had were the keys of my rooms and boxes.</p>

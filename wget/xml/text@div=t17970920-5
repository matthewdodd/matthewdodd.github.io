               <p>Q. How do you know you had your watch when you went into the house? - A. I am perfectly clear of that.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in liquor you know? - A. I am very clear of that.</p>
               <p>Q. A great many girls spoke to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. None? - A. I do not know, none, I am certain I had my watch then.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you certain? - A. I know I had it.</p>
               <p>Q. You must give us some reason why you are certain; did you find your watch again afterwards? A.- No, I found nothing; the pawnbroker produced the watch at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. But what makes you clear that you had your watch when you went into the house? - A. I certainly had it, and saw it just before, while I was with that person.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen it? - A. I do not think it could be many minutes before I went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you saw it before you went into the house? - A. Most assuredly I am.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you got into the house, you went to bed, I suppose? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. With this woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put your breeches? - A. Under the bolster.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite certain of that? - A. Yes; when I awoke in the morning, I found the breeches upon the bolster instead of under it.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the woman? - A. She was gone; when I came down, I enquired of the person, who I took to be the master of the house, and found the was gone; I told him what I had lost, and left the house; I know nothing more than that, till I understood she was taken up, this was of the Friday, and she was taken up on the Wednesday following, when my watch was produced, and one of my pocket handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that woman, and tell me if you can swear that is the woman you picked up? - A. No; I cannot swear to her.</p>

             sworn. - I am constable of St. Martin's in the Fields: On the 5th of August last, I was sent for by Mrs. Clark, the last witness, to take charge of a woman that had stole a watch; I went to take her backwards, and I conceived that she was hiding something between her legs, upon which account I called for a woman of the name of Mrs. Brown, to come and search her, she searched her, and said she could find nothing; there was a parcel of girls in the front parlour, and I believe a man or two might be there at the same time; there were three or four girls.</p>
               <p>Q. In the front parlour? - A. Yes; I took her up stairs, and stripped her, I could find nothing at all about her, and I told her, you have had the watch, and the duplicate is somewhere about you; Mrs. Brown said she had better own where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must not tell us what she owned? - A. I went down stairs, and found a huswife with eighteen duplicates in it, lying behind the door, I think the must have kicked it from where she stood; amongst them was a duplicate of a watch, pawned at Battersea; then I went to Bow-street, and she was committed upon Mrs. Clark's evidence: I went to Battersea, and found the watch there by the duplicate.</p>

This watch was a silver one, and was in my bed-room, and is worth 2 l. 10 s.; there was a gold seal, worth 1 l., and a gold key, worth 6 s. I saw it safe at ten o'clock in the morning of the 30th of September - the prisoner had been painting the house. He came to fetch his tools away on that day; he was only painting the lower part of the house. I sleep in the garret. I went to my bed-room again at eleven o'clock that night, and missed my watch; it had hung up against the bed. I saw it again on the Friday following, (this was on Monday,) the seal and key were gone. On the Thursday after the robbery, I had applied to an officer, and the prisoner was taken. He at first denied it; but before he was examined, he voluntarily said he had given the duplicate to Herbert, in whose possession I found the watch.</p>

            . I am a painter. I worked in the same house with the prisoner. I only know him by doing this job. I left eight days before the robbery. I only did the graining - there was more painting to be done when I left. On Monday the 30th of September, two men brought the prisoner home in a violent fit. I was in bed, and was called down to him. He recovered in about an hour, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230017"></xptr>gave me the duplicate of a watch, saying he was going into the country, and it was not in his power to get it out. I took it out, and shewed it him next day; it was pawned for 15 s. It had a gold seal and key to it, which were afterwards pledged by my direction. On the Sunday night his master came to me; I told him the prisoner had given me the ticket, and I got the watch out. Daniels claimed it. I had not asked how he came by it. He lodged at the same house with me.</p>

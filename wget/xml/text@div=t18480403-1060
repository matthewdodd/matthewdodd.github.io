                  </hi> I am a harness-maker, at Upper Fitzroy-place, New-road. ON 24th Feb., about three o'clock in the morning, I was at the bar of a public-house, at the corner of Foley-street—the prisoner came in—he is deal and dumb—he had a pipe in his hand—he made a motion with his mouth—I thought he wanted a bit of tobacco, and was going to give him a bit—my friend said, "He looks very spiteful; if you do not mind, he will thrust that pipe into your eye"—I said, "No, he will not, as I shall say nothing to him"—he went towards the bar—the landlady beckoned him to go away, as if she did not want him in the house—I gently laid hold of his arm, and led him outside the door—he was on the threshhold, turned round, and made a des<lb></lb>perate thrust at me with his fist in the eye—I tried to lay hold of him, and made a run at him, and he hit me a second time in the same eye—I fell on my temple, and recollect nothing more, for five or six minutes, when I was in the hands of the police—I was taken to the hospital, and was there till the 21st of March—I offered him no violence—I cannot say that either blow was intentional—to the best of my recollection I said, "Come on, old fellow"—he must have turned round to have struck me by the way I held him—I think the pipe had a little spike to the bowl.</p>

                  </hi> I am a carver and gilder, at Mary-street, Regent's-park—I am no relation of the prosecutor. On 24th Feb., about three o'clock in the morning, I went with him to the public-house—the prisoner came in and made dumb motions—there was blood and scratches on his fist as if he had been fighting; and he appeared very savage, as if he had been excited—my friend took him by the left arm, by the advice of the landlady, as she wished him to go—as he went out, he turned round, with a short pipe in his right hand, and put it in his face—he turned as if to strike him—it was not acci<lb></lb>dental—I only saw one blow—I had been to the party—I had only had a drop of porter to drink—my friend was quite sober—we only had a pot of porter at the public-house.</p>

                  </hi> I am house-surgeon at the Middlesex-hospital. On 24th Feb. Roberts was brought—there was a slight wound under his left eye-lid, the upper and under lids were enormously swollen—the eye was considerably inflamed, and for a long time there was danger of losing the sight—in about ten days he had erysipelas in the head and face, not every sever, but it is always dangerous—he has perfectly recovered his sight, but there still remains a weakness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gaoler of Clerkenwell Police-court. The three prisoners were in my custody on Wednesday last—Curtis was in No. 3 cell, and Bennett and Groves in No. 2—I was sitting in the room attached to the cells, and I heard Curtis first speak to Bennett, calling her <hi rend="italic">Sal</hi>—he said he was glad <hi rend="italic">Lou</hi>, that is one not in custody, had got off, for she had been to see him in the <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, meaning Clerkenwell-prison—Bennett then directly called out "<hi rend="italic">Nobby</hi>," (meaning Curtis,) "the <hi rend="italic">swell</hi> says it was a black-handled knife, but that's a lie, it was a white-handled knife; he made a mistake there;" and she said, "<hi rend="italic">Nobby</hi>, they have got your cap and <hi rend="italic">Tom's</hi>"—he said directly, "<hi rend="italic">Sal</hi>, did you say it was my cap?"—"No," said she, "I did not own that"—"Well, don't you," he said, "there is enough against me, <hi rend="italic">old girl</hi>, I will try and get you <hi rend="italic">girls</hi> off, for I am sure of being <hi rend="italic">lagged</hi>; and it is no use all getting <hi rend="italic">lagged</hi>; I will get you two off"—they both said, "Thank you."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 49.)

I heard a noise in the passage; I had lived in the house a fortnight before this happened, and had moved three doors away. I went in, and a female told me there was a Frenchman had got Sarah Bennett's little sister, and wished * * * I instantly went to the room; Bennett said, "For God's sake go in, and get him out." I went in, and he was in the room with his trowsers down, and the little girl sitting on the bed crying. I asked what he was doing; she said he wanted * * * He said, "Me will pay the girl." I said, "You had better go out of the place, or I will fetch a policeman." The candle went out, and he went to the window, and smashed both his hands through it, and by that means I suppose he cut his hands. I laid hold of him by the throat, and said "Come out, I will show you the way." I took him down, and he stood on the step of the door, talking to me some moments. I told him to be off about his business, and he got off the pavement. I stood at the door about five minutes, and then went home and went to bed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Bennett's Defence.</hi> I met with a friend, and went to a public-house; we had not been there two minutes before the Frenchman came in, took my sister outside, and gave her 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

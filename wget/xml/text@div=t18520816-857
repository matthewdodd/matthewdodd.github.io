On Saturday, 31st July, at half past 4 o'clock, the prisoner came and asked to see a monkey jacket and pilot trowsers which were hanging over the window—he bid a price, and said his captain would not let him have any money, but if I would bring the clothes down on Sunday morning, at 8 o'clock, the captain would pay for them—at half past 6 the same evening he came again, and said the captain was on board, and would pay for them—he took me on board a ship at the Surrey Canal Docks, Rotherhithe—he asked me for the bundle; I let him have it—he went down the companion ladder, and asked two boys where the captain was—they said, "Ashore," and that he would be half an hour, he was at the dock lodge—I said, "Let us go ashore"—I did the bundle up, and took it with me—the prisoner got down the ladder first—I was just stepping on to the ladder and he gave me a <hi rend="italic">drive</hi> with his fist, and snatched the bundle—he ran off while I was getting down the ladder—I pursued him, calling "Stop thief!"—he jumped on some ships, and afterwards got on shore again, and then on some rafts of timber—he then put the bundle in his mouth, jumped into the canal and swam for about two hundred yards—I went round to stop him, and lost sight of him—a watchman told me something, and I saw the prisoner on</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman, at the Surrey Canal Docks. I apprehended the prisoner in an old barge—I had not seen him running, he was wet, and quite exhausted; he could scarcely stand—I found this bundle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the bank near the barge—he spoke English to me—and asked for some water—the barge was on the bank of the canal—he stepped from the barge on to the towing-path.</p>

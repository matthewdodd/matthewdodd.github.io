            . The Prisoner brought a light Dun Gelding, on the 2d of December, to my Mother's, at the Plough in Princess-street, by Leicester-Fields . - She keeps an Inn there; he offered it to me for Sale; I asked him how he came by it; he said, he had it of his Father to set him up in a Way of Business, because he could not give him Money: He asked me nine Guineas for it; I bid him six Guineas that Night, but he would not take it; it stood all Night at my Mother's: The next Day he came again, and then I bid him seven Guineas; he would not take it then, but he came afterwards and took the Money. About a Week afterwards it was advertis'd in the Papers; upon which I went directly to Esquire Wright's, and two of his Servants came to our House; the Horse was show'd them in the Stable, (this was the Thursday after) and delivered to them directly. - I never saw the Prisoner after the Bargain was made.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to the last witness: The prisoner came in for two sheep's melts, about half past six o'clock in the morning. I told him we had not any; he asked when I should have any; I told him we did not kill any sheep at all, he might get some in Long-lane; he said it was for a child in a fever, to put on its feet; he went out, and in about ten minutes after I heard the chain of the watch rattle, it hung on a china image on the mantle-shelf, in the parlour behind the shop; I heard the parlour-door shut to, and I went toward the parlour, and saw the prisoner go out of the shop, I was backwards chopping wood for the fire; directly after he went out of the shop, I acquainted Mr. Porter of it, and he went after him, and overtook him, and he was taken to the Compter. Mr. Hart, the constable, brought the watch back soon after seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door between the parlour and the shop fast? - A. Yes; it was a spring lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was shut? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the shop-door open when you left it? - A. Yes; the man opened the shop before he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch that morning before? - A. Yes; I saw it hanging up.</p>

             sworn. - On the 10th of April, a little before seven, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Loesely's; the girl came out and said he had got her master's watch; I followed him and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260025"></xptr>stopped him, I got a person to assist me, and we took him to the Compter; when we got to the Compter-door, the constable took the watch from him; we then went to the prosecutor's with it, and he said it was his.</p>
               <p>-HART sworn. - I took this watch from the prisoner, at the Compter-steps; I saw it in his left-hand and took it from him; I found the chain in his left-hand waistcoat-pocket. (Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Q. Was your wife at home at the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When that old gentleman took hold of me he broke the chain off; he said it was his watch, and if I would give it him he would let me go; I said it was not his, that I gave four guineas for it; I was running home about my business, I had sent a porter home with some fish that I had bought at Billingsgate.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Porter.) Did you offer to let him go if he gave you the watch? - A. No.</p>

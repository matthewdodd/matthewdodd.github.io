On Sunday, the 11th of June, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, a bundle, containing the articles stated in the indictment, was placed near the window - the garden gate had been left open - I did not miss them until the officer came. I found them at Lambeth-street Office, in his possession, one of the bodies was then missing. They are worth 10 l. at the least.</p>

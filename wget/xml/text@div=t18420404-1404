                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, living at No. 25, Lud<lb></lb>gate-street, City. On the 12th of March I received a letter, which I now produce, by post—it came by the first delivery in the morning—I imme<lb></lb>diately went to the Justice sitting at Guildhall, and got the assistance of Roe the officer—by his advice I addressed a letter to Mr. Richard, and put it in the post-office—I went the same afternoon, with Roe, to No. 55, High-street, Borough—I found Greenland the shopman there—I waited there with Roe about two hours, then left directions with Greenland—on the 14th the prisoner was brought to my shop in custody—I knew nothing of him whatever—I had never seen him in my life to my knowledge—I went to the station, and entered the charge.</p>

At the time in question I was shopman to the post-master, at No. 55, High-street, Borough—the prosecutor and Roe came there on the 12th of March—they gave me directions what to do, and on the Utah of March the prisoner came to the post-office, and asked for a letter in the name of Richard—I told him he could not have it, as it was in master's possession, that master had the care of those letters, and asked him to wait—I sent out for a policeman, but the boy could not find one, and the prisoner left before one arrived—I followed him to Tooley-street, Borougn, and there gave him into custody—he never had the letter—the letter produced by the prosecutor has been posted at our office in High-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Register-office, Somerset House. I have known the prisoner about thirty years—I have seen him write—I was a townsman of his, and have received letters from him for relief, and answered them—I received a letter from him the beginning of March—Roe came to me about the 14th or 15th of March, and at that time there was a letter lying on my table which I had from the prisoner that morning—I am sure the letter produced is his hand-writing—I should say it was his—it is some years since I saw him write—I had received several letters from him previous to the 14th of March, and relieved him when he</p>

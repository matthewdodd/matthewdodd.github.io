               <p>To Gladman. What time did you set out with the bags from the Post-office? - About a quarter past three, upon the 16th.</p>
               <p>How far had you gone before you met any body? - About the five or six mile-stone beyond the Highway; there a tall man came up to me as I was travelling down the hill, he damned me and swore very much at me, I said hallo mate, it is the mail, says he, that is what we want, then two more men came up, and knocked me out of the cart, and took my whip from me; they drove the horses up the, they turned out of the way into a field, at the distance of half a mile, or three quarters of a mile, from the road, they opened the cart and took the bags out.</p>
               <p>Were the three men all together then? - Yes, sir.</p>
               <p>What became of you all the time? - The short man stood over me with a cutlass in his hand, he lead me by the collar after the carriage; when they had taken out the bags, they asked me if I knew the best, I said, I knew no more about them than they did; after they had thrown all the bags and mails out, but one, they throwed me up in the cart, I begged of them not to kill me, they said they would not; the short man took a handkerchief and tied my hands behind me, and shoved my legs in, and put the iron bar across them.</p>
               <p>They shut you in? - Yes; they said they would take the smallest bags, I heard a chaise drive up upon the side of the cart.</p>
               <p>Did you hear nothing said? - No; I believed it was a one-horse chaise, and when I came to Holloway turnpike, the man told me it was a one-horse chaise; I don't recollect hearing them say any thing about it; I came back, as soon as I was able, to the post office.</p>
               <p>Are you able to form any recollection of the person of either of these three men? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner at the bar? - Yes; he is one, Sir.</p>
               <p>Are you able to speak with any certainty, belief, or recollection? - I speak the real sentiments of my heart; it is my real belief.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it in the field they put you into the carriage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200025"></xptr>How long did they keep you there? - They left me in the cart in the field, with my hands tied; I was in the cart pretty near three hours after they left me.</p>
               <p>Did you see the one-horse chaise at all? - No.</p>
               <p>When you speak of a one-horse chaise, it is only from the noise of it you suppose it to be so? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about a chaise by any of them? - No, there was not; one said they would take the bags one at a time, and the other said go fetch it here.</p>
               <p>What was the expression? - They said they were going to carry the bags one at a time, one of the men said go fetch it here; they did not mention what it was.</p>
               <p>How soon after that did you hear any thing? - I heard them loading the chaise, when I was in the inside of the carriage, laying upon my face.</p>
               <p>How soon did they come after the expression, go fetch it there? - I believe they came about three or four minutes after they put me into the cart, I saw nothing.</p>
               <p>Was it a dark night? - No; it was a bright star light night.</p>
               <p>Is this the short man that had the cutlass? - No.</p>
               <p>At what place and time had you an opportunity of observing this man? - While they were robbing the cart; I stood looking at them all the while.</p>
               <p>Had they any disguise over them? - No; only the short man had a handkerchief over his face that stopped me first, the other men had nothing over their faces at all.</p>
               <p>Had you any opportunity of observing either of the others till you got into the field? - No.</p>
               <p>It was in the field you observed them all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the short man keep on his handkerchief? - Yes; he never pulled it off at all, till he pulled it off from his face to tie my hands behind me.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the dress of the two men? - They had got a brown surtout coat on.</p>
               <p>Each of them? - No; one was without one.</p>
               <p>Which had the great coat? - This man.</p>
               <p>How near did you stand? - I stood just by the horses heads.</p>
               <p>How near was the prisoner? - I suppose it was the distance of three or four yards.</p>
               <p>Were they at the cart? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you an opportunity of observing them then? - All the while they were cutting the mails open, which was pretty nigh ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Which was it you spoke to when you desired they would not kill you? - It was the two biggest, this man and the other; that wanted to kill me, the little man said no, he would spill no blood.</p>
               <p>Were there any thing particular in his dress or appearance that struck you, besides having a great coat? - Yes; I knowed him by his voice, he talked so much of the brogue.</p>
               <p>What, the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, do you take upon yourself to swear the prisoner was one of the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I will ask him, he says he knowed me by particular marks, what marks is in my face he can know me by; can he know me by my speech among four, five, or six men.</p>
               <p>Court to Witness. Have you never met with other people that have the same brogue as he has? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you could distinguish his voice from any other person? - Yes, Sir.</p>

            . I live in Chick-lane, the prisoner came to me on Monday after the mail was robbed, I saw him again the Wednesday after, the 16th, he asked me if I wanted to buy any Bank-notes, it is a commodity I deal in, he had two notes, and asked me for some money, said he would bring more notes, came again with more notes, and wanted to sell them, I went to Mr. Lion about it, Mr. Lion advised, the best way was to go and apprehend him.</p>
               <p>Did you give information to Mr. Lion? Yes; I then sent for Mr. Clark who came and took him.</p>
               <p>Did Clark come by appointment to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was this upon the Thursday evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner come with any notes upon the Thursday? - Yes; he said he had three ten pound notes.</p>
               <p>Had you any note of him that evening? - He left a ten pound note, and a thirty pound.</p>
               <p>Did you make any mark upon the thirty pound note, so as to know it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that the note? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who did you give it to? - To Mr. Clark; when he came on Wednesday I asked how he got the notes, he said he robbed the mail.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you been intimate with him before? - Never before; he came in to buy a pair of gloves, and asked me to buy this watch, I did not buy it, it was the Sunday night, he asked eight guineas for the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What he says is quite false, the man has been cast and convicted of perjury here, and flogged in the yard, and fined, and in Newgate at the time of the riot, and he got out then, he is the man I hired the horse and chaise for of Mr. Chambers on Sunday morning at two o'clock, he and one Mr. Lions had a horse and chaise at Old-street road.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he never hire a horse and chaise for you? - No; I know nothing at all of that.</p>
               <p>This chaise was not hired for you? - No, my lord.</p>
               <p>Jury. I should be glad to know whether that note is the same, and how he knows it? - I put my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Point it out to the jury? - It is this mark in Hebrew characters.</p>

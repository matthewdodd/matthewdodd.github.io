                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 60.) On the 7th of Nov., about ten minutes past three o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in the Dover-road, and saw a female on the opposite side of the way, with a child in her arms, on the step of a door—I was about to cross to her—she coughed, to give a sort of signal—I went and put my hand against the gate of Mr. Collins's premises; hearing a noise inside, I went and spoke to the policeman to watch the part of the premises in Trinity-street—I returned, alarmed the landlord, and found the prisoner lying on the ground inside the skittle-ground, which is inclosed with a wall—his right hand had a mark on it of having been cut—the wall encloses the premises, it joins the house—after he was taken to the station I saw a stocking with some blood on it quite fresh—it was found close to where he had been lying.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 129.) On the 7th of Nov., a little after three o'clock, my attention was called to the premises of the Roebuck public-house—I heard a policeman's staff knocked against the door—I stood at the corner of Brunswick-street and Trinity-street—Ryrie came round the corner and said there was somebody at Mr. Collins's—he returned to the Dover-road—I stood there and looked at the door in Trinity-street—the door was fast, for I tried it—I looked up on the wall, and saw the prisoner on the tiles—the wall divides Collins's house from Trinity-terrace—it incloses his premises from the street—on seeing me, the prisoner dropped down back into the pre<lb></lb>mises—I and my brother constable were let in, and found him in the skittle-ground—I found a few lucifer matches on him—I cannot say whether he had stockings on when I took him—his hand was cut—there was broken glass on the top of the wall, which would account for that—you cannot get into the skittle-ground without going through the house or over the wall—there is one small space on the wall where you can get up—it forms part of the outer wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Roebuck public-house. On the night in question I looked over the premises, I went to the water-closet, skittle-ground, and round the different rooms of the house—I left the kitchen door on the latch—after I fastened up the house there was no means of getting into the skittle-ground without getting over the wall, because in the morning the fast<lb></lb>enings were as I. had left them—the wall forms the fence of my premises—it encloses them—my side of the wall is not accessible except by getting over the wall or through the house—I was aroused about three o'clock in the morning—I went with the constable to the back of the premises, and found the kitchen door, leading into the yard, open—it could be opened from the skittle-ground side, as it was only a common latch—the bar of the gates in the Dover-road had been taken down—they are at the opposite wall to Trinity-street, where a gig or horses might come in—I saw the prisoner secured—his hand was bloody—I afterwards saw the stocking found near where he had been lying on the ground—it was bloody—my attention was drawn to the kitchen dresser, and the dresser drawer, and a table-cloth, all which had blood on them, and on the latch of the door, which was open—there were two teapots on the table—a person getting over the wall into the skittle-ground might lift the latch, and enter the kitchen.</p>

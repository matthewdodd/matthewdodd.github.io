               <p>William Ward. I live in William Newman's House, where the Prisoner had work'd a Week; I miss'd the Money in my Chest on Friday Afternoon. I suspected the Prisoner, and charg'd him with taking it. He at first deny'd, but afterwards confess'd it; and pull'd part of it out of his Pocket. He said he had laid out the rest, which was 4 l. in buying a Horse, and some Clothes at Watford; tho' it was then but 7 Hours since he stole it. I found 7 l. 13 s. upon him, and I got the Money again for the Horse, but 36 s. was quite lost.</p>

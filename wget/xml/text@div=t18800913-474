                  </hi>. I am a travelling clerk attached to the missing letter branch of the General Post Office—in consequence of the loss of registered letters I was instructed to make investigations—on 3rd September I made up a test letter, and put in it five half-sovereigns, two shillings, and sixpence—I had previously marked them—I addressed the letter to Messrs. Rosenthal and Brunner. 18, Rue de Rivoli, Montmartre, Paris—it was in a registered letter envelope, and I sealed it down with the gum seal and posted it in the E.C. letter box at 4.50 the same day—I made a communi<lb></lb>cation</p>

               <p>to Inspector Martin at the office, and he afterwards communicated something to me—in consequence of that I sent for the prisoner, and saw him in the Inspector's room about 6.25 the same day—Constable Fry was there—I said to the prisoner "I am an officer from the missing letter branch; are you about to go out on your 6 o'clock delivery?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Are the letters in your bag for that delivery"—he said "Yes"—I said "Have you anything in your bag belonging to the post-office not on your delivery?"—he said "No"—I said "Were you facing up the collection between 5.15 and 5.45 this evening"—he said "Yes"—I said "At what table"—he said "No. 3"—I said "Did you see a letter addressed to Rosenthal and Brunner, 18, Rue de Rivoli, Paris?"—he said "No"—I gaid "I posted that letter at 4.50 this evening out of course, as several letters similarly posted are said to be missing; do you know any<lb></lb>thing about this letter?"—he said "No"—I said "Have you anything about you belonging to the post-office or at your lodging?"—he said "No" I said "I suppose you have no objection to be searched"—he said "No"—I told Fry to search him—the prisoner took off his coat and placed it on the table, and as he was doing so he removed a handkerchief from his tail coat pocket, and began to cry and wipe his eyes with it—Fry went on with the March—he searched the pockets of his trousers and waistcoat, but found nothing relating to the letter—at that time the prisoner had his handkerchief in his hand—Fry then went downstairs to search the prisoner's looker—the prisoner then put the handkerchief back in his right hand trousers pocket—when Fry returned I told him to search the prisoner again, and I told the prisoner to take off his trousers—he began unfastening them, and removed the handkerchief from his trousers pocket again—I told him to put it down, and pointed to, the table, but he stooped down and put it on the floor—Fry went to pick it up, and he asked the prisoner if there was anything in it—he said "No"—Fry then picked it up between his finger and thumb, and one corner fell down—he then untied a knot in that corner, and handed me the five half-sovereigns, two shillings, and sixpence, which I identified as the coins I had marked and put into the letter—I said to the prisoner "I identify these coins as the same I enclosed in the letter I have been asking you about; do you wish to say anything about them?"—he said "I have had them two or three weeks; I don't carry them for any par<lb></lb>ticular purpose"—I found nothing of the letter or envelope.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector attached to the E.C. district of the General Post-office—the prisoner was employed there as a letter carrier—on the evening of 3rd September Bradford spoke to me, in consequence of which I went to the the letter-box at the E.C. office at 4.50, and took out a letter addressed to Messrs Rosenthal and Brunner; it was in a registered letter envelope—at that time the prisoner was employed in the facing-room, facing up letters at the table—I saw the letter placed among other letters by Woodward, an officer employed for that purpose, and placed before the prisoner; that was about 20 minutes past 5—it would be his duty to take such a letter to the overseer on duty in that room, and it would then be taken to the "Out of Course" room to be entered in a book kept for the</p>

               <p>Q. Was the sash fastened over night? - A. I am not quite sure, but I thought it was bolted, or else I should have fastened it, it was down; when I came down I missed the things named in the indictment; I missed some of the articles, and my wife and daughter missed the rest; I missed a silver milk-pot, six tea-spoons, two silver salt-ladles, one pair of silver salts, and six silver table-spoons; I had seen some of them the day before, two tablespoons were about in common, and the milk-pot was upon the board in common use; I always lock the street-door, and carry the key up, and we thought she must have got out at the window; the next morning I went to be shaved, and saw a Mr. Clark, a pawnbroker, and I told him what the things were, and begged him to stop them and the parties if they should be offered to him; he went out and came back directly, and said, his man had taken the spoons in that mornings; he then advised me to go to the different pawnbrokers; Mr. Clark went with me, and the first we went to from his house was Mr. Davison's, a pawnbroker, and he said, he believed he had two of the spoons; he produced two of the table-spoons, and likewise a gown and petticoat belonging to my wife. We then went to several other pawnbrokers.</p>

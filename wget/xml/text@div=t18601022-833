On the morning of 30th August, I went to Mr. Carpenter's shop, 68, Cannon-street-road, St. George's in-the East, a pawnbroker—I found a hole bored about the centre of the shop shutters—I put the middle finger of my right hand in as far it would go and it went nearly to the glass—there was a lamp about fifteen yards off I saw some sawdust on the pavement right under the hole in the shutters—I went away and saw Walker and Franklin; Franklin was in plain clothes—I put him in a doorway about an hundred yards down on the opposite side of the street to watch the premises—I sent Walker to the back of the premises and then went away to get other policemen—I examined the shop next morning and found a hole bored through-the shutters and the iron plate, which is about 1/15th of an inch thick—it went through a second iron plate, and I could get the second joint of my little finger through—the plate-glass window was broken—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a piece of it; the whole of one pane was broken—it was 2 ft. 11 in. by 2 ft. 8in.—I received this screw auger, such as is used by burglars, from Inspector Hayes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LAWRENCE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is his name Timothy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but I have a second husband—Timothy had been a carman; he is between 28 and 29 years old—he is now in my employ, he helps me to carry on the business in consequence of my husband being away—he sleeps in the first<lb></lb>floor front-room—he had not a key of the door—there are two or three lodgers, but none of them stop out late—the door is always secured when the last comes in—I did not go to bed till very late—I dare pay it might have been 2 o'clock—I was sitting up in a little room—the staircase is overhead I and if he had come down I must have beard him—Slater-street is by the side the Eastern Counties Railway—I should think it is more than a mile from George's church, but cannot exactly say.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If your son had left your house after you went to bed I must you have heard it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the staircase goes over the room and I there is only a slight wooden partition.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you sitting in the room behind the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; underneath, the front room—the little room is made out of the shop—the room is over mine as well as a staircase—I could distinctly hear anybody walk into his room—I cannot tell what time any lodgers came in that night</p>

               <p>probably they might have retired to rest—I can distinctly hear the lodgers come from the top of the house—I had only one lodger then, and he had gone to bed before—I have two now—I do not know at what time the next wit<lb></lb>ness came in, but she saw my son in bed—I did not say that every lodger I had come in first—I said I did not know at what time she retired to rest—I think she had come in before my son went to bed—she had a separate room; a top room—there are three floors besides the ground-floor—I have a good deal to do in my business and after that is closed, I have to do a little needle<lb></lb>work as I have a large family—we generally shut up the house about 11—I there is a private entrance which the lodgers go through; that is always shut I but do not know who shut it—my other son sleeps in a room adjoining this one—he went to bed about 11—he is younger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This one retired about a quarter to 10, and the other about 11? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I cannot say what time the lodger went to bed—I do not consider my sons lodgers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know of your son being taken into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till next morning, Friday, about 6 o'clock—I did not then go before the Magistrate—I was up at the second examination, and was not called—I offered myself to Mr. Beard, a solicitor who defended my son, and ha did not call me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 22, Slater-street—on the morning of 30th August there slept in the house, me and my husband, and my children, Mr. Timothy and his wife—Mr. Timothy lives on the first floor—I went to bed about a quarter past 11, he was then in bed—I know that, because he got up and asked his wife to go to bed; she had been very ill all day—he did not leave the house, because I shut the door and went to bed at a quarter to 12, and heard no more—the house was all quiet—I do not know how long Mrs. Short and the Timothys have lived there—I have been there a year and nine months, and I found them there—Mrs. Short is my landlady.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you a husband living in the house with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he is not here—he is a weaver and is finishing his work—Timothy has a wife and a little girl—I did not notice what time Mrs. Short went to bed—I had not seen her for two or three days—I do not often see her except when I go down to pay my rent—she sleeps in the back parlour—I cannot nay who generally locks up the house, but I think the eldest boy, Thomas Short, aged about eighteen does, or else Mr. Timothy, who is older than him—the shop is next door—we have no latch key—we work at home and are never out late-my husband is never out at night, and when he comes home in the day time the door is open—I have let him in when he has been out—the fastening is a latch that pulls back; in the day time it has got a string by which you could pull it back, but at night it is generally taken off of the knob—my bed room is on the third floor, and Timothy's is on the first, but I am very quick of hearing, and am a very light sleeper; I can hear any slight noise.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that Mrs. Short's son by her first husband? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, her present husband is out of his mind—a person could not get in at night without being assisted by somebody inside if the string was taken off—it is taken off at night; the last one does it—I do not know who is generally last, but I believe I was, on that night, because I shut it when I came in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you did not take the string off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Timothy has not lodged there all the time I have—I have only seen him at home for the last ten or twelve months.</p>

                  </hi>. I occupy the first floor of Kelly's mother's house, and he lodged with her—I remember his being taken in custody, but do not remember the day of the week—on the night in question he came in at half-past 11 or a quarter to 12, and remained in my place till about half past 2 in the morning, because I had a child lying dead; he then went up to bed—about 3 o'clock the police came to my room door, which was open, and asked me who was up stairs—I said, "Only the persons who live there," and that they were all in bed—I showed him a light—Kelly was in bed, and he asked him to get np and go with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you sober when the police came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I had not tasted one glass of liquor or beer—the policeman knows I was sober—there was nobody there but one young man, and me and my two children—there are only two rooms in the house, which is No. 2, New-court, New<lb></lb>gate-fields—Kelly and his mother occupy the first floor up stairs, and I occupy the down stairs—I have lived there six or seven mouths—Kelly has not lived there so long as I have—I cannot say to a week how long he had lived there—I never made any acquaintance with him; I only noticed him come in and out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that a young man was with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had one child lying dead on the table, and another child living—the young man was only a neighbour—I cannot say at what time he came in, perhaps 1 o'clock, perhaps 2—he was there a great part of the time that Kelly was there, but was not there when Kelly came in; he went away to sea last Thursday—some other neighbours who had been there had gone—some of them left only a little time before the policeman came—I only occupy one room of the landlord—the neighbours who were there were Mrs. M'Carthy and Mrs. Harrington, neither of them are here—Kelly was stopping because the child was dead, and there was what we call a wake.</p>

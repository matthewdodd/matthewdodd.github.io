            . I am in the prosecutor's service. On the 29th of January the prisoner dined with master and me - master called me up stairs after dinner, and paid my wages; when I came down the prisoner asked if master had paid me - I said Yes; he asked if he paid me every Sunday - I said sometimes before it was due: master went out, telling me to take the key with me, which I generally do - the prisoner asked what time I should be at home; I told him about nine o'clock, and master had himself asked me that question, in the prisoner's hearing; the prisoner said, "I dare say you will be back by six or seven?" I said No - I went to wash myself, and saw the side door, which is close by the sink, unbolted; I bolted it, and went up stairs to put my clean things on, and while up stairs I heard the prisoner open the door leading to the passage, where the side door is - there was nobody else in the house - I ran down stairs directly; the prisoner then drew his chair to the fire, and said it was so cold he did not know what to do; he asked again what time I should be at home - I said about nine o'clock; he said, "I dare say you will be home by six or seven;" I again said I should not; he afterwards asked if there was a fastening to the parlour window - I said Yes; he went to see, and found there was- I went for a brush to a cupboard by the side door, which I had bolted, and saw it was unbolted again; I bolted it, then came into the parlour, and told the prisoner I was going to fetch master's dog from the cellar, - I went out at the front door, down the passage, into the cellar, and brought the dog into the shop; the prisoner then stood in the back part of the shop, where there is a door opening into the passage, in which the side door is - the prisoner played with the dog, and called it by its name; he was acquainted with it - it would bark at a stranger, but not at him; I called the prisoner out, and told him I must go- he asked what I was in such a hurry about: I said the sooner I went the sooner I should be back - he came out; I locked the front door, and put the key into my pocket - we went together to a public-house over the way; he asked me to treat him - we had a glass of rum and shrub each - he said he had no money; we parted there: I returned about half-past nine o'clock; master came home in about five minutes - we both went to bed: I got up about four o'clock in the morning, and about seven master called me up stairs, and complained of losing his money - I then examined, and found the side door was unbolted; I told master nobody but the prisoner could have done it - I had not examined the door after bolting it the second time; the key of that door was also missing - it is not usually locked at night; I had seen the key about a week before: it hung on a hook at the back part of the shop.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About what time did you leave? A. About a quarter-past three o'clock; I left all safe then - I did not speak to the prisoner about the bolts being undone; he had formerly lived in the house - I lived with Mr. Hand, a respectable butcher, before I came to master; he told me to leave, because he said I was looking after another place - that was the only reason; a young man out of doors had a sister at Brixton - she brought a bundle of things for him, tied in a white apron; he was going to leave, and gave me the apron to keep till she called for it; I gave it to the whasherwoman, and she told me not to tell master she had washed it - I put it into my bundle, thinking it was the young man's; I threw it out of my bundle when I was leaving - Mr. Hand's initials were on it: Hand had promised to give me 6s. a week, and only gave me 4s.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at a public-house at Shadwell, about eight o'clock on Monday morning; I asked him to account for his time from half-past three till half-past nine; he said he was walking in the Commercial-road, and over the wooden bridge and back to this public-house; the wooden bridge is a quarter of a mile from the public-house - I said I knew better, for I knew he had been in a coach on Sunday evening; he said he was not in a coach at all - I said I knew he was, and that little Ann and another woman were with him: he denied having been in a coach - I then took him to Mr. Russell's, but found nothing on him; I told Russell that, having known him many years, I had no doubt he would attend the office next day, without being in custody, and told him to meet me at the office at twelve o'clock - he was there before me; I found an old knife in his pocket with the point broken off - the cupboard door had been opened with something small; this knife would open it, but I cannot say it did - I could not find the broken point - he was detained after the examination; I called him out of the lock-up place, and said he knew he was in a coach, and must tell me where he was that day; he said he was, that he went to a house where this girl lived, and then to a house in Creechurch-lane.</p>

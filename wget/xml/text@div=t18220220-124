            . I was tried here in July, and convicted of stealing this silk; I was imprisoned six months. The prisoner keeps a shop in Field-lane, and deals in handkerchiefs and other things - I sold the silk to him, about two hours after I stole it, for three guineas; it was on the 8th of June, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you know him before - A. Never. Smith took me there, and went in with me, we dealt in the front part of the house; we went into the middle room, which was not very light - I told him the general price was 1 l. for a pound; he said he would give no such money, but would give me three guineas, which I took - he weighed it in three different parcels; I think he made it 11 lbs. 11 ozs., I took his word for it; he gave me 21 s. down and the rest next morning. I spent the 21 s. that night with Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate, you sold it to a Jew - A. Yes, and that Dynam was not the man, and then he was dismissed. He promised me 10 l. at Clerkenwell, to tell the Magistrate it was not him. I was not on my oath then - Smith lived on Saffron-hill. I was sober.</p>

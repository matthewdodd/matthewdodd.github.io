On the 4th of October I saw Wilkinson, he said a Mr. Cooper would be with me and give me some particulars to enter thirty bales of nux vomica, containing 750 bags. Mr. Cooper brought me certain warrants, and desired me to enter thirty bales of nux vomica by the first vessel to Amsterdam. We entered them at the Custom-house for the York Merchant vessel, laying in the London Docks; we entered them in the usual way, and gave the cocket, bill, and warrants over to Mr. Cooper. When all was done at the Custom-house I gave Wilkinson charge of my lug-boat and tarpaulings, with directions to take in the nux vomica at Bow-creek, which is by the East India Docks, on the Middlesex side of the River; he was to put them on board the York Merchant, then laying in the London Docks, which are five or six miles from Bow-creek. I do not know what occurred afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The warrants and cockets were delivered to Cooper to pay the charges - A. Yes. He represented himself as the owner. I was bondsman for the goods, that they should go to Amsterdam. I considered them in my charge, and expected to receive a lighterage on them; Wilkinson was employed by me, I expected to have to pay him. I had employed him several times before, but not constantly, he introduced Cooper to me as a merchant. Cooper entered into a bond as the exporter. It was put on board my boat from the East India Company's warehouse, Bow-creek, and therefore under my care - I gave Wilkinson charge of my boat and tarpauling, as my servant - it was cleared at the Custom-house in my name, as lighterman, and my name was on the boat. I gave Cooper in charge of an officer for a fraud, in conspiring to cheat the Government. I never saw it in any boat myself.</p>

            . I am superintendant of a floor in the East India Company's warehouses. On the 4th of October, I received an order to pack 750 bags of nux vomica in three different lots, and deliver it out of the warehouse for G. Cooper. I was to make thirty bales of the 750 bags. I proceeded to pack it in thirty bales on the 4th of October, it was done under my inspection. I packed it in coarse baggage, twenty-five bags in each bale, and on the 6th of October Wilkinson brought the warrant to me to deliver them. I delivered them into the hands of G. Smith, the wharfinger, to carry to Wilkinson's boat. Each bag weighed from 14 to 18 lbs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Cooper there - A. I rather think he came to me about them on the 3d, I delivered them on the 6th. I gave the wharfinger the warrants with them, and saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>MR. MARSH. The duties were not paid on them, they were to be exported free of duty; if they are consumed at home there is a duty of 2 s. 6 d. a pound - the article itself is not worth above 1 d. a pound.</p>

            . I am a tide-waiter. On the 9th of October, Wilkinson came to the London Docks on board the York Merchant; he said he had thirty bundles of nux vomica for the ship; the Captain told him to bring it alongside, which he did - the whip was lowered down to get up the bags, it is a rope with a hook - the mate told Wilkinson to hook the bundles, he said</p>
               <p>"No, if I do, that will tear the bundles; give me a pair of slings, and I will sling them," which he did, and they were got into the ship - I took an account of them, they were marked C, from No. 4 to 33, and were put down in the main hatchway, and remained there while we were waiting for other goods to take into the hold - I was the officer on board, and booked them as nux vomica, my duty was to watch them - it was impossible they could be meddled with without my knowledge; they were examined in less than an hour after, in consequence of Albert's coming, they proved to be cinders and coal-ashes, and not nux vomica - I saw them all examined; the cinders were small, so that if a book broke a hole in the bag they would fall out; two or three wrappers were round them, but the book is large.</p>

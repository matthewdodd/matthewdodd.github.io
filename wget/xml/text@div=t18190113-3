            . I am a farmer, and live at Stanwell. About eight o'clock in the morning of the 16th of December, I saw the prisoner in the Stanwell road, driving two cows. I asked him where he was going with them? he said they were for sale, and the price was 26 l. I offered him 12 l.; and after a little hesitation, he agreed to take 12 l. I told him to bring them into Mr. Stevens's straw-yard - he said he would, and went there with me. When he got there, Stevens asked him where he got the cows from? he said they belonged to his father-in-law, Webb, of Colnbrook. I left him there, and went to Hounslow, returned, and found him at the Swan, public-house, at Stanwell. Stevens had been and returned from Colnbrook. In consequence of what Stevens said, I ordered Sexton to take the prisoner in charge.</p>

He denied it, and still persisted that he had them from his father-in-law at Colnbrook - the constable was in the room. I told him to take the prisoner to Sir

            . I am master of the work-house. The mistress gave me the loaves and butter, which she said she took from the prisoner; I sent for the officer - the bread and butter belonged to the Guardians of the Poor; the butter had been given out half and hour before, and the loaves in the morning; I had given the prisoner one loaf and one half-pound of butter for her share - there were no more; some of the paupers were without, and they said they had given their's to her to take out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. One half-pound of butter and one loaf were my own; and the others, two poor individuals pressed me to take out to get them some tea.</p>

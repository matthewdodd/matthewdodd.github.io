                  </hi>. I am a linendraper, at 19, Edgeware-road. I had a shop at Woolwich—the prisoner was in my service as shopman in London, and afterwards at Woolwich—he left in the middle of Dec.—this silk and linen are my property—I saw them both safe in my stock at Woolwich on the last Sunday in Nov.—the prisoner was then in London—he arrived in Woolwich about three hours after I left there—I did not see him arrive—he had been three separate times in my service, and the last time he was with me four months, nearly—these two pieces of tape are mine—they were found at the prisoner's lodgings; they have my writing on them—these things were all kept at Woolwich—I know this ribbon; it should have been in the indictment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Look at this bill (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>). <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is one of my bill heads—I have two shops at Rochester—the one at Woolwich was given up on the 25th of Dec.—I had it three months, and I have had that in Edgeware-road about three years—the Woolwich one did not answer my pur<lb></lb>pose—I put a placard in the window of bankrupt stock—what they call an advertising sale of bankrupt stock is not my business—drunkenness was the reason of the prisoner leaving me—I owed him something—I did not pay him when he left, because he was in a state of drunkenness, and not capable of taking care of it—I told him to go immediately—I gave his wife sufficient to carry him to town—I swear that he never applied to me for wages—he and his wife were the sole persons who were there—the customary time for paying was once in three months—there were deductions to be made from the wages, for goods he had had, and he had staid away a week—the greater portion of the deduction was for a square of plate glass which he broke, amounting to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in my shop in Edgeware-road—the deductions amounted to more than his wages—I can swear to these pieces of tape by a "U" on them, which is my private mark—one of them is now rubbed off, but I saw it on it when I saw it before—I cannot tell how many persons use a "U" for a private mark—this chanced to be the mark of the house when I came to it—this linen has "N 3/4" on it in my writing—I swore to this silk by the mark, but it has been cut since I saw it—the mark is off it now—I hive four or five persons who serve in my different shops—it is not their duty to take the private mark off an article when they sell it—I know Lofthouse—he was serving in my shop at Woolwich—he may have had a handkerchief or some little thing, instead of wages, but not to the amount of more than five or six shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen her last?</p>
               <p>Parker. I had seen her in the stable over night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the stable door locked?</p>
               <p>Parker. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your stable joining to or near your house?</p>
               <p>Parker. It is near my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your mare again?</p>
               <p>Parker. I overtook the prisoner at the bar as he was leading her along the road with a halter at Kensington, about the middle of the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he no saddle ?</p>
               <p>Parker. No, nothing but a halter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Parker. He was a stranger to me, I can't say but I had seen him before. I asked him where he had that mare, he said he was leading her along for a man; then I took hold of the halter, and of him likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you, can you tell?</p>
               <p>Parker. I do not know that he did; I told him the mare was mine; then we got a constable and secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he point out any man that he was leading the mare for?</p>
               <p>Parker. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that time had you seen the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Parker. I had seen him about three or four days before at our house; he carried hard-ware about.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him?</p>
               <p>Parker. No, none at all.</p>

            . I came up from Berkshire with the prosecutor after the mare, and found the prisoner leading her along by a halter at Kensington, in the road. The prosecutor took hold of the mare. Said the prisoner, what do you mean. The prosecutor said this is my mare, and I will swear to her; the prisoner said he was leading her along for a man. Then we sent for a constable, and took him before justice Fielding. He said, he was perswaded to do it by two women that were along with him, as we were carying him along; that he bought a halter at Abingdon the night before, and then went to Buckland and lay in the rick yard till he saw the carter had suppered up his horses. and when the servants were all in the house at supper he went and took the mare, and rode away with her.</p>

               <p>I have a mother in London about seventy years of age; I wanted to come up to see her, and I took the mare to come up upon, but not with any intent to sell her, neither did I offer to sell her. I beg for mercy, and that I may be sent to serve his majesty, either by sea or land.</p>

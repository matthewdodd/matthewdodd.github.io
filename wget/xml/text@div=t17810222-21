             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a shopman to Mr. Crofton. On the 23d of last month, at about half past seven in the evening, the shop was shut in and I was behind the counter at the farther end of it; the shutters belonging to the window were not put up; there was a large pile of flannels; I saw the prisoner inside the door; the door was just too, but I believe the latch was not shut. I did not see him push open the door nor come into the shop, but saw him have his hand upon the stockings very plain.</p>
               <p>How could he get in without your seeing him? - There were about six rolls of flannel upon the end of the counter; they were so high as to conceal him; and as soon as I saw him he had hold of the stockings. I sprang along the shop and asked what he was at; he made no answer but attempted to get out at the door; but before he got out of the shop I laid hold of his coat, and in pulling him very strongly it occasioned his falling.</p>
               <p>Did you reach over the counter or go round? - I was round the counter when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>What became of the stockings? - He pulled them off that pile; there were about three dozen in each pile upon the counter; the counter was exceeding full. He only pulled them off the pile, but did not get them off the counter.</p>
               <p>How far did he move them? - About a quarter of a yard.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself when you pulled him down? - He did not speak at all; I called for assistance and our shopman who was sweeping the door came up and helped to secure him. He said he was a plaisterer and lived in Half-moon alley, Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Did he say what he was going to do with the stockings, or how he came there? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I the person who entered the shop? - I seised him in the shop, and he never was out of my custody.</p>

               <p>As I was coming by, having been at my brother's in the Minories, this man laid hold of me as a man had ran by; I never was in the shop.</p>

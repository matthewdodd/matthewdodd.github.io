             - A. Yes, I do; her christian name is Mary.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 17th of November last, when you were in bed, did you hear any noise in the night - A. I did, it appeared to be over my head, in the back parlour, it appeared as if the footman was either rubbing the tables or some furniture moving. I got up, and opened the window to see if it was light, I found it quite dark; I listened a little time, and returned to my bed, not hearing it again; I listened again when I got into bed, I heard the same noise again apparently; I got out of bed, and loaded a pistol, which I had close to my bed side; I went into the lower part of the house first, to see if it was all safe; I found all safe below, and the doors all shut as I left, them when I went to bed, and I saw the doors fast before I went to bed. After I had loaded the pistol, I went up stairs, I got into the passage leading to the room where I heard the noise, I then found a light coming upon me, I could not be certain whether it came out of the parlour or coming down from the drawing-room; I went back on to the top step of the kitchen stairs, before I could conveniently turn round the prisoner was looking at the clock, about six yards off me; I could see him particularly with a wax-light in his hand looking at the clock, standing in the passage, standing between the two parlours he had a wax-light, he took it out of the back parlour; he looked very deliberately at the clock, while I could tell half a dozen, and I looked at him; he then squatted himself downright to look at the key-hole of the clock, he could not stoop properly forward, he squatted, in that act I shot at him with the pistol, he jumped or fell immediately, I could not tell which; he fell against the door; the candle went out; I could see no more. I heard him make a noise. I was a little alarmed myself, fearing there were more. I heard a noise of getting out, he went out at the street door; I called out thieves and murder; I was on the top of the stairs; I called out thieves and murder, for him to be stopped at the door. The servants heard the report of the pistol, they called out thieves and murder; the watchman came up to the door, and the patrole. I desired the patrole to stop outside, they had their lanthorns; the watchman came in; I took the watchman to the place where I shot him; I found the blood had already spurted from the prisoner about two feet from the side of him; I traced it along the passage down the steps to the pavement, a vast quantity of drops of blood. When I got down the steps, I found a lamp-lighters ladder, apparently, reaching to the balcony. I took the watchman then up stairs into the drawing-room; the windows were all secure, apparently as I had left them the day before; I went twice or three times round the drawing-room; I said I would open the windows to see how he could get in; I thought he might get the ladder into the the balcony, and so get in at the second floor; at last I found the middle window a little dirty; I said I would open that first, which is the middle of the three; on opening the shutters I found they were divided into three folds, the bottom part fell out upon me, which had had six screws fastened to it at the side; they were all found out; the middle shutter was fastened; that fastening had been broken off then; I saw marks on the cloth under the lower shutter, because the floor was clean, there were the marks of his fingers; then I was convinced he must have got in that way. I went down-stairs, I saw a shoe and a hat, between the place and the door where I shot him. Then I went to the back parlour where I first heard him; I found two drawers had been broken open, which had always been kept locked; I did not miss any thing, nothing has been missed; there was only these two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110035"></xptr>drawers broken open; all the things and furniture in the drawing-room has been looked over, because I saw the marks of dirty fingers; the goods were all covered over with sheets, and there were marks of fingers.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a fair sight of the prisoner, so as to know him again - A. A very fair sight; he had a wax-candle in his hand, I perceived that distinctly. In the morning I went to Bow-street office, and gave a description of the prisoner; I said he was about six feet high, dressed like a lamp-lighter; I thought about thirty years of age, dark whiskers, and shot on the right side.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and tell me whether you are certain that he is the man - A. I am quite clear that the prisoner is the man; I have no doubt about it; I never saw him before as I know of; he never lived in that house; he has been formerly a workman there.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is Mrs. Broderick's house in - A. In the parish of St. George's Hanover-square. I shot him exactly as the clock struck five, it was quite dark; it was quite dark when I first heard the noise.</p>
               <p>

            What time was it when you first got up - A. About twenty minutes to five.</p>

                  <persName id="t18150111-58-person525">Q. </persName>
            What was the man doing when you first saw him - A. He was looking at the clock, and he was squatting down when I shot him; I had a full side view of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the man before - A. No; nor never after until I saw him at Bow-street; he was dressed in a dark coat, rather short for him; I think it was something of a jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he on breeches or pantaloons - A. I will not swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you will swear to the man - A. I do not swear to the lower part of his dress; I found a great deal of blood in the passage, and the watchman traced it all the way to Grosvenor-street; I only traced it down the steps.</p>
               <p>JANE DUNKLEY. I live at the White Horse, public-house, Little Britain,</p>

            How far is that from St. George's Hanover-square - A. I do not know. I know the prisoner; he lodged in the same house with me; he has lodged there since May.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his business - A. He is a carpenter,</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming home to his lodgings on the 17th of November - A. Yes, it was on the night of the 16th, and the morning of the 17th, it was about six o'clock, it was dark; he came to his lodgings; I let him in; he went up stairs directly; I lodge on the first floor. I opened the door, and left him to shut it.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18150111-58-person527">Q. </persName>
            How was he dressed - A. He had a short jacket on, he had no hat on I believe, and I think his jacket was a blue one, I will not be sure, and I believe he had no shoes on as he passed my room door. I never saw him afterwards until I saw him at Bow-street; he quitted his lodgings on Friday evening, or Saturday morning; I never saw him afterwards there. This was on Thursday.</p>
               <p>OWEN GRIFFITHS. I am a surgeon; I was sent for to the White Horse public-house, Little Britain, on Thursday, the 17th, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon; I found the prisoner in bed; I looked at the man as he lay in bed, and examined him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him what he sent to you for - A. I went to examine his face; no words passed as I can recollect. I examined his face; I found him wounded in three places in his face. I got some water ready to dress him; I dressed him. He shewed me his thigh and arm; I extracted a few small shots from the thigh, and asked him how he came so much injured; he said, he was shot at in Lincoln's-inn-fields, and he fell down, which was the occasion of the wound in the forehead; he was faint. I desired him to lay down, seeing no means of his being taken care of, I recommended him to go to the Hospital; he promissed so to do. I ordered him to take the medicine that I sent, and I sent him a lotion to wash the part with. I called the next morning, the landlord told me he was gone away; that was Friday. He had one shot in his right cheek; that is all in his face. The other shots were in the arm and thigh, one shot in the left arm, and some in the right; the wound had been recently done; he did not tell me when they were done.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep any of the shots that you extracted - A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. From information, I was sent down to make enquiries upon it; on going into the house, in the passage, near the place where the blood was, on the 17th of September, I found the hat and shoe; I went to the window, where it was supposed he entered; I found it broken open in the same way the former witness has described; after getting as good a description of the prisoner as I could, I inserted it in the newspapers; there were many spots of blood close to the clock, and on the wall near the street door was the mark of a man's hand smeered with blood. On Friday the advertisement was inserted; on Saturday I received information of the prisoner; I went to his lodgings, I found he had left them on the Friday. I then went to every Hospital in London; I could hear nothing of him.</p>

            . I am high constable of Birmingham. On Saturday, the 6th of November, I sent a man to the Hospital for this man; the surgeon of the Hospital waited upon me, saying, he had a man then in the Hospital under suspicious circumstances, he was brought to me in a bad state at that time with very great difficulty he walked, he was a long time coming; I did not say any thing to the prisoner that night, not till Sunday morning; I put him in a good bed up stairs; I sent for a surgeon to examine him on the Sunday, I was informed he was in that state that it was not proper to move him; Mr. Cox informed me that he ought not to remain in my prison; he desired I would send him to the Hospital in the workhouse; I sent him to the Hospital at the workhouse. I told the prisoner I believed he was the man that committed the robbery at Mrs. Broderick's house; he said no, he committed no robbery; he said he had got into the house through the window, and as he had taken nothing, he hoped they would do nothing to him. I believe I have told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110036"></xptr>every word that passed between him and me, I made him no promise or threat.</p>
               <p>William Moiley. I produce some of the shots the same as I loaded the pistol with.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Griffiths. Are they such sort of shots as you extracted - A. Yes, they are about the size.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It appears from the evidence that the man shot in Grosvenor-place lost a great deal of blood; the blood was even traced to the White Horse, Piccadilly; I can make it appear that I bled none, not even the sheets that I lay upon.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

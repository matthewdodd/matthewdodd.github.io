On the 12th of January, the prisoner came to our shop, and asked to look at some stockings. I shewed her some black and white silk stockings. She looked out two pair of each. After she had looked out the stockings she asked to look at some silk shawls.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she purchase the stockings - A. No. Mr. Stevens shewed her the shawls; she looked out one ordered a bill to be made out of the stockings and the shawl to Mr. Baxter, of Long Acre. She said she was going further. I understood she was Mrs. Baxter, from what she said. She left the shop. I then suspected her, and went after her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself see her take any thing - A. No, I did not. I told her we must take the parcel with her to Mr. Baxter. She said, very well. I and Mr. Stevens went with her. I attacked the prisoner, and took this shawl from her. It is called a skarf or a shawl. She rang at Mr. Baxter's bell; nobody came. I afterwards went to Mr. Baxter's; nobody knew her there.

               <p>Q. Were you employed by Mr. Galley, on the 3d of November, to carry any barley from London to Kingston. - A. On the 3d of November I arrived with the barge of barley, at <placeName id="t18101205-41-crimeloc251">Kingston</placeName>

The sacks, some of them, were marked Grives, in full length, and some were not. On Sunday morning, at four o'clock, I went on board and missed a sack of barley; that sack was marked with three letters. I cannot say what the letters were, I informed Mr. Galley - he obtained a search warrant. We went to the prisoner's house. Mr. Galley and Brown went into the prisoner's house. I staid outside. Mr. Galley brought out the sack with the same mark I had seen the night before; the sack that I missed was taken from the top of the pile.</p>

            . I brought some barley from Horsleydown, on the first of November, to Kingston. We arrived at Kingston of the 3d of November. I hired three hundred sacks of Mr. Groves, at Horsley-down, for Mr. Galley. The three hundred sacks of barley were put on board the barge. I attended the barge all the way to Kingston. They were all marked, some with single letters, and some with the name in full length. On Sunday morning I missed the hind sack, on the top of the bulk, I think it was marked with single letters. I had seen the barge at five o'clock the night before. There was a skiff tied to her quarter. The skiff was missing from the barge. The next morning the skiff was found on the Hampston Wick side of the river. In consequence of suspicion the prisoner's house was searched.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. It is in Mr. Groves trade to let sacks out to other people, as well as you. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had your men, on the 3d of November, brought down any barley. - A. Yes, the barge load was very near four hundred and a quarter. I saw the barge when it arrived, the corn was in sacks; some of the sacks were my own, and some Mr. Groves's. On the Sunday morning Mitchener came and told that there was a sack missing. I got a warrant, and searched the prisoner's house. I found a sack marked W. J. G. William and

            , and L. for London. I told the prisoner I had found the sack, and I wished he would shew me the barley. He said he had no barley in the house, but in a jar. He pulled the jar off the shelf and shewed it me. I told him I must search farther. I went in his out house, and went up stairs, there I saw two sacks of barley. One sack appeared never to have been tied; a new sack, no mark, and that answered to my bulk of barley. I found four bushels in the sack, the sack was full; the other sack was tied up, that barley was nothing like mine. I took a sample of that which I supposed to be mine. In consequence of that, he was taken up. This is the sample of the bulk, and this is the sample of the sack. I have no doubt it is part of my barley.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the barley at Brentford. That same sack might be left in my house to put potatoes in.</p>

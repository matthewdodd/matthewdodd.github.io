                  </hi>. I live at Stratford, in Essex. On Thursday night, the 9th of February, I retired to rest about half-past eleven o'clock—I second the house myself—the doors and windows were all safe—I was disturbed in the night by a noise in the parlour, as if somebody was moving about—I struck a light, looked at my watch, and it was half-past one o'clock—I went to the bed-room window, threw it up, and saw a man getting out of my parlour window—I had a candle in a lantern in my hand—I lowered it down outside the window, and saw something white, and a hat lying by it—I immediately went below, and found the parlour window thrown up, and the shutter taken down—the lower part of the hinge had been unscrewed, and the rest wrenched off—the hinges were broken, and one shutter was taken entirely down—I went to where I saw the hat, and found it, with these two sheets and a table cover of mine—I took them into the parlour immediately, and went outside the wicket gate, which was open—the Abbey-lane is at the back of my house—the man who got out of the window went down the short wall, immediately in front of my house—there is a mode of getting to my house by going down Abbey-lane—I only saw one person, but I heard steps of two or three trampling at the left of my parlour window, going down the short wall, in the same direction as the man who got out of the window—on returning to the parlour I missed the property stated—I found some of it at the end of my garden fence, which is the short wall, in the direction I had teen the man go—I showed the hat to Bish.</p>

On Thursday, the 9th of Febru<lb></lb>ary, I saw all the prisoners, after eleven o'clock, coming out of the Green Man public-house, which does not bear the best of characters—I have seen Heard wear this hat—I have often been at the Green Man—I am the watchman at Harrow-bridge, which is rather better than thirty yards from Mr. Brown's house—about ten minutes before one o'clock on Friday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 10th, I saw Fisher coming in a direction from Mr. Brown's pre<lb></lb>mises—I did not see him after that—about an hour afterwards I heard a rattle spring from Mr. Brown's house, and went there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live in East-street, Stratford. On Thursday night, the 9th of February, I had a dispute with my brother, inconsequence of which I went out to walk about to seek for a fresh lodging—I went down Stratford, and as I returned, about a quarter to one o'clock, I saw the four prisoners going down the Abbey-lane towards the back part of Mr. Brown's house—they all four had hats on—when I was going to the fish-market next morning, about half past six o'clock, I saw them again coming out of Petticoat-lane, facing Butcher-row, Whitecbapel—that is two miles and three quarters from Mr. Brown's house—Fisher was then without a hat on—the others had hats on.</p>

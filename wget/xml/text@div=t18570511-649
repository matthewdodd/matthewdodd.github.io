                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Monro, of Anglesey Street, Mile End. I am a cousin of the male prisoner—my mother's name is Harriet Payne—I went to the prisoners' house in Four Acre Street, on Monday night, 29th Dec., but not before—on Sunday, 28th Dec., I saw both the prisoners at my uncle's, and at my brother in law's, Murdock Monro, but only Mr. Bacon at my brother in law's, Mrs. Bacon was at her uncle's, Mr. James Bacon's, and Mr. Bacon came into my brother in law's to see me—it was between 9 and 10 o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing that I saw Mrs. Bacon at my uncle's—she asked me if I would come over on the Monday afternoon to stop with her while Mr. Bacon went to Reigate—I said, Yes, I would come over between 4 and 5 o'clock—I had seen Mr. Bacon at my brother in law's before I saw Mrs. Bacon—I had no conversation with him further than about going over on the Monday—he asked me to come, and I said I would—he was at my brother in law's about half or a quarter of an hour or so, not longer—I was only in company with Mrs. Bacon a very few minutes—I did not observe how Mr. Bacon was dressed that evening—I do not recollect whether I shook hands with him—I did not observe at all what state his hands were in—I walked with him to my uncle's, where I met his wife—on the following day, Monday, I went to the prisoners' house according to the appointment; it was No. 4, Four Acre Street, Lambeth—I knocked at the door repeatedly, but got no answer whatever—I could hear nothing of any one in the house—I lis<lb></lb>tened for two or three hours right on—I remained at the door from 5 o'clock till 8—I then went round to Mr. Edward Bacon's, and from there I went round to Four Acre Street, and knocked again, but could get no answer—it was then about 9 o'clock, or half past—I went back again to his brother's after that—it was about from a quarter to half past 10 o'clock when I left the house that night—I did not observe in what state the blinds of the windows were when I first went to the house the shutters were closed—when I left the house I went straight to my mother's, Mrs. Payne's, and made a com<lb></lb>munication to her—on the following morning, Tuesday, I went with my mother to the house in Four Acre Street—we left my mother's house about half past 11, and got over to Four Acre Street about 1 o'clock—we met Mrs. Bacon at the corner of the street—she had her rent book in her hand, and half a sovereign—my mother spoke first, and said to her, "Where have you been all night, and where are you going; how was it you did not let Harriet in?"—she said she had been in the house all night, and then she said directly that some one had come in at the back room window and had mur<lb></lb>dered the two children, and had cut her throat, and she said she was going to pay her rent and tell her landlord of it—she had a half sovereign on the top of the rent book in her hand—she said no more, but returned directly to the house—she had the key in her hand—she unlocked the door, and we went in—I went into the back room on the ground floor—Mrs. Bacon went</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 75). On Tuesday, 30th Dec., I was on duty at the station house in Kennington Lane, when Mrs. Bacon came there accompanied by Mrs. Payne, about half past 1 o'clock in the afternoon—Mrs. Payne said she wished me to come to Four Acre Street, she considered something had taken place very serious there—Mrs. Bacon did not say anything then—I went with them—on the way Mrs. Bacon said that a person had come in at the window and cut the children's throats, and her own as well—she did not say when that had been done—when we got to the house, Mrs. Bacon unlocked the door with a key—I went into the back room—the shutters of the front room were closed—we all three went into the back room pretty well together—I there found a little boy in a chair, with his head on his little table before him; his throat was cut, and he was quite dead—there was a good deal of blood about; some on the wall and on the floor—I then inquired of Mrs. Payne where the other child was—she said, "Upstairs, in the back room"—Mrs. Bacon was present—I found an infant lying on the floor, in the back room up stairs, with its throat cut, and quite dead—there was a child's bed in that room, there was no blood on the bed—it appeared as if the bed had been slept in—the child had it's night dress on, and the little boy also—they both had a portion of clothing on—they had night shirts on-—on seeing this I said, "This is a bad job"—Mrs. Bacon said, "I did not do it, a man came in at the back window and <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it"—she did not say at what time it had been done—she meant the window of the back parlour, on the ground floor, where the little! boy was—I noticed that window at the time, it was fastened, but not properly, the hasp was a little askew, not straight, as it ought to be; it was enough to hold the sash—no one could open it from the outside or raise it—the glass was quite sound—there is only one window to that room—there is a little yard or garden outside, inclosed by a railing, not a wall—it is a row of houses and a little garden behind each—I did not then make any examina<lb></lb>tion outside the window—I went into the front room, first floor, and saw a female's night dress lying on the bed there, it was very bloody, there was blood pretty well all over it; all the front part chiefly—I did not notice the sleeves then, I afterwards saw that there was a quantity of blood on the sleeves—there was also blood all round the neck, just in the front part—I found a pool of blood on the floor, as if it had been dropping down, several spots into one—the back parlour is the room where they used to live—there was a lot of lumber in the front room—there are also two little rooms be<lb></lb>sides, a kind of wash house and a room over it—I went all over the house, there is no room over the first floor—while I was making a search in the front room first floor, Mrs. Bacon passed behind me, and went to a little box on the drawers, and took out this envelope, and said she must send it to her husband—it is addressed, "Mr. Bacon, Mr. Marriage, Ironmonger, Market Place, Reigate," and has a postage stamp on it; it contains a blank sheet of paper—she said the address was her husband's writing—I then went back to the station, and took Mrs. Bacon with me—I did not take her into custody altogether; I said, "We will go back to the station now"—she "went with me of her own accord—Mrs. Payne also went with me—Mrs. Bacon was detained when we got to the station—the acting inspector told her that we should detain her as regarded the murder of the children—she made no answer to that—she was taken before the Magistrate that same afternoon and remanded—before that, I went to the house again with Mr. Bushell, the surgeon, and a brother officer—Mr. Bushell saw the children—on that occasion I found three knives on the table in the back room, down</p>

               <p>stairs; not the table where the child was sitting, but another table—I have here two knives out of the three—I left the other behind, as it was quite clean—they are common table knives—I observed something similar to blood upon them, on one of them more especially; one did not appear to be stained with Mood as the other one was—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—one of them presents the appearance of having been recently sharpened—this is the one that I thought was the bloody knife that was used—Mr. Bushell saw it—I examined the sill of the back room window next morning, Wednesday, about 1 or 2 o'clock—there was dust on the sill—there was not the slightest appearance of that dust having been disturbed—there were no footmarks, nor the slightest appearance of the ground next to the window having been disturbed at all—it is gravel immediately under the window, just as back door places generally are, it is rather in a rough state—it would show the impression of feet—it was not exactly gravel, it was earth, sufficiently soft to show the impression of feet—I did not look at the hasp then, I had noticed that the day before—on Tuesday, 6th Jan., I received from the turn<lb></lb>key at Horsemonger Lane Gaol, where Mrs. Bacon was confined, this che<lb></lb>mise, there is a great quantity of blood on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner, and live in Lower Ken<lb></lb>nington Lane. I was sent for to the police station there on 30th Dec., about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, or a little after—I found Mrs. Bacon there—I asked her how she did—her reply was, "Very poorly;" at the same time, without any more remark, she followed it up by saying, "A man got in at the window, and out my throat, and my children's also"—I asked her to let me look at her throat—I did so, and examined it—I found several outs or marks on the throat, one from the lower part of the throat, extend<lb></lb>ing from the left to the right, two or three inches long, avoiding the wind<lb></lb>pipe—the wound continued across the windpipe, but not wounding it; there was another cut from that downwards, about two inches long; there were several outs appearing to be backwards and forwards, all above the first cut that I have named—the whole of these cuts I could not find to be continued from right to left, or from left to right; they seemed to be out both from the right and from the left—they were what I may term scratches, or abrasions of the skin—the principal cut was the one passing over the windpipe; the depth of that was perhaps rather more than the eighth of an inch in the deepest part; it was deeper over the windpipe, but not much; it was altogether a slight cut; blood had come from the whole, even the scratches—it was not bleeding when I saw it—all the wounds I saw might have been done by herself; if they were inflicted by another, she must have remained quite quiet during the time, quite passive and consenting, with the head extended back—while looking at the wounds I remarked to her, "This has been done some time"—she replied, "Yes, 8 o'clock last night"—I examined her hands; the left hand was covered with a brown colour, as if from the stains of blood only partially washed from it; there was a still deeper stain round the nails—the fore and second fingers of the right hand were also partially stained in the same way, with blood partially washed from them—I did not call her attention to it in any way—after this interview I went to the house in Four Acre Street; I there saw the bodies of the two children—I found the throats of both the boy and the infant out fatally—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a knife</hi>) the wounds I saw would have been very likely to be caused "by such an instrument as this, most likely—I saw the knife on the table on my searching the room, and I saw immediately that it had been wiped, and I directed the officers to take possession of it,</p>

               <p>and to be careful of it—I have since examined what is on it by the microscope, and have ascertained it to be blood; I have every reason to believe it to be human blood—that is as far as I can go; there is a difference between the globules of blood of some animals and human blood, but it is difficult to distinguish human blood from the blood of some animals even by micro<lb></lb>scopic power—the knife had every appearance as if it had been recently rubbed on a steel—my attention was drawn by the officers to the window of the back room; it was fastened; it could not have been lifted up in the manner in which it was then fastened—it was fastened so that no one could have come in—I do not think it could have been so fastened by any person that went out;—I was shown a woman's night dress, it was on the bed in the front room—there were marks of blood on it; it had quite a different appearance from the blood from the neck; it might have come from any other source than the neck; there was blood on it that I think did come from the neck; that was at the upper portion—the blood on the lower part of the dress was distinguishable from that; it was blood that had either flowed more rapidly or had been rubbed from some clot of blood of a differ<lb></lb>ent character from the blood from the throat—there was also some blood on the sleeve—I was afterwards shown a shift; there were marks of blood on that, near the hem—a pair of moleskin or fustian trowsers has been shown to me by inspector Young—there are appearances of blood upon them, on the front—I saw a waistcoat on the bed; it has since been shown me by Young; there was a spot of blood on the collar—I first observed the waistcoat on the bed where the night jacket was, the first day I went, but I did not examine it till afterwards; when I found the spot of blood I recognized the waistcoat directly—these are the trowsers—there are several marks on them of the appearance of blood.</p>

I am a bootmaker, living at No. 5, Four Acre Street I am the housekeeper—I live in the front parlour down stairs, and make the back room my workshop—Latchford lives with me—I was at home all day on Monday, 20th Dec.—I did not hear the Bacons' children cry at all, during any portion of that day—I was up somewhere about 7 o'clock that morning—before that I had been in the habit of hearing the children cry frequently, every day since they have been there; it was only one child that used to cry—I should say it was fretful, as it cried continually; it was like the cry of a baby—I cannot say any time in particular that I heard it cry, sometimes in the morning, and sometimes it might be in the afternoon, but generally, I think, it might have been towards the evening—I did not observe the windows of Bacon's house during any portion of that day—I saw Mrs. Monro at the house on the Monday evening, about half past 8 o'clock—there was no light in the house at that time—I looked to see.</p>

               <p>that paper—I did not mention it to Bacon; it was his brother's request that I should not name it to him at that time—the watch was advertised and circulated in our division, but not in print—it was described by num<lb></lb>ber—the number had been obtained from Edward Bacon—it was No. 31, 798, a silver Geneva watch—I have since seen a watch bearing that numbers—Sergeant Broad brought it to me—I did not see Bacon with any watch in his possession when he came back from Reigate—the first time I saw a watch in his possession was on Wednesday, 7th Jan.—he told me that he had been down to Stamford on the Saturday preceding and returned on the Sunday—I asked him where his watch was, and he showed me this one (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>), it was not then in the state it is now—it was complete except the minute hand—I looked at it and saw the number—it is No. 13, 663—a few days after the 7th Jan. I was at the prisoner's house making a search of the whole of the premises—Bacon came there while I was there—I was in the back kitchen—there is a cellar opening from the pas<lb></lb>sage; I told him I should look then and I sent for a candle for the purpose—I did not see Bacon go into that cellar—my attention was called by hearing a noise in the yard, and Broad calling out—I went out and saw Bacon there—Broad had him on one side, and he told me that he had put something into his pocket—I put my hand into his pocket and found this watch in the state it is now, with the glass broken—it is the watch I have last spoken to, No. 13, 663—Bacon first told me that he had received a check for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Atter, of Stamford—he always described it afterwards as a check for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had cashed it at the London and Westminster Bank, and received four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and 10 sovereigns—he said that he had deposited one of those notes for safety in a box for his own purposes, to purchase furniture with, and that he had paid the other three notes away—he assured me that the fourth note was in the box when he went to Reigate—I made inquiries to trace those notes, and have the witnesses here—I afterwards told Bacon that I had made inquiries with regard to the notes, and I told him that I had found a fourth note in circulation which had come from him, and asked him for an explanation—he then said that he had received another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, that he had given a person change for it in the street—I have traced that 5<hi rend="italic">.</hi> note, it is the fourth received for the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—he gave me a description of the clothes, which I took down in writing—he has since given me another description of them—on 7th Jan. he described the great coat as rough great coat, with two pockets behind, and the other as a black cloth shooting coat, with pockets at the side—he said the great coat had been made by Mr. Dixon, of Stamford, that he had made all his clothes for the last twenty years—I afterwards received a letter from Mr. Dixon respecting the clothes, and I told Bacon that I had heard from Mr. Dixon, and that he had never made him such a coat—he said "The coat is not so rough as the one you hare got on"—he then said it was rougher, and afterwards he said that the reason he called it a rough coat was because it was an old coat—I observed the cut on his finger on Satur<lb></lb>day, 3rd Jan., when he first came to the station—it was then closing, and gradually healing—it was on the first joint of the first finger of the left hand—it was a strait cut, about half an inch long and about one eighth of an inch in depth—he told me, without my asking bin, that he had done it whittling a stick—on Wednesday, 7th Jan., he told me that he had done it while carving at dinner on the Sunday—he was very much agitated at the time—I asked him if he had seen his wife before leaving home on the Mon<lb></lb>day morning—he said he had left her in bed, that she was vary comfortable,</p>

               <p>that he had kissed her, and that she had bound up his finger to prevent his catching cold in it—I was at the police court on the 21st of Jan., when he was taken into custody—he was taken to the station to be given in charge after the letter had been read in the court—on the way there he said, "Oh! Mr. Young, is it not shocking that she should say I did it? I do not fear; the Lord will help me through it; my poor boy, I could not hurt a hair of his little head; the truth will always go the farthest."</p>

               <p>appeared for her—Mr. Atter has been the attorney for a great many mem<lb></lb>bers of the family for a number of years—as far as I have seen the conduct of Bacon, he has appeared very fond of his wife, and likewise of his children—when his wife was in St. Luke's, he was part of the time at Stamford—he came up to see her, I think, on one occasion—he took her out one day—that was another day, on a Sunday, and brought her to our house; besides that, he came up once to see her, and I think he came another time.</p>

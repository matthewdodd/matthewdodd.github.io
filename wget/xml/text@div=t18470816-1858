                  </hi> I am mistress of the Infant School, in the Maryle<lb></lb>bone workhouse—on the 22nd of April a child named Mary Ann Allen was brought to the workhouse—I first saw her on the 27th of April, she was in a very destitute state, apparently starved, when given to me—it was very emaciated indeed—it remained under my care till the 30th of May, when it died—it appeared to rally a little, but it was always in a weak and delicate way, and very thin—at first it was unable to play or move about at all, but afterwards it was able to play a little with the other children—while in the workhouse it was allowed wine and arrowroot, and nourishment.</p>

                  </hi> I live at No. 26, Wells-street, Oxford-street, the prisoner and her husband occupied the back attic of my house—they had two children, one of them was Mary Ann Allen, the deceased—she was about four years of age—the children were both taken together to the Marylebone workhouse—my attention was drawn to the deceased on the 22nd of April, by a person of the name of Hobson—I went up to the back attic, and when I came to the door the eldest little girl was inside, crying—I requested her to open the door—she said, the mother was gone out, and had locked them in—the door was locked—I went into my shop, got a bunch of old keys, and opened it—I found the eldest child sitting upright on the sacking, and the youngest lying on her side, close by the other—they were in the most dirty beastly state that I ever saw, and the room was equally as bad—there was a large tub</p>

               <p>standing by the side of the bed, full of human soil—it had been there, I suppose, for six months, from the stench; I could not go into the room for some time—there was a large baking-dish underneath the bed, also full, and some in another corner of the room, in an old saucepan without a handle—there was nothing in the room but the bedstead, an old table, a chest of drawers, and an old fender—the children were literally naked, they had nothing on them but what appeared to be a bit of calico, as black as my hat, round their shoulders—they were both in that state—I received information from one of them—the prisoner came to lodge there on the 18th of March, 1835, and lodged there until this time—I do not know how the youngest child was treated—I could very often hear the eldest crying—I never heard the youngest cry, as she was so very weak—I do not know of my own knowledge that she did have a proper supply of food, I have every reason to believe that she did not—I have never had any conversation with the prisoner upon the subject—the father was in the hospital for three weeks altogether—I think he went on the 22nd of April, but I did not take particular notice—I know he was in the hospital at this time—the children remained together in the room, till I had the prisoner taken for robbing the apartment—they were taken to the work-house at eleven o'clock that night—I seldom had an opportunity of seeing at what time the prisoner came in and out—she used to go out generally at eight o'clock in the morning, and sometimes came home again about one or two, but not always, and then went out again—she was a charwoman at two houses in Carburton-street—I think the husband was there in the morning as I took the children away at night—I think he went to the hospital on that day, for I knew he was going to the hospital, and that made me go into the room.</p>

                  </hi> I lodge at No. 26, Wells-street. I remember the child being taken to the workhouse—I cannot say how long before that, the father had been to the hospital—I do not know whether he had been at home on that day—I was called by the last witness to look at the child—I never observed the prisoner beat her; she did not attend to it, or take a mother's care of it; quite the reverse, she neglected it in every possible way, never cleaned or dressed it—it was hardly ever fed, and then only with food of the worst description—it was occasionally brought down to my school and left with me, once a month or so—when I first saw the child two years and a half ago, it was in a very weakly state, and covered with sores; it could not stand.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184708160141"></xptr>
               <p>it was in its mother's arms covered with a piece of green baize; it had a scabbed face—I conceive that the child was slighted and neglected by its mother; though she has repeatedly told me that the children were fed better than I was, every day of my life—she certainly had the means of giving them food, and supporting them with credit, if she had thought proper—I know that her husband was out of work for a few weeks; but she told me that even when he was out of work he used to bring her home 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week; out of work, or in work, she told me she always had that, and she had coals every Saturday night from some charitable institution—when her husband was not employed at the coach-making, I understood from her that he acted as tap<lb></lb>room man, or something at a public-house—when she brought the children to school she used to give the elder girl three halfpence, to buy their dinner with—I was called up by the landlord on the day the child was taken to the work-house—she was lying as perfectly naked as she was born, and the bones were protruding through the skin—the skin was actually broken at the bottom part of its back, and the bone was bare—the prisoner was always very meanly clad herself—I cannot say that I ever saw her perfectly sober—I occasionally saw her during the last week or so before the child was removed, but I never saw her perfectly sober—I have repeatedly spoken to her about the children, and she has told me to mind my own business, that they were better fed than I was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Have you not often seen me come home with food to my children? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have, with broken victuals; and I have seen you carry it out again immediately afterwards; on one occasion you brought a plate of odd victuals into my room, and actually stood and fed my dog with it; I asked you to take it up to your children; you did not, but told me to mind my own business, and that is what enrages me so—I did not tell you that the dog would not leave you till you gave him a bit—they were pieces of bread, skirts of meat, rinds of cheese, and so on—you said the children would not eat it—they were certainly such things as they would eat—the bread was hard, certainly; but if it had been sopped they could have eaten it—that was about a week before they were removed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that she gave that to the dog which would have been of use to the children? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She certainly did—I have repeatedly seen her bring food home and take the same food out again, scraps of pies, meat, and bits of things—she has shown them to me when she has come in, and said, "This is for my children," and I have afterwards seen her take it out again just in the same state—that has occurred several times during the last six months—her husband, who is in Court, says that he has a witness to prove that she did take the food out again and sell it.</p>

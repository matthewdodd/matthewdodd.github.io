                  </hi>. I live in Peter-street, Cow-cross, and keep a general shop. On the 11th of September, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and purchased a pennyworth of bread—she gave me a half-crown—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and she went away—I placed the half-crown in the till—there was no other there—in half an hour another girl came in and offered me a half-crown—that directed my attention to the one I had taken of the prisoner—I examined it more accurately than before, and discovered that it was a bad one, and so was the second—I put the first separately from the other money, in a piece of paper—next morning, about eight o'clock, the prisoner came again for a half-quartern loaf—I served her—she put a half-crown on the counter—I found that to be bad—I said, "You were here last evening with a bad half-crown, and this is bud too"—I asked where she got this half-crown—she said she got it in a shop in Smithfield—I had her taken into custody.</p>

Wood and Son"—I gave him change, after deducting the amount of the leg of mutton—I asked where I was to send it to—he said it was to be sent to Lock<lb></lb>wood's, in Drury-lane, to be left there for him—I asked my boy if he knew where Lockwood's was, he said, "Yes"—the prisoner was still there—I put the leg of mutton, in the basket, and sent him with it while the prisoner was still there—he stayed in the shop some few minutes, and then followed the boy directly—the note was returned to me on the Tuesday following.</p>

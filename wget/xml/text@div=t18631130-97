                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery, stationed at Woolwich—the prisoner is my son—on Sunday morning, 29th November I was walking quietly in Ogilby-street, and he came in rear of me and struck me a blow on my head with a stone, which knocked me senseless—I was not knocked down—I went to the police-station and made a prisoner of him and then went to the station and got my wound dressed.</p>

I am a grocer, of 5, Ogilby-street—I was standing at my door, and saw the prisoner go behind his father and hit him with a stone at the back of the head—he would have fallen, but I ran and caught hold of him—his head was severely cut; it bled very much—I picked up the stone and gave it to the policeman—this is it.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When I came from Ireland, I caught cold in the steamer. I went to my father, and was very bad in the barracks for about a fortnight. My father was not willing to keep me; he thought it was laziness, but I was not able to work. He was threatening every day that he would throw me down the stairs. He told me to go about my business; there was no accommodation there for me, and that Woolwich and England were wide enough for me. I was sitting by the fire, and he said, "Would it not be better for you to go out and work than be here? get up, you will have to walk out of <hi rend="italic">this.</hi>" He took hold of me, put me outside the door, and gave me four or five blows with a cane. He thought to hit me in the belly, only the women brought me into a room and would not let me out that night, as I had no place to go to, unless I walked in the streets. The next morning, he told my mother to go and sell my shirt and trousers, and to go to London and get into some workhouse there, and I should be sent home from there, and I took my shirt and trousers and sold them for fifteen pence. I was out in the streets two nights. I spent the money, and went into the barracks that night again. My father and mother had gone out to the lodgings in the town, and one of the soldiers came with me, who was in the same room, and brought me down to the guard-room, and got</p>

               <p>leave of the sergeant for me to stay in the guard-room till morning. I stopped there, and went up to the barracks, and they gave me breakfast. The sergeant-major told me to go to the Magistrate, and my father should keep me in till I was eighteen, and able to work. I afterwards went about the streets till I went to the relieving officer, and if it had not been for him, I should be dead; he took me in, and said that he would send me home. He gave me a loaf of bread now and then, and tea and sugar for four nights. He told me to go to my father and tell him to go down, and he would not ask him to pay any of the money; but my father would not. He said, "I do not want to do anything only to perish him about the streets, that he may die soon;" and he said that if I went up to that room any more, he would give me twelve months' hard labour. I went up last Sunday to the room, and my father and mother were within. I had come from Greenwich in the morning. It was very cold, and I opened the door and asked them to let me in to warm my hands. My mother said, "Come in;" my father said nothing, he was at his breakfast. In about ten minutes, my father took a shirt which was on the window, <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it in my mother's face, and said, "I told you before not to have the <hi rend="italic">light son</hi> coming into this room at all." He put his coat on to go to Church-parade, and said to my mother, "If you lay a finger on one <hi rend="italic">halfpeth</hi> of victuals that is here; I have everything marked; you may go about the streets with him, as I will be knocking you down." The women in the barracks said that he had said he would give me a dose, and that dose would be poison for me, finish me altogether, and put me out of the way. He was standing at the corner of Oakley-street; I had a stone; I had no intention of cutting him or hurting him, only to frighten him, as I know that it is said by the law of God that we ought to obey our father and mother.</p>

I have known the boy Emmerton about twelve months—I saw him in Old Street Road, on 9th April, between 9 and 9.30, talking to the prisoner, next door to the tobacconist's, near a lamp—I had never seen the prisoner before, but am sure he is the man—about ten minutes afterwards I spoke to the boy, as I heard his mother calling him—I afterwards went to Pitfield Street and saw the prisoner just against a public-house—a great many other people were there, but I knew him from the rest—I said in his hearing that he was the man I saw talking to the little boy a few minutes ago—he said that it was wrong—he was given in custody.</p>

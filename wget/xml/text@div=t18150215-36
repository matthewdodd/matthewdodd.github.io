I came home between five and six o'clock, my porter had the prisoner by the collar in the shop when I came home; I had been out an hour and a half, I suppose the door was open when I left it, I usually shut my shop of a night, as soon as it is dark; the name of my porter is Scott, I asked Scott what he had the man there for, he said he saw him taking a piece of carpet out through the window; I found the window broken, and one piece of carpet gone, the other the prisoner had in his hand.</p>
               <p>COURT. One pane broken - A. Yes, and one piece of carpet gone. the other piece of carpet the prisoner had in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there broken panes large enough to take a carpet out - A. Yes, they are very large panes.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the carpet last - A. I saw it the same day, it was placed near the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so near that a person could take it out, without putting their hand through the window - A. No, they must have put their hand through the window; there was one carpet taken away, and gone entirely, it did not hang up it stood on its end. I do not think it was shut close.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had been quite close it might be taken out without a person putting in his hand - A. No I do not think it could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the prisoner - A, The constable did, I was there when he was searched, he had a bag, and some duplicates, nothing else I did not see any instrument of any sort; I had observed the pane of glass that day, there was not a bit of glass gone; it was a simple crack across the top, in part of the pane.</p>

            . On the 13th of January, about ten minutes before five I took in a few rolls of carpet, that had been standing at the door, I shut the door, and lighted the lamps in the shop; I put up one rool of carpet in the window close to the side where this piece of carpet stood, I believe it touched the frames of the window. I bolted the shop door; this is the piece of carpet, I found the prisoner had hold of it stood up in the corner of the window, I fastened the shop door and bolted it, and went out at the private door for my tea, I left the young woman at work in the shop. About twenty minutes past five, I was returning from my tea. before I got to the shop. I saw the prisoner and another man standing at the corner of the shop window. I passed them, I thought they were after no good.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. No, I never saw him before; I passed them, I passed the shop ten or a dozen yards, and crossed over the way I went under a gateway opposite of the shop; they seperated as I passed the shop. and returned again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150019"></xptr>I came from under the gateway; I walked about ten yards further on the right, because I could not see what they were doing of then; I observed one of the men with an umbrella keeping the light off another shop, and the prisoner stooping down pulling the carpet out; I ran across the way and laid hold of him while he was pulling the carpet out; the carpet was almost a foot out, he had shoved it down to get it out, he could not have got at it without putting his hand in at the window. I did not see him break the window; I seized him by the collar, and asked him what he was doing of; he said he saw something he did not see what it was; I asked him where the other man was; he said he knew nothing at all of him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On my returning home it began to rain; I stepped on the steps of a private door, next to the carpet warehouse, I thought I saw a pane of glass out, I put my hand in unfortunately for me; I stepped on the door again. The porter has said he laid hold of me as I was pulling the carpet out of the window, which is as false as God is true.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

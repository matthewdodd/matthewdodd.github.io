            . I am a clerk in the Secretary's-office in the Victualling-office.

I hold it in my hand now; I think it contained an account, but am not certain - I made a mark on the letter with the account; if there was one in it, and it would be passed to the Medical, and Cash Committee of the Victualling Board, and would then go to the Impress department; it would be left in the board-room. I have no doubt but it contained an enclosure.</p>

            , Esq. I am chief clerk in the Impress Department. I remember seeing the letter produced at the time just mentioned - it contained an account and voucher, both of which I have here, (producing them) - they came to my hands on the 16th of July; I know them to be the same, as I immediately put a number on them.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The letters are opened before they come to you - A. Yes; I cannot say in what state they arrive.</p>

            . I am Secretary to the Medical and Cash Committee. There is a reference on this letter in my hand-writing, to Mr. Richardson, to report on subject matter of the account alluded to (looking at the account) - this is it. After the arrival of the prisoner in England I saw him; a letter had been written to him requiring the original documents - from which he professed to have made up this account; in consequence of which he came to the office, and desired to see me - he was brought into the Committee where I was sitting; he stated that having been called upon by the letter before alluded to for the original documents, he could not produce them, having destroyed them. I said he must give a written answer to the letter - the Board had written to him. The documents required are the original memorandums, which he states in his letter to have been found after the death of Mr. Twynam, whom he succeeded as Purser.</p>

            . I know the prisoner's writing perfectly well - this letter is his writing (looking at the documents produced) - the signature to this account, and the heading are his writing, as also the letters produced.</p>
               <p>The letter enclosing the document was here read, it stated, that Mr. Twynam had left his accounts in a confused state, but the account had been made out by the prisoner from documents, then in his possession.</p>
               <p>MR. FAUCETT re-examined. I have made a memorandum on the letter of the date on which it was received - there is no mark of mine on the account; my belief is, that there was an enclosure, but I cannot identify it; if there had not been one, I should have noticed it, as I read the letter; I opened it on the 15th - Mr. Briggs has refered it on the 16th.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to MR. GOULD. Q. I have not understood who you are - A. I was midshipman on board the Liverpool at the time the prisoner was there. I think the whole of the account is in his writing, except the signature</p>
               <p>"J. B. Somerville." I was on board the vessel when Mr. Twynam died - the prisoner was at that time Admiralty clerk on board, and did the duty of Captain's clerk. Mr. Twynam was ill about ten days; and at his death the prisoner succeeded him - he also performed the duty of Captain's clerk, but had a person to assist him. He continued acting Purser nine or ten months - we were in the Indies all that time. I do not remember his being in bad health; he had the prickly heat, that is a sign of good health.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe when grog is stopped from the men, there is much dispute between them and the Purser about their amount of stoppages - A. Not when they are correctly paid, when the Purser is a just man. They either put their name or mark to the settlement.</p>
               <p>Q. If the duty of the ship calls them away, would not they say to the Purser</p>
               <p>"Put down my name" - A. I never knew it; the men stand on quarter deck, and write their name before the Commanding Officer and others. If they cannot write, they make a mark, and the Purser puts their name.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. This is done publicly on quarter deck; did you see any account of this done on quarter deck. - A. Certainly not; the whole account should be in his writing, except the signatures, which should be made by the parties themselves. I certainly believe the names in this column of signatures, are in the prisoner's writing, a little disguised, but Walker is evidently in his writing not at all disguised.</p>

            . In 1821 I was Lieutenant of the Liverpool; I joined her on the 14th of May. Mr. Twynam was then Purser; he died on the 31st of May; he was only ill five or six days. I was ill myself, and do not know who acted for him. About the 19th of September, an application was made to me as commanding officer. - A deputation of the ship's company came aft to complain that they could not get their short allowance money paid to them from the Purser; I sent for him twice or more, before he came, and at last sent a serjeant of marines with a file of men, who brought him on quarter deck. I was not present at any payment to the men after that.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the name of Somerville on this account, and say if it is your writing. - A. It is precisely like my writing, but I do not believe that I ever signed this document; I am unable to say whether it is my writing or not, the words Senior and Lieutenant are not my writing. I have no recollection of having seen such a document, or such a payment; had I witnessed it, I certainly should recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a knowledge of having signed any voucher or paper which the prisoner can have in his possession. A. I have a slight recollection of having signed some papers, but cannot say what they were; brought to me by him, and taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. He would then be in possession of your signature - A. Yes, the signatures in the column all appear would be in one hands but some are more disguised. I saw none of these parties sign their names, nor make their marks.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You was senior lieutenant at the time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160047"></xptr>A. Yes, I had to sign documents in the Captain's absence, but not frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. After the men made their complaint the allowances were paid. - A. I suppose so, as I heard no further complaint. I never witnessed disputes between the men and Purser. When I joined the ship Mr. Twynam was very busy in his cabin, at his accounts, and was told he would injure his health by confining himself so closely below. I heard him say every thing of material consequence was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a greater difference in the signatures than might be made by a man who wrote the whole account himself - A. Oh! Yes.</p>

I was steward to Mr. Twynam until the 31st of May, 1821, when he died, and then remained as steward to the prisoner for about a month - it was my duty to keep an account of the quantity of grog retained by the Purser, and not served out to the men. Mr. Twynam settled with the caterers of the different messes about five months before his death I think - I was present at that settlement; I cannot say when it was to a month or so. When he died he left his books and papers in his cabin - the prisoner took possession of them after his death. I made out an account of money due for stock grog, by order of Captain 
               <persName id="t18240916-129-person1093">Collier</persName>
            , and delivered it to the prisoner.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Knight and Jones, Solicitors for this prosecution. I served the prisoner with notice to produce certain documents, on the 11th of September, in Newgate. I have a copy of the notice here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not tell you that you had taken all the papers he had on shore, and all the rest were on board the Liverpool - A. No; he said he would attend to it.</p>
               <p>The copy of notice for the prisoner to produce a variety of documents was here read.</p>
               <p>ROBERT M'DONALD (in continuation). I do not think the account exceeded 30 l.; it did not amount to 40 l. I am confident. The money was paid the men by the prisoner shortly after Mr. Twyman's death. I believe the name</p>
               <p>"Robert M'Donald" on the account to be my writing, but not</p>
               <p>"Purser's steward," &amp;c. I remember Welb's writing, and believe his name in the column is not written by him. Reynolds's signature may be his writing, for he wrote a good hand - he is now at Bermuda. When I left the ship all the documents were left with Mr. Moore; when I left him the accounts were made out fairly, that was a month after Mr. Twynam's death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to swear that at Mr. Twyman's death the accounts were fairly made out? - A. I do; the account due for stop-grog was 30 l. at his death; all payments should be entered in the Purser's book at the time they are paid. Mr. Twynam entered them himself, the prisoner had the care of the books and the key was in his possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. PLATT. Q. The prisoner took charge of Mr. Twynam's papers - A. Yes; he told me he had a necessary bill of 106 l. of Mr. Twynams, and that the money-bill amounted to 207 l., or 280 l. in all.</p>

               <persName id="t18240916-129-person1095">F. </persName>
            A. COLLIER. I commanded the Liverpool from 1818, to December 1821. The prisoner was Admiralty Clerk at the decease of Mr. Twynam; he had access to his papers. I cannot say who took possession of them; it is requisite for the Captain of vessels to certify documents as authentic.</p>
               <p>Q. On this voucher are two certificates purpoting to be yours - A. Upon looking at the signatures only, they are so like mine, I should almost say they were mine; but on looking at the document and the dates, I should not put my signature to such a document, because it says it is a payment made between 1818 and 1821, and between those dates short allowance money for stop and sick grog, payments had been made by Mr. Twyman, and it is impossible that some payments should not be made without a man coming to me to know why they were not paid.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a certificate of the money being paid by the prisoner in the presence of yourself, were those payments made - A. Certainly not; he made a small payment after Mr. Twynam's death, but certainly not to this extent.</p>
               <p>Q. It states that the Purser has delivered you two accounts, &amp;c. - 
               <persName id="t18240916-129-person1096">A. </persName>
            He had the management of my accounts, and is the person who would transmit that account to the Victualling Office, he acted both as Purser and as my clerk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have known 
               <persName id="t18240916-129-person1097">Moore</persName>
             some time - A. I knew him from his joining the ship in 1818; he was Admiralty Clerk, and I do not hesitate to say, that since I have commanded a ship (which is from 1805.) that I ever had so good a clerk, nor ever had so little difficulty in passing my accounts at Somerset House, and never had them kept so closely as by him - he has had thousands of dollars which I was answerable for, and money of my own, all of which I always found correct; I had the highest opinion of him, he came to me with the strongest certificate of character.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left the vessel, were not his books left behind - A. I should think not; I do not know the nature of his accounts. I have signed some thousand documents while he was on board. During the time we were in India he was ill several times, and particularly after Mr. Twynam's death; we were sent to the Persian Gulph, and the illness was so serious he was alarmed, being a healthy man, and at times was quite childish, and crying; this was while he acted as Purser.</p>

               <p>Q. Was his mind in that state, that in making up his accounts it was very easy to make mistakes - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. BOLLAND. Q. Were any accounts sent to government at the time you were in the Persian Gulph - 
               <persName id="t18240916-129-person1098">A. </persName>
            No we had no means of sending; his illness was in August; we got to Bombay in September or October; then went to Penang, and there he left us; this was in November, 1821.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you happen to know where it was that he made the small payment after Mr. Twynam's death - A. I think at Cochin.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 21st of July, I apprehended the prisoner at his lodgings, No. 4, Thanet-place, Temple-bar. I searched his lodgings three or four hours after, and found some papers there, which I wrote my name on before I parted with them (looking at them) these are the same - they were all in his bed-room, in one drawer; among them is a piece of black tracing-paper, and a long strip of paper with names on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know that it was his bedroom - A. He said he lodged upon the second floor, and sent me there, and received the linen which I found there. I believe some account-books were there. I gave him every thing but these papers.</p>
               <p>MR. GOULD. I believe these papers to be Mr. Moore's writing.</p>
               <p>These were three accounts, apparently duplicates of the one set out in the indictment, but in the receipt column, some signatures appeared instead of marks; the sums varied; also the totals, as follow: - Bread 30 l. 17 s. 10 1/2 d. Spirits 71 l. 15 s. 3 1/2 d. Beef 12 l. 0 s. 9 d. Sugar 8 l. 17 s. 2 d. Total 123 l. 12 s. 2 d.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to MR. RICHARDSON. Q. Did you not in April last receive another document from the prisoner - A. Yes, (producing it) a letter accompanied it.</p>
               <p>A bill for 333 l. 10 s. 4 d., drawn by the prisoner, from Madrass, at thirty days sight, was here put in and read.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written affidavit, stating the account first sent was incorrect, being only a copy intended for his own information, which there being errors of 9 s. 5 1/2 d., 5 s. 0 1/2 d. 2 s. 0 1/2 d., and an omission of 15 l. 3 s. 1 d., which with 6 l. for the gun room; mess omitted made the difference, but the accounts were made up at the Persian Gulph at the time he was ill. He had the double duty of Purser and clerk to perform, that Mr. Twynam's accounts were in a very bad state, and the vouchers much obliterated and illegible; and it frequently happened that he was ordered by the men to write their names for them when they were called away to attend their duty.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARDS. I received an account on the 28th of November, 1823, with 6 l. added for the gun room mess, the boys' savings are not added there; here is a letter I received on the 8th of April, 1824.</p>
               <p>(read.)</p>
               <p>This letter enclosed what is termed the nominal list, and stated that he had discovered the omission of the boys' savings, and requested Mr. Twynam's executors might be charged with the account, and that all the orders for the stoppage of grog being worn out, defaced, torn and rotten, it was found impossible to preserve.</p>
               <p>The nominal list being examined, tallied with the account put in of the amount of 123 l. 12 s. 2 d., the difference of that and of 101 l. 13 s., being accounted for by 6 l., for the gun room mess, and 15 l. 9 s. 2 d., omissions.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARDS. The prisoner was apprehended on the 21st of July; enquiries had been making about his accounts from 1822. He knew the investigation was going on.</p>

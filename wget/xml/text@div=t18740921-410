Poncin &amp; Co., 3, Queen Street, Covent Garden"—I did not go there at all—he came again on 8th March—he did not pay me for the articles, but I saw the cheque in the afternoon—on 14th March, in consequence of some information received, I went with two constables to 17, Lambeth Road—I did not see the prisoner there, but we found the goods, minus one or two umbrellas—I have four of the umbrellas here—I think it was sixty-seven we found altogether—they were under the mattrass of one of the beds: as</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We recovered all the umbrellas but three—the prisoner was not there—I was not aware that he lived at 33, St. George's Road, Lambeth—he gave me this card—he did not speak of the person whose name is on the card as a different person to himself—he did not say that Poncin had been recommended or had recommended him—he came in as an ordinary customer and ordered the goods—I was the person who saw him first—he introduced himself by presenting the card, and I understood that he was that firm.</p>

I am an accountant at the Birkbeck Bank—on 10th November, 1873, a person named Poncin Edwarde opened an account and paid in 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the account was practically closed on the 22nd of the month—the money was all drawn out but 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these are cheques upon our bank and such as would be furnished to Poncin Edwarde—this cheque marked B bears the-signature "Poncin Edwarde"—it-was presented on 26th June last and is marked "N. S.," which means "not sufficient"—at that time he had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the bank—we have received a great many cheques in the name of Poncin Edwarde—on 7th July this year an account was opened in the name of Peter Palmer—this cheque is signed "Peter Palmer" and marked "N.

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, carrying on business at Tower Street Chambers—I have known the defendant about eighteen months—he is a tailor, living at 33, St. George's Road—I have known him living there six or seven months—I also knew him at 17, Lambeth Road—I know a Mr. Poncin, he was a commission agent and lived at 33, St. George's Road—I could not say where the defendant was employed; all I know is that he worked as a tailor—he had been a cutter-out for some one, but where I could not say—I never knew him doing any other work—I have known Poncin I dare say ten months—I believe the signature to this cheque to be Mr. Poncin's signature—I don't know where he is at this time—I have not seen him lately—I think the last time I saw him was four months ago.</p>

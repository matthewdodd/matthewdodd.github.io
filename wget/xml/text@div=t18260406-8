            . I am house-maid to Mr. Tickell. I found a small box under a pair of steps in the passage leading from mistress' bed-room to the spare room, on Friday, the day before the prisoner was apprehended; I had never seen it before I found it there. I took it up to the nurse directly; there were two watch-hooks, two or three beads, and a hair ring in the box; it was given to Foster. Next day (Saturday) master told me to call the prisoner down stairs - I found her in her bed-room; I and two other servants slept in that room; I said, "Martha, if you please you must come down into the dining-room, master wishes to see you; she said, "What for?" I said,"I don't know - master wants to see us all together, in the dining-room;" she said she could not go down, for if she did she should faint; she had not been ill before; I said,"You must, for they are all waiting for you in the dining-room - master, and the rest of the servants; "she said she could not, or she should faint; she went down one pair of stairs with me, and then said she wanted her pocket handkerchief - I went up, and fetched it for her, leaving her there, and when I returned she was gone; I went down another pair of stairs, and saw mistress' bed-room door standing open, which was not usual; I went into the room and said, "Martha, are you here?" I got no answer - I said again, "Martha, are you here?" and then she answered from the closet where I had found the box; the closet has a door to it, and forms a passage. I said, "Come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060007"></xptr>Martha, we must go down stairs;" she said, "Oh! dear! I feel so faint - I must smell mistress' smelling-bottle," which stood on the mantel-piece - she did so. We then went down stairs - I met master and some of the servants on the stairs, with the officers; we then went up into our own bed-room, to have our boxes searched - the prisoner went up with us; I staid till my box was searched, and when the officer was going to search the prisoner's box I told Amy, the laundry-maid, I wanted to speak to her - I went down into the passage by mistress' bed-room with her (my mistress was in the breakfast room), and when I came out of the closet I observed the corner of the counterpane tucked in between the more than usual; I pulled out the corner to put it properly, and out dropped the smelling-bottle; I called Amy back, and shewed it to her- I then lifted up the bed, and there lay all mistress' things together, tucked between the bed and mattress. - Amy called Foster down - he came, and saw them there before I removed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You went up and found her in the bed-room? A. Yes - she was alone- her box stands in that room; she has only one box; I did not leave the bed-room till she came down with me; I do not think she had any thing in her hand when she was coming down, but I did not notice her hands. We have a nurse, nurse-maid, footman, cook, laundry-maid, and several servants; I had been in mistress' room, and helped to make the bed about ten o'clock - it was about three when master sent me up for her. None of the other servants are here; four servants slept in the room up stairs, but the prisoner slept in an adjoining room; she goes through our room to get to her own. We all pass mistress' room to go down.</p>

            . On the 25th of February I was sent for to Mr. Tickell's; I went up stairs, and searched the servants' boxes - the prisoner shewed me her box; she had got it open when I went to search it - the binges were broken; she had opened it herself: while I was examining it I was called down into Mrs. Foster's bed-room; the last witness shewed me some things in the bed, which I brought away - I went up again, and told the prisoner I should like to search her box again - she lifted it from under the bed, and I asked her for the key of it; she gave me two keys which laid in the window; I tried them, but neither of them would fit the lock; I said they were not the keys - she said, "I had them this moment," putting her hand to her pocket; I said, "I have two keys," and produced two, which I had found with the things in Mrs. Tickell's room; she said, "Those are my keys;" I tried them, and one of them opened the lock. I found eight duplicates in the box - one was for two shirts, three handkerchiefs, and two pairs of stockings, pawned at Beauchamp's, Holborn-bars - I went there. I produce the things found in the bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search her box entirely the first time? A. No - I was called down; I saw her open it for me to search; she had no opportunity of going down to the bed-room after that - another young woman was in the room with her; she said the keys were hers the instant I produced them.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Beauchamp, pawnbroker. I produce two shirts, three pairs of stockings, three handkerchiefs, and a thimble, which were all pawned together, on the 23d of January, for 16s.; they are worth 24s.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does your master do much business? A. Yes; a great many persons come there every day. The person had a bonnet on - I believe it to be the prisoner, but will not swear she is the woman.</p>

             re-examined. The prisoner had been up stairs some time before I went to call her down; mistress had rang the bell some time before for one of the children to be taken out of the parlour; we did not know Foster was coming to the house. I know these shirts to be master's, also one pair of stockings, and two handkerchiefs; I do not know who the other stockings belong to. I have seen mistress' watch several times, hanging at the head of the bed, and the necklace and brooch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whether your mistress gave her maid old articles you cannot tell? A. She has frequently - she is very generous. I never knew her give any but silk handkerchiefs away.</p>
               <p>MR. TICKELL. I know the watch to be Mrs. Tickell's; it is worth 10l. - it cost 24l., and is gold. I know the seals - they were attached to the watch - they are gold - also the chain and slide; here is a ring, a vinegaret, and a smelling-bottle, all of which I knew.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-cooper, and live in Eastcheap. On the afternoon of the 26th of Aug. I put half a dozen of wine into a basket, and left it in my shop—I went into the counting-house, and made out the account—I was there five or six minutes, and when I returned my wine and basket was gone—I went to the station, and found the basket there—the wine was not there—this is my basket—I can swear to the marks on it which I did with my own hand.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 537.) On that afternoon I saw the prisoner going up Rood-lane with this basket, containing six bottles—I went across the road to stop him—when I got about three yards from him he threw the basket down, and tried to escape, but I took him to the station with the basket—the wine bottles were broken, and the wine lost.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Broad-street, Golden-square. On the 7th of February I was called in to attend the deceased, whom I had known for some years; I saw her at her husband's house, which is a public-house, in Half Moon-street, Piccadilly - I found her in a state of insensibility, which appeared to proceed from an injury of the brain; I used the usual remedies, and attended her till the Saturday following, when she died - she always remained in a state of insensibility; I opened the head, and found the scull fractured across in one direction, and a second fracture extending from the right angle to the other - it was a very extensive fracture, but without any displacement of the bones; I found a quantity of blood effused, covering the whole of one side of the brain, and towards the anterior part of the brain I found it more effused, and in that part the brain had been lacerated to some extent; these injuries were fully sufficient to occasion death - I should have suspected, if I had not been informed of the circumstance, that it had been caused by falling from some height on some hard substance, which would produce such an injury.</p>

            . I live with Mr. John Richardson, at the Griffin. The prisoner came into the house about half-past seven o'clock; I had never seen her-before - she did not appear in liquor then - she had a quartern of gin, which a woman and her drank; they then had a pint of porter - the other woman left; the prisoner then began to make a noise, and sing; Mrs. Richardson wished her to be quiet - she then began to use bad language; my master came down, and said if she was not quiet he would send for a Policeman; she was quiet for a few minutes, and I left her standing at the bar - in a short time I heard a fall, and on coming up stairs saw mistress in master's arms; she appeared to be dead - her Christian name was Isabella.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the house with another person to drink; I said it was all right, and we would go- the bar-maid said I owed 4d. for an old score, which I had paid; the landlord came and took my parcel out of my hand for the 4d., which I said I could not pay - he pulled me to the kitchen stairs, and some female behind said, "Away with her - burke her," which very much frightened me; he gave me my parcel - as I went out, somebody took hold of me very violently, and I fell down the steps with somebody after me; my parcel fell out of my hand - my husband went the next morning, and got it; I know nothing of the accident, nor who it was that fell.</p>

             re-examined. Nothing passed in my hearing about an old score; the prisoner did not fall down, or I must have seen it - I am sure she did not fall- she pulled Mrs. Richardson down with great force; it was not an accident - Mrs. Richardson did not fall down on her.</p>

I am an architect, of 260, Camberwell Now Road—on 25th August I was in Walworth Road and was attacked by three people—I received a blow on my mouth which knocked me down, and I felt a pull at my chain—my watch was stolen, but my chain was left unbroken—the men ran away, I followed them and lost sight of them—about an hour afterwards I saw the prisoner at the station, but could not identify him—he resembles one of them in size—I was sober.</p>

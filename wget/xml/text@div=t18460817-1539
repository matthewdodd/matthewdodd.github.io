                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. George Hayne, a mahogany merchant in Long-lane. On the 15th of May I sold some beech and maple, and other wood, to Mr. Hart—the prisoner was in my master's em<lb></lb>ploy—it was his business to take things out and to receive payments—I gave him these goods and a bill of them—they were to be paid for on delivery—on his coming back he told me Mr. Hart did not pay for the goods, I was to call there the first time I was passing—I saw Mr. Hart afterwards, and in consequence of what he said I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

            . I deal in potatoes. On the 23rd of April I was coming through Smithfield, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner Crawley following a boy with a box, and I was closely followed by Brown; I stopped and looked into a shop; Brown<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270004"></xptr>came and looked in my face - I said, "Do you want me?" and he said,</p>
               <p>"Do you want me?" I said No - I then walked on, and he followed me; I still saw the boy with the box, and Crawley trying to take it from him - I went into St. John-street, and could not get across; I there saw the prosecutor, and spoke to him - this was about one hundred yards from where I first saw the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you strike any body? A. No.</p>

            . I live at No. 34, Great Sutton-street. On the 23rd of April I met Marlborough in Smithfield, and spoke to him; Crawley was attempting to steal a box from a boy, and Brown was following him; when he found we were watching them, Brown tapped Crawley on the shoulder, and called him away - Marlborough then went away, and I went towards Smithfield; while I was there the prisoners came up to me arm-in-arm, and Brown said,</p>
               <p>"What bl - y cove was that you were speaking to?" I said a neighbour - he said, "He is a bl - y nose, and so are you, you b - r; I will shove out your bl - y eye for you; and if the other b - r was here I would serve him the same;" Crawley then said, "Punch the b - r's bl - y head about," and just as I turned the corner, Crawley struck me twice over the head with his fist, and my hat fell off; I went to pick it up, and a boy not above a handfull high struck me under the chin, and one of the party said,</p>
               <p>"You b - rs go to work;" Brown jobbed his umbrella against my face, and it went through into my month - I gave both the prisoners in charge; a person named Stevens collared Brown till the officer came and took him - I went to the hospital; this happened about half-past four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You gave no bad language? A. No, I never said a word; I could not - I did not say a word; there was a great crowd of people - there are persons here who saw it; I gave them no provocation -I do not know whether Brown was drunk; I cannot say whether he was or not - he might be; Crawley appeared to be drunk - Brown might be in liquor; he was a little in liquor - he was not so much in liquor but he knew what he was about; I had never known him in my life before - he had no quarrel against me; I never said a single word from beginning to end.</p>

               <p>Crawley. Q. Why did you not give me into custody when I hit you? A. Because you struck me, and I was wounded at the same time with the umbrella.</p>
               <p>Crawley. I was standing looking on, and the officer took me - I know nothing of the transaction.</p>

            . I am a drover. I was in Smithfield, and met the two prisoners and the prosecutor against the Bull's Head; the prisoners appeared to be stopping the prosecutor, and just as they turned the corner, Crawley struck him on the head - Childs had a pail in his hand, and he put it up to keep Crawley away from him; Brown in the meantime came up and jobbed his umbrella right through his cheek; this was done directly- there was some language used by Brown, but I did not hear it; a butcher held Brown, and the officer came in three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near were you? A. About eight yards; I did not hear Childs say any thing - he did not appear to me to be speaking; I was standing by him while he was giving his evidence, but did not listen - I do not give my evidence by what he said; I was not noticing what he said to give my evidence by it - he did not say one word about having the pail; it was an old pail - he held it before him; he did not appear to be making a blow at Brown, nor at the other - he made no blow; Crawley was right before him - I will not swear it did not touch him; they appeared both to be in liquor, and Crawley more in liquor than Brown - I have no doubt they were both in liquor.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took Brown on the 23rd of April - I saw Childs standing by the Bull's Head, with his face severely cut; I went to the bars, and Crawley came up to me, but he did not interfere with me till I got to Long-lane, and then he pressed the mob against me, and a man not in custody, named Crowder, called out,"You b - rs, cut away, there is not a moment to lose;" he repeated the words, "You b - rs, cut away there is not a moment to lose - the traps are coming."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was not Brown nor Crawley? A. No; they did not say a word - Brown endeavoured to get away.</p>
               <p>Crawley. I was not taken till I was looking in at the Compter.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did they not both appear in liquor? A. Brown did not appear to me the least in liquor - I did not smell his breath; Crawley had been drinking.</p>

            . I am a painter. I was in Smithfield on the 23rd, standing at the corner of the public-house, as you go into St. John-street; I saw the two prisoners come up - one of them had an umbrella in his hand- Crawley said, "I should have had the box, if it had not been for that b-g - ring fellow with the pail - see how I will serve him when he comes round the corner;" Childs was coming round from St. John-street, and as soon as he turned, Crawley struck him on the right side, and directly the other struck him on the left side with the umbrella; this was done directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you stated all you saw? A. I have stated all that has been asked - I saw an attempt to rescue; Crawley hit him first, and Brown immediately after - he did nothing in the meantime of any kind or sort; he did not put up any pail - he had not time to put it up; he was carrying it before him - there was another man in the crowd, who struck him as he was in the act of falling; Crawley seemed to sham a little, but he did not appear to be drunk; I smelt Brown's breath in the office; he was not at all in liquor - that is my impression; the reason I did so, was because Crawley appeared to be drunk, but when inside he did not appear so - I did not smell him, because I considered he had shammed it; I smelt Brown because I thought he might say he was in liquor - I did not smell Crawley, because I went to take the prosecutor to the hospital; Brown would not be searched by the officer, and I took hold of him that he might be searched, and smelt him.</p>
               <p>Crawley. I was looking inside like the other people, and the officer came and took me; I never hit the man at all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did it appear to be done with a blunt instrument? A. I should think not; if it had been a blunt instrument the parts would have been contused; it was not a severe wound.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. They have stated quite different to what they stated against me; the officer stated he followed me up St. John-street - I am very sorry it happened; it was done in the heat of passion.</p>

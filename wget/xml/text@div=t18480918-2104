                  </hi>. I am living with my wife at Bethnal-green, I live en<lb></lb>tiroly on my means. Before and in the year 1846 I had been in the habit of frequenting a warm-bath kept by the father of the two prisoners—I was attended there by John Moore—I never behaved indecently to him or to any<lb></lb>body else, or did any act of indecency—in 1846 I first began to part with money on a threat of charges of this sort by Frederick Augustine Moore—he had made numerous applications to me previous to the 1st March, 1847—he said he could bring charges of my having exposed myself to his brother John, and unless I gave him money he would make it publicly known—from the period this first began till the 1st March, 1817, I parted, according to his own admission, with about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at a time—on 1st March, 1847, I was in Paul-street, Finsbury—I was overtaken by the two prisoners—Frederick spoke tome—he said he had a situation, he was going to Ireland, and he must have some more money or he should inform Mrs. P.—when he said that, he expressly named the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—John was with his at the time—I proposed a memorandum myself—I said, "You are present now," and John said he wouldsign it—it was a memorandum of my having given the money to his brother—I went with them to the Fox, in Paul-street, and there Frederick drew out a receipt, and his brother John acknowledged it at the Paul's Head, at the corner of New North-street—this is the memoran dum that they gave me on my giving them the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., "Received of Mr. Phillips. the sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. F. A. Moore. Witness, J. Moore, this 1st of March, 1847."—the so charges continued to be made after this transaction—I see "J.

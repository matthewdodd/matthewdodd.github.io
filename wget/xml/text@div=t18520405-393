                  </hi>. I am the wife of Theophilus Dower Lloyd, of Hosier-lane. About 21st Feb. I let the prisoner Compton a lodging at our house; she said she was married, and her husband was an ostler—she came with a young man, but I did not see her again, as I was confined to my bed—in a fortnight and four days I found they were gone, and I missed a pair of sheets, a pair of blankets, a counterpane, two pillows, and other articles, thirty altogether, which had been let with the lodgings—when they had been gone about a</p>

On a Thursday, in the beginning of March, I went with Leggett to this house in Hosier-lane, and found the prisoner Compton and another young woman there—Compton took some pictures from off the wall, and asked me to sell them—I sold four of them—I afterwards went with the two females and Leggett from Hosier-lane to the New-cut—they all carried some things, and they asked me to carry a bundle, which I did—when we got to the New-cut, they took the bundle of me, went into the house, and I came away.</p>

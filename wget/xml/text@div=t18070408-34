             has the first floor in my house. On the 25th of Februray, between seven and eight in the evening, I was alarmed by my servant, as I was sitting in my parlour. On the prosecutrix going out, she requested my servant to attend her fire, and on my servant going into the room, she came down and told me that she saw a man in the room. I proceeded to the lodger's apartment, I found nobody in the room; on returning down stairs again a person knocked at the door, and informed me that some body had escaped from the window; and by the directions I pursued him, and took him by Portland chapel; he was then standing by the side of a house, he was pointed to me, he had no coat on; I gave him in charge of a watchman. When I returned home, I found a glass tumbler outside of the door broken, and several small cakes laying by the side of it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a considerable way from your house where you laid hold of him. - A. Yes, near a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the parlour before you received the alarm. - A. An hour at the least.</p>

            . What are you. - A. I am an apprentice to Mr. Clark, brush maker in Charlton-street. On the 25th of February, about half past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw a man without a coat on, coming out of the first floor window of Mr. Prior's house; he got from the first floor window to the lid of the door, and then he dropped into the street; he ran down the next turning, and I after him; he came back again to the house, within a few doors, he leaned on a post, I went and informed Mr. Prior; I knocked at the door and called out, and then the man ran away; I went first after him, and Mr. Prior followed; he ran into George-street, Portland chapel; and then he stood at the corner of a public house. Mr. Prior charged the watch with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that the person Mr. Prior laid hold of, was the same man that you had seen come out of the window. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any thing of any glass at any time. - A. When I came back from the watch-house not before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when the man came out of the window you did not see him throw any thing down. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor hear any glass break. - A. No, Mr. Prior picked up the bits of glass from the step of the door when we came back.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prior) This lad has told us that you picked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080022"></xptr> up some broken glass. - A. I did, when I returned from the watchhouse I produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutrix) You cannot speak to the glass. - A. I cannot; only my tumbler had a foot to it, and this has a foot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am an innocent man. Before the magistrate the prosecutrix only valued the tumbler at sixpence, so I was to be tried at Hicks'-hall. They made a burglary of it yesterday and brought me here.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LORD DENBIGH</hi>. On 17th January I was in my brougham in the Strand—I got out at Steward's, the optician's, having taken my spectacles out of my despatch-box. which I shut up again and ordered the brougham to meet me—when I returned I missed the box, which contained four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, an antique ring, and some private memoranda of great value—I had received 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, in a series of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes from Messrs. Hoare, my bankers—I have seen the notes since, but not the other contents of the box—I went straight to Bow Street.</p>

I kept the Crown, Back Hill, in January—one day in January a man came in and tendered a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for change and I changed it—later in the day the prisoner and another man came in and the other man changed two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—they both stood in front of the bar—I got the notes changed and handed the other man the money, but I did not change them both at the same time—I changed the second, five minutes after the first—they drank together and I drank with them, as they asked me to have something—I took one of the notes to Mr. Fowler, of Leather Lane, and changed it, and handed the man the proceeds—I had seen the prisoner several times before—I endorsed all four notes with my name—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

This fourth note must have been changed at my house, but under what circumstances I do not recollect—it was not changed by the prisoner—the person who asked me to drink was not the prisoner—the prisoner has been at my house on several occasions—his sister lives next door to me—I was taken to identify the prisoner, and I should have walked up to him, but he said, "I know him and he knows me," and walked out—the man who changed the notes may have stayed there an hour—I believe the prisoner came in with him—I will swear he was there when I gave the money for the last note—I know the man by sight for whom I changed the second note—I did not go into the passage with him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He said "Yes, that is quite right, I know him"—Goldsmith had walked up in front of the prisoner and pointed him out—when I caught the prisoner he was running away—I had said nothing then about my being a detective.</p>

I did not tell him that that conversation might be used against him, but he knew I was a detective—he said "Goldsmith ought to be in the dock, he knows all about the notes"—he did not tell me that he had been in the public-house on Back Hill that day, or that he had been drinking—he gave me an address—I went there and found he did not live there, but his sister did—that was next door to Mr. Goldsmith's.</p>

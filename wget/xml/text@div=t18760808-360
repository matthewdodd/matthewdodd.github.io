                  </hi>. I am a licensed appraiser—I levied a distress at No. 39, St. Peter's Street, Islington—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the condemnation paper—I am able to say that only the articles mentioned here were on the premises, all the rest had gone, except a piece of drugget, a bed, bedstead, and drawers, the total value of which was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which were given to the defendants, so that he might give up possession; you will find more in the paper than the fixtures—I knew that he was a liquidating debtor per<lb></lb>fectly well—this is the list of articles sold, they realised 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that was independent of the gas fittings, which it was agreed the landlady should have in liquidation of her rent—my costs left something like 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to hand over.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the defendant five or six years—I first had business transactions with him in 1871, mostly cash, but only to the amount of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., till the beginning of 1875, he then asked me for credit, telling me that he had got 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with his wife, which induced me to give him credit for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I continued those credit transactions with him, and the last was in September or October—after he failed he told me that it was all false, and that he did not receive any money with his wife—in December, 1875. I went to his place of business and found Mr. Cooper there—the defendant said that he could not meet his liabilities, and Mr. Cooper wanted some securities—the defendant showed all the goods he had, he showed a lot of pearls, Mr. Cooper got hold of them and took them as security—I mean that the defendant handed them over and gave him an envelope to put them in—the defend antowed me about 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he did not apply to me for further credit in December—I don't think I saw him till about 6th December.</p>

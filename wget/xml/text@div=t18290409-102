            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the night of the 10th of March, about half-past seven o'clock, I met the prisoner coming towards Camden-town, with a bundle, which he said contained chaise harness, that he had to repair - he was going to take it home; he said he occasionally worked for himself, and he was going to take it close by there; I asked him again where he was going to take it, and he said to the Borough; I asked him where he bought it - he said he was not obliged to tell me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you caution him not to say any thing that might affect himself? A. No.</p>

               <p>MR. COOK. Mr. Hamilton looked at the harness as well as I did; I never said it was not his.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know this harness? A. By the furniture of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Hamilton stated that this was a harness which he bought of Mrs. Boyd, and I can prove he did not, as there were some things attached to the saddle of her harness, which are not to this.</p>

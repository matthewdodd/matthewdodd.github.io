               <p>Q. How was he drest? - Much as he is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he trowsers on? - Not that I know, I was very busy at the time, and I could not get out of my place, I sent for Mr. Peat, the officer of the market; I told him to take him into a public house and search him, accordingly he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take any more bad money than that bad shilling? - Yes, I have got four, he tendered them into my hand for payment, he gave me nine shillings, four bad and five good ones, I gave him none back only one; I never returned the other eight to him, I have kept them from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I received the money in the streets for goods, two or three days before, I thought they were all good.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, the officer of the market; I was applied to by Finch, the last witness, to take the prisoner into custody, and found five shillings, which was not concealed, all good, I found it in his right hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept it apart from the rest that you found? - The good money was loose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search further? - I then proceeded to search him, and I felt him up and down his thighs, and I found there was a lump, and I unbuttoned the knees of his breeches, and he had got a pair of drawers under his breeches, there I found this paper of bad money, the good money was all loose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any good money among these? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at the time? - Yes, he requested of me to let him go, and to walk along with him to the London Spa, where he had obtained change for a guinea on the Saturday evening before I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no paper nor any thing like, he found the good and bad together.</p>
               <p>Peat. It was separate, it was not mixed together.</p>

               <p>Of these nine shillings here are four bad, they are exactly of the same manufactory; I do not imagine they have ever been in circulation. Of these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300133"></xptr>found under his drawers here are seven of them, every one are of the same manufactory as the four, they are all exactly alike, except one is bent.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they appear to have been in circulation since they have been coloured? - I don't imagine they have, it is a very easy operation to make them appear like this. The other money found about him are all good.</p>
               <p>Court to Peat. Whereabouts did you find afterwards this paper? - Between his breeches and his drawers, when I unbuttoned his knees I took out that paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I received all this money for my goods in the street; this Sunday morning that I went to buy a quarter of a hundred of mackarel I paid him nine shillings out of my pocket, and I thought it was all very good as ever I had in my life, and I was putting the money into my fob, and it went inside of the lining, Mr. Peat took none from my pocket, it all sliped down that I had, there was no paper about me, and if I had any bad money about me I would not pay it to any salesmaster of Billingsgate, who are counted the sharpest men in London.</p>
               <p>Court to Finch. Had you any reason to suspect him before? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - Pretty near a year, he deals sometimes in the market, and sometimes get other employ, where he can get the most money.</p>

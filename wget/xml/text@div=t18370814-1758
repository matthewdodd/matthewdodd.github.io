                  </hi>. I am gardener to Mr. M. Ghee, of Hanger-lane, Tottenham. On the morning of the 4th of August, between six and seven o'clock, I was mowing about half a mile, from Blackhope-lane. I saw Langsham pass with a truck, three or four times, which aroused my suspicions—I placed myself to watch, and saw Monday come across Mr. Collins's fields, and take up something; and then Langsham went down a lane which leads to some fields, and brought his truck against my master's place—Menday then took up something, and put it into the truck and then they came on towards Stamford-hill; my master having lost some articles. I thought they might have something belonging to him, and I followed them—Menday was about ten yards behind—I asked them to show me what they had got—Menday said, had I lost any thing—I said my. master bad lately lost some things; I should like to know what they had got; and Menday said he had got some lead, and he showed it me—I gave them in charge—Langsham said he was hired by Menday to draw the truck—Menday said the lead was his, and he bought it of a countryman—I gave the lead to the constable.</p>

                  </hi> am groom to Mr. M'Ghee. I was called by Sheppard to take charge of the prisoners, with Mr. Smith and Mr. Kennett—while Sheppard was gone for the constable, Menday said, "Come with me, I want to go aside"—and I let him go about a hundred yards down the road, till we saw a gap, I let him go over there, and he got over a hedge to another field, and made his escape—I followed, and took him in the Newroad, near the Seven Sisters—I brought him back, and asked him, if he came by the lead honestly what made him run away—he said he would make his escape if he could, as he could not tell who he bought it of.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Warren Farm, Wimbledon, and am game-keeper to Mr. William Day, who lives in the Strand, and rents the right of shooting over Warren Farm. On 12th Dec, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was on the look out, and heard the report of a gun in the preserve called the Fish-pond—that is part of the ground that Mr. Day rents the right of shooting over—the ground belongs to a farmer named Rex—a man named West was with me—we went towards the spot, and saw three men, of whom the prisoner was one, for I had known him two years; he was getting over the hedge out of the Fish-pond preserve into an enclosed field—there is game there—it was a moonlight night—I went up to the men, and asked them what they were doing there—one of them, who I supposed to be Scott, said, "Hold him!"—I went over to him, and the prisoner <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with a bludgeon, about 2ft. 6ins. long, with both hands, and struck me on the head with it—I had on this hat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is the mark—I was knocked down senseless—my head was cut—when I was down, the other two men struck me across the legs—as I was getting up the prisoner struck me, and knocked a piece out of my hat—I called for assistance, and they all ran away—the Duke of Cambridge's gamekeeper came up, and we both followed the men—as we followed them I missed the prisoner almost directly, about 100 yards from where I was knocked down—there is a cover there in which he could easily hide himself—we followed the other two and lost sight of them, then returned the same way as we had gone, and met the prisoner coming from the enclosed ground on to the Common—we stopped him—I said, "That is the man who-struck me, and I will swear to him"—I apprehended him—he wanted to know what it was for—I said he was the man who struck me a few minutes before—we searched him, and found this bludgeon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Robin Hood, Kingston-bottom, and am assistant game-keeper to the Duke of Cambridge. On 12th Dec., about half-past six o'clock, I was going my rounds, and beard the report of a gun in the direction of Mr. Day's cover, which was about a quarter of a mile off—I went towards the spot, and when I got about halfway I heard a cry for help—I heard Croxall's voice, which I knew—be sung out, "Come on!"—I went to Mr. Day's preserve, and found Croxall with his head bleeding, in the field near the orchard—he was on his legs when I came up to him, and he and I went towards the Common—I did not at that time see any men running away—when we went in chase we saw two men running, and we followed them, but lost sight of them on the Common—they were going towards Wimbledon—we returned the same way, as near as we could—there was no path, and when we got between 200 and 300 yards from the place where Croxall had been, I saw the prisoner come over Mr. Day's fence in a direction from where I first saw Croxall, and was going towards Wimbledon—when he came close to us Croxall said, "This is the man that struck me; I can swear to him"—we both laid hold of the collar of his coat—he was very obstreperous—we could not bold him, and be got out of our hands—we chased him 150 or 200 yards, and came up with him again, took hold of his collar again, and he drew a knife from his pocket—Croxall said directly, "Brockwell, he has got a knife in his hand; mind your hand"—the prisoner then said he drew the knife to cut his handkerchief—I had hold of him by the hand<lb></lb>kerchief—he shut it up and put it away again—I saw Croxall take this bludgeon out of the prisoner's pocket—while the prisoner was running away he called out, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>! <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>! "two or three times—a person could hide himself very easily in Mr. Day's cover if be wished—the prisoner had on a light plaid cap, a snuff-coloured shooting-jacket, corduroy trowsers, and a light jacket underneath—I assisted Croxall in taking him to the con<lb></lb>stable; and on the way to Wandsworth police-station he told me he was to have been with the party, but was half an hour too late—he then said that if he had been there twenty men should not have taken him, for he would have knocked them all down as fast as they came up to him.</p>

               <p>might be forty or fifty yards, or a little further off the prisoner when we first saw him—I think fifty was quite the outside—he was about three-quarters of a mile from Coomb-lane—there is no road where he was—he was walking gradually along—his coat was not buttoned completely up, only by one or two buttons—the moment he came up, Croxall identified him as the person who struck him—the prisoner said he had done nothing, and he did not see why he should be taken into custody—he said he had heard the cry for assistance as he was coming down from the main road—he did not in my presence say he had gone into the orchard to see what it was—I did not hold him at all tight when he drew the knife, I only just took hold of him in the common way by the handkerchief—I did not put my knuckles down his neck—he did not complain that I was choking him—he said, "I am not going to cut your hand at all, I am going to cut my handkerchief"—he shut the knife up immediately—I had no conversation with Croxall going along, more than his stating that there were three of them; that two were gone away, and he thought one was left back—he did not mention the prisoner's name, or describe his dress.</p>

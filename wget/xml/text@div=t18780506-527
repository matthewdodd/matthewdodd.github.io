                  </hi>. I am a mariner, of 39, Bolton Road, East Greenwich—at about 8.30 p.m. on Good Friday, 19th April, I was going up the steps of a waxwork show at Greenwich—I went first and my wife had hold of my coat—I noticed Bradshaw by my side—I felt a pull and put my hand up and found my watch and part of my chain gone—Bradshaw turned round to get away—my wife having hold of the hind part of my coat threw Bradshaw down and I fell on him and we had a struggle on the ground—1 got up and called "Police!"—he got up and the watch was lying where he had lain—another man, who is not here, picked it up and said "Here is your watch" three times—I could not get at it; I was holding Bradshaw—I gave him into custody—the other man had gone—I have not seen my watch since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I had hold of his coat to guide myself as I had a child in my arms—I was nearly knocked over by Bradshaw trying to pass between my husband and me—I then saw Bradshaw on the ground and my husband on top of him—I thought my husband was <hi rend="italic">dropping into</hi> him for knocking me over with the child—I then saw my husband's watch pass from Bradshaw's into Moore's hand—I screamed out "That is my husband's watch," and if it had not been for the child I should have caught it—I heard Moore say two or three times "I have got the watch," and I turned round and he was gone—on 25th April I was sent for to Greenwich station, where I found eight or nine men placed in the yard and I recognised Moore who took the watch from Bradshaw—I feel certain he is the man.</p>

I was in a crowd at Strait's Mouth, Greenwich, and found Bradshaw being held by Kedge, who charged him with having stolen his watch, and gave him into my custody—Bradshaw said that Kedge had been offered his watch five or six times, and would not take it—a man in the crowd said to Bradshaw "You stole</p>

               <p>it, find another man ran away with it"—Bradshaw made no reply—I took him to the station, searched him, and found nothing on him—I do not know Moore—Mrs. Kedge gave a description of him the same evening, by which he was apprehended—there was a glaring light from naphtha lamps in front of the show at the time of the robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the H Division of the Criminal Investigation Department—I received information of the robbery, and from a description I apprehended Moore on a Thursday morning at a barber's shop in Brick Lane, Whitechapel—I told him I should take him on suspicion of being concerned with another man named "<hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi>" for stealing a watch at Greenwich—he said he knew nothing about it, he didn't do it, but he knew who did—I took him to the station, and he asked me not to let the inspector see him who had Bradshaw in custody until he was placed with some other persons, so as to give him a fair chance—I complied, and took him into a library apart from the station—he was subsequently placed in a yard with seven or eight others—Kedge looked at them, but failed to identify him, but Mrs. Kedge instantly identified Moore; she said "That is the man who did it"—I said "You had better go up and touch him"—she said "I think it is the man" at first, and then on closer investigation she said "I am positive"—I know both the prisoners, and have seen them together on one or two occasions—I saw them the day previous to Good Friday close to where they live, in Cage Street, Spitalfields.</p>

There was another man amongst those in the yard dressed similarly to you, not exactly like—I don't know that they were most all bricklayers—I didn't inspect them previous to you—Kedge went up to the man next you, and said "I think that is the man, but I should not be able to identify him if I saw him."</p>

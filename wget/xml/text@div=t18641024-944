                  </hi>. I am a painter and glazier, at Hounslow—on Saturday night, 8th October, between 11 and 12, I went into the White Hart public-house, at Whitton—I there saw the three prisoners—I had something to drink, and in order to pay for it I took out my pocket-handkerchief, in which my money was wrapped—I untied it, and took a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece out in their presence—I should think I had between 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my handkerchief</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186410240069"></xptr>
               <p>when I went in; near 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I dare say—it was safe when I came out of the public-house—I might have been there three-quarters of an hour—I left, and Payne accompanied me to a place called the Rifle-butts—I was there met by West and Kemp—West knocked me down, and Kemp took my money that was in the handkerchief, and the handkerchief as well—I had a basket with me with my tools in it, and the handkerchief was in the basket—there was also a diamond there, wrapped up in paper; that went too—West and Kemp jumped over the hedge into a field, and Payne went down by the brookside—Payne did not assist the others, and he did not assist me—I was only struck once—the blow gave me a black eye; it was a severe blow—I cried out "Murder!" and "Police!" and a policeman came up—I made a complaint to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was this Saturday evening pay-day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the money was what I had received for wages—I received it in the Black Dog, at Twickenham—I had perhaps two pints of half-and-half to drink; no gin or rum—I never touch spirits—I might have had a pint of beer where I had my wages—I was sober when I left the White Hart—I was not the worse for liquor—I had nothing out of the way to make me drunk—I received my wages between 6 and 7—I consider I was sober when I left the White Hart—I was quite capable of walking—I have known Kemp two years by sight—he and I were on friendly terms; we never had any fall-out—I have known nothing against him—he has always been a well-conducted young man, as far I am aware of—there were five or six others besides him at the White Hart—I will not swear I did not have more than two pints of beer—I did not take notice of how much I had.</p>

On the night in question I was on duty in Whitton Dean, and I heard some one try to call out about 200 or 300 yards from me; it sounded within ten yards of the Rifle-butt—I went up to the place, and found Andrews on his face on the ground, bleeding very much from the mouth and nose—I raised him up and he made a complaint to me—on the next day, Sunday, I apprehended West—I found blood in three places on his trousers—I charged him with being concerned with two more in assaulting James Andrews, and robbing him of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a glazier's diamond—he said he saw him in the White Hart on Saturday night, but he did not accompany him to Hounslow.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you known the prosecutor some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he is not a man addicted to drink—I think he was stunned from the blow—I don't think he was in drink; he knew me directly—I could not swear he had had no drink—he had a dreadful blow in the eye—it was nearly closed then—I took him to the station and washed him, and he went home—I know Kemp—I have never known much of him—I never knew anything against him; I only knew him about that neighbourhood.</p>

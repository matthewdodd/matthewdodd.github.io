                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman S</hi> 270) On the 20th of October, about a quarter to seven in the evening, I was on duty in the Euston-road, at the corner of Brook-street—it was just getting dark—I saw the prisoner driving a pony-cart at the rate of about seven miles an hour—he was whipping the pony—at the time he turned the corner an omnibus was passing, going towards paddington—the prisoner turned to the right, in the same direction—he continued whipping the pony, endeavouring to pass the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186511200032"></xptr>
               <p>omnibus—a female was crossing the road from the north side to the south, and the right shaft of the prisoner's part caught her in the side of the face, and knocked her down, and the wheels of the omnibus went over her—I assisted in picking her up, and put her in a cab and took her to the University Hospital—the prisoner had beep drinking, but I could not see that he was drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the woman attempt to cross? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the first I saw of her was in the middle of the road—the omnibus was then about half a dozen yards from her—the omnibus was going at a moderate rate; I should say about four miles an hour—I did not notice the pony tumble—when he came out of Brook-street the omnibus was perhaps half a dozen yards behind, and it gradually got in front of the cart—the cart then came slowly after it and got in front of it, and the prisoner commenced whipping his horse again—at the time the accident happened the omnibus horses were close to the back of the cart, almost touching—there were a great many vehicles passing up and down the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an omnibus driver, and live at 18, Vincent-terrace, Islington—on the 20th October I was driving an omnibus in the Euston Road, from a quarter to ten minutes to seven in the evening—I saw the deceased on the opposite side of the road, about to cross—she crossed behind a railway van which was coming down on the opposite side to me—I was going to Brompton—the prisoner's pony and cart came by me rather sharp, and instead of keeping in the middle of the road, he kept whipping his pony to come on the near side, and he very nearly hit my horses in going by—he was going at the rate of from six to seven miles an hour—it was not going at that pace all along, but by his whipping the pony it made a spring just there, and the woman was knocked down—she would have got out of my way if she had not been knocked down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he on his proper side of the road? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but he ought to have kept in the middle, in a direct line after passing me; instead of that he drew in to his near side—three railway vans passed and got behind me—I do not think the last had got by when the accident happened—it was my omnibus that went over the woman; my pole did not strike her; it was the shaft of the cart—I had no time to pull up, and I had no room to pull in nearer the kerb—it was moonlight.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose your omnibus had not been there, would the woman have been knocked down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she would have had plenty of time to clear me—it was what I should call rather a careless piece of driving on the prisoner's part, to cut so close ahead of my horses—he was certainly wrong in the pace he was going at—I saw his pony stumble, or make a sort of a <hi rend="italic">tige</hi>, and he fetched it a cut with the whip which made the pony fly to the near side—that was the cause of his going ahead of me.</p>

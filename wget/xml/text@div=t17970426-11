               <p>Mr. Fielding. May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury. it must be with very deep concern, that you find your attention now engaged upon a charge of murder; it is my duty to inform you, that every circumstance attending this unhappy deed, will demand of you a most solemn, patient, and comprehensive investigation, for, upon the bearing of very minute circumstances, establishing particular facts to your satisfaction will depend the application of the law, as you will receive it from the learned Judge; according as those facts fall within the contemplation of the law in different modes in which the law has considered the death of man, either as the facts will amount to the crime of murder, or as they may only amount to the crime of manslaughter, or the less criminal and less culpable offence of homicide. Gentlemen, upon this melancholy occasion, the person deceased, was a seaman in the King's service, and was employed in what they call a press-gang: but, upon the present occasion, from the particular circumstances of the case, you will not have to hear from the learned Judge, that clear authority, established where the execution of a power is entrusted to an officer of the navy, for the purpose of impressing seamen. Gentlemen, I will not call your attention to the case of the man, as it might arise, by possibility, under the contemplation of a murder, arising from doing an unlawful act. If, upon the present occasion, the clear authority established by law had been in the possession of the party, most undoubtedly his crime would have arisen to a murder upon a very different account than that which I shall take the liberty to state.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, on the 29th of March, the deceased was part of a press gang, under the immediate command of a midshipman, a Mr. Pritchard, not having with them the superior officer of the press-gang; if the lieutenant had been there, the case would have worn a very different complexion; however, as is very customary, the midshipman, together with a part of the gang, were dispatched upon that most disagreeable and dangerous service of endeavouring to impress seamen either upon the river or wherever they might be found: in consequence of an order given to this midshipman, he went in his boat with five of the gang with him down the river, and landed at Poplar; when they landed there, the gang were suffered to go into a public-house to refresh themselves; the midshipman took his station at the door, and had not been very long there before he saw the prisoner at the bar passing; he took him for a seaman, and concluded he would be a fit object of the impress service, although he was not armed with the especial authorities that the law requires, namely, the commission from the Admiralty, for that purpose, which is alone intrusted to the lieutenant of the navy, who was not present; they were then about doing that which would not have been strictly legal, but as is customary, to take men where they could be found, whom he supposed to be proper objects of an impress. Gentlemen, I am sure, to men of your description, I need say very little upon this necessity, and it is a necessity to be deplored, but still it is a necessity, and it is a necessity perfectly established in the very elementary principles of every state, and confirmed by the wisest and most temperate minds for a long time back in this country, to be com prisoner legal and constitutional, but I wish to give the prisoner every advantage of considering this matter not under a legal authority, but as a matter passing between indifferent men. The midshipman, as soon as he saw the prisoner pass, called his men from their place of refreshment; the signal which he gave them, was in the sea language, "all talk," which is a phrase they use on board-a-ship; the deceased came from the house, the other part of the gang came one after the other out of the house, and Mr. Pritchard, the midshipman, followed the prisoner at the bar; before they came up to him, he turned upon them, he presented a pistol towards them, told them, that if they approached he would fire; the midshipman was evidently a man of courage, the gang were likewise men of courage, they were not dismayed by this menace, they insisted upon passing him, he insisting, with his pistol presented towards them, that they should not pass, he swore he would shoot the first man that advanced: Mr. Pritchard, the midshipman, expostulated with him, and desired, that if he was determined to shoot, that he would shoot him, and not the men. Blake, the deceased, being a man of this fortitude, which I have hinted at, he swore in language but too customary with these men, d-n my eyes, but I will pass, the King's highway is as free for me as you; he therefore was attempting to pass, and in that attempt, he was shot by the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Now, Gentlemen, I take it for granted, that you yourselves will conclude immediately, that the prisoner at the bar knew these men were a press-gang, and that Mr. Pritchard,not with standing it would not have been a strictly justifiable and legal authority, when it was enquired into, was about to impress this man if he had turned out to be a proper object. Gentlemen, you are here called upon to exercise a very considerable degree of caution, under the direction of the learned Judge, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260017"></xptr>apprehension of this man cannot amount to any justification, in point of law, for an act that leads to the death of another; that he might have apprehension that these men were about to impress him, cannot, in any possible contemplation of the nature of the human mind, admit, in a Court of Justice, of a warranty for what he has done.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I admit that the design most probably was to impress this man; but it is no more upon design than upon an apprehension in the mind, that the solid wisdom of the law establishes a resting place; a design in the mind must be manifested by acts before it can become either praise-worthy or blameable. In this particular case, for it is always best to consider the particular case, and not at all to deal in the abstract; in this particular case, the only manifestation of the design of the press-gang, which could have held out any possible excuse for any degree of violence, infinitely short of the fatal act that we have to complain of here, must have been carried into a degree of force, affecting his person, and restraining his liberty, no such thing happened here; he himself, whatever his apprehensions were upon this occasion, was the first aggressor, and the last.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the learned Judge will be very well aware of a case which happened so long ago as the year 1749, where a press-gang boarded a shop at Bristol without the proper officer, intrusted with the King's authority, being with them; there the distinction arises manifestly at once, they boarded the ship; so here, if the man had been on board a ship, and this press-gang had gone there without legal authority, then the case would have squared with that determination of which the learned Judge is apprized. In another case, if the prisoner had been in his house, and had been there assailed, or any attempt had been made to have forced into his house, there the case would have squared with that determination likewise; but here, upon the open way, where he might have gone about his business, where he might have attempted to have escaped by swiftness, to turn about, with the men advancing at some distance, threatening to shoot them if they approached, was a degree of rashness, accompanying his apprehension, most criminal indeed. Why, then, Gentlemen, as to the time taken up in this, that will remove the case from every possible consideration in the law which constitutes the crime of man slaughter; for the ingredient in manslaughter is a sudden uncontroulable gust of passion; here there is not that ingredient, for it is predetermined; he turns about, threatens them if they approach that he will shoot them, he having not right, nor pretence of right, to turn about in that situation; and afterwards, executes his purpose, fires the pistol, and kills the man.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, the crime of murder derived from malice aforethought, that malignity which seeks the life of another, I am afraid but too often must make its appearance here. Gentlemen, you find then, in this situation, that the prisoner stands not warranted in any degree, by any manifestation of their design, by any force used towards his person, by any attempt towards the restraint of his liberty; he, on the contrary, is rather the person, that restrains the liberty of those who are desiring to approach, makes use of menace, in order to manifest the intention of his mind, and, therefore, instead of having any one circumstance that can hold out a pretence of excuse for turning in that situation, for presenting his pistol, more particularly less for firing that pistol. - You find that the main ingredient of a murder here makes its appearance, that of the execution of a wicked purpose from a malice aforethought, from a predetermination that if that was done, which he himself chose to prohibit, that he would fire his pistol, which firing causes the death. Gentlemen, here the case stands for your contemplation, as between indifferent men; if it be possible, under the direction of the learned Judge, that you can find a degree of excuse for this rashness of his, I am perfectly contented that men of your description should receive and give him every possible advantage of such a contemplation. But, Gentlemen, you must in order to come at a perfect knowledge, as for as human beings are capable of coming at the knowledge of what passes in the mind of man; you must advert to some circumstances antecedent to this-that he was armed, not only with a pistol, but likewise with a sword. Gentlemen, having fired his pistol at Blake, the ball having wounded him, of which wound he afterwards died, Blake being a man of courage then struck him with a whip; upon which he instantly, with the butt end of his pistol, knocked Blake down; then it was, that another of the gang, Thomas, rushed upon him, seized the stick which Blake had before held, and knocked him down; in falling he attempted to draw the sword which he had, and as it was afterwards declared by him, if it had not been for the wresting of that sword from him by the hand of power, with that sword he was determined to have killed the midshipman.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in a case of this sort, you will naturally expect, where a scuffle takes place, where the whole of the business is not so accurately seen by all as by some, that there must be shades of difference in the testimony of the witnesses; Mr. Pritchard, I have told you, was forward upon the occasion, and when the man turned round and threatened to shoot, he exhorted him, if he was so determined, that he would shoot him, saying, at the same time, he did not mind his pistol for he had one too; he produced his pistol, and presented it at him. Now, Gentlemen, whatever was the behaviour of Mr. Pritchard after this act, whatever was the behaviour of any one of the men after the act, will not alter your contemplation of that very moment of time when he fired the pistol; and the other necessary enquiry, as to the state of his mind before the pistol was fired. These men, exasperated as they were for the death of their companion, used him in such a manner as they would not otherwise have done; he was secured, taken to a Magistrate's, and the poor man was taken to the hospital. Of course upon this occasion, there was a Coroner's Inquest summoned, to enquire upon the death; the Coroner's Inquest have made their enquiry, and upon what ground it was it is not for me to say, but they brought in a verdict, in this case, of justifiable homicide; the facts being made known to the officers of the Crown, it was expedient that they should enquire a little further into the business; the Magistrate thought it therefore his duty to apprehend the man, and he, in consequence of the previous determination of the Coro<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260018"></xptr>ner's Jury, considered it as manslaughter only. It now comes before you, enabling you, if you think the facts call upon you, when you shall have heard the evidence, believing what they say, to establish this material fact, that he, the first aggressor, with malice aforethought, killed this man.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have taken the liberty to suggest to you the grounds upon which that establishment is likely to take place, together with the impossibility of all the circumstances or acts done by any part of this press-gang, giving him the least pretence of warrant in law for the malignant rashness which immediately followed the culpable apprehension. That the men might have intimated their purpose, and that he might so have understood it, goes not to a tittle of justification; the only ground upon which he could derive the least sanction for what he was about to do, would have been a violation of his liberty, or degree of force, and attack upon his person.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, upon an occasion of this fort, the most scrupulous examination is necessary; the men who appear on the part of the prosecution, should be attended to, and will be attended to by you, with every degree of jealousy, with every thing that is scrupulous; such an impression as they make upon your minds, such I am sure the Court will be satisfied with, and so shall I. Gentlemen, you shall hear these witnesses, you will hear the account of Mr.Pritchard, and of the other men who were there; it happens upon every melancholy occasion like this, where many witnesses are called forward, there will be different shades in their testimony, they are best submitted to a Jury of the country, twelve gentlemen, attentive to the manner in which a witness gives his evidence, and to the probable and natural circumstances attending a transaction, their determination will always be satisfactory. Upon this occasion you are not troubled with, nor will the learned Judge be troubled with any thing respecting the legality of the authority for impressing seamen; I admit that the authority with which the midshipman was armed, was not sufficient to have carried into effect, with any degree of violence or restraint, the execution of his purpose; and I therefore say, that though he was not armed with the legal authority, he did nothing but as a common man, he was warranted in doing; they did not advance to any attack, to any the least restraint of the liberty of this man, but he, on his part, was the aggressor, under a degree of sanguinary rashness of mind, which one cannot think of without very considerable horror; if therefore, upon the whole of the case, you shall be satisfied from his behaviour, with the time which he had for deliberation, that instead of deliberating upon the likelihood of making his escape, his mind was determined upon it with malice aforethought; you will do your duty, by finding him guilty of murder; if on the contrary, you find any part of this turn into a scuffle, into any attack, or any thing like an attack, and that in consequence of that, a sudden gust, and a natural gust of passion took place, and that under the influence of that, without premeditated malice, he killed the man, then assuredly it will be manslaughter; less than that it cannot by possibility be; you shall hear the witnesses, and I am sure your determination will be satisfactory.</p>

               <p>Q. About what time in the afternoon was it that you saw the prisoner at the bar? - A. about five o'clock; my men were at the sign of the King's-arms, near the river side, they call the place Mill Wall; I was at the door, and upon seeing the prisoner, I called out, "all talk," which is the signal for mustering the men together; upon that they followed me; one, I believe, staid behind to pay for the bread and cheese; we followed him, and hearing us behind him, and hearing the pass word, which he knew very well, he turned round with his face towards me, and presented a pistol at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he presented the pistol to you, had you said any thing to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you done any thing to him? - A. No; I was on the same path that he was, but he was before me; he said he would shoot the first man that came nearer to him; I then begged to speak a few words to him, which he granted; I asked him his name, he told me his name was Christie. belonging to the Young William; the whole of the time he was speaking to me, he walked backwards with his face to me, and kept himself upon his guard; I then asked him to suffer me to pass by him, which he refused, saying, the first man that came a step nearer to him, he would shoot; William Blake then made a similar request, which was denied him; Blake, in reply, said, d-m my eyes but I will go past you; Blake instantly started, with an intention to pass him, and he immediately shot him, the ball entered the right breast; Blake then endeavoured to make a blow at him, after he was shot, and his stick flew out of his hand, the prisoner instantly knocked him down with the muzzle of the pistol;

               <p>Q. Should I mistake it if I said you pursued him when he tried to get away? - A. We walked after him; we intended to impress him, no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him, or were you told before you set out that he was upon his Majesty's service, and it was vain to attempt to take him, for mischief would ensue if you did? - A. Mr. Action said something like it, but I was not to mind what people say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not his words these: do not be after any of your old tricks, that man is a mate in the service of one of the transports, and it is vain to attempt to take him? - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you say, that let him be a mate of a transport, or the devil himself, you would have him? - A. I did not; I said it signified nothing, I will over-hawl him, or something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say you are drunk, and you will repent this? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you were drunk? - A. It was impossible I should be drunk, I had drank but one glass of grog after dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who kept that house? - A. No; I was in at Mr. Acton's.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know who keeps the public-house? - A. I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a Mr. Mills? - A. Yes; he keeps the King's-head, at East-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been there? - A. I called there as I was going across the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Mills was an old acquaintance of your's? - A.No more than any other, I had a pint of porter every day from there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him for any arms? - A. I called for a pistol that I left the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing else about arms? - A. I passed a joke, and asked him to lend me a hanger.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you remember his saying, in this state I will not trust you with a cutlass, you are drunk? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. He did refuse it you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember saying, at least I have a right to my own pistol? - A. I took it.</p>
               <p>Q.After this unfortunate accident you went again to Mills's? - A. Yes; after the man was gone to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing particular passing upon this subject there? - A. I only went to order a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you been drinking there in the morning? - A. I do not recollect that I had any thing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. You were there in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was three times then you were there? - A. I go every morning to look after my boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260020"></xptr>since? - A. Yes; I have been called to an account by his wife, several time, about the accident, because Christie was a particular friend of their's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember shewing him your minute? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember telling him you would make it still better? - A. Mills pretended to be a friend of mine, and I shewed it him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember his objecting to some things in it, and altering it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only note you have wrote? - A. That is the only time I ever put pen to paper upon the subject; I delivered a copy of it to Captain

               <p>Q. Upon following this man he knew perfectly your business, that there can be no doubt about, and then he turned round and presented his pistol, and said, the first man that came near he would shoot; did not he tell you who he was, that his name was Christie, and was the same person that had been described to you by Mr. Action? - A. He said his name was Christie, and he belonged to the Young William.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what ship that was? - A. She was a transport, in what service she is at present I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What service was she in at the time of the accident? - A. I believe in the merchant service.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Upon your coming up to him, with the rest of the gang, did not you make use of these words, d-n you if you are good at that, I have got one too, and did not you then draw your pistol and level it at him? - A. He said he would shoot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not draw backwards for an hundred and fifty yards, you all the time trying to get round him with these men? - A. He did a good way.</p>
               <p>Q. The place itself is a causeway, with the water on one side, and a deep ditch on the other? - A. A marsh on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he must know you meant to get round him, in a place where he could not possibly escape? - A. We meant to over-hawl him, no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you try to take hold of him by the hand, and said, by God, let you be what you will I will have you? - A. I wanted to shake hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you snap your pistol at him? - A. I am perfectly sure I did not, I told him in the boat that he as much deserved to be shot as the poor man that lay in the boat, but the laws of his country should punish him.</p>
               <p>Court. I put it to you, Mr. Fielding,"I think it is impossible this can amount to murder; and I think it is as impossible but it must be manslaughter. Gentlemen of the Jury, We have interfered in this case, it appearing that the evidence is not likely to be varied, and that it can only amount to manslaughter; that being our clear opinion in point of law, perhaps you will be satisfied to find him guilty of manslaughter upon this evidence.</p>

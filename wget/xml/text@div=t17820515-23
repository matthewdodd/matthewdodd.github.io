On Tuesday, the 7th of May, between three and four o'clock, I went into the parlour; in a few minutes, I heard something in the passage; I went out, and found the prisoner in my house. I asked her what business she had there: she said she wanted to enquire for one Johnson, a journeyman cooper. I said I had a good mind to send for a constable to search her: she said, I might, she had nothing. I then turned her out. In about two minutes after, I had occasion to go into Mr. Gallopine's house, which is the next door; I saw the prisoner come out of the little room, with 11 lb. of sugar in her apron: she had taken it out of a closet in Mr. Gallopine's house, which is used for the purpose of keeping sugar in it: I cannot say whether the closet was locked. Upon comparing the sugar I found upon her, I found it was some of the same sort as that left in the closet. It was Mr. Gallopine's sugar.</p>
               <p>(The sugar was produced in court by the constable, and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I was going home to my three fatherless children; I saw a parcel of sugar on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178205150017"></xptr> threshold of a gentleman's door; I took it up, and went in to ask if a sugar-porter lived there; the gentleman told me no. I went to go out, but sat down to eat some: I took it to be broken victuals, and was very thankful for it: these two gentlemen came up, and used me very ill; they took my apron from my side, and made my nose bleed.</p>

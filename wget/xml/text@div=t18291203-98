On the 15th of November I was across the road, and saw the prisoner come out of my shop with a pair of shoes, as if he had bought them; when he got a few yards from the door I went to him, and whether I took them from his hand, or from the ground, I am not certain; but the officer came up and took him - he offered me 1s., and said I had offered them to him for that; but I had not seen him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GREEN. I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner, and saw these shoes taken from his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went in the shop, and took up the boots; there was no one there, and I brought them out to look at them.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DOGGETT. He was ten or twelve yards from the shop - he cried very much, and seemed sorry for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at 17, Rushton Street, Old Ford—on 3rd July, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was in Bishopsgate Street, going home—I was walking along, taking no notice of anyone; as I got just against Sun Street there were three men; one of them spoke to me, I took no notice, and all at once the three came and <hi rend="italic">collared</hi> me—they knocked my hat over my eyes—the prisoner struck me just above the eye—the other two were holding me, and one of them picked my pocket of my purse and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I don't know which it was—the police came up; the other two ran away—there was one man looking out—I got hold of the prisoner, and held him till the policeman came and took him into custody.</p>

I am an assistant in the Post Office, and live in Aldersgate Buildings—on the morning of 3rd July, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was in Bishopsgate Street, with a person named Nightingale and a young girl, a neighbour—I saw the prisoner and two others coming from the direction of the City and going towards Shoreditch—one of them separated and went over to Brushfield Street—when I next saw the three they were scuffling with the prosecutor—the prisoner is one of the three; I am certain of him—the other two were holding the prosecutor's arms, and the prisoner was in the middle—he placed his left hand in the prosecutor's right trousers pocket—the prosecutor was struggling with him, trying to get him away—</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my parents at 6, Aldersgate Street—I was with Haynes and Nightingale on 3rd July, after 12 o'clock, going home—I saw the prisoner and two other young men coming along from the City, singing—when they got opposite Brush-field Street, one left, and went down Brushfield Street—the other two walked on towards Shoreditch—the prisoner was one of the two; I am sure of that—I saw the prosecutor coming along towards the City—the two men whistled to the young man that had left and went across the road, and the other one joined them, and they came along arm-in-arm, went up to the prosecutor, and touched him on the shoulder, and said "What cheer, old <hi rend="italic">pal</hi>?"—one of them hit him on the hat, two held his hands and arms, and the prisoner put his hand in his pocket and took out his purse, and his pocket was turned inside out—I was not 6 yards from them—I picked up a penny, and gave it to the constable—the other two got away.</p>

I have done nothing"—I said "Well, if you have done nothing, just wait a few minutes"—the prosecutor came up, and said he had lost his purse with 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd in it, and the prisoner had taken it—I said to the prisoner "What do you think of that now?"—he said he knew nothing about it—he was taken to the station and searched, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper was found on him—he was asked for his name and address, but he refused it—he gave the name of Edwards at the Police Court, but no address—his coat-flap was torn, and only hung by a little bit.</p>

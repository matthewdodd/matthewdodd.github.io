            , we live on the Commercial-road. On the 22d of October, I was passing from Whitechapel to Flower and Dean-street, about five minutes past eleven o'clock at night, going to fetch one of my children.

               <p>"Yes," and walked on my left side till we got about the middle of the street, and then knocked me down in the mud and took off my shawl; he got me down by going behind me, putting both his hands on my shoulders, and pushing me forward, and took my shawl; he took it at the same moment as he shoved me. He ran back immediately the way we came. It was a dark night, but there were lamps in the street. I am sure he is the man, from his size and dress.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was standing at the corner of George's-street; the prisoner went by just before eleven o'clock, and about five minutes after I saw the prosecutrix standing up all covered with mud. In consequence of what she said, I went in pursuit, and about a quarter before twelve o'clock, Pate and I were together, and the prisoner was coming down Winfield-street; I stopped him and asked what he had done with the shawl he took from the woman, (she had not described him - I took him from seeing him go by about the time;) he said</p>
               <p>"What woman?" I said the woman who was knocked down and had the shawl taken from her in George's-street; he strongly denied it. I took him with the assistance of my partner, to her house; he still denied it. Pate took off his hat and the shawl was in it. I saw nobody else in the street when he went down.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 102, Star Street, Edgware Road—I entered that service of the prisoner in February, 1862—he was then carrying on business at 1, Sermon Lane, St. Paul's Church Yard, as a woollen merchant, I may say as a general merchant, under the firm of Thomas Edgley &amp; Co.—Mr. Henry Edward Watts was a partner in the firm—at that time there was no other firm carried on by the prisoner—afterwards, in May, 1863, an establishment was opened at 88, Oxford Street, under the name of Grant and Co.; that was a mantle and shawl warehouse—Thomas Edgley &amp; Co. were the members of that firm; that is Edgley &amp; Watts—subsequently to that the firm of Whytall &amp; Co., of 46, High Holborn, became merged in it—the firm was Whytall, Elliott, &amp; Co., woollen drapers—Elliott went out of it, and Whytall made an assignment to Edgley &amp; Co.—Whytall &amp; Elliott are both dead—1 think in or about 1864 that business became merged into Mr. Edgley's—there was a firm of E. H. Watts &amp; Co. at Leeds, in 1862, when I went into the employment—the prisoner and Watts were members of that firm—they were woollen manufacturers—that firm had an account with the Leeds Banking Company—in 1862 or 1863 the firm of Edgley &amp; Co., in London, were in the habit of receiving bills signed by Jacob Van Cleef, from abroad—the letters, as a rule, came from Paris—I have seen several of the bills with the heading of "Maydempeck;" they were not accepted by E. H.</p>

               <p>Watts &amp; Co.—when those bill were received they were entered in due form in the bill-book, and passed to the Leeds Banking Company for discount, addressed to the manager, all of them, so far as I had cognizance of them—all those bills were duly entered, and very particularly so—I believe Edgley &amp; Co.'s bill-book is in Court—a large number of those bills accepted by Van Cleef were received here in London by Edgley &amp; Co.—I have seen several—they were sometimes accepted by Van Cleef, per procuration—here is one (<hi rend="italic">referring to the bill-book</hi>) "No. 2861, J. Van Cleef &amp; Co. to E. H Watts &amp; Co., payable at the London Joint Stock Bank, October 10, due April 13, for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is a promissory note, not a bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As a rule they were promissory notes, payable to the order of E.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you find out where they were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We could not find out always—when I did find out it was by going to the various notaries—I had instructions from the prisoner to do so, but I generally knew pretty well where to find them—Mr. Edgley himself had no particular knowledge about it, for he never took up bills himself, but I was perfectly acquainted with the various notaries of the different bankers, so that when I received a cheque in the morning I would proceed to the various notaries and put the question hap-hazard—I got the cheque from Messrs. Edgley, either Mr. Edgley or Mr. Watts, signed by Mr. Edgley or Mr. Watts—I have been in the habit of receiving cheques for that purpose once a week, or ten days, or a fortnight, perhaps, according to the time that the bills arrived at maturity—I received orders from Mr. Edgley or Mr. Watts to take up the bills or notes—the bills probably would become due to-day, and Mr. Edgley would give me a cheque on the following morning, and say, "Grant, go and take up these bills or notes of Van Cleef's"—he might have given orders about other notes and bills besides Van Cleef's, in several instances—I recollect Van Cleef s, that was by word of mouth—I then went about to the different notaries to find out where Van Cleef's bills were—I always cashed the cheque before 1 took up the bills, and paid them in bank notes—that proceeding continued I may say from the middle of 1863, taking up bill of various descriptions, up to the failure of the Leeds Banking Company, on 17th September, 1864—when I got the notes I brought them back to the prisoner—Edgley &amp; Co. were in the habit of receiving these promissory notes from Van Cleef, to the best of my belief, up to the end of 1863—Van Cleef's bills did not go up to 1864—the Maydempeck Forest Company's bills succeeded Van Cleef's—this bill-book is not in my handwriting; the first part of it is in Mr. Green's, the second is Mr. Bertram's, he his here—I heard of Van Cleef's bankruptcy—up to that time I believe Edgley &amp; Co. were in the habit of receiving his promissory notes—I can't be certain when that was—this bill-book was kept in the counting-house of Thomas Edgley &amp; Co., and was referred to by them from time to time—towards the end of 1863, Mr. Bertram was a clerk in the office, I think he came in the early part of 1863 or the latter end of 1862—towards the end of 1863 or the beginning of 1864 I heard the prisoner say to him, "Bertram, go and get some bill forms, if possible, in the French language," and Bertram, I believe, obtained them at Mr. Biden's, in Cheapside—they were filled up for certain amounts, under the direction of Mr. Edgley, and placed on his desk, and then transmitted to the Leeds Banking Company for discount—the name of E. Devillers was</p>

H. Watts &amp; Co., signed E. Devillers, endorsed E. H. Watts &amp; Co., Edward Greenland, and Smith, Payne, &amp; Smith—this is one of the forms purchased by Bertram—the body of it is in Bertram's writing, and the signature, "E. Devillers," is Mr. Edgley's writing; I recognise it as his—it is something after his style, bold—the endorsement, "E. H. Watts and Co.," is also Mr. Edgley's writing—here are four bills, in French, signed by the prisoner, one is dated 27th February, 1864, due 23rd September, for 1037<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is signed "E.

H.

H. Watts and Co.—here are two of 10th April for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1069<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., those are in English—these purport to be drawn in sets but they are not, they are separate bills, there is only one of each kind—there are two separate bills of 10th April, and two of 1st May, 1864, I say the same as to those—they all purport to be endorsed by Mr. Greenland—they are on the forms bought by Mr. Bertram—they were filled up in the counting house and ante-dated, all of them, from 15 to 20 days—Watts endorsed a good many of them—in packet No. 2 here are three separate bills, dated 1st March, 1864, in English with foreign bill stamps, endorsed E. H. Watts and Co., by Watts, the body written by Bertram, and the signature, E. Devillers, by the prisoner—here are 30 bills of that class, of different dates, from 1st March to 25th August, all endorsed by Watts—I have here five bills in French, dated 27th February, 1864, signed by Edgley in the name of Devillers, in favor of A. Teal and Co., and endorsed by Teal and Co. in Teal's own handwriting; they are all written in the same way—I knew a firm of A. Teal and Co.; in Leeds—I know Teal personally: Edgley and Co. had business transactions with them—here are 39 bills in English, on foreign stamps, signed and endorsed in the same way, and they bear Greenland's endorsement as well—those bills were passed through the Leeds Bank by Teal and Co., the whole of them are endorsed by Greenland—the body of them is in Bertram's writing, the dates range from 10th March to 25th August, 1864—here is another class, part 4, bills in favor of Teal and Co., they are in English, signed by Edgley in the name of E. Devillers, endorsed by Teal, the body in Bertram's writing—here are one or two that I should say were in Bertram's handwriting, and many of them an imitation—(<hi rend="italic">selecting</hi>) that is what I consider a genuine one, and this I consider a good imitation—I don't say it is an imitation by Edgley, I believe it to be in Teal's handwriting; I am not an expert in handwriting, but I should think here are about eight imitations of Bertram's writing, there are ten altogether in the packet; the dates are from 10th March to 25th August, 1864—here is a single bill for 1120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated 24th May, 1864, in English</p>

               <p>on a foreign bill stamp, in favor of E. H. Watts and Co., signed "E Devillers," I wrote the name of Devillers there—the body is written by Bertram, and it is endorsed by Mr. Watts—that bill was drawn in June, 1864, during Mr. Edgley's absence on the continent, in Servia, at the Forest—when he came back I told him this bill of the Maydempeck Forest Company was coming due during his absence, and I signed it E. Devillers—that was by no order, I volunteered to sign it—he said, "All right, keep your own counsel, and it will be all right"—after I had signed it, the bill was sent to the Leeds bank to be discounted, and the proceeds of it used to take up one of the Maydempeck bills that was becoming due at that time—the Leeds bank returned us drafts at two months, through Smith, Payne, and Smith, their agents—all the Maydempeck Forest bills with the signature of Devillers were made payable at the London and Westminster bank—Edgley had no account there, he banked at the Imperial bank—here is a bill signed by Teal, in the name of Devillers, dated 20th August, 1864, for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in favor of Teal and Co., it is endorsed by Teal and Co., and the body of the bill is in Teal's writing, in imitation of Bertram's—none of it is in Edgley's writing—there is another bill for 1430<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 20th August, the body of which is in Teal's writing, and the signature, E. Devillers, is Mr. Edgley's; that is to the order of Alfred Teal, and endorsed by Alfred Teal, the body is Teal's writing, in imitation of Bertram's—all the bills in favor of Watts and Co. were entered in the defendant's bill book, we were extremely particular that such should be the case—we kept no note whatever of those in favor of Teal and Co.—they were forwarded directly by Mr. Edgley to Teal—I have taken up several of those when they arrived at maturity; Teal would give us notice a day or two before, and I went, in the same manner to the various notaries but Teal always forwarded the money first—the amounts of the bills were given to Bertram sometimes by me, but as a rule by Mr. Edgley—and the dates—the exact date was not stated, he merely told him to ante-date them for 15 or perhaps 20 days—I have heard that said—I got the amounts from the diary kept of the bills falling current.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any general instructions from the defendant as to how bills coming due were to be dealt with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on many occasions; from day to day—we used to keep a red book, showing the whole transac<lb></lb>tions of the month, of all bills becoming due from day to day—it would save much trouble if I could have the red books; there are several of them in Bertram's writing dissected from the bill book—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the red books—as the bills came due, Mr. Edgley would say to Bertram, "Go and get me three or four blank stamps"—those stamps would be filled up for the amount required, covering interest, &amp;c.—those bills would be forwarded in due course to the Leeds Banking Company, and drafts to cover the bills about to mature would be sent—as they became due, Mr. Edgley would say to me from time to time, "Grant, attend to those bills," or, "Have you arranged for those bills?"—I had to obtain the amounts of the bills arriving at maturity from the bill book or the red book—Mr. Edgley told me to do that, as a rule—he would say, "Grant, you had better get bills to renew the bills falling due on such a day"—I should then tell Bertram to fetch them—if there was one falling due for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., we should draw one for 1030<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1040<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to cover the interest which would be liable on the bill falling due—he gave those instructions to Bertram as a rule but, in my presence: that was only done on the first, second, or third transaction.</p>

What can I do in the matter? In fact, Mr. Teal, I advise you, as a friend, not to let this bill go out into the world, you know the time comes when it is due and cross bills like this has a very bad effect; what would your banker say to seeing either Van Cleef's name or our name on an acceptance of yours; think of it and take my advice; I have explained to Mr. Greenland the nature of these timber or Forest of Peck bills, and you need have no difficulty in offering the other one and taking out a draft on London, for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Do this by return, and I will send you back your acceptance.

There were only one or two continental customers to my knowledge; they were chiefly in various parts of this kingdom, and some of the best houses in the kingdom and in the colonies—the business at 188, Oxford-street was originally the business of Walter Joyce and Co., who were debtors to Mr. Edgley and failed to a large amount—it then became Grant and Co., Grant being your humble servant—they tried to make the best they could out of a very bad bargain, and a bad bargain it was for them—they owed Edgley and Co. between 1300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I was not a partner—I accepted the bills—it was done if possible to recoup the amount they had lost—that was also the nature of the transaction with respect to the firm of Whytall and Co., Holborn—I have not taken the trouble to ascertain the amount of the bills of Van Cleef which were in existence prior to the stoppage of the Leeds bank—I have not the least idea of the amount—I believe they were all in respect of commercial transactions of a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> character—I believe they were for goods which Edgley sold to Van Cleef, and that they represented bills which were renewed from time to time—I only know that from what I learnt from the ledger—I believe that was the nature of the original debt before I entered the service—that was to the amount of about 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe that during the time I was in Mr. Edgley's service Van Cleef's bills represented bond fide transactions.</p>

H. Watts and Co. or Edgley and Co., discounted by the Leeds Banking Company, 12000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or more was sent in that way—the bills contained in the account of the Maydempeck Company were ante-dated 8, 9, and 11 days—they were all dated London or Leeds—if they were drawn in the name of Desire or the other names they would be dated Maydempeck—they were all made in London—I do not remember money being sent out to Maydempeck before the date of the agreement between Edgley and Teal—I won't undertake to say it. was not so—Mr. Edgley went to Servia on three or four occasions—the first time I believe was in the early part of 1863—he was absent for about two months, I should think—I do not remember remitting money to him on that occasion—he went again about August, 1863—he was then absent five or six weeks, to the best of my belief—we received letters from him very regularly—I certainly had a notion that the whole thing was bond <hi rend="italic">fide</hi>—I believed it to be a perfect Eldorado—in the simplicity of my nature, I might have believed that if the Leeds bank had not stopped, it would have turned out an Eldorado—I know that Mr. Edgley chartered ships bring timber from Servia—I do not know how many—I knew it from con<lb></lb>versations that I heard between Mr. Edgley and Mr. Waargan and one or two others—Mr. Waargan is a ship-broker in the City—I overheard conversations between him and Mr. Edgley with reference to the ships being chartered—I cannot give you the particulars—the door of the counting-house was open at the time—the charter parties did not come under my observation—I do not know whether Desire was the son of Van Cleef—I never saw him, and I never had a conversation even with Van Cleef—I have seen a man they call Van Cleef, or Jacobs, on one or two occasions at Edgley's—I have never been present at any conversations between him and Edgley—I did not know of plant and machinery being sent out by Edgley to Servia—I do not remem<lb></lb>ber Edgley telling me of Van Cleef having become bankrupt—I heard him tell parties in the counting-house, casual persons who came in, that he had obtained an assignment of Van Cleef's interest in the con<lb></lb>cession—I believe he went out purposely to obtain it—I did not hear him say that he had instituted legal proceedings in Servia for the purpose of enforcing his right—I heard him say that Van Cleef was a stubborn devil and that he did not think he should get it out of him, but that he had made him give it up—I remember some conversation about Van Cleef's creditors in Paris endeavouring to upset the assignment, and that he had been obliged to take legal proceedings in foreign courts to establish his rights; that was the substance of it—all the bills having relation to the affairs of Thomas Edgley and Co., are entered in the bill books and in the ledger—we were very particular in entering every bill—these books were kept either by Edgley or his clerks, and were open at the counting house to the end—all the transactions were entered.</p>

Frolich, of Pesth—they are bankers there—I do not know how Frolich disbursed it—I saw Devillers first in 1864, at 1; Sermon Lane—he came there as a clerk in the counting-house—he remained three or four months—I had seen him before, in the summer of 1864, on a casual visit to his uncle, Mr. Edgley—when he was a clerk in the office he made entries of the various sales, and made out the invoices at Mr. Edgley's desire—he was totally unacquainted with and ignorant of commercial matters—I believe it was Mr. Edgley's desire to make something of him if he could—I have seen him here to-day—he is about twenty-five or twenty-six years of age—the Maydempeck-Company's name was not up at Sermon Lane—I know nothing of any such company or its. affairs.</p>

I am the official liquidator of the Leeds Banking Company—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be a correct copy of a deed which was executed on 19th December, 1864, between Thomas Edgley and Edward Henry Watts, of the first part; Charles Butler and Alexander Young, of the second part; and the creditors of Edgley and Watts, of the third part—it is a deed of inspectorship of their estates—I have not looked at it—it would, of course, contain a deed of release on the winding-up of the affairs—until the early part of last year I had no notice of the mode in which these bills had been drawn in London—I then communicated it to the Committee of Shareholders, and they directed this prosecution under the direction of the Vice-Chancellor—as far as I know they knew nothing</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you instituted these proceedings, under the direction of the Court, were you under the belief that the bills were forgeries? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was; my information was, that the defendant had signed these bills—I do not know that it was stated that it was without Devillers' sanction, but that the signature was not the signa<lb></lb>ture of Devillers—I believe it was upon that charge of forgery that the warrant against Mr. Edgley was obtained—in the first instance, I think, the sanction of the Vice Chancellor was that he should be prosecuted for forgery; but we have been more than once before the Vice Chancellor as the case has assumed its different features—two or three months previous to the deed of inspectorship, Mr. Edgley put himself in communication with me about his indebtedness to the Leeds bank, in common with the other debtors—I think I have seen him in Leeds—he came forward when<lb></lb>ever he was required to give information with reference to his transactions with the bank—I was the only liquidator; Mr. Young, my partner, did not interfere—Messrs. Bond were solicitors, in Leeds, to the liquidators, Messrs. Freshfields, in London—Mr. Denton, now of the firm of Crowder &amp; Maynard, was there, until the appointment of the liquidator, as the representative of Messrs. Smith, Payne &amp; Smith, the largest creditors; he was then with Messrs. Freshfields—I can't say whether the defendant also gave information to Mr. Denton—I have no doubt he presented himself whenever he was required—he was carrying on business up to December, 1864—I don't think he was carrying on the business; I think he virtually suspended payment as soon as the Leeds bank stopped—I cannot charge my memory whether I had a conversation with Mr. Edgley, at that time, about the Maydempeck Forest business; I think it is very likely—I think he stated that he had been out there on several occasions, and that he had sent out ships for the purpose of bringing home timber from the Danube—I have heard that it was so, but when and from whom I cannot tell; but I think, in all probability, from Mr. Edgley himself—an order may have been ob<lb></lb>tained by his inspectors, on 17th December, 1864, to take possession of whatever property might be found at the forest, or in the vessels; I think not by me—I have no recollection of any order upon Van Cleef and Denelly to receive any amounts due to him; I should think his inspectors would have obtained that—I concurred in Mr. Dresser's being sent over to obtain whatever timber there was felled, or on board ships—if I recollect right, the inspectors sent him over; I don't think I did—the inspectors were Mr. Butler, and Mr. Young, my partner—that was done with the sanction and concurrence of Mr. Edgley—it was either in 1864 or 1865, very soon after the failure of the bank—I think Mr. Edgley offered to accompany Mr. Dresser, for the purpose of rendering every facility he could in obtaining any property that might be there—I believe he gave notice that he would surrender at the Mansion House on the charge of forgery; and he did surrender, without being taken into custody.</p>

Freshfield—they are out of my hands—they were instructions as to what I was to do, and who I was to inquire for—I did not find Van Cleef there, I found him at Belgrade, that is about a day by steamer from Melanovitz, the nearest place on the Danube to May<lb></lb>dempeck—I was two days at Belgrade on my way—I saw Van Cleef there—I made inquiries from him—he was not residing there, he was merely staying at the same hotel that I was—Mr. Edgley had told me I should find Van Cleef either at Belgrade, or somewhere near about there—I found him there, and left him there—I found a forest of valuable timber at Maydempeck—the whole country round about there is called Maydempeck—there was no business carried on while I was there—there was some timber felled—the whole forest I should think would be about twenty leagues in extent—the value of the timber accrues on its being taken down the Danube to Sulina, the port, that is a day's journey—it is brought from the forest to the banks of the river by oxen and horses, and then put on board large flat-bottomed craft, and taken to Sulina—I saw a considerable quantity of timber felled—I did not find any vessels at Milanovitz laden with timber—I went there—there were no ships there, I made inquiries for them—I went up the banks of the river to see if there were any ships lying there—I did not go any very great distance, but the only place where they could lie was close to the village, and there were none there—I went the whole way down the Danube by daylight, when I could have seen any vessel that was there, and there was none but small fishermen's boats—I saw very little timber lying on the banks—I saw some staves, very few, they are made up in the forest; there might have been a couple of thousand—I saw no plank timber there—there is the means of sawing it in the forest—I spoke to Van Cleef about the forest.</p>

I carry on business at 21, Lime Street, as a merchant—the only business transactions I had with Mr. Edgley were with reference to the Maydempeck Forest, in 1863—he knew that I was intimately ac<lb></lb>quainted with the timber trade, and got himself introduced to me, he not knowing anything of that particular branch of the business—he requested me to assist him, and give him information as to the felling of trees, and manufacturing them into not only square timber, but also into staves—I gave him every sort of information, and had many interviews with him, and it ended in his agreeing that I should take charge of the various consign<lb></lb>ments coming to this country as well as to the continent—I put myself in communication with a great many of the leading houses in the timber trade, in England and on the continent; and he instructed me to charter several ships to convey the produce to this country—that was about the end of 1863—in pursuance of these instructions, in 1864 I chartered some vessels to go to Servia—it was either in December, 1863, or January, 1864, I chartered five ships for Sulina, at the mouth of the Danube; their names were the <hi rend="italic">Dwina, Hercules, Memel, Chard</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Jamaica</hi>—some of those vessels belonged to London, probably; I do not know—the <hi rend="italic">Chard</hi> belonged to Liverpool—I entered into a contract with the brokers of the vessels, for them to go out to Sulina and bring back timber—I signed a formal charter party—they proceeded to Sulina in the ordinary course—I know they all arrived there, but there was no cargo ready for them—after some delay some cargo came down—some of the vessels were actually laden with staves—I have seen the cargo by the <hi rend="italic">Jamaica</hi>, and the part cargo by the <hi rend="italic">Chord</hi>, in the docks, in London—the <hi rend="italic">Jamaica</hi> brought a cargo of oak staves, and the <hi rend="italic">Chard</hi> a partial cargo, a half cargo—I should have thought that the value of the half cargo of the <hi rend="italic">Chard</hi> was about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., after the payment of all expenses, and the <hi rend="italic">Jamaica</hi> about 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; she was a smaller ship—Theologus and Carnegie attended to the cargo—I know there has been a great deal of dispute about the other vessels—they were ultimately loaded for whom they might concern; they did the best they could—they were laden with general cargoes, not with wood—I believe they came back to this country—they took about three months to go out; they arrived out about May or June; and I should think they got back about September.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, at present carrying on business at 16, Bishopsgate Street—I have a house at Galatz—I am in partnership with John Robertson Theologus—the first time I ever heard of Mr. Edgley, or of the house of Edgley &amp; Co., was the receipt of a letter from London enclosing bills of lading for a shipment coming by steamer to Galatz—that was in the Bummer of 1862—the shipment was for winches, ropes, and gear to be used in working the forest, with instructions to forward them to Van Cleef, at Belgrade—our business was to re-ship them from Galatz up the Danube—that letter was signed Edgley &amp; Co.—the next I heard of the forest was when I returned to England in 1863—Van Cleef and Edgley came to me and asked me to make a contract for carrying timber home—that was at the end of 1862, or the beginning of 1863—afterwards I had to see Van Cleef in Paris; we differed about the rate, and it came to nothing—I was in England in February, 1864—I then received a letter of instructions from Edgley, containing five charter-parties of the <hi rend="italic">Hercules</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Dwina</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Jamaica</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Chard</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Memel</hi>—I saw Mr. Edgley at his office, and he showed me some correspondence from Denelly, his agent, about the timber being sent down—he asked me if I would take charge of the shipments of the timber—I agreed to it, and after I returned to the Danube, the ships arrived and applied to me for cargo—Van Cleef had then failed, and the forest was sequestered—no large timber came down, but five vessels loaded with staves arrived from the upper river—Mr. Edgley came down to Galats, and wrote me a letter, a copy of which I have, giving me instructions what to do—I loaded the <hi rend="italic">Memel</hi> with maize, because there was no timber, to the ac<lb></lb>count of Mr. Edgley, and I loaded the <hi rend="italic">Jamaica</hi> with staves, which is timber—I loaded the <hi rend="italic">Chard</hi> with the remainder of the staves, and filled her up with maize for the account of Mr. Edgley—I afterwards came to England, and when the ships arrived, I dealt with the cargoes under letters of instruction from Mr. Edgley—I have copies of the letters—he had agreed to take up the documents, that is, the bills of lading, on their arrival here—he did not do so, and I then obtained his consent to placing the goods in the hands of Churchill and Sims, for the sale of whom it might concern—the <hi rend="italic">Jamaica</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Memel</hi> arrived in this country about August or September, but the <hi rend="italic">Chard</hi> not till December—the gross of the dealings with the <hi rend="italic">Jamaica</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Memel</hi>, as far as my memory will serve me, was about 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the <hi rend="italic">Chard's</hi> account was about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the quality of the wood—a portion of the <hi rend="italic">Jamaica's</hi> cargo realized the largest price of any cargo of staves of that year—I have never been to the forest myself, but I know it well by renown and character—it is of enomous extent—in 1864, the inspector of Mr. Edgley's estate sent for me and asked me to take up the forest of Villa Ritza, and also to inquire into the forest of Maydempeck—we worked out the forest of Villa Ritza, and also reported upon Maydempeck, to Messrs. Young &amp; Butler—I have a copy of the report which I sent to Mr. Young at the time, and also a copy of the concession—the report does not contain what I saw, it is information obtained from Van</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you had to find persons who wanted discount on their bills? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was liable on the whole of the bills at the time the bank stopped, to the amount of 390,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not to the Leeds bank—so far as the Leeds Banking Company, I deny any liability to them, because I was merely their agent in the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you to get anything on these transactions, or was it from pure love and affection? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was to get paid for them—for that payment I was to facilitate Mr. Greenland in getting rid of his long dated paper, and handing to him in exchange short dated paper—I was to be paid for that—it was part of the arrangement that I was to put my own name on the bills—that was in order that Mr. Greenland should trace the transactions through his books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And to give a better appearance to the bills, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I don't think so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When were you first required to attend here as a witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first intimation I got was, I think, last October or November—I knew at that time that Greenland had gone abroad—I did not know that he was not coming back—I merely knew it from the public press—I received no subpoena and no notice to attend here when the case stood for trial in August or September—I am not subpoened now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it in the autumn of last year that you gave any information as to your transactions with the bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—I read Mr. Greenland's evidence at the Mansion House, when Mr. Edgley was com<lb></lb>mitted, and was very much astonished at the difference of that statement from what he had told me, and I went to my solicitor at Leeds—I met Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186806080081"></xptr>
               <p>Denton and told him, and he met Mr. Edgley, and told him what I had said, and he sought me out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it comes to this, that in consequent of what you read in the newspapers you made some communication or other which has brought you here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was in September, last year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. How many of these bills had you negociated in the way you have told us before you were aware of the fact that they were not drawn in Maydempeck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gathered, from seeing so many bills, and from the fact of a bill being accidently handed to me one day before it professed to be drawn; my suspicions were excited upon that—I made a communication to Mr. Greenland on the subject—I was never informed that they were drawn in London, that was my own inference, not from any communication with him—I never took another bill after that—that was the conclusion of the transaction as far as regards the Maydempeck bills.</p>

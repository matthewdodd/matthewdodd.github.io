                  </hi>. In the proceedings produced by the last witness the petition of the debtor—s signed on 2nd December, they have not put the date of the filing—his affidavit is filed on 3rd December, 1874—this is a petition under the liquidation clause—the first meeting of creditors was called for 22nd December, when this resolution was passed. (<hi rend="italic">This was to the effect that a composition of</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in the pound should be accepted, payable by instalments.</hi>) There is also a resolution appointing me trustee—I find accounts on the file previous to the meeting of 22nd December—they were presented to the meeting of creditors—this is the statement of affairs produced at the first meeting—this shows 1, 143<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. all unsecured and on the other side I find stock in trade estimated at 662<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and book debts 233<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., estimated to produce 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; cash in hand, nothing; bills of exchange, nothing; furniture, 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and fittings, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making the total assets 691<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there is an inventory showing the stock in trade 622<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the defendant was present at the meeting—that statement of affairs was laid before that meeting and the defendant produced the. details of the stock in trade of 622<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here arc eighteen gold pins charged-14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and fourteen gold chains 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., ten gold watches 74<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., thirty-one night glasses 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; each article has separate price—at the meeting of 22nd December several questions were put to him' by his creditors—eighteen or twenty creditors were present and I was acting for a few of them—the debtor's solicitor, Mr. Griffiths, of Cardiff, was the chairman—the defendant was asked about this stock, and at that time he stated that it was taken by him two or three days before, but he modified that afterwards—he was examined as to his book debts, he said that they were all bad and were only likely to realise 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but when his inventory was taken one by one, he said that they were likely perhaps to realise 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is-a list of those debts—it was produced on a separate sheet of paper and taken possession of by his solicitor—I have not got it and did not take a copy of it—I examined him upon it—I took</p>

               <p>each book debt, seventeen in number, and asked him when the debt was contracted—he gave various answers and I asked him how much it was likely to realise, and I made out that it was likely to realise 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he could not give the addresses of the debtors, but said that he might get it when their ships came in, he gave them with the odd shillings to each amount—he was asked if he had pawned any goods—he said that he had never been in a pawnbroker's shop in his life—he said that that was an inventory he had taken, assisted by his son, two days before this meeting—I attended the subsequent meeting on 4th June—I had not been to Cardiff in the interval—I had not received from the bank rupt any books then—Mr. Griffiths was the chairman—the defendant was there, and his only security was his son, a man of no means, who was abroad, and the meeting refused it, and resolved that the affairs should be liqui-dated by arrangement and not in bankruptcy—trustees were appointed and I telegraphed to Cardiff—no receiver had then been appointed—I went down to Cardiff on, I think, 23rd January, and went to the shop with the prisoner's solicitor—the prisoner was present, and there was a person in possession on our behalf—my attention had been called before that to a discrepancy between the actual goods and those represented in the inven<lb></lb>tory, and I put questions to the prisoner, which Mr. Griffiths, the clerk of my agent, took down—Sir. Clark and Mr. Corbett were also present—there is what was written down—it is signed by Petrali. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he never had fifteen gold chains in his shop since he had been in business; that about</hi> 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">of stock which was missing he had sold to sea captains between the time the stock was taken and the appointment of a trustee; that his daughter had sold some-silver watches, and what money she did not spend in house keeping she gave to him, and that he had had</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for his own expenses since the filing of the petition; that he did not have so many as fourteen gold chains, that some chains were purchased by a captain, he did not know who; that he had no money received for those goods to hand to the Trustee; that he had sold a binnacle and stand for</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and given the money to his daughter and could not hand the money to the Trustee as he wanted some of him, to live upon, that-some of the night glasses had been sold; that he did not know what had become of the barometers put down at</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in his inventory; that he had sold two dia<lb></lb>mond rings for</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">on approbation, nine months ago to a man who had gone to sea, and had never received them back or the money; and that he handed two pass-books, which were the only booh he had, to the Trustee</hi>) These (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two pass-books he so handed to me, and the only two—I have gone through them—the payings in are lump sums without exception, and as to the drawings out there is-only one cheque to himself, all the. rest are to customers—I find that between January, 1874, and 26th November, 1874, he paid into his banker's account 1, 953 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the payments out for the year are about: I the same amount, there is a very slight difference—on an average of four weeks that would be 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per week—giving the debtor credit for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all the other items the deficiency unexplained is 126<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—as trustee the total amount of stock at invoice prices which came into my hands was 372<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—deducting that from the inventory of actual stock made by the defendant and afterwards adding to it 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the difference between the actual stock and the stock represented was 281<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if I deduct 77<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for repairs, that leaves a net deficiency of 204<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I add profit on the sales of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent.—I give him credit for the whole of his 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expenses, for</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to Cardiff only once—I do not find that he owes any tradesman there a single penny—he said that he had been there several years and I-believe it to be true—I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> not inquire about his character—a creditor for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is one of his bail—the; largest creditor is Mr. Heath, of Crayford, Kent, for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner only attended in London once at my request, but he came up of his own accord twice to meetings of his creditors summoned by himself, that made three times—it is not true that he had bad health and was unable to take the stock himself—it is true that he had been suffering from ill health shortly before-his. affairs passed into liquidation, but you asked me whether he was ill at the time the inventory was taken—he told me that it was his inventory assisted by his son—he has two sons and one step daughter—I have seen those three and no more—Mr. Miller is the solicitor for the prosecution—the creditors cannot pay much of the expense, I believe the Treasury pay some of it—Miss Martin, the step-daughter, was not-examined at the meeting of creditors, she was examined by me at Cardiff—that was part of my business—that is her, sitting there—I ascertained that she had paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Griffiths on account of costs, out of this money—what she said was reduced to writing. (Me.

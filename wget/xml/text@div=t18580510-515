                  </hi>. I am shopman to Kent and Evans, of Bishops-gate Street. On the afternoon of 26th April, the prisoners came; Coker pointed to his waistcoat, and asked if we could match it—the assistant showed him the nearest to it; that was not near enough, and he asked for a green check angola—while the assistant turned to get it, I saw Deniord take a piece of goods from the counter, and slide it down by her side—Coker turned round, and stood between her and me, to cloak the operation—Deniordslid it under her cloak; she saw that I observed her—I went in front of her, and the assistant brought the piece of goods asked for—Coker looked at it, and said that it would not do—they were about leaving, and I told him I thought it was not his intention to buy, but to steal—he asked me what I meant, and I told him—Deniord got up, and the parcel of cloth fell from her side—I gave them both into custody.</p>

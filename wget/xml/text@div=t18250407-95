On the 11th of February the prisoner came to my house with a boy about fourteen years old, named Haley, and took my lodgings. Smith came home about five o'clock in the evening with Haley; Betts was then up stairs; they remained there till the 14th - and between five and six o'clock that evening, Smith and Haley came down stairs three times, and the last time Smith went out; it was not dark then - we have a door at the foot of the stairs, which is kept bolted, and I let them in and out; when I let Smith out, he said he was going to take some porter, and should not be long. I bolted the door immediately after him, and heard a noise overhead - Betts and Haley were then up stairs - I opened the door, and they stood there; Betts immediately struck me in the throat, and ran out at the street door, and Haley followed. I ran up stairs and found the first floor front-room broken open, and the new furniture gone off the bedstead - the window was open. I had bought the furniture three years ago - there were thirty-eight yards of it, it cost 2 s. 1 d. a yard. Betts was taken on the 18th - they came to me as man and wife.</p>

               <p>Did you lose any thing besides the handkerchief? - Yes, my ear-rings.</p>
               <p>Do you know who took them? - Yes, Steele; for I had them when she knocked me down, and when I got up they were gone.</p>
               <p>When did you find them again? - I found Goodchild about two hours after, at the Two Brewers, drinking with two men; I found Steele the next day in St. Giles's.</p>

               <p>Will you swear the duplicate the officer had of you, is the same duplicate she brought into your room? - I will not, but there was no other duplicate that I know of in the place; she was going a little way out of town and desired me to take care of it till her return.</p>
               <p>- CROSBY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; I took the prisoner Steele on the 17th of July, and found the duplicate in the room of the last witness as she has related. (Produces it.)</p>

               <p>This woman was in liquor, she was lying with her head on the table asleep; she had a soldier with her, and they begun dancing; I went out and came back again, and sat down, and in about half an hour's time, she said she had been robbed, and I saw no more of her.</p>
               <p>STEELE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went to the public-house to see for my husband; the prosecutrix was there with a soldier, and he begun to pull and haul her about the bosom; she came into the box where we were; I told her to go into the box for we did not want her company; she insisted upon our drinking with her, and said, if she had not money, she could pawn her handkerchief; she shew'd a farthing, and said that was all she had; that she had been robbed in the box where she was asleep; she took it to a pawnbroker's in Hyde-street, and they would not take it of her; I took it for her to Mrs. Davis's the corner of Middle-row, St. Giles's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120113"></xptr>and they would not take it; she said she would not go any further; however, she went across Leicester-fields, and asked me to go into this shop; the gentleman gave me half-a-crown; she desired me to keep the duplicate till next day for her.</p>
               <p>Court to the prosecutrix. This is a very serious charge against the prisoners; their lives must answer for it, and you are bound to tell the truth; were you in liquor that day? - No, I only drank part of 6 d. worth of gin and water amongst three of us.</p>
               <p>Was there a soldier at the Two Brewers? - I don't know, for I did not look.</p>
               <p>How came you to join them in the public-house? - Steele got up for me to come in and sit down, as there was no room.</p>
               <p>Did Steele accompany you to any of the houses to pawn your things? - No, no where.</p>
               <p>Now upon the oath you have taken, did you go with her to Leicester-fields to pawn that handkerchief? - No.</p>
               <p>She did not leave you at the door while she pawned it? - No, no such thing.</p>

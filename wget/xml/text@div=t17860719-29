             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker; I took the things in pawn from the prisoner; four of the articles have been a twelvemonth, and some of them eight or nine months; one is a sheet for two shillings, the 4th of July was a twelvemonth, the other a blanket, 6 d. the 11th of July, a sheet for eighteen pence the 19th of July, on the 31st of December a pillow for sixpence, the 2d of January a pillow for sixpence.</p>
               <p>What is the value of these things? - They really are not worth more than was lent on them, had they been worn any where so long as we have had them, there would not have been a thread of them left.</p>
               <p>You know nothing by whose direction the things were brought by the child. - We imagined by the mother of the child.</p>
               <p>Did the mother of the child at any time intimate that she knew any thing of them? - I only imagine she did, I do not know any thing of my own knowledge of a certainty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was innocent of the whole story, but when I missed them I challenged my wife, and she told me she would call the landlord, and he would put me into the watch-house; I am a gardener, and went to work every day.</p>
               <p>Brammel. The prisoner is a man that has lived in credit, and has been in very good circumstances.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Did you live in the same house with the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you tell whether this time twelvemonth, and in the month of December, and January, and February, the prisoner used to lay constantly in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you heard of these things being gone? - I do not know, above a fortnight.</p>

               <p>Court. A married woman cannot be guilty of felony when in the presence, or in company with her husband, because she is then supposed to be under his restraint; but he being absent, then it is her crime, not his; and though he does afterwards know of it, if she did not commit it under his concurrence and restraint, that will not affect him.</p>

               <p>I am a fruiterer in Covent-garden; I keep a stand, the same as Mr. Whitelegg; I lost fruit several times; I watched to see if I could detect any body; On the 21st of November I saw five men come down the market, they came to my stand, and tried my ropes; I came forward, and they went away; I then hid myself, and they came and tried the ropes again; they then went to Mr. Whitelegg's, and listed up the cloth and ropes, and took a bushel basket of apples; the prisoner was going away with them, a coach was coming by, and he did not see me till I got hold of him; I asked him what he was going to do with them? he said, what was that to me; I got him stopped by the people; I got him by the collar, and desired him to go with me; he got hold of the rails, and the people wanted me to let him go; he said he had only taken an apple; I got a constable, and he was taken to the watch-house, and the apples with him. (They were produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the basket that was taken by the prisoner? - A. Yes; I know it by the mark on the basket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner.Q. Did you see me with the basket? - A yes; you did another man had them carrying away, and your coat was over, it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. - He has got some witnesses, I believe, to his character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. - I have some witnesses.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his father (John King) and Joseph Salmon, who gave him a good character.</p>

On Wednesday evening, the 7th of February, I shut and locked the shop-door, and the cellar-flap was fastened by a chain—I left the shop—I came into the shop several times after; and, about a quarter to nine o'clock, when I came in again, I found the street door open—the lock was undone, and somebody had unfastened the door, which had a spring<lb></lb>lock—I suppose they had got in from the cellar-flap, as it was found open afterwards—I found the door open, and the pigeons were gone—my son keeps a bird-shop—those birds which were taken were opposite the door—they must have opened the street-door, and given them out to some<lb></lb>body.</p>

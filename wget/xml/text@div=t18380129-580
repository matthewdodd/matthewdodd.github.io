                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. John Lemont and Co. brewers, Pollard's-row, Bethnal-green. On the 27th of January, I placed a quantity of brass and iron on a piece of vacant ground near our premises, and put a full barrel of ale in front of them, to hide them—they were safe at eight o'clock in the evening, and next morning, at eight o'clock, I mis sed them—a barrel was missing from another part of the place, and six of the rails—they are cast-iron.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 8.) I was in Bethnal-green-road on Saturday afternoon, and saw the prisoner, in company with another man, driving a donkey-cart across Hare-street fields, with something very heavy in it—I followed them—the other walked away—I caught the pri<lb></lb>soner, and examined the cart—it contained six bars of iron wrapped up in a counterpane and a woman's shawl—he said they belonged to the other man who was gone away—I asked where he lived—he said he did not know, but he had employed him, and he was to take them to Shoreditch, but he could not tell to what house, as the man was to meet him in Shoreditch—I took him to the station-house—I made inquiry, and found that twenty bars had been stolen from the prosecutor the night before, and these six were identified—the donkey and cart were claimed by Ann Wiltshire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Wiltshire, and live in Abbey-place, Essex-street, Bethnal-green-road. On Saturday last the prisoner came to my house, and asked me if my husband was at home—I said yes; but he was ill and asleep—I asked what he wanted—he said, "I want the cart, if you please"—I said, "The boy has just taken the harness off the donkey, you can go and take it"—he put the harness on the donkey—a man came to him, and they went away in the cart—the donkey belonged to the prisoner himself, and the cart to my husband—he lends my husband the donkey, and my husband occasionally lends the prisoner the cart—we have kept it for him for three or four months, as he had nothing to do for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he ever let it on hire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he only has our cart to fetch things from market—he sells things in the street, and has the cart to bring things from market in—we do not let it out—it was a very small spring truck, but my husband had shafts put to it.</p>

               <p>bought nothing, but came out, and in Church-street met John Greenwood—he asked if I had any thing to do—I said not—he said, "Will you do a job, to move a few things for me, I will give you a shilling?"—I said, "Where is it to go?"—he said, "Into Shoreditch: can you go now?"—I went with him to Mr. Wiltshire's house and got the donkey and cart—Greenwood went with me to Hare-street-fields—he went in at the gate and brought out two iron bars wrapped in a shawl—he said it was only two bits of iron—he brought out the rest and said, "Come on"—when I had got about 200 yards this gentleman stopped me, and asked what I had got—I said, "I believe iron"—he said, "I want you to accompany me to the station-house, and give a description of the person who has left you"—I said, "Very well," and went—the Inspector sent the donkey to the green-yard, and I was to go before the Magistrate—I was remanded, and came up again last Wednesday—the iron was wrapped up in different things.</p>

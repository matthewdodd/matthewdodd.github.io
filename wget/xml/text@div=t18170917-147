            . I am driver of the Taunton Stage. I lodge with Mrs. Coleman, as I was coming to town, I took the prisoner up at the end of Chiswick-lane - I never saw her before-when we arrived at the Castle and Falcon she asked me what she had to pay, I told her 1s., she said she was poor, I gave her the 1s., back - She called for a glass of gin and water of which I drank, I went up stairs and drank with some friends - I came down in about twenty minutes and found her still in the tap-room - I had some tea with her - I recollected having to meet a party at Sadler's Wells, and told her of it - She expressed a wish to go, but said she had no money, but she had got friends and would pay me again if I would pay for her - I took her to my lodgings where she left her bundle, and then to Sadler's Wells - I did not meet the party I expected, and took her back to my lodgings. After the robbery, I went in pursuit of her on the Manchester road, as she had said she expected some money from Manchester; I was in the Leeds coach, and when we got to Barnet the prisoner stopped the coach that I was in, to take her to St. Alban's; she came out of the Woolpack Inn where we stopped - I seized her and sent for a constable, before he came she fell on her knees, and said she hoped I would not prosecute her; I told her I certainly should, for her ingratitude to Mrs. Coleman - I heard her throw something in the fire-place, and found five 1l. notes there rolled up together-when the constable came, the landlord found three 3s. pieces wrapped up in a 1l., note, in the fire-place; she had a basket with her tied up in a silk handkerchief-the first thing I found in it were three silk handkerchiefs of mine, and Mrs. Coleman's spencer. I can swear to one of the notes, as I had it a long time, and paid it to Mrs. Coleman about a fortnight before. I gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When I returned from Sadler's Wells, I asked Mrs. Coleman to let her stay for that night only - We all supped together; I did not undertake to meet her at Finchley - I did not search her basket, it was the constable. She did not leave her bundle in my room.</p>

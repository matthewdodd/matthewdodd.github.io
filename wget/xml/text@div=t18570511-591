                  </hi>. On 28th April the prisoner came to me, and produced this letter—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "No. 21, Southampton Street, Bloomsbury. To Messrs. Smale. Dear Sirs,—You will greatly accommodate me by sending per bearer the enclosed order. I shall be calling on you in the course of the week to make a selection, when I will settle my account with you. Yours respectfully, J. W. Webb,—16 plate to pattern, 1 gilt spring, 3 1/4 in. wheels, 1 1/2 in. ditto thick, and 1 bag of plaister")—I objected to give him the goods, because it is usual to pay for one order under the other, and the order of 9th April had not been paid for—I told him so, and he said that Mr. Webb had sent no money, but would call—I requested him to wait while I con<lb></lb>sulted my brother, upon which he made for the door, opened it, and went out—he ran down the street, and was brought back by one of our men, and was given into custody; he said nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He asked me if Mr. Webb sent any money; I said, "No;" I perceived that there was something wrong, and went to see Mr. Webb, who promised to meet me at the place appointed, but they followed me, and brought me back.</p>

                  </hi>. This paper is not in my writing, nor did I authorise anybody to write it—I did not send anybody to Messrs. Smale for these things—I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Have you got any assistants in your establishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at present—a person must be a dentist to write this order—I have had two persons in my establishment named Webb, they were no relations of mine; one was a porter, and one was an assistant—it turned out afterwards that they were brothers, but I did not know it—one was George Webb, and the other William Charles Webb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did they leave you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should imagine it is about twelve months ago—I gave the assistant a recommendation to a person at Birmingham, as he behaved very well, and was very honest, as far as I knew—I know that he went there—I do not know what became of the porter; the assistant left before him—the porter could write, he was a well educated man—I could not swear to his writing—I cannot say whether this note is his writing; I have no idea whose it is at all—I have heard of both of them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185705110039"></xptr>
               <p>since they left, the assistant sent to thank me for the recommendation, and the porter called on me perhaps six months ago, and said that he was very badly off; I gave him a trifle, and have not heard of him since.</p>

I took the prisoner at Mr. Smale's, and heard the charge stated to him—he said nothing—he gave his address at a common lodging house in George Street, Bloomsbury, and he had lodged there for about a week—I searched him, and found on him this pocket book, knife, and pencil.</p>

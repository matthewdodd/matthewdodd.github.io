On Thursday, 16th Dec, the prisoner came into the entry room, and said, "Is there anything for Southgate?"—I said there was, and went and fetched three pieces of print—the prisoner had a sheet, or bag, which he opened, put the prints in it, put it across his shoulder, and walked off—from something that occurred to me I followed him into the court, and said, "Are you from Mr. Southgate's?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Return with me;" and at that moment Mitchell came up—I did not like his looks; he said he was an inspector of police, and I said then he could return with me, and when we got back the people at our house knew him to be the inspector—I gave the prisoner into custody—when I gave him the goods I did not believe he came from Mr. Southgate's; I believed he was getting them under false pretences—I parted with them on the representation that he came from Southgate's</p>

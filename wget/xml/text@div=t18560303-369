I am a widow, and live in Hare-street, Westminster On Sunday week, at half past 11 o'clock, I was coming along Victoria-street—I did not see the prisoner till he came up to me, and placed his arm across my throat—he took five duplicates, which were in a porte<lb></lb>mounaie and two pocket handkerchiefs out of my pocket, and ran away—I called out, "Police!" as soon as I oould get my breath—the two handkerchiefs produced were found on him—they are mine.</p>

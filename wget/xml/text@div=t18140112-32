               <p>Q. Did you join with Mr. Mansfield in purchasing some sheep - A. Yes, these sheep were placed by me in a field near Highgate. I had only one black sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night between the 6th and 7th of December, did you lose that sheep - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the field, and had information of the sheep that was lost, did you see any part of it - A. In a few minutes after I went down two men brought the fore part of the sheep; they said they had detected the man, and had taken him to the watchhouse. I then knew the parts of the sheep to be mine, because it is a remarkable sheep.</p>

               <p>COURT. You said the sheep was yours and Mansfield's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there in the whole - A. There were nineteen. I knew the sheep by the marks, and by the head. The patrol took that part of the sheep down to where the other part was; that part was compared with the other part, it appeared to be the same sheep; the parts corresponded; the hind quarters corresponded with the fore quarters left on the skin. He had cut the sheep in two, and skinned the hind quarters, and left the fore quarters on the skin. They were all joined so as to constitute the entire whole sheep.</p>

            . I am a watchman belonging to Islington. On the morning of the 7th of December, I saw the prisoner; I walked with him about an hundred yards; I left him about a minute to inform another watchman. I afterwards run up the path, and catched hold of him. It was between five and six in the morning when I stopped him; it was quite<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120016"></xptr>dark when I stopped him with this bundle in his possession. The parcel contained the hind quarters of a sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him - A. I said, you have got something that does not belong to you; he said he had got some mutton that his brother had given him; he had killed a sheep. I felt the mutton; it was quite warm. I then secured him, and took him to the watchhouse. I and the constable of the night searched him; we found a knife upon him; his pockets were filled with horse hair and cow hair</p>
               <p>Q. Was that knife an instrument fit to kill sheep - A. Yes, I believe it had killed the sheep; there was some blood upon it. At Worship-street the parts of the sheep were joined together; they matched.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say you found a parcel upon him with a hind part of a sheep in it - A. Yes; it was all tied up in one bundle. The pluck was of oneside, the knife and the bill hook were all in one bundle, and there was a piece of black wool on the mutton.</p>

            . I am patrol of Islington. I saw the prisoner in the watchhouse, and the hind parts of a sheep laying on the table. I saw the horse hair taken from him. I went with my brother patrol to about Highbury-barn; I knew the prisoner must have come that way by the way where he was taken. When we got to Mr. Hopkinson's farm we met a person belonging to it, the bailiff; we asked him whether there was any sheep on or about that part. We made search there; we found the sheep wild there, in two meadows; there was one sheep running about; we went to one part of the field; we found a dissected skin and entrails put into the ditch, covered over with roots of grass. We took it with us to Mr. Hopkinson. When we found the skin we did not find the fore part of the mutton. This was the dissected skin, belonging to the hind part. We returned again to the field; in the centre of that field there had been a pond, under a knapsack laid the head, and a little distance from the head laid the bladder and gall, and a little distance was some blood, as if the sheep had been killed there. We went to another part of the field; we found the fore part of the sheep with the skin on. We then went to Mr. Hopkinson, and took the whole together. I put the parts together. I am a butcher. I had not a shadow of a doubt when they were compared together but what they belonged to the carcase of a sheep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer employed by the Mint authorities—on 13th October, in consequence of information, I went to Canterbury Place, Highbury Vale, with other officers, about 7 o'clock in the morning—the street-door was forced by my directions—we proceeded to the first floor front room—that door was also forced—I found both prisoners in bed—I addressed the male prisoner as Scarborough—I told him my name was Brannan—I said to the female "What shall I call you?"—she said "Scar<lb></lb>borough or McLaren"—I said "I came here by the direction of the Soli<lb></lb>citor to the Treasury; I have a search warrant and will read it to you if you think proper"—he said "Never mind, Mr. Brannan, you will find all you want in that room," pointing to where we found the things—we forced that open—the room was fitted as a factory, nothing there but implements for coining to a very large extent, and very complete—I produce those things—amongst a number of moulds we found was one treble mould for sixpences—we also found the pattern piece from which the impression was made on the mantel-shelf—we found numerous wire ladders which had been dipped in solution—they are used while the counterfeit coin is undergoing the process of colouring and coating—there are treble moulds for making shillings, double moulds for making florins, two double moulds for half-crowns, and one for florins, files, galvanic batteries, plates, granulated metal, antimony, several ladles with white metal in them, and other instruments</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187110230012"></xptr>
               <p>for coating—there were some porous pots, and a quantity of copper wire which had been employed in solution, and a quantity of implements for colouring, and coating, and making plaster of Paris—nineteen good pieces of money were handed to me by Inspector Rutt, which have all been used a pattern pieces—on the way to the station the male prisoner said "I suppose it will go hard with me, they will give me a ride for this I hope you will be dead when I come back, and a piece of lead under your back"—when at the station the whole of the counterfeit coin, and the good money was placed on the table, and the female prisoner said "Mr. Brannan, I will save you all the trouble, I will pick out the pattern-pieces that we used; I don't intend to give you any unnecessary trouble"—132 farthings were found at the prisoner's place—in a purse which was taken out of the female prisoner's dress pocket we found two counterfeit sixpences, which correspond in date with the pattern-piece—the farthings are filed down, and after a process of colouring and coating they are circulated as sixpences.</p>

We took two sledge hammers with us—the key which opened the back room door was found by Inspector Bryant in the prisoner's trowsers pocket, and he said it would open the door—I did not apply that key to the front door—I could not swear that there was a key in the bedroom door—the prisoners were in bed—the male prisoner did not go to the station quietly; I don't know that I ever had to deal with a more violent man—I did not break open the back door with a sledge ham<lb></lb>mer—Inspector Butt broke it open with his shoulder—the prisoner did not say he had a lodger named Harrison—I did not hear anything said about a lodger till the remand at the Police Court, and no name was given then.</p>

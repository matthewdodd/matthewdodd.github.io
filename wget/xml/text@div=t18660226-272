                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, in the employ of Solomon and Co., of Houndsditch—on 2d February, I had been to Deptford to see a relation who was ill—I returned to town by train, and walked over London<lb></lb>bridge to Gracechurch-street—I entered Talbot-court, and was followed by three men—one of them put his arm round my throat, and kept my head back while two others rifled my trousers' pockets—I was then on the ground, and they held me there till I became almost senseless—they found I had no money in my trousers' pockets, and threw me violently on the ground—I fell on my hat—the prisoner is one of them, but not the man who put his arm round my neck—he rifled my pockets, and assisted in throwing me on the ground—one of my pockets was torn completely out and the other is torn, but I had nothing there—I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my waistcoat-pocket, which I kept all right—they left me on the ground and went towards Gracechurch-street—I called "Police!" and followed them—they had not left the court—the policeman met them half way, and stopped them a very short distance off—I gave them in charge—I did not lay hold of them, as I was bleeding from my nose, and my face was saturated with blood—the constable took the prisoner; the other two got away—I did not see Mrs. Hodgson there, as I was in such a state of agitation and suffering.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Hodgson, a bootmaker, of Swan-place, Blackman-street, Borough—on Tuesday night, I was with an old lady of seventy-three and another friend, coming over London<lb></lb>bridge, and saw the prisoner and two others following me from the other side of the water—the prisoner came in front of me by the Queen's insurance office, Gracechurch-street, and clapped his hands, but finding his companions were not behind us, he left and joined them at Talbot-court—I distinctly heard a cry of "Police!" and saw the prisoner put up his hand and knock the prosecutor into the middle of the road, where he remained all the way up Gracechurch-street—he did not quite knock him down, but he reeled into the middle of the road—Morris said, "I charge these men with assaulting me"—each of the others said, "No, sir, not me, sir, for I have just come over the water," which I know they had—the others escaped, and I saw the prisoner taken—I had scarcely lost sight of him, as there was scarcely another man in the street—I did not go to the station, as I had to catch the last train to Blackwall; but I saw the case in the paper on Monday, and thought it my duty to come forward—when I saw the prosecutor struck, it was after what I saw at the end of Talbot-court—I heard the cry of "Police," and we turned and met the three men together, coming from Talbot-court—there was only us in the street at the time.</p>

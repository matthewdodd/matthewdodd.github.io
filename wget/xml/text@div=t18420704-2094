                  </hi>. I live with my father, Timothy Murray, S. No. 17, George-street, St. Giles's. On the 25th of June, about half-past ten o'clock in the evening, I was standing in Buckeridge-street—the prisoner asked where I was going—I told him I was going to the pawnbroker's for my mother—I had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3. in my hand, and a duplicate—he asked me what I had in my hand—I did not tell him—he saw my hand shut, laid hold of it, and forced the money out of my left hand—the halfpence dropped, and he ran up the street with the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I staid to pick up the halfpence and duplicate, and ran after him—I afterwards saw him in Mr. Riley's public-house, in Bainbridge-street—I went to the door—I waited from half-past ten to half-past eleven, and sent a young woman in to ask the prisoner for the money—he afterwards came out—I asked him for the money, and began to cry—he said nothing, but ran away—I knew his person by seeing him about—I have not spoken to him above three or four times—I went to the station, and the inspector sent the sergeant round to different public-houses—I afterwards saw him on the 27th, in Maynard-street—I went and gave fresh information, and he was taken—I am quite sure be took the money out of my hand—it was my father's.</p>

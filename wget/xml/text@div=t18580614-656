                  </hi>. I live at the Castle, at Harrow, kept by Mrs. Smith. On 28th May, I saw the prisoners there, and there was a man named Delaney in the tap room; they had something to drink; I do not know who paid for it, but Delaney brought me the money to the bar—Allum paid me with coppers for some ginger beer, which I took to him—they afterwards came to the bar, and asked for a half quartern more gin; I served it, and Watkins paid for it with 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers, before any other money was offered, but there was a second order—Delaney and Watkins drank it; Allum was stand<lb></lb>ing in the passage when it was served—Watkins ordered another half quartern, and Delaney paid for it with a counterfeit shilling—Allum was there, either in the passage or not far off; he may have been as far away as that desk—I told Delaney the shilling was bad; he said, "Well, I was not aware it was bad; you know that well, Mr. Hutchins, or else I should not have given it to you"—I knew him as a carrier coming with the carts; he said, "Give it to me back"—I said, "No, or you might try it on with somebody else"—Watkins said, "Do not make a fuss about; I will pay for it," and he paid me 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I marked it with my knife, put it on the shelf, and gave it to Mrs. Smith afterwards, who gave it to the constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Harrow. I know the prisoners—on 28th May, I went with them from the Crown public house to the Castle—I have known Watkins several years—he has lived in the neighbourhood—his real name is John Allum—he asked me to get a pot of beer, and gave me some coppers to pay for it—Allum afterwards gave me a shilling to pay for half a quartern of gin—I gave it to Mr. Hutchins, who said that it was bad, and put it on the shelf—Watkins was there at the time.</p>

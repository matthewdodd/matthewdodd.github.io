                  </hi>. I am a manufacturing chemist, at 9, Old Montague Street, Whitechapel—on Saturday, 24th April, about 8.15, I was going along Fenchurch Street—I had a gold watch and guard on—as I was crossing Billiter Street, I saw the prisoner standing there—he rushed at me, and caught hold of my chain—it broke into four or five different pieces, and he ran off with part of it—there were two men at the corner of the street, and when I chased the prisoner, they tried to stop me—a gentleman stopped the prisoner at the top of Billiter Square—I did not lose tight of him only as he turned the corner—I am sure he is the man—the pieces of my chain were found afterwards—I was close behind him when he turned the corner, and I saw the same person running when I turned it.</p>

About 8.30, on this Saturday, I was in Lime Street Square—I went to Billiter Street and found the prisoner, held by someone—the prosecutor charged him with stealing his chain—he said he was innocent, but did not wish to give his address, on account of the disgrace on his parents.</p>

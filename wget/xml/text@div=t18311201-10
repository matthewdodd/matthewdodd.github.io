The prisoner came into our shop on Friday evening, the 4th of November, about seven o'clock, and asked for sufficient shoe-ribbon for a pair of shoes; I cut him three-quarters of a yard, which came to 1 1/2d. - he gave me a good half-crown - I gave him 2s. 4 1/2d., which I got from Mr. Peascod, our cashier; I observed the shillings which I gave him - they were two good shillings, I am confident, and they were a different stamp to what he afterwards produced; he took the 2s. 4 1/2d. up, and turned from the counter with the change in his hand - his back was then towards me; he immediately turned again, threw a shilling on the counter, and said, "You have given me a bad shilling;" I observed that shilling, and it was bad - the two I had given him had the coat of arms on them, and the one he produced had the lion and crown, I am positive of that; I took the shilling which he threw down, and told him it was a bad one, and I did not believe I had given it to him, but I took it to Peascod, and got him to change it - he said nothing in the prisoner's hearing; I gave the prisoner an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010013"></xptr>other shilling - I said nothing to him; he then left the shop - I followed him immediately, by direction of Peascod, and overtook him six or eight doors from the shop, in company with another man - I was within two yards of him; I followed them fifty or a hundred yards - both went down Regent-street in company together; he had joined the other man as soon as I got out, near our door - he crossed over the road alone, leaving the other man on the opposite side; he went into Mr. Waugh's, a chemist and druggist- I do not know what became of the other man; I stepped up to Mr. Waugh's window, and saw him served with something - he threw a half-crown down on the counter, which the young man took, and gave him change; he took up the change, then turned from the counter, and immediately turned back again to the young man, and threw down a shilling; I stepped into the shop at that moment, and asked the young man, in his hearing, if that was a bad shilling he had returned him - he said it was; I said he had served me in the like manner a few minutes before - the prisoner said he had never seen me, nor been in our shop; I have not a doubt of his person - the young man detained him; I got a Policeman, who apprehended him: the bad shilling which he returned to me I saw laid on one corner of the desk by Peascod - I left it there, and found it laying there when I came back; I had left Peascod there, and found him there when I returned - he marked the shilling in my presence, and I delivered it to the Policeman; I went with him to Waugh's - the prisoner was waiting there in the custody of another Policeman: the shilling the prisoner gave me was compared with the one he had passed at Waugh's, in the prisoner's presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Jamaica-place, Commercial-road. On Saturday, the 20th of July, I was coming along Vinegar-lane, Commercial-road—the prisoner accosted me between twelve and one o'clock, and asked me to come into the house where she was, and if not to give her something to drink—I pulled out my puree, which had silver at one end and four sovereigns at the other—I gave her two sixpences out of my purse, and she immediately snatched my purse from me like an arrow out of a bow, and went off with it into the house—I went in after her, and said I was robbed—I saw nobody, but in a minute or two a woman came and said, "She does not live here, but she comes here sometimes"—she was afterwards taken up—I have no doubt the prisoner is the person—I have seen her at the door as I have passed by before—I pass there several times to the London Docks—I was never inside the house before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the Saturday in question, I received information, and took the prisoner between four and five o'clock that afternoon in High-street, Shadwell—I had been to the house before, but could not find her—I know she resorts to Vinegar-lane—I told her it was for robbing an old gentleman in Vinegar-lane, at the house of Sally Jones, of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some silver—she said, "I declare I have not been in</p>

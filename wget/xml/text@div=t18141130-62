               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at your house on the 13th of November - A. He was. I cannot say exactly the time he came; a little after eleven o'clock I received the injury.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been there - A. I understood by my wife, he had been there better than two hours. I had seen him better than an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. A little after eleven what happened - A. I make it a rule to clear my house at eleven o'clock; and the company had all gone, except four persons, and my two friends, I had got in my bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other three persons in company with the prisoner - A. They had been prior to the time that this happened. The prisoner placed himself against the bar at my house; and used very abusive language. Before he used that language, I had desired him to go, the other three requested to have another glass, it was past the hour I said, I would serve them no more; the lights I had taken out of, the tap room. They stood at the tap room door to have another glass; and by the request of my wife, I let them have another glass. The prisoner requested to have some, he said he had no money except three farthings; but he would be damned if he would not have it. I told him he should not, nor any one else should have more; and if he would not go out, and the others I must be under the necessity of putting them out" why you b - r, said the prisoner</p>
               <p>"which way will you do it" I had no anger on my part; he is but a little man. I took him up in my arms from the place where he stood, I carried him about three yards, immediately I found I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300045"></xptr>found I was wounded in my side, I called out I am stabbed; and secured his arms directly, my neighbour had his eye upon him the whole time, he is here; he jumped to my assistance, he pulled the prisoner up to the bar. I said examine his hand; he has got something in his hand, he extended his arms from his body; we found nothing in his hand, and the party that was there, said, it was only the prick, of a pin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any knife afterwards - A. My neighbour did. I said it is some sharp instrument; I am afraid it is broken in me; my wife sent immediately to the watchhouse the constable of the night, sent several watchman down they came and secured him, we all looked on the floor where he stood I saw Mr. Hodge pick up the knife within a foot of where I was stabbed; he was taken to the watch-house the constable was bnt a young officer, he sent a watchman down for me to come to the watch-house I hesitated about going and while I was at the watchhouse the prisoners party nearly rescued him.</p>
               <p>Q, Have you given the whole account of every thing that happened, before you received the wound - A. Yes; the constable has got the knife; he has had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. You carried him three or four yards - A. Yes; to put him out, that was towards the door I carried him. I carried him that way for the purpose of putting him out of the house and for no other purpose,</p>
               <p>Q. Had he frequented your house before - A. I have seen him several times before.</p>

             HODGE. I was at this public-house on this night. I went in about nine o'clock, I did not see the prisoner then, I saw the prisoner some time afterwards, in the passage; Mr Jones said it was a rule to clear his house at eleven o'clock; there were three more in company they wanted some rum and water. Mrs. Jones said she would have no more drawed for any body. They made some disturbance Mr. Jones said to his wife, I will let them have another glass, if they will go quietly. They went out into the passage; the prisoner stood with his back against the bar, opposite of the street door; I was in the bar myself. Mr. Jones stood in the passage, he said to the others come now you have had your glass it is time for your departing, it is a late hour, I will have my doors fast. The prisoner used foul language and said he would not go, until it suited himself. Mr. Jones said if he did not go qusetly, he should be under the necessity of putting him out. He abused Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones said, it is of no use I will have my doors shut. Mr. Jones laid hold of him round the body, to carry him out; and when Jones got by the door he called to me that he was stabbed. I went to his assistance, and laid hold of the prisoner, and drew him up to the bar door, Mr. Jones opened his waistcoat; he bled a great-deal. He said he did not touch him, there is something broken in it. The other men said it was only the scratch of a pin. I picked ue the knife at the very spot where it was done. The knife was partly open, there was no blood upon it when I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on what part of Jones's body was it where he was struck - A. On the left side; just by the bottom rib bone.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the surgeon here - A. No his wound was dressed by a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The knife hit against the rib otherwise it might have been mortal.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was called to take the man into custody that stabbed Mr. Jones. I went with some watchman. I searched him, and found no knife.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor How long did you continue ill with that wound - A. I did not feel any great effect of it until Wednesday morning. A surgeon did not see it until this happened on Sunday night eleven o'clock, a surgeon saw it on Monday Dr. Smith attended me he told me it was very fortunate that it hit upon the rib no harm would come of it. If it had not hit there it might have been fatal.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you get well - A. The next morning I felt a very little uneasier; except I breathed hard if any body came near me, I was in fear from it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was an uproar in the house, when I went into it. Mr. Jones was running out of the bar with his chopper, and striking a man on the head. His head was all of a gore of blood. I sat drinking in the house until eleven o'clock and then I was more drunk, he charged me with stabbing him. There were seven or eight followed me into the watchhouse, and took my part.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hodge. Did the prisoner appear to be in liquor - A. No; he had not had but one pint of porter in the house.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called two witnesses; who gave him the character of a quiet humane man.</p>

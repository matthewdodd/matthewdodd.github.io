               <p>Eddison. Yes. A large Spoon and a Tea Spoon, the 27th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these Things?</p>
               <p>Eddison. In a little Buffet.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Eddison . In Chiswell-Street .</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss them?</p>
               <p>Eddison. The Maid miss'd them presently after the Prisoner was gone out of the House.</p>

               <p>Eddison. Yes, my Lord, she was with me 14 Years ago, she nurs'd me; so she came to see me.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time was it?</p>
               <p>Eddison. About Two or Three o'Clock in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay?</p>
               <p>Eddison . About an Hour and Half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any Pursuit after her?</p>
               <p>Eddison. She said she lived down at Tower-Hill; I went down that Way, and going about the Street I enquired of Black-shoe Folks, and the like, and I heard of her; at last I came up Wellclose-Square and I saw her standing in Rosemary-Lane the next Day; I ask'd her whether she was not at my House yesterday Afternoon, she said yes; I desir'd her to go home with me; which she accordingly did; then I ask'd the Maid if that was not the Person, and the Maid said yes; so I charg'd her with the Robbery, and she told me she had not got them ; I pleaded with her hard to tell me where the Spoons were ; she would not tell me any Thing about them, so I charg'd the Constable with her. After we got her before the Justice she confess'd it, she said she was turn'd out of her Lodgings, that she had not a Farthing in the World to help herself; that she had sold the great Spoon, and the little one she threw into the Vault .</p>
               <p>Q. What was it worth ?</p>
               <p>Eddison. They were both valued at 5 s. She told me she had pawn'd it in Ratcliffe Highway , so on the Friday I went to every Silversmith and Pawnbroker I could find, and I happen'd to go to this Gentlewoman's House, Mrs. Wiles; I ask'd if there was not a Spoon there that

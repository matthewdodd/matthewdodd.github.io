                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Thomas Summerlin, a butcher, who lives in Goodge-street; the prisoner was in his service. On the 15th of July, a piece of salt beef was missed—this is it—I was called from another shop to accompany the policeman to High-street, on suspicion of the prisoner stealing a piece of beef which had been found among his clothes—the prisoner said it was the first time, and he hoped we would look over it.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the beef and the suet in the bag—I heard the prisoner say he hoped his mistress would look over it this time, as it was the first time, and he hoped she would consider his wife and family.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

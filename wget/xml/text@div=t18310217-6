               <p>JOHN JONES. I live in Church-lane, Whitechapel, but on the 9th of January I lived in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. I went out at eight o'clock that evening with my wife, leaving nobody in the house - I locked both the doors, and made the house safe; I returned at half-past' eight, and found the things all scattered about the room - when I put the key in, the door flew open; it was open - on going into the house I saw the prisoner running along the passage; I came out, shut the door, and held the knocker in my hand till I got assistance - I went in again, and heard the back door unbolted; he ran out, I after him, and caught him in the yard - he said it was all up with him; I had said nothing to him then - the people said they had caught him; he said Yes, it was all up with him - I examined, and found a drawer open in the front room; it had been shut when I left, but was not locked - there had been several articles of wearing-apparel in that drawer; the prisoner said he had taken the key out, but none of the things were taken out of that drawer, nor were they pulled about - in the back room a basket was drawn out from under the bed, the dirty linen taken out of it, and scattered about the floor - a box was turned out in the back room; it had been left unlocked, but with the lid down - I found it with the lid up and empty, and the things on the floor - the lease of my house, a policy of insurance, and a blue cloth pelisse were on a chair; they had been in the box - I cannot say whether the pelisse was on the chair or the floor; I saw the Policeman search the prisoner - he gave the Policeman eight keys, which they called skeleton - keys, in his presence.</p>

            . I live in Nelson-place, Bethnal-green. In consequence of the alarm I went to the house, and found the prosecutor taking the prisoner into the parlour - I went up to him, and asked him what he had come there for; he said for what he could get - I took the light off the table, went into the back room, and found the basket empty on the floor; I was present when the Policeman searched the prisoner and found a phosphorus-box, matches, eight skeleton-keys, and a wax taper on him.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I received the prisoner in charge, and found on him eight skeleton-keys, a phosphorus-box, matches, and a wax taper - when I was searching him I felt the keys; he said he would give them to me, and did so - as I was going to take him to the station he said it was all up with him, he had done it, and wanted me to go to his father's; I found one of the keys opened the outer door, and another the parlour door - the prosecutor gave me a door key and screw-driver.</p>

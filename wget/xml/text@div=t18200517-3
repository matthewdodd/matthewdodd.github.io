On the 12th of May, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, in company with another man - it was dusk; I was attending to a lady. My apprentice, Haynes, came up to me, and said the prisoner had taken a piece of sarsnet; I looked at them, and saw a piece of the sarsnet hanging out of the prisoner's coat. I had laid it on the counter myself not two minutes before. He had it inside his great coat. I saw a little bit of it hanging out under his great coat, which was on his arm - I laid hold of him, he laid it down, and the other ran out of the shop directly. The prisoner said he wanted to go after his brother, and made towards the door; I pulled him back, and sent for a constable, who took him to Bow-street. The sarsnet measured upwards of thirty yards, and is worth 6 l. - it cost me 5 s. a yard. His great coat was on his arm, he was not wearing it.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor. On the 12th of May the prisoner came to the shop with another person; the other said,</p>
               <p>"I want half a yard of green persian, the same as I had before" - they had both been in the shop before - I do not know what they bought. I did not serve them, but I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get him the persian - A. Yes, and served him. He then asked for some black ribbon, and I cut him a yard - he also bought a bootlace, and gave me the money. I then saw the prisoner take the sarsnet off the counter - it was about ten yards from me; he took it as privately as he could, and was watching Mr. Balaam at the time. I immediately went up to Mr. Balaam, called him into the back room before I gave the other man the change, and told him what I had seen. He directly went round the counter, and seized the prisoner, upon which the other immediately walked out without the change. The things, I believe, came to 6 d., and he paid me 6 d., therefore I had no change to give him. He had nothing to detain him in the shop, and took away what he had bought.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you away from them when you went to speak to your master - A. About a minute - there was time enough for them to go away if they thought fit. When my master seized him he wanted to go after his brother. He immediately put the sarsnet down on the counter, and said,</p>
               <p>"Is not this the persian you wanted?" - this was before he wanted to go after his brother; the sarsnet was near Mr. Balaam before the prisoner took it.</p>

During that time I have not been able to work, in consequence of a rupture produced by over-exertion. On the day mentioned, I had been to Paddington, and had just left the stage, when I, by accident, met the person who was in company with me. I had very little previous acquaintance with him, merely knowing him by the name of Wilson, a boot-closer. He said he was going to purchase a piece of green silk to make a shade for his eyes. I accompanied him, and while he was settling for what he had purchased, I took from the counter a piece of silk for the purpose of looking at the shade of it. I turned towards the light, and having a great coat on my arm I laid the silk upon it - having satisfied myself I returned it to the place from whence I took it. In a moment after, the person who served in the shop, came round the counter, seized me, and said I had robbed him. The person who was with me, fearing, perhaps, that I had actually committed a theft, left the shop.</p>

             re-examined. I am sure he said he wanted to go after his brother. He laid the silk on the counter as Mr. Balaam was going to seize him, and before he seized him. Mr. Balaam was in the act of seizing him when he said,</p>
               <p>"This is the persian you want."</p>
               <p>Q. What had Mr. Balaam done to make him think he was going to seize him - A. I had called Mr. Balaam into the back room, upon which he rose up the flap of the counter, and went straight up to him.</p>
               <p>MR. BALAAM re-examined. I am sure he said he wanted to go after his brother - I cannot say whether he produced the silk before I seized him, but I saw him lay it down - it was under his coat, apparently concealed. I only saw a very small piece hanging out. I should not think he had it in his possession more than one or two minutes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was there anything to prevent him from running away - A. Nothing that I know of, but to the best of my recollection the apprentice had to give him 3 d. change, for he had 3 d. in his hand when he came to me, but in the confusion he could not state that. There were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170005"></xptr>five or six yards of the sarsnet unrolled at the time it was on the counter.</p>

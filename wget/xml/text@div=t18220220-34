               <p>BENJAMIN BOND. On the 21st of January, I was walking home to dinner, about half-past one o'clock. I am lame. I was in <placeName id="t18220220-34-crimeloc183">Gower's-walk, Whitechapel</placeName>

I do not think he was walking when I first saw him; I did not suspect him, and thought he might stop the other, but he did not; but when the man that robbed me came up to the prisoner, there were three of them, and all ran off together. I rather trembled, and was almost overcome; I sat down in a house for a few minutes - he was apprehended the same evening.</p>

            . On the 21st of January, I saw the prisoner standing by our door, in Gower's-walk; I noticed him, and saw another lad come up to him, he was about fourteen years old: he said to the prisoner as he turned the corner</p>
               <p>"Now." I looked the other way, and saw another lad, of the same size, standing by the corner, and immediately, as Mr. Bond turned the corner, I saw the lad snatch the watch out of his pocket, and run off by our door. Mr. Bond cried Stop thief! I could not get out of the house to pursue him as the table stood by the door, but directly the lad ran off the prisoner ran to him and hit him on the head. I saw the watch in his hand, with the chain hanging out; the lad directly gathered the chain up in his hand, and all three ran off together. A dog ran out of a cooperage and ran after them - the prisoner beat the dog back twice.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 21st of January, I met Bond in Lambeth-street, about three minutes walk from Thompson's; he said he had been robbed of his watch - Thompson was with him, also a cooper, who described the persons. I went with Thompson to look for them, and between seven and eight o'clock, I found the prisoner at the Anchor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200028"></xptr>public-house, Lower East Smithfield; I took him from the description I received of his hat; I found 9 s. 6 d. in his pocket. He said he knew nothing about it. Next morning Thompson and Bond came to the office - Bond said he had no doubt of his being one of the three.</p>

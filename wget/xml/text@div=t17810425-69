            , spinster, sworn.</p>
               <p>On last Tuesday was se'nnight, in the evening, the prisoner came to a Mrs. Gibbs's, next door but one to where I lived, and asked for a lodging; she would not admit him, unless he paid a shilling before he went into the lodging; he had not a shilling to pay: he asked the woman where I lodge, to have a pint of beer, and she asked me to go along with her.</p>
               <p>What is that woman's name? - Gibbs. I went with him to the Blue Anchor in Snow's Rents, opposite where I live: we had two or three pints of beer. He took me from there, and would insist of my going with him into Tothill-street, into a very bad house I was not acquainted with. He pretended love to me, and that he would marry me. I went with him to the Chequers: we had three pints of beer there; we staid there about an hour and an half; we sat in the tap-room; he took me from there to a very bad place, a night-house in the Almonry.</p>
               <p>How came you to go with him there? - He said he was going home with me; I desired him to set me home; I thought he was going with me.</p>
               <p>How came you to go into that house? - I do not know indeed.</p>
               <p>Did you think that was your own house? - Yes; I thought so indeed.</p>
               <p>You must be much in liquor? - I am not used to liquor; he made me intoxicated; I did not know what I was about: he sent for half a pint of peppermint, and forced me to drink; we were there all night; the next morning he stripped me of my cloak, and a Barcelona and pocket handkerchief, my apron, a half-guinea, and two half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Did he take them by force? - No; there was nobody in company with me all night but him, and in the morning they were gone.</p>
               <p>Was he gone before you missed them? - Yes; I was in bed in the Almonry, in that bad house: when he left me, he told me he was going down to get some breakfast, and would come up again.</p>
               <p>Did you miss the things before or after he went down? - I missed the money before he went down, and I asked him about it; he said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Did you miss the other things? - Yes, directly; I got up, and had not a handkerchief or apron to put on; he never came up again.</p>
               <p>Had you the money when you went to bed? - Yes, in my pocket.</p>
               <p>How do you know you had it in your pocket? - I thought [ had; I can't swear to it.</p>
               <p>Were the other things found? - Yes; I had him taken up the next day: there was found my black silk cloak, an handkerchief, and an apron: he could not say much for himself, but he swore he had not the money; he took the silk handkerchief and pocket handkerchief, therefore he must have the money.</p>

               <p>SYLVANUS PRICE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I have a black silk cloak, an apron, and pocket handkerchief; I took them out of the lining of the prisoner's coat; he said nothing when I took them from him.</p>
               <p>(They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I met this woman: she went and drank with me; she went home, and came out again, and walked with me; she said she was dry; we went into the Chequers, and had four pints of beer; I paid for two, and she paid for two: she wanted to go to bed, and asked me to go home with her; I was a stranger; I did not know the way to her home; she asked me to take her to somewhere to lie down; I took her to an house, and took a bed for her; I gave 1 s. 6 d. for it. When we went to bed, she said she had lost her money; I said I had no money but to pay for the bed; I went to bed with her; she waked at six in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250085"></xptr> morning, and waked me, and said, she was vexed about her money; I said I knew nothing of it; she said, did not I promise to give her some over-night? I said, I did not promise her any money; I had none to give her; she said, what must she do to go home! and she gave me a cloak, an apron, and handkerchief, to pawn for her; I could not get what she wanted; I was bringing them back, and the man laid hold of me and took me up.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.)</p>

               <p>George Hall. I live at Hadley. About the 13th of July last, I had a black mare that I turned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220010"></xptr> out upon <placeName id="t17551022-14-crimeloc73">Enfield-chace</placeName>

I advertis'd her in all the evening papers; and about a week after I had a letter sent me from out of the country, informing me that my mare was at Nuneaton in Warwickshire; the letter was sign'd

            . I went down into Warwickshire, by order of Mr. Hall. I found the mare in Warwickshire, but can't tell the name of the town. She was in custody of one Mr. Peak; he had chang'd her away for another; I swore to the mare as Mr. Hall's property; (I bought her for him in Yorkshire last April.) Mr. Peak had just sold her to another person, and he paid the gentleman the money back again, and delivered the mare to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did Peak change with?</p>
               <p>Adkerson. He chang'd for this mare with the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Adkerson. Peak told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Peak, is he here?</p>
               <p>Adkerson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you of your own knowledge know that this mare was in custody of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Adkerson. No, I do not. I took the prisoner up at the Cock-pit there, by the intelligence of Cox. I asked him if he knew any thing of a black mare, and a dun gelding; he fell a crying, and said, he did very well; he begg'd for a little time, and I gave him two hours. He sent for his father, but he did not come. I ask'd him if there were any Confederates with him, and he said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he stole the black mare, and dun gelding?</p>
               <p>Adkerson. No; but he had a dun gelding there, which one of our neighbour's lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What need of confederates to know a black mare, and a dun gelding. Did he or did he not say he stole them?</p>

               <p>Adkerson. He did not say he stole them.</p>

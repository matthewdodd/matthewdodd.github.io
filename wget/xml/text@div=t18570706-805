                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Papineau and Co., of Har<lb></lb>row Bridge. On 29th June, at half past 6 o'clock in the evening, I went into the yard and saw Bourne with something under his arm—I accused him of taking lead—he said that he had not—I then saw Ward with some lead wrapped up in his smock—there were eight or nine others coming up, and as soon as they saw me stop Bourne, they turned back, and Ward turned round with the rest of them, and I saw him put a velvet coat down, from which the officer took this lead (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is ours—they had been drinking the whole day, or I do not think they would have done it—they did more drink than work that day—it was in our warehouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed as a labourer by Mr. Papineau—I was sitting at tea about half past 6 o'clock, and saw the men burst open the warehouse door—Bourne was one of them—they took some lead out of the warehouse, and bent it, and put it about them—there were at least five of them, but I did not see Ward—I cannot say that he was not there, because I do not know who the others were—I gave information to Burton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ward's Defence.</hi> The man that the coat belongs to has run away, and I am obliged to suffer for him; I have a wife and children, and am inno<lb></lb>cent; I wish to ask the policeman if he saw anything in my possession.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). I was called—I saw Bourne first going, and stopping some of the men, he immediately turned back, and I saw something very heavy and bulky under his left arm—he went round the corner of a low wall, and dropped something—I took him back, and found the lead there—I examined the coat, and found a piece of lead in it—at that time Ward had on a small jacket—the person who the velvet coat belonged to has absconded, in case of being apprehended—I do not know where Ward was at work—they were all on the ground when I came there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Bishop &amp; Blundell, wholesale and manufacturing stationers, carrying on business in Old Fish-street-hill—we have a factory in Little Britain—the prisoner has been in our employ nearly 8 years—he was a foreman at the factory, over a certain number of hands there—his duties were to give out the work, to keep an account of it, to mix the colour for them, and to fill up his time in any way he could to our advantage—there was no written agreement—when he first came to us we had but few hands so employed, and his time was occupied principally in working; subsequently, as the business increased, he had less work to do, and it became more a matter of overlooking—his hours were from 8 in the morning to 8 at night, with intervals of an hour at dinner, and half an hour at tea—when he first came to us he had 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and it was increased till it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was also allowed to charge if he worked any overtime, at the rate of, I believe, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour—it was also his duty to render an account on the Saturday of what work each person had done during the week—he had done so for some years before 27th August last—I was at the pay table on Saturday, 3rd September—he came on that day and presented the accounts in the usual manner—I produce an account which he presented to me—"3d September; 4 reams of extra enamel, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. M. A. Downea."—we had a person of the name of Downey in our employ—I believe her name is Mary Ann Downey—on his presenting that, I paid him the 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the bill—he returns me the bills, sometimes on the following Saturday—we roll them up and keep them, putting the dates—Mr. Blundell marked this in my presence, "3d September"—he returned that in the usual way, otherwise we should not have had it—I was not present when the prisoner was asked to give some explanation; I came in subsequently—I was present when he was given into custody—I was present at the factory during the four weeks before 3d September—I always saw the prisoner there, employed about his ordinary business—it is quite impossible for us to say whether the work mentioned on the bill has been done by anybody.</p>

               <p>sure—if he had done so, I do not know whether he would have dined in this room—I do not know what time he dined, or whether he took the hour he was entitled to for dinner—I looked after him pretty well—there are several rooms of a comparatively private nature, where he might have had his dinner if he had liked—there was one room above, where I have some-times seen him eating; it was not strictly private—I do not know whether he had tea on the establishment—he was entitled to half an hour for tea—he was supposed to be there at 8 o'clock in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Bishop and Blundell—on 27th August, I was at the pay table when the defendant came in and presented the accounts of the various work people—I produce one account, in his writing, which he rendered me on that day, headed, "Downe, one ream, imperial; second coat, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I understand by that, there was work done of a certain kind to some paper of the size called imperial, by a person of the name of Downey—I know we had a person of that name there some time—I paid him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 10th September I was at the pay table; he then produced a similar account, and a similar account on 17th September, the following week—both these amounts were paid him by me—on the week following September 17th, he again came to the pay table—I looked over his accounts, and picked out one headed "Downey," similar to these, and I asked him who Downey was—his answer was "I am Downey"—I forget the next remark that I made, but his answer was "I did the work, and I have kept the money"—I then asked him why he did not make out the account in his own name, if he had done the work, and he said if he had made it out in his own name it would have been objected to—I said, "If you have done this work it must have been, in our time"—he said he had done it during his dinner hour, and at leisure times—that was the whole of his answer to the best of my recollection—I was not in the factory during these three weeks that I have spoken of, more than once or twice—the description of the work mentioned is done there—it is an ordinary week's work for one woman—the amount is 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

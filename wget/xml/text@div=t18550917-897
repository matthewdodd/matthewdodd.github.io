                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 187). On 20th June I was stationed at Penge—about half past 1 o'clock, in the middle of that day, I was called out of my bed to put an end to a fight—I went to the Crooked Billet, and in front of that house outside I found a fight going on—there were a great number of men outside, I suppose 150, shouting, and making a noise—the prisoners were all there—I went quietly to the men, and told them to give over fighting—they said they would not be interfered with by the police—Collins said he would kill all the police that came to interfere—Collins struck violently at me three times—I put my arm up to save my head—the other men pushed me back—I do not remember that Ratcliff was there at the beginning, he was there soon afterwards—Collins struck at me three times, and the other prisoners were pushing me about, with a great many others—I went and stood at a short distance from them, and in a short time Cannon, another constable, came up—I sent for more assistance, and I told Cannon what had taken place, and we considered it was best not to interfere—the <hi rend="italic">men</hi> were getting up a pretended fight—I really did not notice who it was that pretended to fight, they were striking each other—they left off of their own accord soon after Cannon came, and a great number of them went into the Crooked Billet—I and Cannon remained outside, at the top of a court, leading to my house, which is close by the Crooked Billet—I then saw Pooley; she spoke to the men, and pointed out Cannon, and said, "That is the b——r that gave me a month, serve him out for it"—there were a great many persons outside the public house at that time—Pooler having said that went into the public house—she came out again is about five minutes, and Bavington, Collins, Sheppard, Dixon, and Kem<lb></lb>mish, came out with her—Cannon and I were still standing in the same place, at the top of the court, and four Persons came up to us—Bavington was one, but whether they were all the same men that came out of the public house, I do not know—they came down two abreast—Bavington pulled off part of his clothes, and said to the man by him, "You take that b—r, and I will take this"—Bavington struck Cannon directly, and the other man struck me—who the other man was, I do not know—I was then struck by a great many—there were but four at first—the other three struck me—Cannon 'and I stood on our own defence, and directly a great number came, as many as could get near us, but how many it is impossible for me to say—beside striking us with their fists, they threw stones at us—this struggle went on at the top of the court, for five or six minutes—soon after this Cannon was separated from me, and I was knocked down a few yards down the court—I was knocked down three times—I succeeded in getting up twice—the third time I could not get up for some time, and I was knocked about and kicked, and jumped upon—I was near my own door when I was knocked down the third time by Collins—Kemmish was in the court, and while I was on the ground with the truncheon in my hand, he stood on my hand and wrenched it out of my hand, and Sheppard kicked me on my left hip—I turned to prevent their kicking me, and they got on my back—I hallooed "Murder!" as loudly as I could, till I could halloo no longer—I then heard one of the men say, "Come away, leave him, he will do now"—I do not think I laid long in that court—Cannon came down the court the third time, as I was holding by the fence—Cannon and I got into my house, we fastened the door—some persons came down the court a</p>

               <p>very short time afterwards—I saw Bavington, Collins, Sheppard, Dixon, and Kemmish, outside my house—they looked in at the window, and then commenced throwing stones at us, and broke the window all to pieces—all the prisoners that I have mentioned took an active part in it—Cannon and I tried to keep the door shut, which we could not do, and Cannon said, "We had better leave, we shall be murdered"; the front door was burst in, and we went to the back—I saw Bavington, Collins, Sheppard, Dixon, and Kem<lb></lb>mish, in the house—at the time they came in, Collins had this large piece of wood (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) in his hand, which he had split off the bottom of the door—he held it in both his hands, and struck Cannon on the head with the edge of it—Cannon had a butcher's chopper in his band—Collins struck at Cannon's head with this board—Cannon put up his arm, and got the blow on his arm—I was attacked also in the room—I was in one corner and Can<lb></lb>non was in another—the furniture in the room was broken to pieces—these are the legs of my table (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw these legs in the hands of the persons in the room—I cannot Bay positively who had them, I was too much excited—there were some legs of chairs in some of their hands—1 was knocked down—one of them pulled me by the arm out of the corner I was in, and another knocked me down—when I got up I fought my way to the door—the violence had gone on in the house from five to ten minutes before I got out of the house—I did not see Cannon there at the time I fought my way out—I believe he was there—when I got to the door a man had a knife in his hand, and he made a stab at me as I went past—who it was I cannot say.</p>

               <p>except these prisoners—I saw several sham fights got up—I did not at all interfere—I saw Pooley come out of the grocer's shop with some bacon in her hand—she said, "That is the b——that gave me a calendar month serve him out, but spare the rest"—there were none of the police there but Wiles and me—she went into the public house, and came out again, and Bavington, Collins, Dixon, and Sheppard, came out of the public house—they came up to me and Wiles, took off their jackets, and Bavington said, "We are going to fight these b——policemen; I will take this, and you take the other"—Bavington then struck me with his fist in the left eye—I saw Wiles struck, but I could not say who struck him—I should say there were nearly fifty round us—I drew my truncheon and struck Bavington, and Wiles struck the other one—we kept them away as well as we could for some little time—Bavington closed on me, and shocked me up against the butcher's shop—some one called out, "Take the b—n truncheon away, and use it"—I passed my truncheon over the frost, and gave it to Mr. Wren, the butcher, who was in his shop—I then armed myself with a butcher's chopper that I saw lying in the shop—I took it to defend myself—Bavington kicked me on the leg—Mr. Wren assisted me with the long arm—I got in the shop, and Mr. Wren and I kept them oat as well as we could for Home little time, but the stones came so thick that I was obliged to retreat out at the back door—I should say there were forty or fifty in front of the shop engaged in throwing stones—all the male prisoners were there—Hurry was there while the stones were throwing but he was not throwing stones—Ratcliff was there at the commencement when Bavington commenced striking me, and Ratcliff said, "Give it the b——"—I am sure of that as to Ratcliff—I saw Ratcliff and Hurry in front of the butcher's shop—I did not see them throwing stones, but there was so many there, I could not say—I noticed Hurry jumping about and shouting, but I did not see him throwing stones—the stones were thrown so fast that I retreated out at the back door—Wiles was then gone down the court—he was not in the shop—when I got out I met Sheppard standing in the court—he said, "Here comes one b"——and he tried to prevent my going up the court—I had the chopper in one hand, and my truncheon in the other—I struck him with the truncheon, and I went on towards Wiles, whom I saw standing at his own door—I and Wiles went into hi house, and we locked and bolted the door—his house is at the back of the butcher's shop—no great distance down the court—when we got into Wiles's house, there were a number of them throwing stones through Wiles's window—I noticed amongst them Sheppard and Kennish—there were several others—I could not particularly identify any other—they were all about there—they were in the court—the court was full of people—Bavington and Collins were there—I could not positively speak to any other—after they broke the window in with the stones, they forced the door in, and we tried to escape out of the back door—I distinctly saw Collins come in with this piece of board in his hand, which had formed the bottom part of Wiles's door—Collins took up this with both hands and struck at my head—I put up my arm, and the blow broke my arm—he struck me on the head afterwards—I had seven blows on my head—one was a severe blow, I believe it was done with this board—as my arm was broken I could not use the chopper—I struck Collins with the truncheon, and retreated to a corner of the room—I had seven blows on my head—not all with this board, some with these table legs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when I was in the corner, Dixon called me out into the middle of the room, and said, "Come out, face</p>

               <p>me like a man"—I could not say how many persons were in the room—the room was full—immediately one of them turned the table bottom upwards (it was a Pembroke table), and broke the four legs off—Bavington, Shep<lb></lb>pard, and Dixon were amongst those who broke the table, and armed them selves with the legs—as I stood in the corner, they made strokes at my head with this board, and the legs of the table—they broke my. hat right in, and hit my head—I was then leaning against a corner in the angle of the room, supporting myself that way—I was not able to defend myself—I called out "Murder!" as well as I could, and they left me, and one of them said as they left me (I believe it was Dixon), "The b—r is dead enough now"—I was in a fainting state, leaning in the corner of the room, and when they got out, I tried to get up—I fell down—the neighbours came and got me up, washed my face, and gave me some brandy—I heard these people coming back again, and I crawled up stairs as well as I could—my head was cut all to pieces—my left arm was broken, and bruised from the shoulders to the wrist, and my left leg was bruised very much with the kicks—I saw Wiles in the room some five minutes after these persona broke in—there were so many there I could not see what position he was in—I saw some of the men strike him—the sergeant at last came, and I went away with him—I assisted in apprehending the prisoners—these men have been there about six weeks—I knew them by being about there—they had been drinking, and were about half-drunk, but every man was capable of knowing what he was about—I was a witness against Pooley; she had a month for picking pockets, on my evidence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant at Hammersmith. I bad a barge called the Elizabeth lying off my place on 8th Dec, she was moored in the Thames, and had coals on board—I had requested my man to give infor<lb></lb>mation to the police—I have since seen the coals which the policeman has pro<lb></lb>duced—I should say they are the same sort that I had, but I cannot swear it.</p>

               <p>saw the prisoner go to it and take coals from it—he put them in his hat and walked away with them—I followed and overtook him, and asked what he had got?—he said, "A few coals"—I asked how he got them—he said be took them off the shore—I said it was wrong, he took them off the barge—he begged me to let him take them back—I said I could not, I most take him—in going to the station, he said he was sorry for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cooper, and live in Wapping. On the night of the 29th of Aug. I fell in with the prisoner, in Wapping—I went up the Highway with her, went to a public-house, and gave her a little treat—I then went home with her to Rosemary-lane—I paid her the charge for the night, and stripped off my clothes—I had four sovereigns—I sounded them in my purse before I went to bed—I put my trowsers on the top of the pillow, and my watch below it—she then told me to put the light out, and I did—she then got up, because she said the bed was not right, and she would have more sheets on it—she begged me to light the candle again—I tried to get a light, and could not do it—she said, "Never mind," she would go up stairs and get a light, but instead of that, she went out, and went away—in about two minutes I went to the bed—I found my watch was safe, but my purse and four sovereigns were gone.</p>

I received information from the prosecutor, that he had been robbed in a house in Russell-court, Rosemary-lane—I went in search of the prisoner, and found her at the House and Leaping-bar, Whitechapel, at two o'clock in the morning—I told her I wanted her for robbing a man of a purse and four sovereigns—she said, "I know nothing about the purse; he gave me half-a-crown to sleep with me"—there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a knife found on her—I found nothing in the room—the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>

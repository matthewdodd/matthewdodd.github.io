                  </hi>. I am barman at the Crown and Dolphin, Cannon-street. The deceased came there on Saturday, 8th May, about half past 12 o'clock in the day—I had never seen her before—she was not exactly sober, but was quite capable of taking care of herself—she was there till half-past 4, and got rather better—I think there were two or three women in her com<lb></lb>pany; she treated them to some porter, there were no spirits drank—they paid for four or five pots of porter, between three or four of them—I do not think the deceased drank above three parts of a pint, she drank very little—about half past 4 the prisoner came to fetch her away—I had never seen him before—he was not very angry; he said, "I want you to come home along with me"—he did not speak particularly cross; he did a little, but not to speak of—he was a little displeased at finding his wife drinking at the public house—she went away with him—I saw no marks of violence on her face then—he went outside first, and she followed him.</p>

I know the prisoner and deceased by living next door to them; they lived together—I believe she was married to him—I always understood her to go by the name of Mrs. Bailey while they have lived there, which is about a year—I believe he is a corn porter—she came there as Mrs. Bailey—I do not know her Christian name—on Saturday, 8th May, about 6 o'clock, she passed me with the prisoner—she had no marks or bruises about her face, but she appeared to have been crying—she went indoors with the prisoner, and a little while afterwards I heard a fall in the front room ground floor, which they lived in—I live down stairs in the back room, next door; my back room is next to their back room—when I heard the fall I was at the street door—not many minutes after the fall I heard the prisoner say, "Take that!" and then he said if any man or woman in the house interfered be would serve them the same way—I believe he was in the passage when he said that—about half past 8 I heard of the woman's death—I went into her room and she was dead, on the bed—the prisoner was not there, he had been taken by the police—she had a black eye, a mark on the forehead, and a mark under the chin, which were not there when she went into the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Knight, and live at 43, Devonshire-street, in the same house as the prisoner. I was at home on 8th May—I knew the deceased, they used to call her <hi rend="italic">Carry</hi>—I was on the first floor up stairs all day long—my room is right over hers—I heard them come home about half past 5 o'clock; directly they got inside the house I heard her fall, and heard the prisoner say, "Take that!"—immediately after she fell—they were then in the passage—the fall was in the passage—I heard the door of the room unlocked, and directly it was opened I heard a second fall, and then heard him strike one of his hands against the other—he used some vulgar language, and said if any man or woman came to interfere with him he would</p>

               <p>serve them the same—I then heard the room door shut again, and heard her say twice, "Oh dear! John"—I afterwards heard a third fall, but did not hear him speak any more—it was all so quiet after that that I thought they were gone to bed—I had seen the prisoner come home at 5 with his mates, but did not see him again till after 6, when he came up to my room door, and said "Pray, Mrs. Knight, there's a good soul, come down and see what you can do with my old woman"—he was very much excited—I went down, and found her lying perfectly dead on the floor on her right side, with her arms folded, her knees drawn up, and her head buried into her neck—she was a very good sized woman, not very stout, and not very thin; she always said her age was thirty-two—her mouth had blood on it—there was no appearance of it's having been washed—her face had been washed, apparently to refresh her—there is a waterbut in the yard, just outside the door, to which the prisoner went twice or three times after the third fall to draw water—I undid the deceased's clothes, and observed marks on her face; her left eye was very much blackened, her forehead had a bruise, and there was one under ber chin—I had not seen her before that day—I know she was <hi rend="italic">on the drink</hi> very much—when the prisoner came up to roe, I said, "Good God! Bailey, what have you done?"—he said, "You know how drunk she gets, and aggravates me by her getting drunk, and I smacked her face"—she was a very quiet woman generally; but every three or four months she would get <hi rend="italic">on the drink</hi>, and drink for a week or a fortnight together, if her things would last—I have known her to go without her linen three days for drink, or as long as her pawning her things would last, or selling them either—she was a quiet woman at all times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Rogers, of 44, Devonshire-street, next door to the deceased. I occupied the back room upstairs—the deceased called herself Caroline Harris—I saw her on the day she died, about 12 o'clock in the morning—I believe she had been out, she was very much intoxicated, and when I went into the room she was sitting in a chair, and did not answer when I spoke to her—I did up her hair, and washed her face—there were no marks on her face then—Bailey came to me about 5 that afternoon, and asked me if I had seen his old woman, if I knew where she was—I said, "No," and I expect he then went to look for her—about half-past 6, he came to me at my daughter's, a few doors off in the same street; he was very much agitated, and said, "Oh, dear, Mrs. Rogers! will you come to see what you can do with my old woman, I am afraid she is dead!"—he was grieving very much indeed, and was very much distressed—I said, "I hope, Bailey, you have not been ill-using her?"—he said, "Oh, Mrs. Rogers! I have not, I have only smacked her face"—I then went to the room with him, and saw her lying on the floor, and Mrs. Knight undoing her clothes—I lifted up her head, and said to the prisoner, "Oh, dear me! a smack of the face never did this"—he answered, "Oh, Mrs. Rogers, I did not do it! I did not do it!"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and a bachelor of medicine of the Commercial-road. On 8th May I was called to see the deceased at 43, Devonshire-street—I found her lying on the floor quite dead—I got there as nearly at half-past 6 o'clock as possible—I examined her externally at that time, and found the left eye blackened, two bruises on the forehead, one on the right side of the cheek, and a very severe one on the left side of the chin—they were all recent except the black-eye, it was rather the remains of a black-eye, the bruise was of a greenish colour—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examin<lb></lb>ation on the 10th; the whole body was healthy except the head—the brain itself was healthy, but there was a clot of blood pressing on it—on removing the brain from the skull I found this clot of blood at the base of the brain covering a portion of the brain under the projecting bone, at the very bend of the neck, just where the spine joins the skull—I attribute death to the clot of blood being there—apoplexy would produce the clot—taking into con<lb></lb>sideration the age of the woman, and the healthy state of the brain and vessels I should say that clot was produced by external violence, either by a blow or fall, or both—a blow behind would do it, but I should rather attribute it to a blow on the front part of the head—that would be much more likely to produce it than a blow behind; or it might be produced by a fall either back-wards or forwards—there was no external mark on the back of the head—if she had fallen forwards, and hit her forehead on the ground, that might have produced it; or if she had fallen backwards, but if she had fallen backwards there would probably have been some external marks—a blow under the chin might, by suddenly throwing the head back, rupture a small vessel at the base of the brain; but I should rather attribute the mark on the chin to a fall than a blow, on account of the skin having been abraded in a very slight manner—intoxication would predispose her to the injury, and less violence would produce the effect than on a sober woman.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence, in which he stated that he had lived with the deceased eight years, and had suffered much from her drunken habits, from which it was impossible to reclaim her; and whilst in that state she would make away with everything they possessed; that at the time in question she had been for some time intoxicated, and he had fetched her from the public-house; that she insisted on leaving the room to go for more drink; that he rushed before the door to prevent her, and pushed her, upon which she fell, and so received the injury.</hi>)</p>

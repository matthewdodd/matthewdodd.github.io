On the 7th of July, between ten and eleven o'clock, as I was going into one of the warehouses, I saw the prisoner - He appeared confused, and I saw some tea drop from his hands; I went out, put the door ajar, and waited sometime, I then saw him put his hand into a chest three or four times. I told the elder, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>JAMES HEPWORTH. I am an assistant elder in the Company's service; from information that I received from Lavoy, the prisoner was secured and taken to Mr. Benny, who told him he suspected that he had some tea about him, and ordered him to be searched-the prisoner said, "to prevent further trouble, I have some;" and produced it in a bag with eyes to it, to hook it on his apron.</p>

I was standing near Covent Garden, when a man came up and said he wanted some men for a painting job, and made an appointment to meet me at the Angel, Islington. He met me with two others. We went to a public-house and had some ale. The two others left. The man pretended to be or was intoxicated, and on getting near the Bank he asked me to get the cheque cashed while he waited. I thought it was genuine, and did so, and was given in custody."</p>

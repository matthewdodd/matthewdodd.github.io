On the 20th of March, about half-past ten o'clock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100080"></xptr>in the evening, I received information from my servant, and missed a piece of cheese from the safe, which I had seen here about half-past six o'clock - I had seen the prisoner in the skittle-ground - and the safe is close by the steps of the skittle-ground - it had a canvass front, which was torn open, and the cheese taken out - I had noticed it particularly, as we had two gentlemen to dine with us that day - and there was a decayed place which they had cut out; I noticed it when it was taken away - I had tasted the cheese.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Are either of those gentlemen here? A. No; I am quite sure it was safe at half-past six o'clock - the prisoner had not left the house at half-past six o'clock - for when he came from the skittle-ground he went into the tap-room, and must have passed close by the safe - a door near the skittle-ground leads into the street - there were two gentlemen in the parlour that evening, and the prisoner and some others in the skittle-ground - I have seen the prisoner frequently in our house.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Heavens. I saw the prisoner at his house - he had been playing at skittles, and as he came from the skittle-ground he said, "I will be d-d if I won't have that piece of cheese" - the canvass of the safe was a little torn, but not enough to get the cheese out - the prisoner left about seven o'clock that evening, and was in liquor - we missed the cheese at half-past ten o'clock.</p>

            . I am servant at the Bell, in Hoxton, not far from the prosecutor's. On the evening the prisoner came to our house with a piece of cheese tied up in a black silk handkerchief - there were several persons there, and he gave them some to taste - he said he knew it to be good, for he got it from the right place, from Newgate-street - he was a little in liquor - he was saucy, and challenged my fellow servant to fight him - he wanted to raise money on the cheese - it was weighed, and weighed eight pounds and a half - I live near the prisoner - he bears a good character.</p>

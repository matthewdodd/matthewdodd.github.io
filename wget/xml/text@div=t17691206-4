            . I lost two shirts, the property of a young man that I wash for, on Friday the 20th of October. They were brought to me by a gentleman that stopped the prisoner with them. (Produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Dr. Cherrington. On Friday the 20th of October, as I was coming down Paradise-Row, in Chelsea, to go to my own house, the prisoner came by me in a rushing manner, and had like to have thrown down my little boy that I had in my hand. I turned to him, and said, You brute, why do you push the child? He went forwards a dog's trot. He seemed to be an active young man, and had a bundle under his coat, on his left breast, supported by his right hand. Soon after this I heard the cry of - Stop thief! that is the man. He was but a little past me. Then I called out - Stop thief! that is the man. Immediately Mr. Atkinson stopt him. He begged of Mr. Atkinson to let him go. Upon which Mr. Atkinson said, That is the bundle that is dropped. I saw it on the ground before I came up, but it was rather in motion on the ground. I did not see the prisoner drop it. I took it up, and carried it with him towards the water-side. In going along, I met the daughter of Mrs. Greenwood: she said they were stole from her mother. Soon after that I met the mother, who said it was her linen. We went to the headborough's house, and there I delivered the linen into his hands. The prisoner was taken to the cage. The prisoner wanted to make his escape, and begged of me to let him go. I said, I am very sorry for you as a man, but, as a publick offender, you must be punished. (The shirts produced, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Atkinson confirm'd the above account.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

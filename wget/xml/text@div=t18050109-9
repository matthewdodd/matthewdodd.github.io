               <p>Q. Did any thing pass when he came out of the house? - A. I saw him make a blow at Mrs. Wilson, she was standing by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had made that blow at Mrs. Wilson, which way did he take his course? - A. He ran immediately towards Hind-street, and he had not got above twenty yards before he was stopped by a gentleman, who seized him, I was then crying stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that gentleman keep hold of him? - A. Only for a minute; he got away from him, he made a double across the street, and whether the gentleman struck him or not, I do not know, but the prisoner fell down in the middle of the street; he got up again, and kept on my side of the way back again, opposite to No. 11; he then turned a corner into William-street, which is within one door of where I live; I pursued him, crying stop thief; I never lost sight of him, I saw him stopped in Marybone-lane by several people.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he get away from those persons by whom he was then surrounded? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the purpose for which you seized him to apprehend him? - A. Yes; he struggled, and made a blow at my head, which I avoided, and he fell.</p>

               <p>Q. On the evening of Saturday, the 20th of October, did you hear any cry of stop thief? - A. Very much indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon hearing that cry? - A. I ran out, and saw this gentleman pursuing a man, and singing out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do? - A. I stepped over the way to meet the man; as I came up on one side the pavement, he stepped on the other; he fell down, and I caught hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you catch hold of him? - A. Because I heard the cry of stop thief, to apprehend him; I led him along very quietly forty or fifty yards, Mr. Holford told me there was something in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see whether he had any thing in his hand? - A. Not to my recollection; he struck me at the corner of William-street with a piece of iron, and I was taken to the Hospital. Twelve or fourteen pieces of bone have been taken out of my head, and there are more pieces coming out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you hold of him at the time he so struck you? - A.I still continued to have hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this, did any person come up to your assistance? - A. Yes, a butcher of the name of Snowden; I told him he had got something very hard, that he had struck me upon the head very hard, and two of them got it out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it prove to be? - A. An iron crow; me and the butcher conveyed him to the watch-house together; I was taken to the Hospital, and was there five weeks and three days.</p>

Nothing more likely; a portion of the bone was cut away from the skull, it was cut in a strait line, about as broad as a goose's quill, three quarters of an inch long and very deep, as if it was done by such an instrument as that; it made an incision into the bone, there was a complete piece taken out, as if it had been sawed out as it were; the scalp that covers the bone was very much torn; besides the fracture, there was a wound on the side of the head, and after examining that wound, the bone was discovered with a piece of it cut out, a slit in the bone as if from a violent blow; you may form some idea of it, by cutting off a piece of a goose's quill.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did it appear to be broke off, or cut out? - A. Cut out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Scott Adie, 115, Regent Street—I know Aston, by his coming to our shop about twelve months ago from his masters, Mackay and Co.—on the 28th of August last he came into the shop and said he wanted two lengths of cloth—he had got the patterns of them, and I was to cut the length of each piece—he said it was for Mackay, Burke, and Wheeler, 120, New Bond Street—they are customers of our firm—I entered the cloth, and saw it delivered over to him—the value of it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him the invoice, made out to Mackay, Burke, and Wheeler—he went away with the cloth—as near as I can recollect, it was between three and four o'clock in the after-noon—I parted with the cloth because I did not know that he had left Mackay, Burke, and Wheeler's—he said he came from them, and I believed that to be true.</p>

I took Aston into custody on the 31st of Angust in Great Queen Street—he was with another man—I told him I had a warrant to apprehend him for obtaining goods under false pretences from Scott Adie, in Regent Street, in the name of Mackay, Burke, and Wheeler—he said he knew nothing about it—I asked him if his name was Aston</p>

               <p>—he said it was, and he had certainly lived in their employ in Bond Street, but he had left twelve months ago—I found thirty-seven pawn tickets in his room, one corresponding with the ticket produced by the pawn-broker's boy for cloth pawned for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the name of John Smith—they were in a cupboard in a room where he was living—I found another ticket on him relating to a ring.</p>

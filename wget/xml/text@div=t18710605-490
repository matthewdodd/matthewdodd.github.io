I keep a coffee-house, in Broadway, Camberwell—on 8th April, I served the prisoner with two cups of tea and a tea cake—he gave me a half-crown, which I gave to my wife and gave him change—about half an hour afterwards I was looking over the money and found it was bad—my wife tied it up in her handkerchief, and I afterwards gave it to the policeman—on 29th April, the prisoner came again for a meat pudding, which came to 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not notice that he was the same man till I served him, but my wife did—he gave me a florin, I found it was bad, and sent for a policeman—the prisoner went on his knees and begged me not to do so—I gave him in custody with the florin.</p>

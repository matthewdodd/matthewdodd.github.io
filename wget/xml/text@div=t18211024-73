On the 20th of September I saw the prisoner at the corner of Portman-street, and asked him if he knew a man who would beat our carpet. He said he should be glad to do the job for 3 s. I took him to the house, told my mistress, and told him to come for it on Monday morning, which he did, at half-past nine o'clock. He was to bring it back as soon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240039"></xptr>as he could. He said I should always find him at the watering-house. He never returned it. I found him on the 6th of October at a public-house, at the corner of Quebec-street; before I spoke to him he said "I have not got your carpet." I went to speak to the landlady, and he went away. I saw him a quarter of an hour after at the General Townsend, public-house, in Oxford-street, but said nothing to him. On the 9th I met him again, and said he had stolen the carpet. He said "No I have not, I shall be obliged if you will let me go, I will come back again." I took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why not take me before - A. The third time, as he had two others with him, I was afraid; and at the other times he appeared tipsy, he was sitting down, I wanted to see him standing up, to know him better.</p>

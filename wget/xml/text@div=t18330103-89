On the 12th of December I put these candlesticks down at the tap-room fire, to melt the grease, and the prisoner came in to sell something which she had in a bag, and was alone in the tap-room; it was about a quarter to ten o'clock; my servant missed the candlesticks; the prisoner was stopped with them while I was up stairs - I had not myself seen her that morning.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's servant. About a quarter before ten o'clock I was in the kitchen; I heard the candlesticks rattle in the tap-room; I followed the prisoner up a court; she turned round, and I saw the candlesticks under her shawl - I asked two women in the court to mind her, while I went to ask mistress what I should do with her, and while I was gone the women sent for an officer, who took her - I saw her at the station-house, with the candlesticks.</p>

I know the prisoner well; I saw her tried here four or five years ago, for robbing her lodgings - I have the certificate of her conviction - (read); I am certain she is the woman; I have known her ever since - she was at that time very heavy with child, and took the whole on herself to save her husband, who has never been near her since.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, D</hi> 27). On Thursday, 1st May, about half-past 1 in the morning, I heard cries of "Murder" and "Police," in Carlton-terrace, Harrow-road—in consequence of hearing those cries I went there—I saw the prisoner's wife in her night-drees, or chemise, standing in front of the terrace, with her night-dress saturated with blood—she com<lb></lb>plained of some one to me—in consequence of what she said I went with her to where she lived, and knocked at the door—the landlord of the house opened it—while we were waiting for the door to be opened, she was bleeding very much: I should think there'was a pint of blood on the stone in front of the door—when the door was opened, I went up stairs to the third floor front-room, and found the prisoner there dressing himself—I said, "This is a very serious case; you are charged with assaulting your wife with some blunt instrument"—his wife was then in the front-room—he said, "It is a good job she got away from me, or it might have been worse"—I then took him to the station, and sent for a surgeon to attend the wife—at the station she said, while the prisoner was by, that he had struck her with the axe on the side of the head—she said, she saw the axe coming and stood on one side—she also said, he had tried to stab her with a file, more than once—I saw several wounds, one on the neck, and one on the finger—in consequence of what I heard then, I went back and searched the pri<lb></lb>soner's room, and there found this axe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under some fire-wood in a corner of the room—there were marks of blood on it then, and now—I also found this file (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under the bed—there were no marks on that—there was blood on the floor of the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—on 30th April, we went to bed about 10 o'clock—about half-past 12 my husband awoke me for the pur<lb></lb>pose of giving him some medicine—he had not been well; he was in a very strange state—I gave him his medicine, and got into bed again after a short time; he told me to come to bed—after I had got into bed again he tried to pierce me with a file in the stomach—he had not said anything before he did that—he did not pierce me with the file—I got it from him after a long time, and threw it under the bed—I had several scratches from it about my body—I tried to get away from him as much as I could—he then got the axe from behind some fire-wood—we were out of bed at that time; in the struggle we got out on to the floor—he struck me on the left side of the head with the axe—I was standing up at the time, trying to get out of the door away from him—I could not say what part of the axe he hit me with—it out my head, and the blood flowed on to my chemise—when I got from him I ran down stairs as fast as I possibly could, and he threw the axe after me on to the first landing, but it did not come near me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had he been in a strange state for some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; from the Saturday night—this happened on Thursday, 1st May—he could not work—he had not been confined to his bed—he could not sleep, or rest at all—there did not seem any rest in him—he had been drinking very hard for a fortnight, continually, every day—it was on Saturday night that he was first taken so ill that he could not go out—I had no one to attend him—I offered to go for a doctor<lb></lb>ing of parties being in the room: he even went down to my landlady's room and looked about her private apartments, and in the cow-shed, and underneath the cows—he had never done such a thing before—that was in the morning part of the Wednesday—sometimes he was a great deal worse than he was at others—after he had slept in the afternoon he seemed much better, and I was in hopes that he had overcome it—he said nothing more about it before we went to bed about 10—I can't say whether he went to sleep—I fell asleep myself—he was a very good husband to me when he was sober—I never gave him any ground of complaint—he is a timber sawyer—the axe is used for the timber—it was placed in a corner behind some fire wood with other tools—the file is used to sharpen the saw—I don't know where he took that from; he generally carried it in his pocket—he had got out of bed before he tried to stab me with the file.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Kensal-green—on 1st May, about half-past 9 in the morning, I was called to examine the prosecutrix at her house—I found two incised wounds on her head, one over the left ear three inches in extent, and one over the right ear about an inch in length; they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186205120039"></xptr>
               <p>were to the bone—this axe would be calculated to produce such wounds—I found a great number of scratches and bruises on the belly, as if caused by the sharp point of a file—there was also a blunt wound on the right side of the belly, as if produced by the blunt edge of the file—I afterwards saw the prisoner at the station—I asked him how he came to do it—he said, he had had <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens,</hi> and it was through jealousy of one Jem Trotman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you are familiar with what is called <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a very aggravated state of it makes a a man insane, so that he would not know what he was doing—he would not then know the difference between right and wrong—I have heard the evidence of the prosecutrix—if I had been called in I might have advised some stimulants to be administered—suddenly depriving a man of stimu<lb></lb>lants after he has been drinking might bring on <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—it may last some days, until the man gets a good sleep—I did not see him in a tremulous state—the symptoms described by the prosecutrix are such as occur in an aggravated state of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—the only way in which I can account for there being no recurrence of the fit, was his getting plenty of good sleep—possibly his being locked up might have some effect, but <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> if a formed disease, and I should hardly think it would have been so.</p>

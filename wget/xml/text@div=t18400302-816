                  </hi>. I lire in Silver-street, in the parish of St. Olave—it is my dwelling-house. On Saturday, the 15th of February, I was at home—about seven o'clock in the evening a square of glass, which had been put in that day, was broken at one corner, and taken out—this seven yards of cloth and this velvet, which are mine, were takes out of the window.</p>

I was opposite Mr. Kirby's house about seven o'clock, and saw two persons at the window—they pushed the square of glass in—I could see the arm of one, but I do not know who did it, but the prisoner hurried up the street with the cloth—the other walked a few yards behind—my brother hallooed something, and the prisoner dropped the cloth—I believe him to be the person—I did not see his face.</p>

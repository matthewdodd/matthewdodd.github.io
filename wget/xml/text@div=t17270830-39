               <p>Mr. Rowe (who keeps the Guy Earl of Warwick) depos'd, That the Prisoner had been a Lodger in his House for some Time, and behaved himself very much like a Gentleman, that he kept his Room, to himself, and would never consent to let any other Gentleman lay with him though he had been often importuned to do it by this Deponent, who had sometimes Customers who would have been glad to have lain with the Prisoner, but he would not suffer it.</p>
               <p>The Prosecutor being asked why he did not lay these Things to the Prisoner's Charge sooner, the Fact being committed in March last, and he not making it known till August, said, That he being unacquainted with the Ways of the Town, and being a Stranger to the Law on Such Occasions, he said nothing of it till he heard the Prisoner was taken up for an Offence of the like Nature: When he told the Landlord of the Guy Earl of Warwick, of the Indecencies the Prisoner had offered to him; who acquainted some of the Gentlemen with it that belong to the Reformation of Manners.

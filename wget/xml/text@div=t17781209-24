               <p>I am choachman to General Paoli. On the 25th of November as I was driving out of Stanhope-street into Park-lane, about eight o'clock, I saw a man coming on horseback into the street as we were going out of it. He had a handkerchief tied round his neck, and the cape of his coat up; we went down the lane; he came after us; he over-took the carriage, and presented a pistol to me; he told me to stop; I did not stop then; he rode on, and came to meet me, and told me again to stop; I did stop; he went to the coach door. I jumped off the box, and halloo'd out. I did not see whether he robbed my master or no; as soon as I halloo'd out, I heard him gallop away.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say he stopped you, who do you mean? - A man; I do not know who; it was a dark night. I cannot swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Was it near any lamps? - I cannot say it was near any lamps; it was dark in the lane.</p>
               <p>Wilson. He had this wig (producing it) over his hair when I took him.</p>
               <p>[There being no evidence to bring the charge home to the prisoner, he was not put upon his defence.]</p>

He called after the coachman to stop; there was a gentleman whose name is Garth with me in the coach. I believe the prisoner called twice before the coachman did stop; when the coach stopped; the prisoner came to the side of the coach, presented a pistol, and demanded my money.</p>
               <p>What did you give him? - I am uncertain as to the sum, but I gave him more than the indictment states. The other gentleman gave him his money first; when the prisoner had got the money, he wished us a good night, and rode off.</p>
               <p>What sort of a horse was he on? - I conceive it to be a kind of brown or bay; it was of the small size. He had his hat flapped down before, was dressed in a black coat, with a red waistcoat, and something round his neck. I suppose a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Had he his own hair? - I cannot speak to that; he had his hat on and flapped; I think he had his hair tied behind. I saw his face.</p>
               <p>How long might he stay with you? - I cannot tell; I suppose about three minutes.</p>
               <p>It was a dark night, as we heard from the witnesses on the other trial? - No; it was not a dark night; the moon shone bright, and the lamps were alight. I came from the Devizes; we had the benefit of the moon a great way.</p>
               <p>Upon the best and most serious recollection; do you take upon you to swear to the man? - I am certain to him, or I would not have come here. I came with great reluctance; I saw him at the Rotation-office, and knew him directly. I described him very particularly; he behaved exceedingly civil.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you lived with her Grace? A. Ten years; this equipage always goes to the Theatre with her; I never left any thing in a coach. I do not know Gray, a coachman. A napkin was once left in a coach, and brought back some months ago. The tray and silver candlesticks were in a table-cloth, with two pieces of wax-candle, and a knife; there were two other parcels in the coach, with tea things and refreshments; the coachman could not tell what was in them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you leave these things in the coach? A. No - the housemaid handed the parcel out to me, and I gave it to the porter, who (I am certain) put it within the hall; they were not missed till the morning. I saw them at Marlborough-street-office on the Tuesday after.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. About what time in the morning were they missed? A. About half-past ten o'clock; it was before Schofield came: the other parcels were taken down to the housekeeper's room. I went to Covent-garden to see if I could find the link-man, to see if he knew the coachman - I did not go to the office; we suspected the coachman had taken it.</p>

            . I am servant to the Dutchess. The page and I came from the Theatre in a coach; I did not observe the coachman's person. I gave the cloth, containing the tray and candlesticks, first out of the coach, to the page, who gave it to Webb, the porter - when I went in I saw it in the outer hall; I took another parcel out: the page and porter took out a basket which was too heavy for me. I am certain all three parcels were placed within the house. The coachman took his fare, and drove away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you were much enter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210075"></xptr>tained at the Theatre? A. Not much - I had seen the play before; it was late, and I went to bed soon after I came in- the plate was always taken down stairs by one of the servants; I took one parcel down, and the page another - I left the other standing in the hall, and left the porter fastening the door, and thought he would bring it down when he came.</p>
               <p>Q. If you left him fastening the hall, how could any body get it? A. The hall is divided - I left the page and porter standing there; the coachman went as soon as he had his money - I do not say the parcel was there when I went down; I passed it when I first came in, and did not see it afterwards; it was missed in the morning by the under-butler; we immediately suspected it was stolen, and sent to Covent-garden, to ascertain the number of the coach, intending to send to the Police-office. I never left anything in a coach - a napkin was once left, but not by me - it was brought back.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were these things left in the coach? A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whose duty was it to take care of them in your absence? A. Anybody about the house would bring them down; it being late at night they are generally put into the housekeeper's room - she locks them up till morning.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About half-past two o'clock in the morning I stopped the prisoner in Warren-street, Tottenham-court-road, with all this property, tied in a table-cloth; he was near the mews where he keeps his coach; I asked what he had got - he said, only a candlestick - he distinctly said, "A candlestick;" I felt the bundle, and as it contained more than one, I took him to the watch-house; in the way there he offered three or four times to give me the things to let him go - he halted several times, and at one of those times a candlestick fell on the ground; he begged me hard to let him go, and take the property, When he got to the watch-house he said he found them in his coach, but did not say who they belonged to; he said nothing about that before - I at first asked where he got them from, and he said he could not tell; he never told me who they belonged to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not know he was in Thurston's service? A. No - Thurston has lived there eight or nine years; I do not know him to be a respectable man. I have since heard that the prisoner lives in Warren-street; I believe Warren-street is nearer to Stratton-street than the stables are; I think he must pass his own house to go from Stratton-street to the stables. I expect no reward in this case.</p>

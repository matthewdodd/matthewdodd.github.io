            , put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, and he pulled out his silk handkerchief. He took his hat off and put it into his hat. I catched hold of his collar and told him to give the gentleman his handkerchief I told the gentleman that he had his pocket picked of a handkerchief, and to convince the gentleman I took the prisoner's hat off, and the handkerchief was in it. The gentleman desired me to seek for an officer. I could not find any. I took the prisoner to Guildhall; there the gentleman swore to his handkerchief. I have never seen the gentleman since. I saw the prisoner take it out of the gentleman's pocket, I am sure of that.</p>

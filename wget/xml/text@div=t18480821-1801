                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, and live at 27, Lawrence Pountney-lane. On the evening of 6th July, I was waiting at the corner of Nag's Head-court—the prisoner came up and accosted me—I pushed her away—she came again, and 1 pushed her away still harder—she came a third time, and laid hold of me by the waist—I pushed her again, and took up my coat, and was going to strike her—she went away down Nag's Head-court, and a start man came up and looked in my face—lie said, "I beg your pardon, I '"ought you were a friend of mine"—I found my watch was gone, and one chain, the other chain was hanging down—I ran after the prisoner, and as I went I found the other chain drop, but I ran on after the prisoner, the policeman came and took her—he put his light down, and my watch was behind her—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

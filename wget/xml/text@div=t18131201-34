               <p>Q. You say the sum the amount of meal was then 722 l. 10 s. 8 d. then there is the addition of 10 l. 3 s. to the 722 l. 10 s. 8 d. - A. Just so, sir. I sent the bill to Mr. Kingsford on the same day I received it at the Victualling office and in the same state I received it.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do with the bill - A. I took the bill home to my residence at Wandsworth, there it laid until the 17th of May, and then having occasion to go to town on the 17th, I took it to the bankers Messrs. Perrin; I endorsed it before I took it them.</p>

            . I am a bill broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Cast your eye upon that Victualling bill, and tell me whether you discounted that bill - A. I believe we did, I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. For whom did you discount that bill - A. For Barber and sons; the principal sum carried out in that bill is 731 l. 17 s. 5 d. We discounted it for Barber and sons, on the 1st of July.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it - A. I brought it to the accompting-house, perhaps I gave it into the hands of my partner, or laid it on the desk, or gave it into the clerk, or partner, Mr. Brind, and from the statement of our books it went into the hands of Mr. May, or his clerk. The entry in my book is the hand writing of my partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know personally what became of it afterwards - A. No further than appears in my books.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you see Mr. May afterwards - A. Certainly not</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him upon the circumstance of that bill - A. To the best of my recollection I believe not, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scarlet. Were yours the hand that received it from Barbers - A. Yes, it was paid into my hands; I brought it home to my accompting-house, and laid it on the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. But you made no entry upon it - A. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the constent practice of bill brokers to enter the bill in the book on the same day - A. The entry does not take place on the same day perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you always enter them in your books - A. Not always enter very bill in the book that we discount.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you received this bill of Barbers, were there any other money or other bills to the amount of 14,000 l. at the time with this; is it your course to give a bankers check or bank notes - A. We pay over money to the amount of 10,000 l. without making any entry; in a large concern we pay in one payment for the whole.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. When you do not enter them at the moment, what means do you adopt to know; what I want to know is when you make a payment of 10,000 l. how do you know whether you receive more or less, there must be some period when some gentleman must want to know how he stands - A. We can tell, we make our arrangements in the evening or the next morning; we take paper memorandums in our pocket-book at the bankers desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Cast your eye upon that, tell me whether that produced you 1700 or 700 - A. I obtained for it 731, I have do doubt about it whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was passed away what did it produce to your house - A. Only the sum that we had given for it, that I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. So though it is not carried into your ledger you have documents that you are able to ascertain the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010033"></xptr>the fact, and if a 1000 l. had been paid over, you would be able to ascertain the fact - A. Certainly, the same evening or the next morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. With respect to that particular bill, you have no doubt you received it for 730 l. odd - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that from a recollection of your own or from any memorandum - A. By the entry in our books. I have no personal recollection of the bill.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BRIND. I am in partnership with the last witness, Mr. Usher.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the persons that transact your concerns in your accompting-house - A. Ourselves, and the clerk, Mr. Nicolls.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to your entry in your book respecting this bill, what is the first entry you have - A. A bill entered 731 l. 17 s. 5 d. This is the Bill book; on the 1st of July it was entered. That bill came into our house on the 1st of July; it was brought into the office from Messrs. Barker and son.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the sum - A.731 l. 17 s. 5 d. after deducting the property tax.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that bill afterwards - A. That bill went from our office to Mr. May's office. It is very probable it went from our office by me; I have not the least doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. While it remained in your office, and before it went to Mr. May, was any alteration made in it - A. Certainly not. It went from our office on the 1st of July. We have an entry of it going from the house in another book. This entry is made by the clerk; he is here.</p>
               <p>COURT. The first transaction of it coming into your house is entered by you - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that bill produce to your house any larger sum than that which was on it - A. Certainly not; it went forth for 731 l. 17 s. 5 d. That is the original value deducting the property tax.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it passed from you as a single bill - A. It went out of the house with other bills; it came in with other bills.</p>
               <p>Q. And went from you with other bills - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the person that took that bill out - A. I did; I took it to Mr. May's office, and left them there.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. May a clerk - A. Yes; he transacts business in Mr. May's absence; he receives all bills that are brought into the office to discount.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he fills up drafts for money - A. I cannot remember.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether he did or no - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Did you ever see a single instance of his drawing any - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. With whom did you transact this particular business of this particular bill - A. I positively cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever transact with the clerk any discount to so large an amount as this transaction - A. Yes; I have left bills frequently with Mr. May's clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. All clerks do receive something for the master's consideration, and when the master comes home he gives instructions - A. Exactly so. 5,401 l. 15 s. 4 d. that is the amount of the whole of that bundle of bills.</p>
               <p>COURT. The whole of that part in which this bill was included -</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. It is so, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the number of the bills - A. Nine bills. They were all Government bills; I got the sum total by 700 l. and odd, not by 1700 l. and odd.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose 1700 l. to have been paid upon the footing of this instead of 700, must not you have seen that an error, and that you were overpaid a 1000 - A. Undoubtedly; a 1000 l. paid over is easily detected upon this occasion; I am certain I received no more than seven. We received cash.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other transaction with the prisoner that day when you in your return received the discount of the 5,401 l. 15 s. 4 d. - A. The principal eight were a Treasury bill of 100 l. 520 l. and one of 700 l. a Victualling bill 749 l. 2 s. 4 d. and 732 l. that is the bill in question.</p>
               <p>COURT. Can you say from your own recollection whether you had any personal communication with May - A. I cannot say whether I had or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. You say if the principal is not at home you would leave them with his clerk, if Mr. May would discount the bills he might leave a draft to discount them with the clerk - A. Yes, or by sending cash.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NICOLL. I am a clerk to the two last gentlemen. I find an entry to the amount of 5,401 l. 15 s. 4 d. That is the going out of them; they went to Mr. May; they were to return the cash to the amount of 5,401 l. 15 s. 4 d.</p>
               <p>Q. If a 1000 more had been returned should you have known that - A. We certainly should.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner coming to your house in July last - A. I do, the 3rd of July.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the day was it - A. I rather think it was late, it being the last entry in our Bill book; that circumstance strikes me that it was late.</p>
               <p>Q. When does your business close in the day - A.We generally leave the office about half after four, but leave a person until five, in case any body should come. It was between three and four he applied to discount a Navy or Victualling bill for 1731 l. 17 s. 5 d. due on the 3rd of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the amount of the bill when he applied to you for the discount - A. I cannot say; he produced the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bill, and tell me whether that is the bill - A. This bill agrees with the bill in my book except I have entered it Navy; it appears to be a Victualling bill; they are known in the market by the name of Navy bills; they are drawn by the Victualling office upon the Treasurer of the Navy. Upon his applying to get the discount; I answered we would try to get it done.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out to get it discounted - A. I myself carried it to Bruce, Simson, and Company,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010034"></xptr>Bartholomew-lane, bankers; that is but a short distance from our place of business.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be absent - A. I should suppose not ten minutes. I returned and said, that I had got the promise to have the money for the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner May - A. I cannot say whether he was in the office when I came back; it was communicated to him that we had the promise. I brought the bill back to make a ticket of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. You did not part with the bill - A. Only for my clerk to enter it; my clerk having entered it, I myself went to the house of Bruce and Company, and got the money; I received 1,724 l. 10 s. 4 d. that is the money by allowing all the discounts, which is seven guineas and a penny; I returned with the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner - A. I did see him, whether he was waiting or came in afterwards I cannot say; I can say I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver him the amount of the money you had received - A. That I cannot say, whether my partner or my clerk gave it him, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you bring back the amount deducting the discount - A. Yes, in bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner request any loan in addition to the discount of this bill - A. He did of 600 l. We agreed to make him that; the loan was made to him in addition to the produce of this bill; the total sum was paid by a draft.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of the draft - A.2,321 l. 15 s. 11 d. That was a draft upon our bankers, Down, Thornton, and Freen.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us the figures of the principal sum making that sum that you have mentioned - A.11 s. 2 d. that Mr. May was debitted in an old balance, the 1st of July: then there is the discount of the bill 7 l. 7 s. 1 d. discount of commission 2 l. 3 s. 3 d. making total 10 l. 1 s. 6 d. that taking of the Navy bill 1,731 l. 17 s. 5 d. deducting the 10 l. 1 s. 6 d. leaves 1,721 l. 15 s. 11 d. advance 600 l. making the total 2,321 l. 15 s. 11 d. The check has been paid.</p>
               <p>Q. For the loan that you made the prisoner, did he lodge any security with you - A. I have not the least doubt he did. That is the check.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear of your own knowledge that the prisoner was present in the office and received the check - A. I can say I know it was delivered to him in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the clerk of the prisoner - A. I have no recollection of knowing him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him - A. I knew him about the month of August following; I cannot recollect whether I knew him at that time or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come to your office to ask for the discount - A. He came to our office to ask it to be discounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the person he applied to - A. I should think so, because I was the person that went out to get it discounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you first saw him - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And that he brought the bill when first he came - A. Yes, and brought the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Now recollect, was not the first application made to you whether you could discount a Navy bill - A. To the best of my recollection he produced the bill at the time; I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do swear that the bill came as the application - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was, positively, that is a matter you cannot be mistaken - A. I have not the least doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be from the time that you first went out to enquire about this bill, and your return to the office - A. I conjecture about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not in your habit to be going to different bankers in the way of your business - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in this transaction to fix this transaction in your memory more than the others - A. The circumstance that makes me conclude it was late, it was the last entry in the Bill book. I don't know any particular reason but that.</p>
               <p>Q. Except that circumstance that you perceived this the last entry in the Bill book, you would not have known whether it was eleven in the morning or three in the afternoon - A. That I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Lathy was a person in whom the prisoner had implicit confidence - A. He was the person that frequently brought the books; he as frequently brought cash as Mr. May, and probably more so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Lathy lately - A. No, I do not know what has become of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the sum 1700 in the margin, do you know the fashion of that one - A. I do not know 1731 at the top of the bill is Lathy's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. The sum of 1700 and odd pounds you have no doubt is Lathy's writing - A. I have no doubt whatever of it.</p>

               <p>Q. There are four; take it in your hand again; the first sum I at the top upon which you have been speaking upon, which a figure I stands before I in the margin, by the pounds, shillings, and pence, do you believe that to be Lathy's writing - A. I think it is the same hand writing as the top.</p>

               <p>Q. If he had signed the name of May would you have paid it - A. Certainly not. All that he did was writing the name and the sum.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him do any more - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you acquainted with the prisoner's hand writing - A. Certainly.</p>

I want to know whether the I in the margin before the 732, and the figure I in the lower part of the break before 724, and the figure I before 732. are them fingers of the prisoner's hand writing - A. I believe they are not, so far as any body can be a judge of a person's hand writing they are not.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it carried by the Bank into the Navy office for payment - A. It was.</p>
               <p>MR. TWEEDY. I am cashier in the Navy office, in the Victualling department.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bill paid to you by the Bank of England - A. It was; that bill was one of a number of bills amounting to 14,600 l. It was represented as a bill of 1700 l.</p>

               <p>Q. In the hurry of business I believe the practice has been to look at the figures only - A. The bill was detected in our office after the payment took place.</p>
               <p>Q. If the practice has been to look at the figures only, a I might be put in without your detecting it - A. Certainly; generally we look at the body.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your lordship, gentlemen of the Jury, it is not in my power to address you by my counsel.

When the whole case is gone through, the decision will be left for your consideration. Gentlemen, my life is in your hands, and what is dearer to me than life. Gentlemen, I am of respectable parents; I received a good education in this great metropolis; I have carried on the business of a broker a great many years with credit to myself, and up to this hour I have maintained a character void of offence. I have lived in the bosom of my family; in the society of a most affectionate wife and my children have I spent my evenings after the business was over. I mention not these circumstances that they can clear me of the charges, but I mention these circumstances to shew the improbability, and I think I might add, the impossibility of a man so acting to be guilty of an act to forfeit his life and character, and to bring distress upon his family. I will now proceed to the subject under your consideration: the indictment charges me with having forged the instrument, or of having altered it, and what is indeed the very essence of the crime that I did it with intention to defraud his Majesty, and the Treasurer of his Majesty's Navy. That the hand-writing that was made there is mine, not a tittle of proof has been adduced, and I feel boldly assured that I must be acquitted. The next charge is, that I uttered it knowing it to be forged. Gentlemen, that transaction was conducted principally by my clerk. In that clerk, I reposed the utmost confidence. I was daily in the habit of leaving blank bills signed, for him to fill up.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010037"></xptr>He had the entire management of my banker's credit, and by the clerk was all the bill business transacted. Gentlemen, upon such evidence as this, the most respectable merchant might be placed at this bar. Some few years since, Mr. Weston was placed at this bar; his clerk availed himself of the confidence of his master; he forged a power of attorney upon General

            , whose dividends Mr. Cohen, the army agent, was in the habit of receiving. I have not been able to procure the attendance of my clerk; he is beyond my reach. It would be idle to detain you by stating circumstances upon which I cannot procure any legal proof. There is no evidence beyond presumptive evidence of the forgery, and whatever there is further necessary for me the learned judge will point out to you. The learned Attorney-General has done no more than his duty, and I believe I may say, after he has done his painful duty he will rejoice in my acquittal. If there is a doubt in the case the learned judge will tell you to give me the benefit of that doubt. Gentlemen, God be with you and direct you.</p>

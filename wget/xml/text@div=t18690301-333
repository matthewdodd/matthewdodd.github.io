                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Grimsay, as wholesale trimming manufacturers, at Bethnal Green—Genower came into our employment in January, 1868—I did not know him before that—we have been aware since last June that we were losing property—we missed some bobbins upon which silk is wound—they are stamped with our initials by a metal stamp—these are our bobbins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—some of them have had the mark effaced, but we put them in water, and the wood swelled up, and now you can see the initials risen up—we do not sell them with silk on them,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186903010019"></xptr>
               <p>we send them out to people who work for us off our premises; they are weighed out to them—Mrs. Penn worked for us once, and now does so again, but I believe she did not work for us between Midsummer and Genower being taken in custody—we also missed other property—this China silk (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was sent to us to be dyed—this brown silk is the same description as some we lost—this black purse twist is ours, we have had it three years—this fringe was made in our engine-room—these boards are the same class of goods as we lost—four knots of China silk which had been sent to be dyed were found in a drawer, and I had a conversation with Genower with reference to them—he made a statement to me—I applied to the police, got a warrant, and went with an officer to Walker's house, 250, Bethnal Green Road; there are eight rooms, I think—there is no shop, but "Walker, trimming manufacturer," is put up—on entering we saw Walker, and the officer said that we had a warrant to search his premises to see if there was any property of Kerr &amp; Grimsay's there—he seemed to know my name, and to know me—he said, "There is none belonging to them here, you are welcome to look round my place"—I said, "It's no use you saying that, because you bought some brown silk on Friday last from Genower"—he said, "Oh, I know now who you mean," and produced this box with this green silk, and the twist, and these beads, and said, "These are the things I bought of Genower"—I had only spoken to him in reference to the brown silk—we searched the place, and in a bin for keeping bobbins, in the same room, we found 417 bobbins—I examined them, and said, "Our marks have been erased"—Walker said nothing to that—he was then taken in custody—I saw a lad named Watts on Monday last, but did not recognize him as having seen him at our warehouse—we do not sell bobbins at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you sell the silk, do not you sell the bobbins? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; we sell the manufactured goods—we bought the business of Thomas Kelsey, he had the same stamp as we use—the bobbins are worth 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, if bought in a lot—nothing would be easier, if they contained stolen silk, than to destroy them immediately afterwards—some are stamped at both ends, and some not—I know that Genower has been in business for himself—I did not know anything of him before he was introduced by my partner, but have since ascertained that he had been in business previously, with a partner named Thomas, I believe—I believe Walker said that he had them of Genower, Thomas's partner, as part of their surplus stock—I attend personally to my business, but there are some parts of it that I cannot attend to—I have not bought any goods of Genower, and, as far as I know, our house has not—when we took Kelsey's business, we continued using his bobbins, and the stamp he had in his business—he had been in business a good while—I cannot say how long he used the stamp—a good many of the bobbins have been in existence a good while—they very seldom get mixed with other people's bobbins when they are given out to wind; you might get one bobbin among others, but not generally—it will astonish me if the prisoner proves that he has had these particular bobbins two years—we have had Kelsey's business three ears—I cannot say whether Walker said "Yes," when I said "You bought some bobbins of silk of him on Friday last"—these are not chiefly remnants, this is part of a parcel of silk which came in from the dyer's—these others are the goods which I said before the Magistrate were not of much value, and chiefly remnants—this China silk was not found on Walker's premises; these are the goods found there, and the beads—the beads are like ours, and Walker produced them; and said</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk spinner, of 21, Coventry Street, Bethnal Green, and have worked for Walker four or five years—these white bobbins were marked by me—they have been in Walker's possession and use over two years—some of them have my mark—I have had them in my hands some hundreds of times—I have taken the silk off them and spun it on the wheel, and I have marked these very bobbins to know the weight—this one is 1oz. 2 drachms—they are bought new of bobbin turners, but you can buy old bobbins—the loom brokers sell old looms and old bobbins—I have seen Genower come to my master's place—he walked in with some bombast, and I thought he was a sort of trimming manufacturer—from what I saw of him I should have had no hesitation whatever in buying of him</p>

I am a porter, of 88, Cooper Street—I was in Walker's employ from December, 1867, to the beginning of 1868, and was employed to make twist—I have seen a great quantity of bobbins there, with a great many initials, some with "J &amp; S" in the corner—I have bought both old and new ones for him from a loom broker—I cannot say that they all had the same mark on them—I did not buy all that the broker had.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understand you had very small transactions with Genower? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very small—I knew that he was a servant of Kerr &amp; Grimsay—I did not go to the premises to get the goods, they were brought to me by Genower—on the first occasion, when I bought a bunch of crystal beads, he said that they belonged to a friend of his who had over-bought himself, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that bunch—there were three transac<lb></lb>tions—the second was some leaves, which he represented were made by his wife in anticipation of an order which was stopped, and she required some money, one Saturday night—the third transaction was a small quantity of black spikes, which came to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he said, again, belonged to a friend who had over-bought himself, but I have never been able to realize the price for them—these facts were known to my solicitor—I believe he made a statement to the solicitor for the prosecution, and I signed this undertaking (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have never seen Genower at the place of business, but I knew he was in Kerr &amp; Grimsay's employment—I never had any<lb></lb>thing but manufactured articles from him—I cannot tell you whose writing is in this book; I had nothing to do with keeping it—I received a subpoena to produce it—some twelve months ago, or more, when Genower was in business in Globe Street, I supplied him with trimmings and ornaments—he got into my debt 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and came to me and said he should never be able to repay me, but if I would go to his place, and select anything I liked, we could take it off his account, and he left the book with me at that time—he was in difficulties fifteen months ago, but I never was aware that he was bankrupt</p>

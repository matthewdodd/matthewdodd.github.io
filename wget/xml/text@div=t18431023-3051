                  </hi>. I am a horse-hair manufacturer, and live in Banner-street, St. Luke's. Fletcher and George Meadows worked in my factory—I rent a place in Golden-lane, where the hair was taken from—on the 16th of Oct. I received a letter—in consequence of that I conferred with the police—the next day I saw a bag containing some hair—it had been taken from Golden-lane—Richard Meadows had a right on the premises at Golden-lane—Fletcher had no business there whatever—I had ordered my foreman on Tuesday morning to let George take this hair to Golden-lane, to have it carded by a steam-press I have there, and to bring it back—he had no right to dispose of it.</p>

In consequence of directions from the prosecutor, I went on Tuesday, the 14th of Oct., to a court leading into Golden-lane, where I could watch the entrance leading into the factory—I saw Fletcher standing at the corner of Arthur-street-leading to the prosecutor's factory—I pointed him out to Cole—he had no appearance of bulk about him—he went towards the factory—in three-quarters of an hour he came from the entrance of the court—there was no thoroughfare, so that he must have come from the factory—he had a bag nearly full—he passed me with it in Play-house-yard—I watched outside a public-house—he went in, and Redman followed George and Fletcher into the house—I had seen George three or four times before Fletcher went into the house—(I had first seen George com<lb></lb>ing from the prosecutor's residence in Banner-street, about 300 yards off—he went to the factory)—they staid in the public-house three or four minutes—Redman came out before them—George came towards me, and went towards the City, and I followed Fletcher with Redman—he turned round in Chis well-street, saw me, and went into a public-house—I followed, told him I belonged to the police, and wanted to know where he got this hair—he said, "I bought it in the Curtain-road"—I said, "How came you this way from the Curtain-road?"—he said, "Oh, this I bought in Smithfield"—I said, "Which way did you come?"—he said, "Through Long-lane and Barbican"—I asked if he had called anywhere—he at first said no—I asked if he did not call on some one in Golden-lane—he said, "Yes, I did"—I found this hair in the bag.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, H</hi> 24). I am specially stationed at the London Docks—on Sunday night, 20th June, about half-past 12 o'clock, I was on duty there, and saw a light on board the <hi rend="italic">Stadts Utrecht</hi>—the ship <hi rend="italic">Ellen</hi> was alongside the quay—I went back to the jetty, and got the assist<lb></lb>ance of Savage—we went on board the <hi rend="italic">Ellen</hi>, and then on board the <hi rend="italic">Stadts Utrecht</hi>, and saw two men on deck, who appeared to be tipsy—I said, "You have got a light in the forecastle"—one of them called out something, which I could not understand, and the light was instantly extinguished—I was in my uniform great coat—I went into the forecastle, and found several men smoking—I saw an open oil-lamp, which appeared to have been just extin<lb></lb>guished—it was warm—I told them they must not light that light again, as it was not allowed—a number of them began to clap their hands, and came close round me, shouting—I could not understand what they said—I saw the prisoner among them—I made my way to the steps, to get on deck—I turned my light on them, and began to ascend the ladder—as I was ascending, somebody gave me a blow on the back—Savage was behind me, ascending—I saw somebody below moving the ladder backwards and forwards—I caught hold of Savage by the hands, and pulled him on deck—I went towards the captain's cabin, and the prisoner came after me, and said, in English, "Where are you going to?"—he spoke very good English—I told him I was going to see the captain—he said, "You cannot see the captain, you shall not see the captain," and put one hand on my arm, and the other on the back of my neck; and two men, whom I did not know, in the dark, pushed me towards the side of the vessel, where the steps are near, where the plank was that fastens one vessel to the other—I laid hold of the bulwarks in struggling with them—the prisoner stooped down, and laid hold of my legs, and threw me over the side of the vessel, and in going over the side I got hold of a chain, so that I did not fall into the water—the depth of the water there is about twenty-two feet—I hung there for about a minute, and got on to the ship's channel, and on to the top of the plank, then got on to the <hi rend="italic">Ellen</hi>, and then on to the quay—if I had not been able to catch hold of the bulwarks, I should have fallen legs foremost—when I got on board the <hi rend="italic">Ellen</hi>, the prisoner and two more men, and another man who was afterwards drowned, were on board along with Savage—the prisoner had gone there while I was hanging on the side—when I got on board, the man who was drowned was striking Savage on the breast—White and two Thames policemen came up, and I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Stadts Utrecht</hi> again, went down the ladder, and several of the men sur<lb></lb>rounded me—one man loosened the guide rope—some one caught hold of my arm—I turned round, and found it was the prisoner—the guide rope is what you lean on as a banister to guide you from one ship to another—the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>

I accompanied my sergeant on board the <hi rend="italic">Stadts Utrecht</hi>—I have been in Court during his examination, and have heard the statement he has made—it is true—I went down with him into the forecastle to remonstrate about the light—I did not see the light, but I felt the lamp, and saw it smoking—the sergeant went against the companion, and I followed him—as he came up I saw him get a blow from somebody, I cannot say who—as I was going up somebody tried to remove the ladder from under my feet, which would have thrown me down—I was raised up and saw the sergeant going towards the captain's cabin—the prisoner stopped him, and said, "No, go to see captain;" he prevented him from going, took him by the neck, and pushed him over the side of the vessel—the depth of water there is twenty-two feet—the <hi rend="italic">Stadts Utrecht</hi> draws from twelve to fourteen feet—a person in still water would be in more danger than in moving water—I did not see how the sergeant saved himself, as I was forced into the <hi rend="italic">Ellen</hi>—he came on board the <hi rend="italic">Ellen</hi>—I was assaulted there—I tried to take them, but they retreated into the ship—I was assaulted by the man who was after<lb></lb>wards drowned—I had attempted to take him into custody—they were very tipsy, and the prisoner also—the sergeant went ashore for further assistance—the deceased man, who was crossing the plank with two others, went to take bold of the rope—it was slackened, and he fell into the water, and was drowned.</p>

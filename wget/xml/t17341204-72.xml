They both lay together in a Room, up three Pair of Stairs: My Mother lay in another Room on the same Floor. On the 27th of October my House was broke and robb'd in the Night: I don't know who did it; but we were alarmed by Thursby. She goes first to my Mother, lays her Hand on her Face and wakes her, and tells her there were three Rogues in the House; but desires her not to come out of her Room for fear the Rogues should murder her. Then she goes to the Window and calls out Thieves. The Noise waked me. I got up, and taking the Key of the Door with me, went down Stairs, I found all my Doors and Windows fast, except the Parlor Window, and that was open. The Sash was thrown up, and the two Alarm-Bells were taken and laid down upon the Table. The Drawers were open. The Goods in the Indictment were taken away; besides which, there was a Petticoat dropt, and a Gown half in and half out. Thursby told me that as she was a-bed with Brown she was waked by the Noise of her own Trunk being broke open, and then saw three Men, one in Grey, one in Olive, and one in Black: That two of them had Masks, and the other had a black Crape over his Face, and a long Knife in his Hand, that he threatned to cut their Throats if they did not lye still; that he plunder'd her Trunk, took out her Cloths and a Purse of Money which he chink'd in his Hand, and then they tyed up her Clothes in a Table-Cloth and went away - I called in a Constable: he said. This must be done by your own Servants. I said, I believed my Men to be very honest, and had no suspicion of

At first, she said she had pawn'd no Clothes, but afterwards own'd that those were hers. She was carried before the Justice again the next Day; but as we could prove nothing upon her, he bid her go home again, and not fly from me, for if she did he told her it would be an Argument of Guilt. But notwithstanding this, she left my House and I went next Day to enquire for her at a House in Wapping, where her Mother-in-Law lives: Her Mother-in-Law told me that she had been a Thief to her -</p>

She brought these Men's Shoes and Stockings and desired to get her a Suit of Men's Apparel, and procure her a Passage to Jamaica with some Captain that would take her as his Boy. She seem'd to be under a great Concern; but being so well drest I said to her, Mrs. Collet, (for that was her first Husband's Name) the Times are well mended. She answered, But indifferent. Are ye out of Service says I. Aye says she, I have left my Master these three Weeks, tho' it seems she had then been come away but one Day; And she told me that Captain Towers had given her a Suit of Cloaths, and a Fan and five Guineas.</p>

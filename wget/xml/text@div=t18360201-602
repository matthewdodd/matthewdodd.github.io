                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I live at No. 17, Cherry-garden-street, Bermondsey, Surrey, nest door to the house occupied by the prisoner. I do not known whether she is married—on the 28th of January, about eleven o'clock, heard a noise outside in the street—I was just at break fast—I opened the front door—an alarm of fire was given by the neighbourhood, saying the next house to me was on fire—I stepped out into the street, and perceived in the first-floor window the bed-curtains on fire—I instantly went to the front shop door, and gave three or four knocks, but could gain no admittance—I then attempted to burst the door in, and the by-standers said I could get in the back way—I instantly went to the back, and got admittance there, the door being open—on going up-stairs I met the prisoner on the middle of the stairs, coming down from the first floor—I passed her and proceeded to the room I had seen on fire in the street, which was the first floor—when I got there I found the door locked and the key taken out—I instantly burst the door in—in doing so I found the room full of smoke—I saw in one part of the room a bed all on fire—the feather-bed and bedding were on fire, and the bed-curtains also—it was a four-post tent-bedstead—there was a fire in the fire-place of the room—I pulled the bed-things off and rolled them up—the next witness came in with a pail of water, and assisted me—I opened the window, and threw some of things into the street—by that time the room began, to become also—the sheet on a horse before the fire, on fire, and about half burnt—it was still burning—I pulled it off, rolled it up, and threw it out of window also—the next witness (<hi rend="italic">policeman No.</hi> 65) came in and assisted me in putting out various places in the wainscoating which were on fire, and the bedstead, which was on fire—it was not in a blaze—he assisted me in a putting out the wainscoating was close to the bed—the head of the bed was pushed right in the corner to the wainscoat—there was a great heat in the room when I first entered—the room is about fourteen feet in length—I saw lines reach<lb></lb>ing</p>

               <p>from different places in the room and wet linen hanging on them—they reached from the fire-place across the room in two or three different places—I do not know that the prisoner takes in washing—she said she had washed these the day before—I left my brother constable in possession of the places while I went for my inspector, and met him coming towards the house—the wainscoat and the window-frame were on fire—they were in a burning state—quite charcoal—that might be done by the heat of the room, other things being on fire—several places were so, and other places were completely burnt—I saw a quantity of tinder under the frame, the remains of something that was burnt—the house belongs to Mr. Slight—I believe the prisoner occupies the whole house, but lets out different parts to lodgers.</p>

The hen roost was in a fenced yard, and the fence between nine and ten feet high. The next morning. I went to milk my cows, at about three o'clock, and the yard pale was open. I did not miss any fowls until I saw them at the watchhouse, which was between six and seven in the morning; there were eight hens, value eight shillings, and two cocks, value six shillings. I knew them immediately to be mine, for I had been in the habit of feeding them.</p>

            . I am a watchman, and having left my beat on the morning of the 20th of August, I was going home, at about half past five; I saw the prisoner with a basket on his back, standing still. I turned back, and he ran away, which made me suspect. I over took him in Church-lane; he drew back, and struck me over the arm. In the basket, I found ten fowls, which Spring claimed at the watchhouse.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes; he and I went to Hudson and Gordon's brewhouse on the 3d of December, about twelve o'clock at night, and staid about there till one; when we unlocked the wicket door with this key, which we took with us; then we went to the accompting-house door, which we unlocked also; we got a light from a bottle of phosphorus, with a match, and looked about us; this key opened the iron cupboard, from which we took a quantity of bank-notes, and several other papers; then we broke open the desks with this thing, (a large screw-driver,) and took out some bad money and a one-pound bank-note; there was a bad dollar, bad shillings, and bad six-pences; and a quantity of halfpence; we took out of a drawer some shares of tickets, and a quantity of notes; also two checks.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that one? (Shewing a check.) - A. Yes, it is; I took this, and the twenty-five, the twenty, the fifteen, the five, and a great quantity of one and two pound notes; this is the fifteen pound note which I gave to my wife; I live at No. 8, King-street, Mile-End New-Town; I do not know the other notes; when we had taken them out of the iron safe, we slammed the door, locked the accompting-house door, and came through the wicket into the street; we then went to Bow-fair Field, where we left the thing like a weather-glass, which we brought out of the accompting-house, and went and committed another robbery. I had the fifteen pound note, and some of the ones, and the check; and Warren had the twenty pound note, and some of the ones; after that, we went to Warren's house first, and then he went to mine, where we parted the things, as well as we could, in the morning, and then he went home; this check I told him I could get money for, and the other too; he fet off to Bow to inquire about the robbery, and if any body was coming after us, and was to meet me; I went to the end of Gracechurch-street, where I met a man, and asked him if he knew where that check was payable, he said he did; I did not know, but I asked him to go for it, and I waited at the door; it was a few minutes before nine, and he stopped some time; I went in and asked for change for a five pound note, they said I had come too soon, and the man said he was waiting for his money; I went out, and in a few minutes he came out, and gave me a twenty pound note, and the rest in money; this is the gentleman who said it was too soon,(Mr. Churchyard); I gave the man two shillings, and he left me. I then met Warren, who said, there was a great disturbance at Bow about the robbery; I gave him the twenty pound note I received for the check, and we then went to my house, this was about ten o'clock, he said he would go and get small notes for it; I told him he had better not, but he said he would go to the Bank of England, and he went away, and I never saw him again till I saw him at Whitechapel Office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Nobody else accompanied you but the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You kept the check, and employed a man to take it to the banking-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is just as true as that you don't know the man at all? - A. He was a staranger to me; when I went into the banking-house, he said he was waiting for the money, not for his money.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell him you stole it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180201130040"></xptr>Q. May I ask, is your own son in London at present? - A. I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not the officers been looking for him? - A. I don't know, I heard they have been at his house; I have been a prisoner myself ever since I resigned myself up on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not your son the person who went to the banker's? - A. No; my son is about my size, or a little taller, with hair rather lighter than mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you were a witness here before? - A. About twelve months, on the trial of one Woolridge, about Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Q. As a voluntary witness, to save your own life? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn evidence against any other man for forging Bank notes at any time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been tried here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Or any where else? - A. Yes, at Stafford.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Mr. Neville.) Q. Look at the fifteen pound note, and the twenty pound note; do you know them? - A. They correspond with the numbers in my book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I submit, that this being a place at some distance from the dwellings of the two partners, and not communicating with either, it is impossible to call it their dwelling, because, though there might be a pretence for saying it was the dwelling of the two if they live together, yet, in as much as they live in two separate houses, it is impossible that it can be considered as the dwelling of both; it must be shewn; taking it that they both lived in one dwelling, that it would then constitute a felony; I know it has been considered that our houses might be taken as dwellings, but there is a case where an out-house, separated only eight yards from the principal dwelling, was not considered as a house in which a burglary could be committed; that case is in Ist Hawkins, 219; here the evidence stated, is, that the brewery is upwards of one hundred yards from the dwellings which the partners occupy, which is a much greater distance than that stated in that case; the proof is, that they occupy two several houses, and the out-house is charged as being a part of the joint occupation of both; I therefore contend the indictment cannot be sustained, but it is not proved to be the fact.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not stated to be a part of the dwelling, but is charged to be a burglary on the ground of it being an out-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. My Lord, it is also stated to be out of the parish of St. Mary-lc-Bow.</p>
               <p>Court. I am not aware of any thing to induce me to say that an out-house is a place in which a burglary cannot be committed; the case which you cite, was a case in which it could not be connected with the dwelling-house; in this case, though it has not been distinctly proved to be a part of the partners' dwelling, yet it is a part of their premises; if you mean to say there was a distinction between the accompting-house and the other part, the answer is, it is connected with the place where the man slept, by a continuation of building. However, if upon further consideration you think there is any thing to be made of it hereafter, the prisoner shall have the advantage of it.</p>
               <p>JAMES BILLINGS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the premises of Messrs. Hudson and Gordon, and if so, describe them? - A. I begin with the accompting-house that was broke open next the street, from which we go to the marsh run on the stage, next it a store-house, and a passage from one accompting-house to the other, all under one continued roof; there is a ready communication without any interruption whatever.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am quite innocent of the robbery: Pritchard came on Friday morning to my house with a bundle, containing a red waistcoat, and writing paper, my wife said the waistcoat was too big for me; he said it could be altered, and then he sent for some gin, and took me to his house; he said his son was waiting at the new pump by the Bank; I went with him, and we met his son, who took the check to the banker's? he bought a fowl, and told me to take it to his house, and says he, you shall have a bit of fowl, and a drop of wine after dinner; then he asked me if I would go and get change for a twenty pound note; I said, yes, and went and asked for it; they told me the note was stopped, and asked me who I had it of; I said a man, who was to give me something for my trouble. He wanted to bring me in about two months ago, as he has now, when he gave me a Norwich bank-note, and I went to the White-horse in Fetter-lane for change; they told me it was stole a twelvemonth before; I might have been stopped there as well as for this; Combes knows Pritchard put the things in the privy himself. I have been a man that have always got my living by the sweat of my brow, and he never did in his life.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18020113-52-verdict280" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a shopman in the employ of John Griffith, a pawnbroker. I have known the prisoner about two months, and hare frequently seen her at our shop pledging and redeeming articles—on the 30th of January, about four o'clock, I missed a dark olive-green lady's cloth cloak from the outside of the shop—it hung in front of the window for sale—I had hung it up myself about eleven o'clock, and had not seen it after that—I did not see the prisoner at the shop that day—I saw the cloak afterwards at the office, on the 16th of February, in possession of North, who is in Mr. Blackburn's employ.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Blackburn, a pawn<lb></lb>broker.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before the cloak was lost on the 30th of January, had there been any string missing, and another put on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why say you know it by the string having been sewn on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has been re-sewn since it was made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But before you lost it from your shop, what had you ob<lb></lb>served about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I observed the cloak altogether—the lining inside, and the string has the general appearance of the same string—there is no<lb></lb>thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260117"></xptr>
               <p>else—I speak to it by the general appearance—I will not swear to it—I know it by the silk inside—it is not usual to have silk sewn in that way, and the cloth is the same quality and the same colour, to the best of my opinion, and the make of the cloak is exactly the same—from its ge<lb></lb>neral appearance altogether, I should say it is the same I lost—there had been no fresh strings put on before I lost it—it was in the same state as it is now—the strings are the same now as when it was lost—one has been re-sewn since it was made—I had observed that before I missed it—it attracted my attention when I pinned the private mark on the cloak to the string—taking every thing together, I should certainly say it is the cloak, but I had rather not swear to it being the same.</p>

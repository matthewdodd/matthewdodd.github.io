                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bennett, who keeps the Victoria beer-shop, North-mews, Highbury—on 24th October I was standing in my shop and the prisoners came together, with two women, between half-past 7 and 8 o'clock—Gearing asked for a pint of porter—I served him—they all drank the beer and when it was nearly drank Gearing gave me a shilling to pay for it—I kept that shilling in my hand, and at that time Smith put a quartpot across the counter and asked me to fill it—I drew the porter and he gave me a shilling to pay for it—I put that shilling in my mouth—I then gave the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change to Gearing for the pint of porter—I had the shilling that Gearing gave me in my hand—I then bit the shilling that Smith gave me and it was bad—I went out and tried both the shillings—they were both bad—I went and fetched Mr. Walter, a neighbour, and left him in my house while I went to fetch an officer—I came back with the officers and the prisoners were there—I gave them both in custody, and I gave the two shillings to the officers.</p>

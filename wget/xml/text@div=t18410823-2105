                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. John Knight, a draper, in Goswell-street. On the afternoon of the 24th of July, the prisoner came for some sewing silk—I opened the wrapper before her—she selected a few skeins, and said she would take a quarter of an ounce—I turned to get the scales, turned again to get the weights, and saw her distinctly each time take a handful of silk—I served her, and let her go out—I fol<lb></lb>lowed her about four bouses down, then brought her back, and gave her into custody of Mrs. Knight—the prisoner said she had no silk, and was surprised at my asking her—I said I was certain she had—she said she would make me swear to it—I gave her in charge, but the silk had been found previously—this is the silk—it is my brother's, John Knight.</p>

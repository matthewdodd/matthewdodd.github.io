One of them held out a Pistol, and bid me Stand. I knowing some Chairmen were near, call'd out for Assistance, when he that had the Pistol struck me on the Head with the but-end of it, and cut me sadly. Then they took away my Pocket with 4 Guineas, 4 Handkerchiefs, a Snuff-Box, and a pair of Gloves.</p>

               <p>Booth. Sutton and I with the Prisoners, went round Grosvenor-Square, and seeing no body but the Prosecutor, Patrick and Meeds went and got before her, by the End of Little George-street, and stopt her. Says she, What do you want? And, says Patrick, What, are you saucy ? And with that he cut her over the Head with his Pistol. So that the Blood ran down. She cry'd out and Meeds cut her Pocket off. There was 3 Guineas, an old Handkerchief, and a Pair of Gloves in it. I found no more Money, but Meeds, I believe, had finger'd her Pocket first, and then bid me take it. As we were going away, Viner White turned back and pull'd off her Apron. When we came to a Lamp in Piccadilly, we took out the Things. I had the 3 Guineas. We threw the Gloves over the Rails of a Gentleman's House; and then we went to a Gin shop in Drury-lane, over-against Short's Gardens ( where we knew the People usually got up by 2 in the Morning.) There we pawn'd the Handkerchief for Half a Pint of Gin, and staid till 8 or 9 a Clock; and from thence we went to the Goat in Newport-Market, and got some Steaks for Breakfast.</p>
               <p>Viner White. Booth has ow'd me a spite ever since I beat him in the Skettle-Ground.</p>
               <p>Sutton. We robb'd the Prosecutor in Grosvenor-street by the Corner of Little George-street. Patrick struck her on the Head with a Pistol, and knock'd her down. Meeds cut her Pocket, in which was 3 Guineas, a Handkerchief, and a Pair of Gloves. Then we went over White-Conduit Field, and so to a Gin-shop in Drury-lane, where we pawned the Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there nothing else taken from her?</p>
               <p>Sutton. No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Court. The Prosecutrix swears, and so does Booth too, that one of you turned back, and pull'd off her Apron.</p>
               <p>Sutton. I believe there was an Apron, now I think on't.</p>

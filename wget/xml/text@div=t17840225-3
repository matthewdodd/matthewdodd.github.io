               <p>Court. Was any body in the house besides yourself? - Yes, lodgers; I called for assistance, and the prisoner came down stairs, and finding the street door locked, he went up stairs again, and wanted to jump out of the window.</p>

               <p>But do you know whether it was fast or no? - I cannot tell; I did not venture into the room; I waited for people to assist me; they came and saw the prisoner out of the window upon the tiles; I suppose he was afraid to jump; when I saw the people come, I opened the street door to let them in to help me take the man, they took him half off upon the stairs; that was the prisoner; when we came into the room the bed was laid together upon the bedstead, and the furniture was taken half off from the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any thing moved from the room? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, in the first place this is a crime as charged in the indictment which the law has made equal to burglary, but in this case here had been no breaking at all; he came in by the street door, and got out by a window, which the prosecutor does not know but it was open: the next thing charged here is, that he stole a pair of bed curtains, now you hear he had got them half off, but they were not all removed; if they had been separated from the bed and had been removed but a foot, that would have been a felony; but in this case it is not so; therefore in point of law, the evidence does not support this indictment.</p>

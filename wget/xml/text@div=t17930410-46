Williams's Reports, and Capel Loft's Law of Evidence; the Pocket Book was printed in demy, there was 1100 sheets of that in the same shop, I took it away and brought it to my master's shop; it has been in my custody ever since, it is in a clean state. I went afterwards to Mr. Edwards's shop and took the boy with me, about ten minutes after; the boy lives the next door or the next door but one, Edwards came out of the back parlour when the boy came into the shop, he said that is the boy I bought the paper of, the boy did not say any thing, but cried, he did not deny it.</p>

            ; they were at this time printing the Attorney's Pocket Book, Gilbert's Law of Evidence, edited by Capel Loft, and P. Williams's Reports; I live in the house of which the warehouse is apart; I have lived there this twenty-five years. It is the custom of the trade for those persons who are interested in a work to send in their own paper for the law printers to print.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that been the case with respect to the things in charge? - It had.</p>
               <p>Q. If that paper is lost Messrs. Strahan and Woodfall are answerable for it? - They are answerable both for paper and print. In consequence of some information I had from Bennet, I took the boy to the public office in Bow-street; after that he was discharged in the morning, the boy went home, and came back again, and the warehouseman found other things were missing, besides the Attorney's Pocket Book; we missed some of P. Williams's Reports, we did not know any of Loft's Law of Evidence were missing, till we found it in Edward's shop, and then we went and looked, and found that just that quantity was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards find that the quantity you discovered at Edwards's shop exactly made up the quantity missing? - No, some of P. Williams's Reports are still missing; but Gilbert's Law of Evidence exactly made up what was missing. I took the boy in consequence of that transaction to Edwards's shop, and Bennet went with me; I told him it was my property, and asked Mr. Edwards how he came by it? he said, he bought it of that boy; I asked him what he gave a pound for it?</p>
               <p>Q. Did the lad deny that assertion of Edwards's? - No, not in the least, the boy began to cry very bitterly, and was very sorry for what he had done; I asked him what could induce him? he said, he wanted to lay by a little money for the Easter holidays.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at any time even subsequent to that deny that he was the boy that brought it and sold it afterwards? - Never, I took the lad again to Bow-street, at six o'clock that same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether his examination was taken in writing or not? - They took some writing of the boy's declaration.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to the boy giving him hopes of favour, if he made such a declaration? - No, except in the morning the warehouseman did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the boy sign that declaration? - He was brought forward to the table but the Court was so full I cannot say that he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Wilkinson told me if I would confess, they would not hurt me; if not they would send me to Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Court to Wilkinson. What became of the paper that was at Edwards's shop? - It was taken away; it was work that has never been in trade and could not by any means get from the warehouse, except from our shop.</p>

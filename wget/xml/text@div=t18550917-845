                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Farrer, of No. 35, Culford-street, Kingsland. On 6th Sept. I was returning from the Crystal Palace, and between half-past 5 and 6 o'clock, was passing through Grace'. church-street, and as I passed a print shop, near Cornhill, the prisoner was passing too, and snatched my watch from my side—it was on a hook fast-ened to my dress, and a chain which was round my neck—I took hold of him by the collar, and detained him for a minute—his collar slipped from my hand—I got him by the arm; he held the watch in his hand, and said three times, "Here it is"—he threw it down at my feet and ran away—a young man ran after him, and he was taken at the corner of Cornhill, and brought back in a moment—the hook was fastened to my sash—the swivel was left on the chain.</p>

On 6th Sept., between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, I was in Gracechurch-street, and saw the prisoner deliberately snatch a watch from the prosecutrix's side—he gave it a kind of a twist, and the lady cried out for help, and said, "Oh, my watch!"—he threw it down at her feet; I pursued him to Bishopgate-street, and handed him over to a police<lb></lb>man—I am positive that it was the prisoner.</p>

Colebrook lived with me for eight months as <rs id="t18280703-167-deflabel833" type="occupation">errand-boy</rs>; I went to his lodgings on the 21st of May, in Chatham-gardens, City-road - I think it is No. 32; the house was pointed out to me by my son, who was there before me; I found several books there, also a fiddle, and 1 lb. of thread, which were mine; the prisoner was gone to the City, and on his return I charged him with taking these things - he denied it stoutly; I said if he would confess, and endeavour to recover the property, I would not send for an officer, nor proceed against him; he still said he took nothing; I was so provoked that I took the property and spread before him, and said, "How can you deny taking the property, when I have found this at your lodgings?" he then said, "I took that and no more:" I said, "What is become of Clarke's Bible?" (and several others I mentioned) he said, "I don't know - I did not take them at all:" seeing him so obstinate I sent for an officer, and when he saw him he told me he had sold a great part of them to Retmire, a bookseller, living in Shire-lane; I went there, and brought him to Colebrook; who said, "That is the person I bought the books of;" he had said before that he bought books of one and another, and did not know that he should know the person again - I did not find any books at his house, but he said he had bought a great many volumes of Plays, and this Bible for half-a-crown; but he said it was imperfect, and wanted thirteen leaves; I have looked at it, though not particularly, but I believe it is all right; when the two prisoners were brought together, Colebrook said to Retmire, "You said you would give me so much a dozen for volumes of Plays," and Retmire said, "No, I said so and so;" these books were found at the pawnbroker's by the duplicates.</p>
               <p>Prisoner RETMIRE. Q. Did you not ask me if I had any Prayer-books or Play-books, or the Londinensis? A. Yes; You said you had not, but you had duplicates of them; and knew where they were, and that they could be recovered; you said you bought books of various persons and when you saw Colebrook you said, "That is the person I bought books of," and he said, "Yes, it was me."</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Fetter-lane. I bought the duplicate of a Bible from Retmire, I think, four or five months ago, for 5s. - it was this Bible in two volumes; I had been acquainted with him a long time - I bought this History of England of him for 12s., and sold it to Mr. Dance for 12s. 6d.; he did not tell me where he had them from - he said he knew the owner of the Bible.</p>
               <p>Prisoner RETMIRE. Q. When I first brought you the Bible, before I pawned it, what did I offer it for? A. I believe he asked me 15s. for it; I said I had not the money or I would have bought it - he said he would go and pawn it, as he wanted money very badly; I gave him 4s. for the duplicate, and did not take it out for a fortnight - I then sold it to Mr. Dance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I take novels in part of payment for the History of England? A. Yes; there were 7s. worth of novels, and 5s. in money.</p>

            . Q. Did Colebrook say, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030070"></xptr>the presence of Retmire, what he had given for this Bible? A. Yes; he said 2s. 6d., and that it wanted thirteen or fourteen leaves; Retmire then said it was sold out and out, and he could not get it; the title page is wanting to this second volume, but it is not in general bound in two volumes - that is the reason; I found nothing at Retmire's but the duplicate of these four Hebrew books.</p>

               <p>COURT. Give an account of what happened there, and the manner in which the deceased got the wound of which he died. - About half past 12 at night on the 28th of last month, as I was sitting up waiting for a gentleman who lodged at my house, there came some people to my door who demanded admission, which I refused, desiring to know who they were; I did not choose to open my door to any but those I knew something of; they refused to give any other account than that he was a gentleman and an officer, but no name was given; I still repeated, I would not open the door to any body I did not know; the deceased immediately, with great violence, forced it open from its then fastening; he burst the door open about 18 inches; I got it shut with great difficulty, and put up the iron bar; when he found the door was made fast again he called out, D - n your blood, you are only a rascally waiter, and I will be revenged of your master to-morrow, and with great violence kicked at the door and stove the bottom pannel; I could no longer bear to have my door broke to pieces: I took up this stick (a very large one) and opened the door with the stick in my hand; the first thing that I saw was the deceased with his drawn sword; he made a lunge at my body; I warded off that, and many chops and thrusts, the marks of which are to be seen upon this stick; this created a very great noise; Mr. Storer was then gone up stairs to go to bed; he called out, White, what is the matter? I don't know that I made him any answer, if I did, I know not what it was, but very soon Mr. Storer came down with a pistol in his hand, and his servant attended him; Mr. Storer was in his night-gown and night-cap without his stockings; he came forward and demanded of the person who I was then engaged with, who he was, and what he wanted; the deceased immediately left me and made a thrust at Mr. Storer.</p>
               <p>Where was Mr. Storer standing at that time? - In the middle of the passage; he retreated on seeing the sword pushed at him, and told the deceased, if he did not desist he should be obliged to shoot him; the deceased said, shoot and be d - d, and continued pushing; Mr. Storer repeated those words twice or three times, that he should be obliged to shoot him if he did not desist.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was Mr. Storer retired to when he fired? - Very near the bannisters; I cannot be certain whether he touched them or not.</p>
               <p>He could not have gone farther back? - I apprehend not.</p>
               <p>Where did he wound him? - On the right side of the belly; the deceased said he was wounded, and dropped the sword out of his hand; he asked to have his sword again,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177701150035"></xptr> which was given him I believe by Mr. Storer's servant, and he walked away: at the corner of my house I saw he was joined by two women in red cloaks.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You had never seen the deceased before, he was an entire stranger to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is your custom I believe, though you keep an inn and a tavern, to shut up your house at a much earlier time than this? - I always fasten my doors with a temporary fastening, and never let any body in except a lodger or a person I am acquainted with.</p>
               <p>And you never saw the deceased before? - No; I have seen his picture to-day, but I never saw him before that night.</p>

Keith, as the woman told me his name, for I did not know him, he was so much altered; he set on the step with his back to the door groaning exceedingly; when he came into the parlour I asked him, what is the matter, Capt. Keith? raising himself up a little he said, I am shot through the body, I am a dead man, lead me to bed; the women led him up stairs to his bed; I undressed him and put him to bed; he fell into a dose, and one of the women went with me for a surgeon; the other staid with him in the room; I went to Palace-yard and fetched Dr. Justamond; he came and took some blood from him; I asked the women, where they found the Captain in that said condition; they said, Between Pedler's-acre and the Swan.</p>
               <p>Did he himself give any account how he came by this wound? - I asked him several times; he was in liquor when he came home; I went to the bedside after I sent the woman away, and asked Capt. Keith how he was; he made answer, O my side, my side, my side, could that pain be taken away in my side, it affects my breath; I asked him, when he was sober, if he could remember the person, or could he see the person that shot him; he said, I was so much in liquor I cannot positively say; I asked him in the morning, if he should know the person that shot him, or if he could tell me where it was; he said, Now I am sober, to the best of my knowledge, Mrs. Smith, it was done in the Swan.</p>

               <p>Did you never say that he told you it happened in any other way? - No; being in liquor he said it was between Pedler's-acre and the Swan; that was before he was sober.</p>

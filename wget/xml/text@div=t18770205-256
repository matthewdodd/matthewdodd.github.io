In October last I shipped 30 tons of asphalte sand from a schooner into the defendant's barge at Pickle Herring Wharf. I was to give the prisoner 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. He was to deliver it to me at East Lane. Three or four days after the barge came to East Lane; the sand was aboard. I told him to bring his barge alongside of mine and moor her there.

I am an apprentice to Mr. Saunders, a water<lb></lb>man and lighterman, and am the step-son of Emanuel Hamilton—I live at 51, Drummond Road, Bermondsey, with my mother, who is living apart from ray step-father—before Christmas last the prisoner gave me in custody for stealing 30 tons of sand from the Mary Ann—the summons was heard and discharged—I heard the prisoner sworn as a witness—in September last, on going home to tea in the evening, a man was waiting to see me; he said that there were 25 tons of sand at Pickle Herring Tier which was to be brought down to East Lane in the morning, and I was—to get it into a barge, as it belonged to the Bermondsey Vestry, and he said Mr. Ford, of the Ber<lb></lb>mondsey Vestry, would pay me 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the next morning, about 4 o'clock, I went to Pickle Herring Tier and saw the Cestrian, with some sand in her; I moored the barge alongside and left for three or four hours—I afterwards went to see about it and found the people who had loaded it had put the sand all on one side, and the barge was sinking; it did sink on the Satur<lb></lb>day—I employed two men to get the barge up; the ship was moved on the Saturday night to enable us to do it—the sand was put into another barge and taken down to East Lane—many people knew of the barge having sunk; I did not tell Hamilton, but he must have known of it—on taking the sand to East Lane the Vestry would not receive it—I had the sand laying about for some time at the Millwall Docks; I sold it for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had to supply the barge—I did not tell Hamilton what I had done with the sand, as he never asked me, although I saw him every day—people are paid for taking sand away from ships—I have taken some out of the steamers for the General Steam Navigation Company—it is not true that Hamilton called upon me with a policeman, nor that 1 threatened to strike him with a knife—I saw Hamilton on the wharf when the sand was lying at East Lane—I do not know Captain Brown.</p>

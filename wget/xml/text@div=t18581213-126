               <p>and then went after the prisoners into Threadneedle-street, took hold of them both, told them I was a policeman, and that I should take them in custody for uttering counterfeit coin—they made no reply, but Kalnier threw down this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his hand—I picked it up, and put it in my pocket—I took the prisoners back to the shop, sent for assistance, and as I was bringing Koshant out of the shop, he threw down three pieces of money on the pavement, and dragged me away, so that I should not pick them up—Quinton gave me a shilling—I took Koshant to the station, and found on him four and a half ounces of tobacco, half a dozen cigarettes, one shilling, two sixpences, two fourpenny pieces, a threepenny piece, 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, all good, and a passport—I received this other shilling from March, and this half of a bad shilling from Andrews; there are four altogether.</p>

I purchased two numbers of a publication called "Sam Sly," or "The Town," of the prisoner at his shop at Barking on 26th May—it is a shop that he opens once a week for the sale of old clothes—this publication was exhibited in his window—a woman, named Nash, had pre<lb></lb>viously been taken into custody for selling these publications—I gave the two papers I purchased to my master—I have read the article in question—I believe it is intended to apply to my master.</p>

Robert Liddell—this publication found its way to Barking before May last—there was something in it reflecting on my daughter, and I gave a Mrs. Nash into custody—that was perfectly well known at Barking—the prisoner lived about three doors from Mrs. Nash—she appeared before the Magistrate on a Monday, and on the Tuesday a man named Crantz opened Winch's shop to sell it, and next week Winch took it up—they were exposed in the windows of both shops, and outside the door—they had a sort of label with red letters, "Everybody reads 'Sam Sly.'"</p>

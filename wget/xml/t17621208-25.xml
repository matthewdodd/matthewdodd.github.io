            . On the 4th of last month, between 12 and 1 in the morning, I was coming through <placeName id="t17621208-25-crimeloc137">St. Paul's Church-yard</placeName>

               <p>Q. Which of them spoke to you?</p>
               <p>Stirling. That I cannot tell. I said to them, no. I was not past them above 20 paces, but they both followed me; they came and tripped me down, and by the fall my bundle flew from under my arm. I was held down by this woman, while the other woman took and made off with my bundle. I cannot tell who tripped up my heels, because it was done behind my back; as soon as I could recover myself, I laid hold of the prisoner, and said, What do you mean? do you want to rob me? where is my bundle? O, said she, come along with me into the Old Bailey, or Fleet-lane, or some where thereabouts; I did not go, but I held her at the very spot where the thing was done; I carried her to the end of the Old Bailey, and told the watchman that I had got a prisoner, the watchman would not take her in charge; then I said to him, I would take her to the watch-house myself. I did, and never let my hold go, from the time it was done. She was secured in Wood-street-compter that night, and the next morning carried before the sitting Aldermen. I charged her there in the same manner I have given evidence here. I never got my goods again. I lost in that bundle twenty-five yards of linnen cloth, six yards of fine muslin,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176212080024"></xptr> eighteen pair of worsted stockings, six pair of black figured ditto, nine of white ribb'd, and one of plain; that is thirty-four in the whole, eight silk handkerchiefs, four linnen ditto, and three black neckcloths.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons have you had taken up? A. Four; two were discharged, and the bills against two were ignored - two of those worked under the prisoner; one of the witnesses has absconded since.</p>

            . I am agent to Messrs. Chippendall and Co., of Manchester, calico printers - I was directed by them to make a sale of some shawls in August - I consigned some of the same shawls and other handkerchiefs to Messrs, Gregson and Co. - I received them from Messrs. Chippendall; they were all to be shipped to Calcutta - Wilkinson, Fisher, and Co., are our packers; I sent these goods to them to be packed, and forwarded to Phillips, as the lighterman - the goods I received from Chippendall, answered to the invoice - they were unpacked in my warehouse, and I sent some at different periods to the packers' but not all; those I sold to Messrs. Gregson, also went to the packers' - I have got all the stock in my possession, except what I sent to the packers' - (looking at some shawls) - I cannot say these are part of what I sold to Messrs. Gregson, but they are the same pattern, size, and texture of cloth, and are Chippendall's make - such shawls as these would go into Phillips' hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know the manufacturer? A. Yes - he is here; I have not sold a piece of this description since October or November last; I sold some of these patterns about that time - but here is one pattern which never was sold; I believe it was only printed eight or nine months ago. Previous to November last I may have sold three or four hundred pieces of some patterns - I will not positively swear none of this particular pattern have been sold.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. Were any of the shawls at all sold for home consumption? A. None; the former ones all went to Phillips, except eight pieces, which were sent to Messrs. Goldsmidt, about two years ago; the barder of this one is a new pattern - I believe I never sold one of that pattern; the others have not been made more than two years and a half.</p>

            . I am in partnership with others. at Manchester. We manufactured these shawls - this one is of a particular pattern, which we have altered this year - we first sent some of them to town about six months ago; I had sent none to town in October last; the calico is made expressly for us, and is of a thicker texture than usual; we have sold two other parcels of this new pattern, for shipping, besides what we sent McVicar, and we have made presents of five or six single shawls, but those were all 8-4ths, and these are 6-4ths. McVicar is the only agent I employed for the sale of the 6-4ths.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many of this new pattern have you sent to town within the last six months? A. Proba<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260112"></xptr>bly fifty or one hundred; we sold them for exportation - I cannot say that they left the country.</p>

            . I am manager to Messrs. Wilkinson and Co., packers. I have delivery notes of Mr. McVicar; I packed all the shawls received from him, and received the delivery notes from him; I delivered the goods, packed, to our carmen, Burn and Wood, to take to Phillips; they were packed in tin cases, and soldered; I believe these shawls were folded in our house, and formed part of that package - there was a ticket put into the outside fold, and part of it still remains; I cannot speak to the ticket, but it is on precisely the same spot as we place them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean that you packed that very shawl up? A. I believe I did, and that they were folded in our house; an Excise-officer was in attendance. The tin-case might be taken out, opened, and put in again, with a little trouble - it would take much trouble to repack them properly, but we have nothing to do with the shipping.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. If the property is out, you conclude the case has been opened? A. Yes; I know the folding done in our house; this shawl bears every appearance of having been folded in our house, and I believe was packed by me. I have a peculiar method of packing.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many examinations have there been at the office? A. Four or five; the shawls were then opened.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look again at the ticket - do you believe it to be part of your ticket? A. It is the place where we put the ticket - it has been torn off evidently; there are fifteen shawls in a piece - we always put a ticket on the outer one.</p>

            . I am one of the City Marshals. I took the prisoner at the prosecutor's counting-house, on the 15th of September; I asked where he had those shawls from, which he had to ship for Mr. Phillips; he said he had not a shawl in his possession, and did not know anything about them; he said he never had a shawl in his possession in his life. On being taken to the Mansion House he said he lived at No. 6, Norwich-court; I went there, and saw his wife - I inquired for Hall - she said he was at home, but she was his wife; I found one of these shawls on her neck at the time - I then searched the house, and found up-stairs four whole shawls and five half shawls.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to Mr. Venables? A. Yes, where I found four other shawls of the same pattern, which the manufacturer identified; I never saw the prisoner and that woman together. I did not find any shawls in the trunks - they were in the drawers.</p>

             re-examined. There is not much difficulty in opening these packages. I have examined some of a similar description, and I find, by very common means, it might be done, and closed, to all appearance, as it was before; the tin-cases are to preserve them from sea water. I know the prisoner's wife - the place where she was found is where he lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could you have opened the case yourself? A. Yes, with a pair of pinchers, a hammer, and a chisel; and if they closed the wooden case, the tin lining would not be seen - it was a deal case with iron hoops - they could break open the tin without its being discovered in this country. I asked one Smith to turn evidence; he said he knew nothing about it - the cases are sealed.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. If it was opened, would it be discovered before they arrived at Calcutta? A. No; the prisoner might perhaps have access to the goods only a a few hours, or perhaps a day or two - they were all night and part of the next day in our lighter; the prisoner was generally there as our confidential servant; it was his duty to see them delivered on board the ship.</p>

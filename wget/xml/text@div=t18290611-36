               <p>JAMES COMWELL. I am a <rs id="t18290611-36-viclabel192" type="occupation">coal-dealer</rs>

On the 30th of April Smith gave me information; I went to my shed, and found all the screws had been taken out of my cart; one wheel, the axletree, and the springs were removed from it, but were not taken off the premises; the cart stood upright - I saw the prisoner, and asked how he came to take these things off my cart, he said he was employed by a person, but he would not tell me who - this was about nine or ten o'clock in the morning; the cart was standing near the Three Colts public-house, in Dog-row.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SMITH. I am a silk dyer. I saw the prisoner about half-past four o'clock in the morning, at work with Mr. Comwell's cart, under the shed; I got on my clothes, went down, and took him - he had this hammer in his hand. which I told him to drop, and he did; one wheel was off, and the other partly off the cart; he said if I knew his troubles I should not interfere with him - I had seen the cart between six and seven o'clock at night; it was then perfect, and lying down on the shafts.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he was employed to take the springs from the cart, by a man who represented himself to be the prosecutor's brother.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SMITH. He did not tell me the man employed him, but he said the man lived near Three Colt-lane, and that he hopped as he walked, one leg being shorter than the other; we have made every inquiry for such a person, but cannot find him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I gave the best description I could of the man who employed me; I have done my best endeavours to bring him forward.</p>

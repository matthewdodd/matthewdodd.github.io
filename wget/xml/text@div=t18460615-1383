                  </hi>. I live at County-terrace, Harper-street, Kent-road. On the afternoon of the 16th of June I was in company with George Grout at a cook's shop in High-street, Southwark—I came out of there, and Grout gave me a half-crown and two shillings—the prisoner was standing close by at the time, and made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at the money—I closed my hand, and said, "What did</p>

               <p>you do that for?"—he said, "You old b——, if you don't like it, take that," and <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his hand, and knocked me down—I got up and asked what he meant by that—he knocked me down again and kicked me—I do not know whether he was intoxicated—I am quite sure he aimed at my money in my hand—I clenched my fist to prevent his getting it, and then he knocked me down.</p>

I saw the prisoner come behind him, and make a snatch at the money—I am sure he was snatching at the money—Tilley said, "What do you mean by this?" pulled his hand away, and put the money into his pocket—the prisoner said, "You b----, I will tell you what I mean," and directly knocked him down—he knocked him down twice—I got between them, and he said he would serve me the same, he would rip my b----guts open if I interfered—I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi> I am twelve years old, and live with my father, Robert Brockington, at Church-street, Shoreditch. On Sunday night, 18th Feb., at ten o'clock, I met the prisoner and two more boys at the corner of Church-street—I had seen them before, but had not spoken to them—I went with them to a lodging-house, and had a bed there, because they per<lb></lb>suaded me to stop out all night—the prisoner appointed to meet me next morning, and took me under the Eastern Counties' Railway arches, tied a handkerchief over my mouth, laid me down, knelt on my chest, and stripped me—I kicked, struggled, and hallooed out—he made a bundle of the clothes, dodged me in and out of the arches, and then ran away with them—I ran after him, naked, and screamed out—I went home.</p>

               <p>Prisoner.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. You first saw him flourishing the pistols in the air, and using incoherent expressions? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was using incoherent language? A. Yes, something about green flags.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know him before? A. Yes, he has dealt at my shop for eight or nine months; I saw him very frequently, and conversed with him - be seemed to me as if he knew how to behave himself; he always conversed with the greatest propriety; be ordered what he wanted, and had it home regularly - I never noticed any thing incoherent in him till that morning, then there was a change in him - I thought it strange to see him flourishing pistols; I never saw him with a pistol before - I did not consider them loaded till I saw the large one discharged.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You have sworn wrong; it was not in my shirt tail, it was tied about my side, with about 3l. worth of holy prints of the holy church of Rome, the mother of our Lord. - Witness. There was a 1d 1/2. in his breeches pocket - I saw no prints or papers; a small bag was given to me, containing a crucifix - I never saw him before.</p>

            . I am inspector of the Westminster division of the Police. I searched the prisoner's apartment, and found in a box a blunderbuss not loaded, a canister of powder for 1lb., a quantity of bullets and swan shot, a few gun flints, and some pistol flints - I also found a bundle of papers, not prints: there was nobody in the room - he has a daughter sixteen years old, but no wife.</p>
               <p>JOHN BATHO. The prisoner lodged in my house, No. 7, Broadway, Westminster; the apartment searched belonged to him, he has one daughter - he had been in a very unsettled state of mind before this; I have known him about three months - I live in the house myself; about six weeks ago, he came down on a Monday morning when he usually pays his rent, he fell down on his knees three times in my shop, and talked incoherently, as he has done to day; I observed the same conduct two or three times since - he has not appeared to me at all in his right mind for the last six weeks; one night, about six weeks ago, I heard a quarrel up stairs between his daughter and himself, and repeated cries of murder from her - I went up and endeavoured to pacify him; she had offended him, but in what way I cannot say; she told me he had been beating her, and put my hand to her head to feel a blow he had inflicted - I had seen no provocation on her part towards him; this ill treatment occurred about twice, to my knowledge - but the day after this happened she left home and did not return; I consider his mind overpowered by Religion.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. What I have to say is, I cried out"Rose green Loretto, her green flags rise up:" that is,"Blessed mother Loretto, mother of our church, and goddess above rise up" - I said nothing else till the man arrested me, and I fired at him in defence of her name; she is our goddess, and every body that does not believe in her cannot be saved - the law of God must not be broken, and if they do not believe in her, that will become their condemnation; it is useless for them to be ignorant and live in darkness - she is the light from Heaven that is bestowed that the world should not be so dark; all nations will worship her, it is the will of God, and the will of God must be done, and will be done - I fired in defence of that holy name; I would have fired at him, or any body, in defence of that holy name - I molested nobody; no heretic that does not believe on her, will ever see the light of Heaven - I leave it all to Almighty God; God knows the best.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had interrupted the witnesses several times during the trial with the same sort of language, and whenever insanity was alluded to he always declared that he was "always in his senses."</p>
               <p>MR. MCMURDO. I am surgeon of Newgate. I have examined the prisoner three or four times; I have seen him daily while he has been in the prison- I have no doubt at all of his being in a state of extreme insanity.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. This incoherent manner does not appear put on, but a real disordered state of intellect? A. It does- I always found him in the same state.</p>
               <p>DR. MILLER. I accompanied Mr. McMurdo to see the prisoner last Saturday - I did not anticipate being called as a witness, but from what I saw of him that day, I conclude he is of unsound mind, and that is my opinion now; I have not the least doubt of his being insane.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LOMATH. I heard the report of the pistol; it made a very loud report.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was in the execution of my duty as a Christian to destroy that man, and the honour of my church, because he is rotten and blind - that holy name, there is no other God but her.</p>

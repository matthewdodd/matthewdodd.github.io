                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 138, Westminster Bridge Road—on 26th November, about 9 o'clock at night, I was called to Tower Street Station, to see a woman on a stretcher—she was lying before a fire, and had been dead about an hour—the pupils of her eyes were very much dilated, and her fingers were slightly contracted—there was no congestion, and no marks of violence—I infer, from the dilation of the pupils, that she died of apoplexy—I cannot say whether she had had any drink—it is very diffi<lb></lb>cult to smell drink from a dead person.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 108, Blackman Street, and surgeon to St. George's Hospital—on 28th November I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the deceased, and found a clot of blood, and 2ozs. of blood and serum at the base of the brain—there was no fracture of the skull; there was a bruise on the right knee, a graze on the right hip, and a scar about the middle of the back, just over the kidneys—the brain was congested—the stomach was perfectly healthy—apoplexy was the cause of death—there was not sufficient evidence of violence for me to form any conclusion what brought on the apoplexy.</p>

On the night of 26th Novem<lb></lb>ber, about 6 o'clock, I found the deceased, whose name I afterwards found to be Elizabeth Stevens, sitting on the footway in King Street, Cornwall Road, with her back against the wall—I raised her up, and asked her name; but I could not understand what she muttered—she was the worse for liquor—I sent for a stretcher, and conveyed her to the station—she smelt of drink, and was placed in a cell, and died about 9 o'clock—the corpse was taken to St. George's Workhouse.</p>

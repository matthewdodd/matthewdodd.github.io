                  </hi>. I am adjutant of the 1st Life Guards. The defendant was enlisted in my regiment on 4th July, 1857, by my superintendent, and was discharged on 16th March, 1858, having served exactly 254 days, and being ineligible in consequence of physical disease—I did not deliver his cer<lb></lb>tificate to him—I saw that it was made out by my superintendent, but not in the form in which it is now; it has been altered—I can say that I had seen that paper at the time he left—it was made out in my presence; I saw it when it was completed, and before it was delivered—I saw it after it was</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a major in the regiment and lieutenant colonel in the army. The signature to this certificate is in my writing, but it was not then the same as it is now; there are alterations made, not by me or by my authority—I quite agree with what Mr. Limbert has said as to the word "six," as to the "y," and the word "enlisted"—I am not the only officer who signed it—a discharge document is generally by three officers; the captain writes this, and I add my name—the signatures are mine, and that is all—I attest the truth of the document, which is given to me.</p>

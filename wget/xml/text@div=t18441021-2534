                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Robert Knowles, of Wood-street, Cheapside—on the 19th of Sept., I saw the prisoner take a dozen padlocks from a drawer in the warehouse—r accused him of it, and he said he had taken them with the intention of stealing them, and he was sorry for it—I found these padlocks in his coat-pocket—they had no business there—he was engaged in the warehouse.</p>

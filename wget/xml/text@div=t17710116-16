On the 24th of December, about six o'clock, I missed my watch. I had heard the prisoner had been up my stairs about that time, therefore I suspected him; at last I went to the prisoner's room, which was not locked; searching there, I found under a bunch of paper, this my watch hanging up in the prisoner's room. We took him up before the justice.</p>
               <p>- Jefson. Upon the alarm of Rudge having lost his watch, Dalby came to us, and told us where the watch was; that he would shew. us, and he did shew us where it hung, and said, The prisoner put it there. We went for a warrant; while we were gone the prisoner came in and went up stairs; we went up after him to see what he was about. As soon as he came up into the room, the prisoner came in and said, There was a watch, and he had it from a child, and said, she found it upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>- Dalby. I was got drunk upon the day before Christmas day. Lying asleep in the tap-room, the prisoner waked me. I found my shoes were gone. The prisoner said, he had taken my shoes up stairs, and wanted me to go up, I said, I would not; the prisoner said, he had something particular to say to me. I went up, the prisoner took from under the foot of one of the beds this watch, and said, he found it upon that other bed, and said, it was the man's who lay in the other bed: I advised him to put it where he found it. He said, he would not, and then hung it up under this bunch of paper. I went to sleep again afterwards. There was an alarm about the watch. I told them the soldier had took the watch. I shewed them where it was.</p>
               <p>(The watch produced in court, deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I did not steal it. I was going up stairs. I wanted to get this lad in liquor into bed. Going up stairs, I found the watch. I prevailed upon the lad to go with me. I told him, I had found this watch. Dalby persuaded me to hang it where it hung, and told me, it would be enquired after by and by, and then I might give it the owner. I afterwards hung up the watch, went down stairs, then I heard a watch had been lost. I went up stairs to bring it down again, The people enquiring after it, came up. I told them there was the watch.</p>

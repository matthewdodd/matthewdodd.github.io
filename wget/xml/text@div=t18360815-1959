                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Wednesday morn<lb></lb>ing last, I was in Mile-end-road, and saw the prisoner Skeggs coming over the Globe-bridge with a cart-load of potatoes—he drew up at the Bell and Mackerel public-house—I saw him take something very bulky off the cart—he rang the bell three times very violently; and these keys were thrown out of window by Skelton—Skeggs then went and opened the gate of a shed, deposited two sacks there, and put the keys on a bench—he then came out of the yard with his cart, and proceeded on his journey; I went and stopped him, and asked what he had left behind—he said he had left nothing behind—another officer came up, and I told him to take him unless he told me what he had left behind—he then said he had left some chaff behind—I took the name on his cart, and let him go—I went back to the house, took the keys, unlocked the place, and found the two sacks, one was full of chaff, and the other had a bushel of pollard—I shut the place up, and took the keys with me—I waited till he returned from market, and took him into custody about seven o'clock that morning—it happened about four o'clock—after taking him, I went to the Bell and Mackerell, and took Skelton into custody—I told him it was for being concerned with the other prisoner in robbing his master of the chaff—he said he knew nothing about the chaff, nor about the keys, nor any thing else—nobody in the house would own the keys—I showed them to him—I then went back to the shed, and found the place open, and the sacks empty—they were the same sacks I had seen in the morning—this is a watering-house by the side of the road.</p>

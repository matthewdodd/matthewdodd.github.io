                  </hi>. I am one of the partners in the firm of John Ismay Nicholson and Co.—there are three partners—we carry on business at Nicholson's Wharf, Lower Thames-street—we have a wharf and warehouse for the reception of goods—the prisoner came into our employ in Feb., 1847—we have different floors for the reception of different goods—the prisoner had the sole charge and superintendence of the fruit floor—he came on 30th May, in the morning, stated he was not well, and left before I arrived—from that day he did not attend his duty at the warehouse—I sent a man to him next day, and I went myself on the following Saturday to the place he lived at—we could not find him—I had caused an examination to take place on the floor under his care—a person called several times at our counting-house, and on two occasions I had conversation with that person—and I received this letter, which is in the prisoner's writing: (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"July 24th, 1848, 28, Mount-street, Whitechapel. Gentlemen,—I arrived in London last night, after travelling 200 miles, to meet your wishes and that of my friends, who advise me to wait upon you and give you every information that I can respecting the missing goods, &amp;c. For that purpose, gentlemen, I am now here; I am anxious to throw every light in my power, on a transaction which I fear my continued absence has given a colouring anything but favourable to my character. Awaiting your commands, I am, Gentlemen, your obedient humble servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM HENRY SMITH</hi>.—To Messrs. Nicholson and Co.") The prisoner came to the counting-house on 29th July—I stated to him that there was a large deficiency in his department, handing to him a paper con<lb></lb>taining the amount of the deficiency, 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he could explain the deficiency he thought, and I gave him till the following Tuesday to do so, which would be 1st Aug.—I saw him on 1st Aug., but did not enter into it then because I was engaged—he came on 2nd Aug., by appointment—he said he would explain the deficiency in one particular parcel, that of Stubbs and Church's—he said there was an error in the delivery—I told him that error had been corrected, that they had acknowledged receiving eleven boxes more than he had charged against them—the total number of boxes of Stubbs and Church's which appeared by his account to be deficient was fifty—that eleven made thirty-nine to be accounted for.</p>

On 11th Nov., 1847, there were landed at—Nicholson's Wharf, from the ship <hi rend="italic">Nimble</hi>, 2642 boxes of raisins—they were deposited in the fruit floor, of which the prisoner had the care—they were imported on account of Stubbs and Church, and marked with a diamond and C----when I went into the fruit floor I asked the prisoner if he had made them all right—I cannot remember the words he used, but he gave me an admission of some sort or other—here is the warehousing book of that day—here is the entry in the prisoner's writing—he charges himself with the reception of these boxes—on 2nd Dec, 1847, we received 200 bags of white pepper by the <hi rend="italic">Felicity</hi>, numbered from 1 to 200, on account of Peck and Co.—in the prisoner's book, in his own handwriting, he charges himself with having received them—I saw him on that occasion, and he gave an admission of some sort or other of having received these goods—on 19th Nov. I received sixty-nine boxes of Jordan almonds by the <hi rend="italic">Leonidas</hi> from Malta, marked O, on account of John Dalgleish—in the prisoner's warehousing book here is the same entry—on that occasion I agree in amount with him—all those goods were placed in the fruit floor—on 9th Nov.

I was at Nichol<lb></lb>son's wharf, and received him in custody—I found on him this memorandum<lb></lb>book. <hi rend="italic">The contents of the book being read, were as follows</hi>:—"In this unplea<lb></lb>sant business of ours, I find I have but two alternatives; the one is, to confess all I know to N. and Co.; the other is, to leave the country. N. and Co. have told a friend of mine who called upon them to plead in my behalf, that if I will tell all, and who bought the goods, they are inclined to be merciful towards me. Now, if I do this, I must compromise you most fearfully. I do not wish to do anything of the kind; I wish to leave the country for ever. I have made arrangements to do so, and my friends are trying to raise money to accomplish this. I think, taking all things into consideration, you ought</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210052"></xptr>
               <p>to contribute towards this object. 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would greatly assist me; and I think you will see the great necessity there is. 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would make up the sum necessary to take me quite away, and I think I have every right to call upon you for that amount; your safety so much depends upon it. I therefore expect that you enclose me a Post-office order for that amount, so that I may get the money to-morrow before twelve o'clock. Do not fail in this, as worse may follow."—" Gentlemen, I wish to address a few words to you touching the unfortunate affair now at issue between us, before I leave this countryfor ever. You apprehend that I have robbed you, and unfortunately appearances are greatly against me; but although I have been mixed up in one or two mat<lb></lb>ters which has to some extent compromised me, yet they cannot be set down as robberies. A counsel at the bar must greatly pervert the truth to induce any jury of Englishmen to bring in a verdict against me. That goods have been missing, I was well aware for some time past; but I can most positively state that I was quite ignorant how they went. I was thunder-struck, and I positively would (indeed I made an effort to raise the money) have paid up all deficiencies if I by any possibility could; but 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a great sum for a poor fellow like me to raise. But if God spares my life, and if I have ever so moderate a share of success in the new country to which I am bound, I most solemnly promise to remit you money by instalments till every defalca<lb></lb>tion is made good to you. Messrs.----ought to take into consideration, in proof of my innocence, that had I been so disposed, I could have taken goods of much less bulk, and much more valuable than fruit; in fact I could have robbed them of hundreds, in lieu of the paltry amount charged against me. The facilities, to persons dishonestly inclined, to rob, are greater at N. W. than I ever remember to have seen at any other W. wherever I have been. Not only can the foreman deliver any quantity of goods without the slightest check, but even the very labourer employed, can, in his temporary absence, send out goods with ninety-nine chances out of every hundred in their favour of never being detected. Your own words, so often repeated to me, to keep a sharp look-out after the fellows, for they would rob you before your eyes, would prove that you were not ignorant of the facilities afforded to the evil-disposed. Messrs.----will I hope ponder over this, and cause some alteration in a system to which I have fallen the victim; a knowledge of this fact would make importers of goods think twice before they sent their goods; and however glad I am that there is every probability of my escape from the disgrace of a public prosecution, I am equally glad that a further injury will not fall upon my late employers through my instrumentality. Is conclusion, I beg to state that so paltry a robbery is not at all in accordance with my character. I am either good or bad in great degrees. Had I robbed you at all, it should have been to some amount; had I robbed you at all, rather than allow myself to have been compromised, I would have fired the warehouse."

The prisoner was in my service, between six and seven months, as a warehouse boy, to have the charge of the good up stairs, and to regulate them—these articles were in the warehouse—they had been taken in pledge—my shop-man found in my warehouse a pouch, in which were some duplicates of articles found at Mr. Crouch's—I have a partner.</p>

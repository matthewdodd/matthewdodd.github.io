The Prosecutor deposed, That as he was passing along the Street, a Woman came to him, and asked him to give her a Pot of Ale; and he telling her he would, if she would go to a House over the Way, she presumed upon the new contracted Acquaiutance, and took him hold by the Arm, and led him he knew not where, to a Place where he never was in his Life. That when he was there, they drank; but however, he said, at last (whether by his own Inclinations or their Persuasions, he could not tell, but) undrest he was, and in Bed; and when he was there , his Female Attendants put the Candle out, which he would not suffer; but telling them he would not lye in Bed it they did not light the Candle, they obliged him, and did light it , but by and by put it out again; this was done several times; and one of the Chamber-Maids came and lay down by him. Being asked whether he was drunk or sober, he answer'd, he was drunk enough to go into that House, but; her enough to know what he did: for he laid his Breeches under his Boster to secure his Mony; but however they found means to get them away , and he did see the Prisoner put them there again. He felt for his Money, and missing it, would have risen and gone away; but was told , it he took any Notice of it, they would be gone away, and have moved off the Premises by Morning: She lay all Night, and got up in the Morning and got an Officer; and when he came back, they had broken up House, and almost (out not quite) got all off; but lighting on the Prisoner , saluted her with a Mrs. Mary! have I caught you? and so secured her. That she being secured, desired him to be easy, and she would send for a Friend and make him Satisfaction; upon which, a Brandy Man came, and paid him half a Guinea. The Prisoner in her Defence said, That indeed she was in the House, and that the Prosecutor must needs have Variety of fresh Bits, and had 3 and at last would needs, have the Mistress of the House for a Bedfellow; but that when they were abed, she went away and lay in another Place. That after he had apprehended her, she did consent to make him Satisfaction rather than come into Trouble, and he receiv'd half a Guinea, and was to have the rest 2 s. a Week, in which Weekly Payments a Default being trade, he brought this Indictment against her. But as the Indictment was laid for taking from his Person, when by his own Account his Breeches, at the time when his Money was taken, were not on, the Jury <rs id="t17170227-57-verdict292" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Was it an old hat? - A. It was a new hat; I saw it before it was finished.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever suffer any servants of your's to repair hats in your manufactory? - A.Never, (produces the hat); here is a white mark in the front of the crown, and the same again behind; I had observed it on the 27th, and I put a mark of T. L. in the inside, which I have no doubt, if the hat is taken to pieces, will be seen; I put it between the brim and the crown.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where you saw this hat first, was upon the bench in the shop? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the prisoner brought the hat into the shop for the purpose of being repaired? - No.</p>
               <p>There is a sister of the prisoner's who works in the same shop? - A. In the same house, but not in the same shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not permit your men to sell hats upon their own account, and have let them have them at the wholesale price? - A. Yes, if they go below, and give their orders.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you undertake to swear that that very hat was not sold at your shop to the prisoner? - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. It he has a hat to alter, he carries it into the manufactory? - A. No; he must bring it into the shop, the same as body else.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they not alter hats for themselves in the manufactory? - A. Not to my knowledge, we never permit it; this hat has not yet had the least finish on the surface.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You told me you put T. L. upon the hat; do you put that mark upon every other hat? - A.No; it is a mark that I put upon this particular hat, in consequence of suspicion; I put it on a piece of paper, and, with the point of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010017"></xptr>pen-knife, forced it up between the brim and the crown.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>LESTOCK PEACOCK, jun. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I live with my father, a carpenter and joiner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever purchase any thing of him? - A. Yes, a hat, somewhere about September or August.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you return it to him? - A. Yes, to be repaired; I had my hair cut, and it was rather too big for me, I could not tie it in, it was so stiff, I gave it him to make it smaller, and put a leather in behind.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you returned it him for this purpose? - A. It was on a Thursday in June, I think the beginning, it was about six weeks.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Then it could not have been it June? - A. I cannot exactly say when it was, it must be six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. This day six weeks then you think, do you? - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Have you ever had the hat again? - A. NO.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that hat? - A. This is the band; I am sure it is the same buckle and band.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.How do you know it is the same buckle and band? - A. To be sure there a great many alike, but it is exactly like it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifton. Q. Then all you mean to say, is, that you delivered a hat with such a band to the prisoner at the bar to repair? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>LESTOCK PEACOCK, sen. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, he has been in my service.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever buy any thing of him? - A. Yes; I bought a hat of him for my son, I think in September last.</p>
               <p>Court. (To peacock, jun.) Q.How often had you worn your hat? - A. Not more than a dozen times.(Mr. Larkin cut the lining of the hat, and produced the paper with the mark T. L.)</p>
               <p>Larkin. The hat had never been lined at all when I put the paper in.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury (To Larkin). Q. Did the prisoner leave his own hat in the manufactory? - A. He did, and it is here. <rs id="t18010701-18-verdict108" type="verdictDescription">

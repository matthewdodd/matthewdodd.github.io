            . I know the prisoner, and was present at his marriage at Ely to Sarah Cuttriss, in 1805 - I saw her alive last Monday evening - I know the prisoner's father - he was not at the wedding - he is living - I went with them to his father's house after the wedding - the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050086"></xptr>father was present at the dinner, which was provided by his friends at his father's house - Cuttriss had 600l.; the prisoner lived with her about 5 years; he then failed there, and left her with three children in distress - he was a tailor - his goods were taken in execution - she was supported by her friends - he never returned to her that I know of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Then you do not know of their living together since 1810? A. I do not know that I have - I do not know how old he was when he was married - I have heard he was only eighteen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How old was his wife? A. She was under age, I think - her mother is a widow - she was not at the dinner.</p>

            . The prisoner is my son; he was born on the 7th of May, 1787 - I knew nothing of his being married to Cuttriss till after the marriage - his father was living at the time - they dined at our house the day they were married.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you know of it? A. I received a note between ten and eleven o'clock the same day, and provided for them as quick as I could - I knew nothing about it before - my husband is very ill, and unable to travel here - he was not at home when I received the note, but I carried it to him as quick as I could - he dined with them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You took the note to him, where was he? A. He worked for 'Squire Deering, and was not at home - I cannot tell at what time they were married - we live at Denvers, sixteen or seventeen miles from Ely - I took no care of the note.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to WM. CUTTRISS. Q. At what time were they married? A. About eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Cuttriss is well aware my father was applied to for his consent previous to the marriage, and would not give it; and he knews that he went and made the affidavit himself to obtain the licence.</p>
               <p>WM. CUTTRISS. I understood the prisoner went to Denvers to communicate with his father - I did not go with him, nor see the father afterwards - I do not know whether his father consented - I went with the prisoner to make the affidavit before the Rev. Mr. Griffiths, at the request of Cuttriss' mother, who was a widow.</p>
               <p>E. MILLS. I know the letter was my son's hand-writing - it was addressed to me, not to my husband.</p>

On 4th June, my little girl gave me a half-crown, which I put in my pocket—I had no other there—she brought me a second half-crown about an hour after—I examined it, and found it bad—I came out, and told the prisoner it was a bad one—he said he had just taken it from his master; he was sorry he had drank the beer, for he had no more money to pay for it—I gave him the bad half-crown back, and he left—soon after<lb></lb>wards I examined the first half-crown, and found that was bad—I then</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Sherwood; my master sent me down Houndsditch with Mr. Crowden; when we had got about twenty doors from my master's, two men came up against us, and push'd us against the wall; one of them pull'd Mr. Crowden's watch out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Which took the watch?</p>
               <p>Jennison. The prisoner did, Mr. Crowden bid me follow them directly; I did; they were not out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they run away together?</p>
               <p>Jennison. They walked at a very great rate; I gave my master information of it; my master stood at his door; I shewed him the man; my master and the oldest 'prentice took him.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the men dressed?</p>
               <p>Jennison. The prisoner was in blue, the other man in light-coloured cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take only the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jennison. Because he had taken the watch; I told my master so at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the way was the prisoner on?</p>
               <p>Jennison. The same side as my master's house; the other man had crossed the way.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say?</p>
               <p>Jennison. He asked what we wanted with him; we told him a gentleman wanted him that would be in, in a few minutes: we took him to my master's; the prosecutor came in; we searched the prisoner, but did not find the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch at the time it was taken?</p>
               <p>Jennison. I saw it in the prisoner's hand when he took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what he did with it?</p>
               <p>Jennison. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now are you sure the prisoner is one of the men that shoved the prosecutor and you up against the wall and robbed him?</p>
               <p>Jennison. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Jennison. Not to my knowledge.</p>

Sir! the gentleman has had his pocket pick'd of his watch, and that is the man that stole it, in the blue coat, pointing to the prisoner. I called my eldest apprentice to assist me; we took him, about two doors beyond my house; we brought him back to my shop, and in two or three minutes Mr. Crowden came in; he appeared much frightened.</p>

I had carried three chests of lemons for a man that lives in Fire-hall Court; as I came down Houndsditch, I walked by Mr. Sherwood's house; he came out to me and said, Young man, somebody in my shop wants to speak to you. I turned back, and went into his shop; he shut the door; presently the man came in, and said he had been robbed of a watch. I said, By whom? He said he could not tell: the young man said, I will take my oath you was with the man. He said first he saw me with the man that committed the robbery; now he swears that I committed the robbery. I was searched; it was not found upon me. I had nobody with me; I could not have conveyed it away. Mr. Sherwood said, Where is your companion? I said, No-body was with me: they sent for an officer, and I was carried to the Poultry Compter.</p>

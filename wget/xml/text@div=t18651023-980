                  </hi>. I am a master builder, in Shoe-lane, Fleet-street—in the latter end of August and the beginning of September, I was preparing to build some houses in a field at Forest-hill—a Mr. Brassington was also carrying on some work there—the prisoner was in his employ—he was burning ballast—on my premises I had two carts, a tumbril and a spring cart—the tumbril was a old cart, and I empowered Mr. Brassington to sell it for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the other was a good spring cart, worth about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a conversation with Mr. Brassington about the sale of the tumbril cart, early in August—the prisoner and another man were present—not a word was said about the sale of the spring cart—I passed there shortly afterwards, and the prisoner accosted me, and said, "Is it true the old cart is for sale?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I will soon find you a customer for it"—I said, "Oh, very well, but the matter is in Mr. Brassington's hands, and I will have nothing to do with you"—I had never seen him before—that was all that took place—I went there on 5th September, the tumbril was then gone, and the spring cart had been drawn out from its place—the prisoner was not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186510230084"></xptr>
               <p>there then—on 8th September, I heard something, and on the 11th I went to the premises, and found that ray spring cart was gone—I had authorised no one to dispose of it—on 19th September, the prisoner came to my place in Shoe-lane, and said, "I have come to see if I can make up the matter about the cart"—I said I could not say anything about the cart, but I had never given him or any other man authority to sell the cart, and I must have it back, and if not, I should give him into custody—he said he supposed be had made a mistake; if I would overlook the affair, he would endeavour to pay so much a week to get it back—I declined, and sent for a policeman—he never told me he had received a cheque—I saw my cart on the 11th, the day I missed it, at Mr. Clayton's at Forest-hill, near the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you pay for that spring cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was about fifteen years ago; it may be twelve—we used it for work we did at odd times—some two years ago I offered to sell it—I have never been anxious to sell it since—the wheels have been repaired—it was offered for sale when I was ill—I sold the tumbril cart for the iron that was about it—it was no longer any use to me—I swear positively I did not say to Mr. Braasington that I should be glad if I could get a customer for both carts—the prisoner did not take part in the conversation between me and Mr. Brassington—he was within hearing—I did not ask the prisoner to find a customer for me—the cart had been drawn from under a shed when I saw it, and we had a discussion about it—the prisoner was not there then—he did not ask me if the two carts were for sale, and I did not say, "Yes, for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I swear that—I might have told him he would find my address on my cart—no one came to me wishing to buy the cart, and saying the prisoner had sent him—I am quite sure of that—Mr. Pearce was examined as a witness at the Police-court—he said he had written a letter to me, offering me money for the tumbril cart—I can't speak positively as to whether he said for both carts—it might possibly be the two—I don't re collect his saving that it was in consequence of what the prisoner told him that he wrote that letter—I heard from my son that the spring cart had been sold—he did not tell me that the prisoner had sold it to Mr. Clayton—he told me a man that worked there told him that he had sold my spring cart, and that he would get a cheque or money for it that day, and bring it up at night—he did not know the man, he was only there one day—I sent one of my men down the next day to see who had sold my spring cart, and on the 11th, I went myself—I did not know then who had sold it—a bricklayer, employed by Mr. Brassington, said to me, "All right; you may depend upon it the man has got the money, but he has not come to work to-day"—I took a policeman with me and made inquiries, and afterwards went to Mr. Clayton's premises and saw the cart—I could get no information from him—ho would not tell me who he bought it from—I asked him civilly about it—I had the policeman with me—the prisoner came voluntarily to my place on the 19th—he said, "I have come to make an arrangement with you about the cart; "or" settle about the cart"—I can't swear to the precise words—ho did not offer to pay me the money—he said he would pay me ten shillings a-week if I would compromise the matter—I was not asked about that before—I have been examined three times—I did not say to him, "You have sold my cart in a mistake; you must get it back"—I do not recollect using the word "mistake"—I was perfectly calm—George Brown, a witness, was present—the prisoner was brought up at Greenwich on this same charge, and discharged—subsequently he was brought up again and committed—the charge was dismissed at first for want of</p>

                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of a saw-mill at Perry-vale, Forest-hill—ON 5th September, in consequence of something I had heard, I went to Mr. Weston's premises at Forest-hill—I saw a spring cart there—on the evening of the 6th, the prisoner came to my place and said that he understood that I had been down the evening before to see about the spring cart, and that he had come up about it—my clerk asked him what was the price of it—he said, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my clerk said, "Oh, nonsense, about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the prisoner said, "No, I can't take a farthing less than 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6a. as the two were to be sold for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there was a little discussion about it, and at last I said, "Well, I suppose you must give him the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—my clerk gave him a deposit of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my presence, and I told the prisoner that my clerk should call down on the following day with a cheque drawn in favour of Mr. Weston for the difference, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he then went away—on the following morning I drew a cheque on the London and County Bank for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and sent it down for the cart—I have since received that cheque through my bankers—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was cashed—there was no endorsement on it when I sent it—I received the cart on the 7th, about 12 o'clock, and it is on my premises now.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see Mr. Brassington on the 5th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I told him I wanted to buy the cart, and he referred me to the prisoner as the man having authority to sell it—he said he had had a little disturbance with Mr. Weston, or he would have sold me the cart himself—the prisoner was not there then—on the following morning my clerk left a message for the prisoner, and he called as I have described—he said then, "The cart belongs to Mr. Weston of Shoe-lane, and I will take the money up to him"—the price I gave for the cart was more than it was worth—it had been offered for sale before, and people would not give that for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder—in August and September I was building a house at Forest-hill—I had some conversation with Mr. Weston about a tumbril cart—I don't think he said anything to me about the other cart then—we have talked about the spring cart, with reference to sale—that might have been some time afterwards—before I saw Mr. Clayton, he came down to my house one evening, and said, "I believe you have got a cart for sale"—I said, "I have nothing to do with it; I believe one of my men has; me and Mr. Weston have had some words, and I don't want to have anything to do with him"—I asked Lacey if he had any authority to sell</p>

               <p>the cart, and he said, "Yes"—I believed he had because he told me so—I had reprimanded him because he left his work to try and sell the cart, and he had had several people there to look at it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there any concealment about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I dare say he was a month bothering about it—I knew that he was endeavour<lb></lb>ing to sell it—I can't say that Mr. Weston did—I believe my men knew it—the prisoner behaved very well while he was with me—I had been put on my guard against him, and I gave him an opportunity of retrieving his character.</p>

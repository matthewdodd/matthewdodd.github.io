On the 23d of January, my wife called me down stairs, I missed two boots out of the shop window, I had seen them safe about ten minutes before. My wife went to the door, and pointed Mackenzie out to me. Mrs. Thorn had her in custody; she found the boots on her; and she said, the other prisoner had stolen them, and that she was bringing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190022"></xptr> them back, I took them from her, she was close to the shop. Mrs. Thorn fetched Wainwnight, and he took her. The boots were mine, they were odd boots and worth 12s. The prisoner, Brown, went into the shop, and asked, what had became of her sister, in about half an hour; my wife said, that she was the girl who was in the shop with Mackenzie. Brown said, she never took the boots, and asked what I was going to do with her; I gave her to the officer.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 23d. of January, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoners came into our shop, I was in the yard, when I came in I found them in the shop; Mackenzie asked for a pair of highlows, she said, they were for the other prisoner; Mackenzie said, she was going over the way to get a pint of beer, and would try them on-Brown then said, she was going over the way too, and would call again; Mackenzie went first and Brown followed. I went into the street to look after them, they did not go the way to the public-house. Mrs. Thorn crossed the street, and stopped Mackenzie. I went to the shop window and saw the lamp swinging, which made me think somebody had been taking the shoes. I called my husband to see if any thing was gone, he missed the boots. Mrs. Thorn had taken her with the boots. In about half an hour, Brown came to the shop, and asked if the other girl had stolen the boots - I told her she knew it; she said, she did not, for the girl had found them at the door; this was before I said any thing about them. I am sure they were our boots. When Mackenzie was in the shop, she was folding her gown round her waist.</p>
               <p>MRS. THORN. On the 23d of January, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw the prisoners at the corner of Saffron-Hill, about five doors from Walker's, they were coming from Walker's house; Mackenzie had something folded in her lap, I asked her what it was; she said, they were boots; I asked her, where she got them from; she said, she picked them up at the door. I turned her round and took her back to Walker's; she winked her eyes at Brown, and she escaped.</p>

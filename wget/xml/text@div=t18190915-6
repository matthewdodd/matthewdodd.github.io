I was coming out of the fair with Mr. Colbeck, a little after eleven o'clock at night; the prisoner came up, seized me by the leftshoulder, and said,</p>
               <p>"You b - g - r, if you move." While he held me, a great many others came, and took two half-crowns and some sixpences from my pocket; they tore my waistcoat off, which had my comb and other things, in the pockets. They tore my breeches pockets off, and took my hat off my head, in which was my handkerchief; they took both away; they took away every thing I had. Then the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Let the b - g - r go;" I made the best of my way home. I lost my friend before they attacked me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. On the following Wednesday morning, I met him in Oxford-road, knew him, and had him secured. I had seen him about Oxford-road before the robbery; I never spoke to him before, but am certain he is the man - they were three or four minutes robbing me. I had seen the prisoner walking in Oxford-road about a week before, and four or five times before that. I have not seen my property since.</p>

               <p>Court to Stewart. Was the horse you saw at the Green-yard, and that which was taken the next morning to Bow-street, the same horse you lost? - It was the same horse, saddle and bridle.</p>
               <p>Are any of Mr. Goddard's people here? - No, none of them; his Christian name is John; I took the horse home on Wednesday night; it was a cropped bay horse, fourteen hands and an inch high.</p>
               <p>Had you ever rode him before? - Yes, a great many times; I knew him perfectly well; I have had him a week together in my possession.</p>

               <p>Did you find out where he had been? - No otherwise, than I heard he had been riding up and down where the centries were, and at both the playhouses, and that he was very much in liquor.</p>

                  </hi> I am wife of George Mansfield Walls—we were last month living in the service of the Rev. Mr. Layton, of River-house, Duncan-place, St. Mary. Islington. On the night of the 6th of Oct., I and my husband went to bed between twelve and one o'clock—we were the last persons up—we fastened all the doors and windows—we slept in the kitchen under the back drawing-room—as I was going to bed I heard a noise—my husband took a candle, and went into the kitchen—he is not here—I did not go with him—he came back, and we retired to bed—after we had been in bed some time, I heard a noise again, like some one walking about the room—I tried to rouse my husband, but could not succeed—I got up, and went to the back drawing-room with a light—the door was not quite closed—I opened it, and saw two men, the prisoner was one—I thought I had seen him before, but did not know where—he had Mr. Layton's tea-caddy in both hands—the other man had a candle in his hand—the prisoner lifted up his hand, and said, "You be still,"—I shut the door, and went down calling "Murder!" to arouse the house—I went to the bottom of the stairs and rung a bell, which brought my husband and my master to my assistance—next morning I ex<lb></lb>amined the house with a policeman—the front drawing-room window shutters were pushed open, sufficient to get an arm in, when the window was open—I had fastened the inside shutter the night before, but the window-catch had something the matter with it, and it would only shut down—it could have been opened from the outside—the shutter was thrown open.</p>

                  </hi> I occupy River-house, Duncan-place, St. Mary, Islington—I went to bed early in the morning, and left Mrs. Walls up—I was alarmed, between one and two o'clock, by a violent outcry and the ringing of a bell—I put on a dressing-gown, and ran down into the room opposite to where the robbery was committed—it was undis<lb></lb>turbed, and I went into the opposite room, the back drawing-room, and found it in disorder—I found a crow-bar on the sideboard—I missed a silver pencil-case, and a pen-knife, from a work-basket, which was overturned, and the contents strewed about—the window and shutter had not been disturbed—I went into the front drawing-room, which communicates with the back by folding doors, which were open—on entering. I saw the window wide open, and the shutters thrown up—there was a pool of candle-grease on the table, which was slightly burnt, as if a candle had been set there—I found a cabinet broken open by such an instrument as this crow-bar, and missed from it about forty English and foreign coins, a mother-of-pearl snuff-box, set in silver, three massive gold mourning rings, a silver Palais Royal medal, an <hi rend="italic">elui</hi> case, and a great quantity of jewellery, principally ear-rings—I examined the win<lb></lb>dow and shutter, and found marks of violence—I did not apply the crow-bar to them, but could tell by my eye that it would have produced them—I also saw marks of the instrument against the window-frame outside—it could be lifted up from the outside; it is about four feet from the ground—it is a Venetian window, the centre opens, and the sides are closed—when it was open, any<lb></lb>body could easily remove the shutter—it is very long, and fastened in the centre by a small pin—a person could thrust his arm into the opening of the shutters, reach the spring lock of the bar, and throw it up—I saw that done afterwards, as an experiment—I afterwards examined the garden, and saw three footsteps—I cannot say whether they were of different people—my garden is enclosed by a wall five feet high—there is a public road on one side, and on the other side next to the window is the yard of the County-court.</p>

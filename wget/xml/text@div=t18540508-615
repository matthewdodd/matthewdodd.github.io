Let it be the best brandy"—I know Mr. Dixon intimately, he lives directly opposite me—I said to her, "If you will wait five minutes, till I have served the waiters, I will attend to you"—she said she was in no hurry for a few minutes—I afterwards served her with the brandy, and she tendered a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I put my name and Mr. Dixon's on the back of it, in her presence, on the counter—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave the prisoner nine sovereigns and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—she then left the house—I desired my potman to follow her, being rather suspicious—I paid the note into the Islington Bank next morning, and the cashier told me it was a bad one—I next saw the prisoner about a week afterwards, in the body of the police court, at Marylebone-street, on the day that a man named Fuchs was examined.</p>

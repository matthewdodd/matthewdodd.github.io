I am the wife of George Hale, of 9, Half-Moon-alley, Chapel-street, Milton-street—I and my husband occupy the whole house, which consists of two rooms—last Saturday night, 23d February, I went out about 6 o'clock, leaving nobody in the house—I double-locked the door and took the key with me—I had fastened the windows—I came back at. a quarter to 7, and saw a candle alight—three coats were taken off the door and laid on the ground, three umbrellas were taken from the staircase, and were laid on the three coats, and a gown was taken from the bedroom—the drawers were open and a shirt taken out of it, and laid on the top of the other things—nothing was taken away, but I found these things removed—I unlocked the door of the house, and it only required one turn to unlock it—I had double locked it—I found the prisoner in the house, he was attempting to make his escape out of the back door—I heard a scuffle' outside while he had the back door in his hand; there must have been another party—I did not lay hold of him—I am quite sure it was the prisoner—he went away—I called out for the police—my house is in the parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate—the value of these goods is about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I am a carman residing at 24, Milton-street—the stables of my mistress, Mrs. Bingham, are immediately by Mr. Hale's house—on Saturday night last, about 7 o'clock, I was coming from my stable, as I had done my horse up for the night—I heard a noise, and on looking to the tiles I saw the man jump from the tiles into the yard and run towards the gates—I ran after him, and secured him till the policeman came—I heard last witness call "Police"—I did not see anybody else at that time, but I heard some one.</p>

On Saturday night last, I took the prisoner in custody from the last witness, and took him to the station—I told him he was charged with being there for some unlawful purpose—I did not know the charge at the time—he said he had only just come in the yard—I searched him, but found nothing on him.</p>

I shall hold you till she comes;" and he held me the policeman came, and gave me in charge: he did not see me on the tiles, I was not on the tiles.</p>

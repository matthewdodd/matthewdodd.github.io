               <p>Mrs. Wilson—she is married to Patrick Cavannah, but goes by the name of Wilson—Cavannah had only come home three weeks before this happened, and lived there—he is not here to-day. On the 1st of April I heard him and the prisoner quarrelling between nine and ten o'clock—the prisoner came to the door and asked Cavannah, his father-in-law, to let him in—he said, "You shall not come in to-night, Robert"—he went and opened the door, and then the prisoner went away—he came back again in about five minutes and threw some little stones at the door—he said, "I want to come in"—I am sure it was the prisoner's voice—master went across to the fire-place and got the poker—he said, "You shall not come in to-night, Robert, but you may burst the door open"—then I heard a pistol immediately fired off—the door was shut at the time—the ball of the pistol went into master's cheek—I saw master's cheek bleeding immediately after I heard the noise of the pistol—master was stooping at the time, his head was close to where the parlour-door opens, about the middle, above the lock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner in Bath<lb></lb>place, Wellington-street, Woolwich—he fired a pistol just at the time I came up to take him and said something—I found a pistol in his band, and took one from his pocket—they were both discharged—I had seen him discharge one of them up the street—the other was not loaded—I could not see whether it bad been recently fired, for I did not examine it—I went at first on hearing the report of fire-arms, and as I went I saw him fire another—as I took him to the station he said, "I have done it, and it would not have happened only I was drunk"—I looked at the door of the house and saw a hole through it four feet four inches from the bottom, and nine inches and three-quarters from the jamb—it might be nine or ten inches from the handle, but I did not take notice of that—it was about eighteen inches from the key-hole—it is the street-door and opens into the passage, which is of the width of the door.</p>

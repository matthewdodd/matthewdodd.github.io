               <p>Q. Do not let any circumstances of apprehension, or any thing prevent you from speaking the whole truth, you are now under the protection of the law, and therefore I desire you to speak the whole truth. How long have you been ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200057"></xptr>quainted with the prisoner at the bar? - Six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you call yourself? - I used to do business for the navy, and in the mercantile line.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his brother, who is deceased? - Yes, the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first had any communication with the prisoner, on the subject of forged stamps? - About four months before I was apprehended; on calling at the late Idswell's, in St. Maryaxe, in the prefence of Soloman Idswell, the late Idswell asked me, what I thought of having a six shilling stamp made? if I had anybody I could sell them to, I might make my fortune? I then told him I had a friend at Portsmouth, and mentioned one Mr. Wolfe; he then asked me whether Mr. Wolfe could be trusted, and would have no suspicion? I told him he would not, for he was a man that made use of a great many himself, and therefore he would have no suspicion. A few days after I see Mr. Wolse in town, whom I had known many years; in the course of the conversation I told him that I expected some stamps on credit, from a stationer, and wished to know whether they would said him, being six shilling stamps for powers of attorney and assignments? he then said they would suit him; I then told him I would send him about two hundred pounds worth; Mr. Wolfe said they were too many, that he could have a better use for his money. Then we parted without coming to any agreement, and then I went to the late Idswell's house, and acquainted him what had passed between me and Mr Wolfe.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did the late Idswell live? - No. 57. St. Mary-axe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this conversation pass in the presence of Solomon Idswell? - No, it was the late Idswell.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did you see Solomon? - Then the late Idswell and me went to buy some paper stamps, in order to get them stamped; we went to a shop in Lombard-street, and bought two quires of blank powers of attorney without stamps, for which he paid half a crown, or three shillings, I don't know which.</p>
               <p>Q. You met Mr. Wolse, you have told us what past between him and you. Had you any talk with this man about Wolfe again? - No, I had not. The late Idswell went the same afternoon to Messrs. Mount's and Page's, stationers, on Tower Hill, and he bought several quires of powers of attorney, and assignments not stamped, and took them home to his own house; and he also desired me the next day to attend, to call on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call the next day? - Yes. When I came he took me up three pair of stairs into a back garret, where I see in the middle of the room, a bench fixed with a small press fixed on it, and a fly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the press in working order? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was fixed in the middle of the room? - Yes, and

               <p>Q. You asked him leave to do it. Well, when you went down stairs, you left him at work? - Yes. I returned again at four o'clock the same afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you what sort of a thing it was that they stamped these papers with? - It was a brass metal with a stamp engraved on it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was it done? - The paper was laid on the bottom of the press, and then the brass plate laid on it, and the fly with a handle forced the screw down on it.</p>
               <p>Q. The stamp was not thrown down with the fly and up again, it was laid down? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. So that for each one it was necessary to take it up, and lay it down on it? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You went down stairs and returned at four o'clock in the afternoon? - Yes. After I came, there were three hundred and twenty-three packed up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation while you was in the room or before you left it, with respect to the operation? - The work shook the room, and I mentioned it to Solomon, and he said there was no danger.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed to him, what did you say? - I told him it caused to shake the room very much, and I was afraid it would alarm the neighbourhood; and he said, there was no danger.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned at four o'clock in the afternoon, there were three hundred and how many? - Three hundred and twenty odd packed up, and a direction wrote upon it, to Mr. Wolfe, at Portsmouth.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that in the presence of Solomon? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with them? - They were taken to the inn in Gracechurch-street, where the mail goes out.</p>
               <p>Q.Who took them? - I am not certain whether it was Solomon or the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. What mail coach? - To Portmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next thing that happened? - I also wrote a letter to Mr. Wolfe, by the post, in Hebrew, and acquainted him that I sent him such a parcel, and desired to have some remittance; two days after I received a letter, at the New York Coffee house enclosing me a Portsmouth bank note of fifty pounds, and a banker's checque for ten pounds, on Sir James Esdaile and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the note if you was to see it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Shew him first the Portsmouth and Hampshire note. What became of the letter that enclosed these two bills? - It has been destroyed.</p>

            Idswell? - The late Idswell's.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the next thing that took place? - I wrote a letter to Mr. Wolfe, acquainting him that I had drawn a bill on him him for forty pounds, and I hoped he would acknowledge it; about eight days after I received a letter from Mr. Wolfe, desiring to have a quantity of stamps on parchment; there was an order wrote in English, which I tore off and gave to the late Idswell.</p>

               <p>Q. How much was the amount of the order for parchment? - Twenty pounds ten shillings it came to after it was paid.</p>
               <p>Q. You delivered that order to the late. Idswell? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it? Was there any remittance in that letter? - No.</p>
               <p>Q.What was done with that order for the parchment? - I gave it to the late Idswell, and he went into Birchin-lane; I went with him, and he shewed the order to Mr. Weatherby, and left it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the parchment order was left there to be executed? - It was. After a few days the order was got ready, and the lateIdswell went himself, and paid for it, and conveyed it to Mr. Wolfe the same as the other. About three weeks after I received another letter from Mr. Wolfe, where in he mentions to have some twopenny, sixpenny, and fourpenny stamps; I also carried it to the late Idswell's house, and myself and him went opposite the India House, at a stationer's, and there we purchused them, about five pounds and upwards, which I paid for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. The Idswells were not provided with any stamp except the six shilling; so that the other order, and the order for parchment, you were obliged to get executed elsewhere? - Yes, we were. Mr. Wolfe requested me not to send him any more six shilling stamps, unless he should first acquaint me. I wrote a letter to Mr. Wolse, that I should comply with his order for small stamps, and also send him four hundred powers of attorney. I then went by myself to Mount and Page, on Tower-hill, and bought fourteen quires of blank powers.</p>
               <p>Q.Unstamped of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And what did you do with them? - I brought them to the late Idswell's house in St. Mary-axe.</p>
               <p>Q. The same place where the others had been stamped? - Yes. They were also stamped the same as the others were. I went up stairs for a little time that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you find in the garret when you went up stairs? - Solomon Idswell.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing? - The same as before.</p>
               <p>Q. He was at work? - Yes, stamping.</p>
               <p>Q.Now how long might you stay with him the time that he was stamping these papers, that you brought from Mount and Page's? - I did not stay with him above five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you go again; how soon were they finished? - I did not come the same day. They were also conveyed to Gracechurch-street, to be conveyed to Mr. Wolse.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were sent? - Because I received a letter from Mr. Wolse acknowledging them, and that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200060"></xptr>night I wrote a letter to Mr. Wolfe that he would receive them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were sent? - Four hundred, all powers of attorney, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go back to St. Maryaxe that night? - No, I went to the prisoner's own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner's own house? - In Baker's-buildings, Broad-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you six the day when you bought this at Mount's and Page's? - Tuesday or Wednesday, I cannot say the day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to Baker's-buildings what did you see there? - They were packed up to be sent to Mr. Wolfe. I see Soloman packing up the four hundred powers and the smaller stamps, to be conveyed to Mr. Wolfe.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know what that parcel consisted of? - I see them, he looked them over for to send them to Mr. Wolfe. Counted them I believe, and packed them up in a parcel to be sent to Mr. Wolfe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you the same evening write a letter of advice to Mr. Wolfe that they would be sent? - I did, and also requesting some remittance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the parcel carried to Gracechurch-street? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.You went away and left the parcel there? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you receive? - I received a letter two days afterwards, concerning the receipt of the stamps, and enclosing a bill of fifty pounds. (A bill shewn him.) That is the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it enclose any thing else? - Nothing else. I gave it to the late Idswell, and Idswell also 
               <persName id="t17950520-26-person290">

               <p>Q. You subscribed your name to it? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who wrote the body of it, did you see it wrote? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you acquainted with the hand writing? - No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q.Who produced it to you to sign your name to it? - The late Idswell shewed it to me to sign it at the New York Coffee-house, at the same time both brothers were there.</p>
               <p>Q. They were then both together? - Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had signed it, what became of it? - I gave it to the late Idswell to go to Smith, Pratts, and Hardy, silversmiths Cheapside, in order to send it to Portsmouth for acceptance.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next thing that happened? - Two days after I went myself, and the late Idswell went to Pratts, Smith, and Hardy, silversmiths, in Cheapside, and got my bill there returned from Portsmouth accepted by Mr. Wolfe, and he discounted it, and gave gold for it.</p>
               <p>Q.What you call fine gold? - Yes; not coin gold. Then he gave me half that money, half the fifty pounds, and half of fifty-five pounds, the late Idswell did.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you do with the fine gold that you got at Pratts? - He disposed of it, he gave me the allowance of that.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next thing that happened? - He told me then that he must not work any more, he must leave off making stamps in that house, he said it was no matter, there was another house where they had been making some louisdors before. Then they removed to Smith's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who removed to Smith's? - He mentioned the house; in the mean time I went to Portsmouth, and received about seven or eight pounds of Mr. Wolfe.</p>
               <p>Q. On this account? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned where did find the Idswells? - I found Idswell in St. Mary-axe, and some time after he took the press in a coach; I went with him in the coach to Cornhill. I did not go with him to the house, I left him there, and he took it to Smith's.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you understand he took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200061"></xptr>it to? - Into Church Entry, Blackfriars. I left him with his fly and press together in the coach, and went home.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon did you see them again? - I see the late Idswell almost every day. In about a fortnight after the late Idswell went to Smith's house again, the late Idswell took me up stairs, and shewed me a table in the room.</p>
               <p>Q.Then the late Idswell went up stairs with you, did this man go up stairs with you, or did you find him in the room? - I found the table and the press, and the press fixed on a very strong board, stronger than in St. Mary-axe.</p>
               <p> Court. About a fortnight after you see the press in Smith's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same press you see in St. Mary-axe? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the press was on a flouter board than in St. Mary-axe? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The press and fly were the same? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time see the prisoner there? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after? - About four or five days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the press before you see the prisoner there in working condition fixed? - Yes, it was. Then four or five days after, I went there with the late Idswell, and Solomon also was making of stamps.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he in the same operation as you see him in St. Mary-axe? - He was.</p>

               <p>Q.How long might you stay while this man was working at Smith's house at that time? - Not long, I did not stop but a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.From the quantity that appeared to be done, did he seem to have been long at work at that time? - No, he did not. The greatest part was unstamped at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity might there be laying there for the purpose of stamping? - Not above fifty. I returned again in the afternoon, and took away from Smith's what were made.</p>

               <p>Q.What was the next particular transaction? - That was Sunday, on Monday I called there again, and I also took what was made.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see this man either on Monday or Tuesday? - No, I did not. On the first Sunday I see him there, and the Wednesday following they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, you and the late Idswell were apprehended? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.This man was not apprehended for some days after? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the die on which the impression was made in Smith's house the same that had been used in St. Mary-axe? - It was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any other stamps besides, and dies for making stamps? - Yes, there were other stamps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see these in possession of this prisoner? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is not material on this indictment, so I will not pursue it.</p>
               <p>Court. You don't know who took this first parcel to the mail coach in Grace-church-street? - I have forgot whether it was Solomon Idswell or Idswell Idswell, I am not positive.</p>

               <p>Q. This you say you believe to be the one that you saw in St. Mary-axe, and at Smith's; the board is not the same that was in St. Mary-axe, but the iron work you believe is the same? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. When was it the late Idswell first applied to you? - About four months before I got into trouble.</p>
               <p>Q.About what month was that? - In October.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you never was in custody on no charge? - I was once, in the year 1791, doing my business I happened to have a misfortune concerning the navy; there was a probate of a will brought to me, and it was supposed to be a forgery; I was ordered by the navy board to attend the board, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not then taken into custody at all for that? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a man of the name of Welch, concerned in that business? - That was a woman, recommended by a man, of the name of Welch.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave in some bail for attendance on a future day? - No, I did not to the navy board.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you this fact, whether nobody passed their word for you to attend the second time? - Not at the navy board; I received a letter from the navy board to attend on Tuesday, which I did; when I came there, they asked me where I came by this paper? and I told them it was brought to me by a woman, for to receive the money.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you ever in custody on any charge at all? - No, I never was; the gentleman of the navy board were satisfied, if I would promise to detain the man and woman, when they came; at the same time the advocate for the navy board laid, they were not satisfied, and then I came away, and never came forward.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you whether you did not give bail to come the next day before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200063"></xptr>the justice? - I asked your advice, and you advised me not to come forward, and I left the country, and it has been the total ruin of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you set off and go to Hamborough? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in Hamborough? - Four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in London in this four or five years? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever appear public in London again, till Mrs. Welch, who had something to do in this transaction, was dead? - I don't know that she is dead, I did not hear so.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not in consequence of hearing that Mrs. Welch was dead, that you publickly appeared in London? - People might say it, it may be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not? - It might, I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not?Did not you keep out of the way till you heard Mrs. Welch was dead?</p>
               <p>Court. What signifies pursuing it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Do you know any body of the name of Barnard? - Yes, I do.</p>

               <p>Q. He was a bankrupt? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. What debt did you prove under that commission? - Fifty pounds, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. O, a great deal more than that, three or four hundred pounds I believe? What did you claim to prove? - I did not claim more than fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Never? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to swear that under Barnard's commission, you never claimed more than fifty pounds? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor ever, swore that he owed you three or four hundred pounds? - Never swore it.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean publickly, but by affidavit? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. What might you have been, the greatest part of your life? - I was in very good business in the navy; I have been as well to do as some of the first merchants in London, till such times as I got acquainted with the late Idswell; I have done business for twelve or thirteen years in the navy.</p>
               <p>Q.Now I take it for granted, you have always got your livelihood as an honest man? - I did always, till I became acquainted with the Idswells.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as you were an honest man, Idswell Idswell did not seem to be under much difficulty to persuade you into the plan? - In fact they got me under so much, that any thing they asked me to do, I should have done.</p>
               <p>Q.When you were taken up you expected to be prosecuted, did not you? - Why, yes. The advice I received was that opinion, the person advising me to go off, as they might commit me.</p>
               <p>Q. I am now asking you about the last transaction; when you was taken up, you expected to be prosecuted? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. No! when you was taken up for this forgery? - Certainly I did expect it.</p>
               <p>Q. And in order to prevent your being prosecuted, you stated this charge against Idswell? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing of Mrs. Welch's death? - She is not dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Who furnished Mrs. Welch with money to go to Ireland, just before you came from Hamborough? - I could have brought the man to justice, but I did not choose to do it.</p>
               <p>Q.Who furnished Mrs. Welch with money to go to Ireland, just before you came from Hamborough, and just before it was reported she was dead? - I did, but she is not dead.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had given the account to these persons who are carrying on this</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200064"></xptr>prosecution, you had a copy of your evidence? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember stating to any body, that the contents that was put on that paper, was not true? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said there was a great deal more put down than you could positively swear to? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever ask any friends advice, how far it would be necessary to swear, in order to save yourself? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You never consuited with any body about the evidence you should give when you came into court? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. That is as true as all the rest you have sworn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know a person of the name of Bryant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What was Bryant? - He was late clerk to the prison where I was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same prison in which a person of the name of Norwood was in custody?</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. That is extremely irregular, Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am not going to ask what Mr. Bryant said to him, or him to Mr. Bryant, I only want to bring Mr. Bryant's name on your lordship's book, then in order to ascertain the locus in quo, I ask whether that is the same prison in which Mr. Norwood was in custody.</p>
               <p>Witness. I slept in the room with Bryant.</p>
               <p>Court. Who is Bryant? - He was clerk to the keeper of the House of Correction, where I was; we were friendly together at first, but I found him quite different at the latter end.</p>

               <p>Q.Employed by them in engraving the dies with which the stamps are impressed? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you by their direction engrave a die for a six shilling stamp, with the letter E? - I did, by a warrant from the commissioners.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you had the opportunity of looking over a great many stamps, which were suspected to be forged? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q.Who produced them to you? - Mr. Whittard.</p>
               <p>Q.Were all these that were produced to you, genuine or forged? - They were forged.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it to you obvious without a glass? - I cannot see without a glass.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q.What is it in that you call a forgery? - It is a cross, and very heavy, and different in shape.</p>

               <p>Court. I see this is so badly impressed, that half the sixpence on the right hand side, has made no impression at all? - No, it is very imperfect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Major. You who have engraved the one, have no difficulty whatever in stating that the other is a forgery? - None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that all that Mr. Whittard shewed you were forged? - Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q.And the die of the one that you produce; the genuine one has been the one used by the commissioners, which you made under their direction? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. How long has that stamp been used? - Since the year 1788; I have the warrant in my pocket, it is the 27th of May 1788, and finished by me by the August, pursuant to that order.</p>
               <p>Court. And been used ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Whittard. Did you shew to Mr. Major all these that are here produced? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that include that one that Wolfe himself had taken, that power that he had spoken of? - I believe so.</p>

               <p>Q. In what manner did you fix it? -  I put two braces to it, from the ceiling, and from the wainscotting,from the bottom to the stand, to make it stronger, and one I put at the end.</p>

               <p>Q. Looking at that, can you say, that is the same that you saw the last time? - I cannot say it is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be the same? - It is the same in point of size.</p>

I said, between eleven and twelve; and I said, we were rather watched by a person. He said, he did not do any thing that was unlawful, and that they might come home and see what was transacted; as he did not do any thing that he was afraid of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he try the press, to see if it went easy? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever, in your presence? - No, he did not in my presence; he never put any thing to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any observation on the instrument going either free or stiff, or any other observation on it? - He said, that the sliding bar would go stiff; and I said, it will go better when you put some oil on it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it placed upon when the porter took it home? - On a mahogany table, in the one pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you seen this under your husband's care? - It has been broke twice or three times, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200071"></xptr>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar at all? - I had no knowledge of the person at all. The first time that we made a small press of this description, there came a strange person to order it, and Mr. Cheshire came the next day for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you don't now know the person? - I don't know that I do.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever seen the prisoner at the bar, upon your oath? - That person looks like the person.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not seen him since he has been in custody, and therefore you may be very honest for what I know. Do you believe the man at the bar, to be the person that you describe as a stranger that came to you giving the order for the press? - Yes, I believe it is, and I thought the paper described the person that came about the press.</p>
               <p>Q. You see an advertisement, and you thought that described the person? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Looking at him, do you think that that is the man? - Yes, I really believe to my conscience that that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. And the press which you verily believe in your conscience the prisoner ordered, was fetched away by Cheshire? - It was.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not this press, but a smaller? - Not this, a smaller.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. These presses are made for a great many other things? - Yes, they are manufactured to the weight of five hundred weight for clothiers.</p>
               <p>Jury. Pray were you present when the person came to give the order? - I was present in my own house, and called out by the clerk of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it Cheshire, or the stranger, the prisoner? - I took it of a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q.Which stranger you believe to be the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that press was afterwards took away by Cheshire? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. But you never saw the stranger, whoever he was, about that press after? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. When was the order given to you about this small press? - About the beginning of February.</p>
               <p>Q. To Cheshire. What did you do with the small press that you received in February? - It was the same size as this; the porter took it away after I put it together.</p>

               <p>Q.Be so good to tell us what past between them when they came to your house? - The young man, he that is dead, asked me if I had a room to let, and I told him yes; and he asked me if I had a garret, I told him yes, and he went up stairs to see it. The young man ran up stairs by himself as far as I know, he went up stairs and did not stay any longer than to go up and down; and I said, sir, will it do? he said he did not know, but he would call in a day or two and let me know. The young Mr. Idswell he called a day or two after, and asked me if I had a key to either of these garrets? - I said, I believed there was one in one of the doors. I advised him to have the biggest, because<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200072"></xptr>it had two windows, but the young one said he would take the least, and he gave me half a guinea earnest.</p>
               <p>Q. When did they come and take possession of the place? - They never had their things in my house to my knowledge. On Shrove Tuesday he asked me, says he, what time shall you be up to-morrow. I said, I shall be up between six and seven; says he, I shall send in some things. The next day Mr. Jonas called at my house, about eleven o'clock, and asked me if I had seen either of his brothers; and I said no, and he went away, and in ten minutes he returned with the prisoner at the bar; then they rested at the school room door and spoke to each other, and I spoke to Mr. Idswell. I said to Mr. Idswell, your brother is a pretty gentleman. I thought he was to bring his tools in and come to work; says he, Mrs. Smith, my brother he is under a little dilemma, he is arrested; then they went out together, and about eight o'clock the prisoner and Jonas called again, and I asked if they had seen their brother? they said, no, they were going to see him, and if they did not make haste, they should not see him before he was locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at the board before you. Did you ever see it before? - About six o'clock that day a man brought it down from the garret, and took it down into the school room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same day as Mr. Idswell was arrested? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen this before? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. It was no part of your property? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know that such an article was in your garret? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not there before Idswell took your garret? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was brought down into your school room, was it as it is now, or had it legs to it? - Then it had. The man put it in the wash house, and when Mr. Idswell came, I told him that a man had been to take a table out of the garret, and it was in the wash house, and he said there let it be, and I asked him what I was to do with the legs? there were two pieces of legs loose laying down; he said, I might have them for fire wood.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe they were in fact cut up for fire wood? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. The officer came to your house very soon after? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did they come to your house from Bow-street? - It was not ten minutes before they came; I don't know where they came from. I was had up to Bow-street, and I told them where that board was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Idswell drinking tea at your house? - The brother did.</p>
               <p>Q. Not this man? - I don't know that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come at the same time? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring any thing? - He brought a piece of iron in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew it to you? - I should not know it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give it you to feel the weight of it? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it look like? - It looked like the bit of a top of a wedge broke off, to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it look pretty weighty? - Not a great piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing that to be broke, what part of that would look like it? - I don't know that that is like it.</p>
               <p>Court. You see that board brought into your house. Did not you? - No, indeed I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How often were they in your house? - The deceased Mr. Idswell, was several times at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner there several times? - The prisoner was not there above<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200073"></xptr>twice or three times. He was twice, that I know of, on that day that his brother was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you recollect a man of the name of Moses calling on him? - There was a man called but I don't know his name;(looks at him) I believe that is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was out of town part of the time? - I was out of town from Thursday morning till Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at Moses. - I really think he is the man, but he was not powdered nor dressed so when he was at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. To Moses.Is that the woman that you saw? - That is Smith's wife.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Smith. Did you ever see that iron part before? - No, never at my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You remonstrated with the Idswell that is dead, that he never came to work there? - No, it is the brother.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen him come to work? - No, I never see him that morning.</p>

            While you had the garret, there was a thumping in the next room to you? - There was. I said to my daughter, when I see blank paper go in, it is my opinion they are making stamps. It was like the turning of a printer's press,but not fast, one after another.</p>
               <p>Q. What rooms did you occupy? - I keep a room in the one pair of stairs, and one in the two pair.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. How dared you to continue in court? I move, my lord, that he be committed.</p>
               <p>Witness. As I was subpoenaed on both sides, I thought there would be no objection to me.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you communicate that you had been in the gallery during the trial? - I did not communicate it to any.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to stop, that you might not be examined? - Nobody desired me to stop.</p>
               <p>The witness was ordered out of court, while the propriety and legality of examining him was argued by the counsel on both sides. Mr. Garrow concluded, that he should not examine him, but begged he might be called in, and committed to Newgate. The witness was accordingly called in.</p>
               <p>Court. Where have you been during this trial? - I was up in the gallery.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you come in? - When they were calling over the jury.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard what the witnesses have said? - I did not give any attention to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear me say, that no man should be examined that remained in court? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you? - I am a shoe-maker; keep a shop in Bartholomew-lane, near the Bank. I did not understand it; I never was in court to give evidence in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the prisoner to know that you was in court? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you dare to remain in court? the only way to prevent this in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200075"></xptr>future is, to commit you to Newgate tonight? - Indeed, I was ignorant of it; I never was in a court on evidence before; I hope your lordship will take it into consideration, not to send me to any place to confine me.

               <p>Q. You have had frequent occasions to see them write? - Not so well this; but the other I knew very well; he has been a client of mine; I have done several things for him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow desired the short-hand writer to be particular; asked him if he saw him sworn? and as he could not say he saw the witness sworn, he was now sworn again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Isaacs. You have been acquainted with the deceased Idswell from his infancy? - I knew them both.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with this prisoner? - I knew them both from the same time.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you had an opportunity of seeing this prisoner write? - Never in my life, excepting once, about four or five years ago; that was in his putting his signature to an affidavit to arrest upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good to take this bill of fifty-five pounds into your hands, and attend to my question. I don't ask you to swear positively. On the oath you have taken, whose do you believe that hand writing in the body of the bill to be? - I cannot believe to it; I do not believe it to be Solomon's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.On the oath you have taken, whose hand-writing do you believe the body of that bill to be? - I am positively at a loss what to say. I do not believe that to be the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you believe it is not? - Attend a little, have you, besides seeing him write his name once, have you seen writing which you have known of him to be his? - Never in my life. I have had some writing, but I did not know they were him. I was concerned for a bunch-backed man in the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know from this man whether these papers that related to this bunch-backed man were his writing or not? - I never see him.</p>

             whether the paper was his handwriting or not? Do you mean to say, that looking at that, you cannot form any belief whether it is his hand-writing or not?</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. I object to that question.</p>
               <p>Witness. I have known both the Idswells; I was in the habits of using the coffee-house where they used every night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then you choose to say, that you have no knowledge of his hand-writing, and can form no belief of it? - I cannot; I only see him write once, Solomon Idswell.</p>
               <p>Q.Be so good to look at that, and tell me whether that is the hand-writing of the deceased Idswell Idswell? - That is the deceased's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.You have no doubt about that, I dare say? - No, that is his hand writing. When Mr. Escott shewed me these two papers, both men were living at the time, therefore I said that I knew Idswell's hand-writing, and this is it. This is a month or six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q.(Another paper shewn him) Now, tell me whose hand writing the body of that is? - Idswell Idswell's; I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at it; have you any doubt about it? - Very little; I have no doubt about it; but it is a very great thing to swear to a man's hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Moses? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - I lately was clerk to the New Prison, Cold Bath-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the prison to which Moses was sent? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Moses when he underwent his examination at Bow-street? - I took Moses up once to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that when he was examined there? - I took him up on another circumstance, not on the subject of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Moses say any thing respecting giving evidence on this occasion? - Moses was in my apartment when I was clerk. When the prisoner at the bar was committed to our prison, I made a tender under the circumstances to the governor, Mr. Ayris, that he should have my room, that he should sleep in my bed chamber; and I would sleep in my sitting room.</p>

               <p>Court. Are you still in the gaol? - No, I am not; I left it about three weeks. I have the misfortune to be in the king's bench for debt. I am brought up now by Habeas Corpus.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What conversation had you with Moses, on the subject of this case? - There was hardly a day ever past that Moses was not continually speaking to me about his situation as an evidence; always continually. I dare say if we talked of it once, we talked of it two hundred times.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - He expressed a deal of sorrow that the two brothers were likely to lose their lives by the situation in which he was placed, but he must do the best for himself, and for the sake of his family. He said that he had lived in intimacy with the two brothers for years, and that they had always behaved as men to him, and that they were on strict terms of friendship.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing that you can recollect at any time? - I don't recollect that he ever said any thing else than wishing they might get through their difficulty both of them; and when the other brother was shot, he was agitated for several days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Moses had a copy of his examination at any time? - Yes, I have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how he came by it? - I took the case by a messenger that came from the Stamp office; I took it to Mr. Ayris, the governor. He often wished to have a copy, and I asked Lavender for it at first, and Lavender said it would come from the Stamp office.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200078"></xptr>Q. Did you ever hear any person say any thing to Moses respecting his examination? - I don't recollect any thing about that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You can tell us of some very handsome offer that was made to Mr. Moses on this subject? - I never heard one in my life, never heard directly or indirectly.</p>
               <p>Q. You are discharged from your situation now? - No, I resigned; I wrote two letters to that purpose.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses with whom he had dealt, who spoke of him as always paying them for what he had, and that he was a general trader.</p>

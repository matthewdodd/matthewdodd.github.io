            . I am a labourer in the East India Company's service. I was employed in the same warehouse as the prisoner; that warehouse contained spices. There was a great quantity of nutmegs in that warehouse. On the 17th of September I observed the prisoner; he put his hand and took a handfull of nutmegs from the sieve; he dropped a few back again; he put the rest of them into his left hand coat pocket; he went away, and came back again to the sieve, and took a few more of them; he went away, and came the third time; he took up a few more again, then he went away. Mr. Brown, the elder, came up, I reported it to him, and he reported it to the warehouse-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the hand that put was put into the sieve belonged to the body of the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>

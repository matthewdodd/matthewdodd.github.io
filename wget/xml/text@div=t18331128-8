I have got no watch;" I took it from his waistcoat pocket - I led him back to the house, and gave the watch to my mistress, and held the prisoner till my wife brought the policeman, and I gave him in charge - I had him in the garden waiting till the policeman came - Mrs. Ventom delivered the watch in my presence to the officer; I swear it is the same.</p>

Mrs. Kenney came to me; I went to Mr. Ventom's and saw the prisoner there - I received a watch from Mrs. Ventom, and took charge of the prisoner - I searched the prisoner, and found this handkerchief, a card case, two keys, a knife, a screw-driver, 1s. 6d. in silver, and 7 1/2d. in copper on him; when he was given in my charge (after I searched him,) he asked the lady two or three times to forgive him, saying, it was the first offence he had committed, and hoped she would look over it; and he asked me what I thought would be the punishment of such a crime - he said his mother was a hard-working industrious woman, living in Bethnal-green - he appeared very much distressed at what had occurred, not hardened, but more timid - I took him to the station-house; he said it was the first offence he had committed, and wished to be forgiven.</p>

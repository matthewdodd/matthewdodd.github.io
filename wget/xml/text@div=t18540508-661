                  </hi>. I am a chair maker, of No. 84, Curtain-road, Shore<lb></lb>ditch. On 21st Dec. the prisoner, who I had known previously, came to my premises, and told me he had a large quantity of walnut wood for sale, at Isleworth—I went there with him, and he showed me some walnut wood, in Mr. Chitty's yard there, and told me he would sell me some of it—I selected three loads, which I was to give 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a load for, and on the receipt of them, to give him a bill of four months; I was not to give him the bill before I received it—on 2nd Dec, he came again to me in the Curtain-road, and told me he had just come from Isleworth, and that the wood was loaded on the wagon—I was on the way to my house—he said it would make no difference to me, and would be an accommodation to him, if I would accept the bill—he produced a bill stamp, bat I do not think the bill was drawn—I accepted it, but not in blank, it was drawn then—if I had not believed the wood to be on its way, and had been carted, I should not have accepted it—I have never got the timber—the bill is due, but I have not paid it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DUNCAN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have; you known him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two years—he is a chair manufacturer in Old-street—I had not stated the quantity of walnut wood I wanted to purchase, before I went to Isleworth with him—we went there about 2 o'clock, and then went together to Mr. Chitty's premises; I did not see Mr. Chitty; I saw him afterwards during the day—I agreed to purchase three loads, at 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per load—he showed me the wood, and I selected out of it, and said I would give him a bill at four months, on the receipt of it—I believe he proposed three months, and I said "No; four months"—I will not swear it—there was nobody else present—a load of wood is 600 cubic feet—it was in plank—after that, I went with the defendant to a public house; the Chequers—we got there about half past 3 o'clock, and stopped some time—I will swear it was not half past 8 o'clock before we left, but I did not take notice whether it was past 8—I saw Mr. Chitty there; he was in conversation with the defendant and me—we met him on the road, but did not speak to him—I did not know him at that time—he stayed with us at the Chequers—I and the defendant went away and left him there—we drank some porter or ale; I did not drink much, I was very ill at the time—I can undertake to say I did not keep continually drinking with Westrop and Chitty all the time I was there—there were not fifteen quarts of ale drank between us; I swear I did not drink a pint—I went with Westrop as far as the railway—we did not go back to Mr. Chitty's that night—the wood was in two lots by themselves; eighty-two planks laid on the top of some others—I swear I never said on the night of the 21st, "If it will be any accommodation to you, Mr. Westrop, I will accept your draft at four months"—Westrop came to my house on the morning of the 22nd, somewhere about 11 o'clock; no one was present then—I should not have given him my acceptance, if he had said that the planks would be down in the course of to-morrow; nor if he had said I should have them in forty-eight hours—when I found that they did not come, I went to his house the next day, the 23rd, and told him the wood had not come up; he said it would be sure to be up on that day; I said, "Very well"—it did not come on the 23rd either, and it has not come yet—I saw him on the 24th, and he said he was going to see about it—I dare say I had 100 interviews with him, between 22nd Dec. and 4th March—I kept calling there—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185405080100"></xptr>
               <p>instructed Mr. Dunbedine to issue a writ against him on 4th March—I had waited till then, because he kept continually making excuses—there was frosty weather after Christmas, and he said that the horses could not stand, which I thought was a very feasible excuse—it lasted about a fortnight—I have had other wood from Westrop since 22nd Dec.; that was walnut tree wood—I had two planks on 24th Jan.—the price of the whole of it was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was not to come off the account, or to interfere with the other wood at all; he said that—it was to be a new purchase, and he had to take a bill of my acceptance; he never got it, because I have never had any more to make up the load, and he has never applied for it—the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth was part of an unlimited quantity—I was to have any quantity I wanted, and when I got as much as would suit me, I was to give him a bill—there was no amount mentioned by him that I was to go up to, nor any specified time—there was no date mentioned for the bill—he did not offer me some of Mr. Gordon's wood, or any other wood—he did not tell me I might take as much of the walnut wood in his yard as I liked; nor did I say, "No; I will not take any more of that; I will wait for the wood from Isleworth"—I will swear that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear that you did not say you would not take any more of that wood which you gave 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for, because it was not dry enough? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said I would not have any more, but I did not add that I would wait for the Isleworth wood—I was constantly expecting it—I had a large order on hand, and bought that wood to execute it, and I have never been able to execute it—I will not swear that I did not say, "No, I will wait;" but I do not believe I did—I never gave him any threat of any legal proceedings—I got a memorandum from him about the end of Jan.—I believe my solicitor has that—I did not send a letter to Westrop, or direct a letter to be sent to him, directing him to send the bill, or a writ would be issued—I did not send him any letter—I did not direct my attorney to send him any letter before the writ—I never said or gave authority that the action should be stayed if I had the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to retain, nor did I direct my attorney to do so; I left it entirely in his hands—I gave no directions about it whatever; that action is not yet tried, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever use these words in April to any one, "It is gone too far, it cannot be stopped now; if I cannot get anything out of the civil law, I will go to the criminal law?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never did—I believe it was on 22nd or 23rd April that I gave directions to the police officer to take him into custody—I instigated that idea myself—on 21st April I went down to Mr. Chitty's place, and saw him—I asked him if the wood was Mr. Westrop's; he said, "No," and that he had no power to sell it—I asked him if there had been a wagon there on the 22nd; he said, "No," and that it was not his wood—Mr. Westrop had told me that it was to be his, but it was on condition that not one bit of the wood was to be removed till the money was paid—I gave him into custody, because I considered that he had obtained it by false pretences—if I had known it before, I should have given him into custody before—I did not go into the matter with Mr. Chitty of how much had been paid; I asked him, on 21st Dec, if that wood was his for sale, and he told me "No," that he had paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, and that was all, he told me: I did not want to go any further into his business—I men<lb></lb>tioned to a dozen persons, I dare say, that Mr. Westrop had obtained a bill of me; none of them are hero—I do not suppose it would take above ten or fifteen minutes to measure a load of timber, 600 cubic feet; it depends upon who measures it—I dare say a load of timber would weigh a ton and a half.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Isleworth, and keep a timber yard there. I have seen the prisoner—I do not recollect 21st Dec.—the prisoner had not carted any timber away from my yard in Dec., nor had he the least right to do so—no portion of it was removed at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you remember one day in Dec. being at the Chequers public house with Westrop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not—I do not recollect seeing Westrop and Isaacs together—if we three were together I do not recollect anything about it—I did not see a couple of men come to my pre<lb></lb>mises from Westrop on 23rd Dec., nor did I, to my knowledge, point out any wood to them as the wood sold by Westrop to Isaacs—I cannot say whether it was before or after Christmas that a red brand was put on some of Westrop's wood—I do not know what it meant, nor can I tell on how many loads it was put—the weather was not so bad that the timber could not be taken away if it had been paid for—the wood might have been carted away supposing all the money had been paid—since that I have had 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid me on Mr. Westrop's behalf, and he sent me a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill which was not honoured, and I have been obliged to take it up, since which he has sent me a note to meet his creditors, which I do not like—it would take five or ten minutes to measure three cartloads of this wood if it was in the log, but as it is it would take two or three hours, leading and everything—most of it is in plank—it takes five wagons to cart what is technically called three loads of timber.</p>

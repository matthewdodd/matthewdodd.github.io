                  </hi>. I am clerk to a merchant, and live in Rose<lb></lb>place, Mile End-road. I am acquainted with Mr. Claxton. On the morning of the 24th of May, by his direction, I watched, and saw his wagon at Briggs's cow-yard, Hackney-road, loading—I watched the prisoner from there to Cam<lb></lb>bridge-heath-road—the nosebags appeared to have been emptied into another bag—there was one bag containing something—I watched him down to the premises of Chadwick, a green-grocer, in Cambridge-heath-road—when he got near there the wagon stopped, and the prisoner took a bag from the fore part of it, and went up a passage behind the man's premises, and shot it into the bin in the stable—I got a policeman, went with him, showed him the bin, and it turned out to be the horses provender—the policeman took possession of it put it into a sack, and brought it to the station—the policeman and I followed the prisoner—I came up with him in Bow-road, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 365.) On the morning of the 24th of May, in consequence of what Mr. Gillas told me, I went into Chadwick's stable, and in a bin which he pointed out, I found a quantity of food for horses, which I took charge of, and produce—I afterwards took the prisoner into custody—I told him he was charged with robbing his master of some corn—he said, "Oh, it is only that I picked up on the road."</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Cann-hall, Wanstead—the prisoner was in my service about a year and a quarter this time—he had been so before, as carman—in consequence of some suspicions I entertained, I gave directions to Mr. Gillas—on the morning of the 24th of May, I sent the prisoner out to Mr. Briggs', in Hackney-road, for a load of manure—he took three horses and a nosebag—I examined the nosebag before it left my yard—it was full of cut chaff, bran, and beans, mixed—when it came back it was empty—this pro<lb></lb>duced is such as they usually bait their horses with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know anything about the corn that went out on this particular morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was such corn as this, it is what I feed all my horses with—I charge him with stealing a portion of what he took out in the nosebag, and which ought to have fed the horses—if they had been fed properly it would not have been brought back—it would depend on the time they were on the road—a portion usually comes back—I went to Briggs's yard with Gillas, to watch, and was there from nine till half-past nine o'clock, while the cart was loading—I got there about the time the cart arrived—Briggs keeps horses.</p>

               <p>did not see the cart leave Briggs's—I had then left—the nose-bags were then full, on the horses—it was his duty to go direct from Briggs's to my house—he had no right to stop on the road—Mr. and Mrs. Chadwick were brought before the Magistrate, and were dismissed—the sack is not mine, it is one which the officer found at Chadwick's, and put the corn in—I expect that the corn was emptied out of the nose-bags in Mr. Briggs's yard—there were two wagons together on this day.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

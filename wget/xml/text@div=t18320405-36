The prisoner brought a haunch of mutton; I took it of him - there was a bill on it, which I took to my mistress, and she gave me three half-crowns and two shillings, which I gave to the prisoner; the bill was 9s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure you paid it him? A. Yes; my master was in the drawing-room with my mistress at the time - this is the bill, but there is no receipt to it; I did not think to ask him to write any - I did not tell him my master was not at home; I have lived five months with Mr. Pitman - I am nurse, but I opened the door as I was going up stairs; the prisoner said I had not paid him, but I am certain I did.</p>
               <p>MRS. DREW. I sometimes send bills out without receipts to them, but he had authority to write receipts if he got the money; I had a good character with the prisoner: he left me the day after he received this, without notice - he came back about six o'clock on the Sunday morning, and said he was come for his clothes; I said there was a haunch of mutton which he had not paid for; as Mr. Pitman had called and said he had paid for it - he gave me no answer, and I sent for the officer.</p>

            's shepherd. On the 16th of April I went to the fold, and found only ninety-nine sheep there. I traced the footsteps of a man out of the fold, to a field about one hundred yards off, where I found the skin of the sheep - I knew it by the mark. I traced the footsteps out of that field through two others - They lead in a direction towards the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far did you trace them towards the prisoner's house - A. Within a quarter of a mile of it. I compared the carcase with the skin, and it matched it. The bones fit the joints left in the skin exactly. I produce the skin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was on a Wednesday, about eight o'clock in the morning - I saw them on the Saturday before. There are only the prisoner's house and another farm near the field. The sheep had been killed a very short time-the skin was warm, and not stiff.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to the prisoner's house on the 16th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and found him up stairs, in bed. I told him I had a warrant to search his house, read it to him, and proceeded to search. I went into the back room, and found a breast of mutton undressed, and very dirty. On searching further, I found the head in a pail of water, split open, and ready for dressing-it was not cut in a butcher-like manner. I searched the cupboard under the stairs, and found the remainder of the carcase, except the two loins and the fat of the entrails - I took them to the magistrate; they were matched into the skin. One shoulder had a piece out of it, which piece remained in the skin, and matched with it. I asked the prisoner for his shoes, to compare them with the footsteps in the field - He gave them to me without hesitation - They exactly fitted the footsteps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not keep the shoes. I took them to the magistrate, and returned them to the prisoner.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060004"></xptr>They were right and left shoes, and had a few nails in them. There were nails in the impression.</p>

The young man told him his shoes were in the field the overnight, the prisoner said they were not. Soon after that the prisoner looked at me, and said, "Mr. Cane, it is not your sheep." I said it was not mine, but my kinsman's. We searched the house in consequence of information.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not search other houses - A. Yes - They were not near the prisoner's. I had observed the footsteps lead towards the prisoner's house. The entrails were left in the skin. The prisoner did not say he bought the meat.</p>

My little boy was not well, which awoke me in the night. The prisoner answered me once or twice in the night. There is no door to our room:. It was impossible for the prisoner to pass down stairs without my knowing it.</p>

My child awoke about eleven o'clock in the night.</p>

On Tuesday, the 20th of December, the two prisoners came to his shop together, between seven and eight o'clock, and asked to look at some gold ear-rings - I was on the landing-place, and could see all over the shop: they spoke to Mr. Young, and he talked as if he was serving them - I heard Fanny Cave say, "I want some gold ear-rings, not the common ones; I want the best" - my master brought her some in a box; she said,"These are too common; I want the very best fine deadgold ear-rings" - my master went into the counting-house- he returned, and said, "The young woman who manages the business, is gone; I don't know where the case is, will you come again in the morning?" the next night(Wednesday) they came again, and Fanny said, "I have brought this coral ear-ring to match, and I want a pair besides;" at that time Sophia dropped something on the floor, and Fanny said, "Oh, my dear, you have dropped the sovereign;" I could see all that passed - my master then lifted up the candle for her to look for it; she said,"I have got it, Sir," and she picked it up - my master then asked if they would like to see the ear-rings that night- they said they came on purpose; my master then went into the counting-house to get them, and

             went to the glass-case, which was shut - Sophia still stood with her face towards my master; Fanny opened the glass slide of the window, took out the bowl of bugles, and then the comb - she went towards Sophia; I then went down stairs, shut the glass slide of the window, and said, "You have been robbing my master;" Fanny said, "I have not;" she had the bowl and the comb then in her hand - she tried to open the slide, but could not - she then laid down the comb on the counter, the bowl on the glass, and ran to the door; I had not loosed my hold of the glass, and she struck me on my bosom, as she went out - a young man at the door pushed her back again; Sophia still stood in the shop - some of the bugles had fallen on the floor, and I swept them up after they were gone to the Compter - I also swept up some buttons, but I had not seen the prisoner with them in her hand; Sophia had a basket, but I did not see any thing put in there; they had the articles between them when I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not a good sized bowl? A. Not very large - I could not be seen; they stood about two yards and a half from the counting-house, and about two and a half from the door -I was down in a moment - the door was shut; master did not wish to give charge of them, as they had taken nothing, and the officer said, "I will take it on myself."</p>
               <p>WILLIAM YOUNG. On the Tuesday evening these two prisoners came to my shop, and on Wednesday they came again and brought a little drop, or ear-ring, to be matched - they asked to see some good ear-rings; I made a pretence to go for them; I was not gone above a minute and a half, when they opened the sliding sash, and took out the bowl of bugles and the comb - the young woman popped down, and took them; Sophia did not attempt to go - she staid behind with the basket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not wish to prosecute them? A. No, I would sooner put up with the loss - I lost nothing then; there were more valuable things, but they could not see them.</p>

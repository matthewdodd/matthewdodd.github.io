On Monday morning, 26th May, I received information—I went and examined Mr. Laws' premises—I saw foot<lb></lb>marks in a direction towards Ribbins' shop, which is about 300 yards from the factory—when I got to Ribbins' I saw a boy there, and I searched the shop—I found under the counter this piece of pipe, and in the front of the counter was this bag—the man who was with me identified it by the make—from further inquiries I went to Mr. Noble, a marine store-dealer, in Church-street—I there found this large piece of lead—I then went to the Broadway, and saw Ribbins—I told him I wanted him; he must go to the station—he said, "Very well"—I then said to him, "I am about to ask you some questions, and what you say will be told to the Magistrate"—I then asked whether he had purchased any sheet-lead since Saturday—he said, "No"—if he had purchased eleven dozen screws, or a piece of iron pipe, or a bag—he said no, he knew nothing about it—I sent for the piece of lead and showed it him—I said, "Do you know anything about this?"—he said, "No"—I showed him this bag, and this piece of iron pipe—he said he knew nothing about them—he appeared sober; he might have been drinking.</p>

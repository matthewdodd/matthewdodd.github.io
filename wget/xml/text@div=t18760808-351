                  </hi>. I am in the Assay Office of the Gold-mith's Company—on 7th April, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's shop in New Oxford Street, and saw this coffee-pot in the window, labelled "120 years old"—I went in and asked to see it—the I prisoner showed it to me'; he told me that the price was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that it was an antique—I was instructed to purchase it—I also looked at this ewer, I and found on it an old mark, the Roman letter I, which is the hall mark of I 1744—I had received instructions that there were two bottoms, and I judged so by the thickness; the prisoner said that the price was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10., I and I purchased it right off, and asked him to let me take the coffee-pot I on sale or return within two days, which he did, and on further examination I found that the letter M on the coffee-pot represents 1747—I was instructed to purchase it, and went and paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it next day—I have made an assay of the coffee-pot, and it is 2 dwts. in the pound under the standard; it would not have been marked at Goldsmith's Hall on that</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The difference in money value between this and standard silver would be about a 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ounce—the prisoner told me I could take the coffee-pot on approbation, and if I did not approve of it I could exchange it for anything else, but I said "No, I will take it on sale or return within two days," and he was quite content, and for all I know he would have let me have the ewer on the same terms—the information.I had was from Messrs. Prideaux &amp; Son—I had had no communication from Price—a record at Goldsmith's Hall of all the marks; a stranger would not know without referring to me or to a book which is published—I was pretty certain that the coffee-pot was a new manufactured thing, but I knew it was an old mark—I saw one or two other articles in the window, and my doubt was whether it was the thing I was instructed to purchase.</p>

                  </hi>. My father is a solicitor, and is clerk to the Goldsmith's Company; I am assistant clerk—we received information from a man named Price, in consequence of which I directed Harman to go to the defendant's shop and purchase certain articles—we had received minute directions from Price—on 7th April Harman brought these articles to Goldsmith's Hall, and under my directions they were fully tried and tested—the Court never meet oftener than once a month, but the interval is sometimes longer—the information Price gave me also implicated Brown—inquiries were made, and on 5th May we had a writ issued against Gooch, which was served next day, Saturday, and on Monday, 8th May, he came to Goldsmith's Hall and saw my father in his room—we never allow clerks to be present on these occasions—he said he had called in consequence of the writ with which he had been served, that it was a very unfortunate thing for him, and asked us what we should advise him to do—we pointed out to him that the 4th section of the Act enabled him to clear himself by giving the name of the person of whom he bought the article; that he at once and without hesitation expressed himself unable to do—he said that he had bought it in the course of trade, but from whom he could not tell; he repeated that several times, and asked what we should advise him to do—he was told that we could give him no other advice, and that he had better consult his solicitor—he asked if the articles were destroyed; we said no, they were at Goldsmith's Hall, and we were not in the habit of destroy<lb></lb>ng things of that sort—he gave us further explanation, and my father told him pretty plainly that he did not believe him, and that he must know of whom he bought them—this is the writ (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) Gooch left, and next day a clerk from Messrs. Dobree called and paid the two penalties in the accustomed way—Brown was apprehended on the 16th May, and taken before a Magistrate on the 17th and remanded—he was brought up again on the 24th, and Gooch appeared and gave evidence against him—after the 17th the Magistrate issued a summons and directed it to be served—Brown was represented on the 24th by Mr. Alsop, a solicitor, who cross-examined Gooch; his statement was taken down in writing and signed by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My first interview with Price was as near as possible on 31st March last—I did not get the information then; I got it within a week—I did not see him on the first occasion, but on the second I did for some</p>

               <p>considerable time—we are absolutely prohibited from issuing a writ without a written order of the Court—a meeting might be convened, but it is a large body—the prisoner did not make a clean breast of it at first—I did not contemplate any criminal proceedings against Gooch when I saw him on 8th May—I did not think there was sufficient evidence, although I had seen Price a quarter of an hour before—I did not inform Gooch that I was in communication with Price—Brown was given into custody, and Gooch was examined on 8th May—Price was re-called by Mr. Also after Gooch had been examined—the proof in such cases is upon the person who is found in possession—Brown is not. sentenced, he is awaiting his sentence now—we have taken no steps against Price.</p>

I am a silversmith. I have seen the cream ewer before, it has been in my shop. I sold it, it was brought to me by the prisoner, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ounce for it; I assumed it to be old; I looked at the mark. A modern one would be 9?. per ounce. I have had the coffee pot; I sold it. I bought it of the prisoner, not at the same time as the others. I gave him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per ounce; I bought it as being old. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I bought the coffeepot first, it was brought to me in my shop by the prisoner; it was produced to me at his house four or five days before; it was then plain. He said he was going to chase it, there was another one with it; it was sold about the middle of March. I bought the coffee-pot about the 7th or 8th February. I entered the sale in my books, this other one was marked; I sold it for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I sold it as old; I did not know if it was; I bought it as old. I bought the cream ewer about 25th March of the prisoner, that was the first time I saw it. I bought it as an old article, at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ounce; it was a cash transaction. I paid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it is entered in my books. There was no invoice for making it, there might have been a bill for polishing; I have not got it. I generally destroy the small receipts as soon as I have entered the amounts; I have known prisoner, about three months. The cream ewer was not taken by me when it was only a half-pint, I did not take it to prisoner's house. Price was in the shop when it was shown to me. I never said anything to Price about the ewer; I never said to Price they would be very nice things if made antique. I spoke about the chasing. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This coffee pot was complete when I saw it; I believe prisoner showed me the pot. Price was present. I only saw the coffee-pot at Brown's, it was perfectly clean. David L. Gooch."</p>

               <p>previous to this—in January this year I was passing his shop and he was standing at the door—we both said good morning and he invited me in—I asked him for work, and he said "You see how it is, I have got a good man who does my work and a thoroughly experienced man in old-fashioned work, he has had hundreds of pounds from me"—he then stepped behind the counter and said that his man was getting very saucy and he did not like it—he brought up a small piece of silver and asked me if I thought I could make a sugar basket of it—I said "Yes, but it will be a very small one"—he said "You are <hi rend="italic">greener</hi> than I thought you were, this is for a foot," and he showed me a hall mark on the piece of silver and told me to be very careful with it, not to hurt it—he said that old-fashioned work sold better than new and that all he should have to do with it when I brought it home would be to take it down to Goldsmith's Hall and register it, and they would charge him 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce for it, and he said "That is my business"—it was a small piece of silver about two-thirds of the size of my hand—I took it home and thought I was very fortunate—I made the sugar basket and took it back to him and charged him 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per ounce—I found the rest of the silver he then said "I forgot to weigh the piece of silver again, suppose you charge me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce," because I had not allowed him for it; "that will make it straight and there is your money"—I did not get any other work from him then, I was very ill and had to go home—he came to my place two days afterwards, but in the interval I had received a note from Thomas Price—he brought a pint tankard, two milk ewers, eight salt spoons, and a half-pint tankard; they had old marks on them—he told me he wanted the two milk ewers to be gilt inside and polished and the salt cellars also; the pint tankard was to be made into a beer jug, the spoons were to be reduced to the size of a pattern he brought, and the half pint ewer to be made into a pint ewer, with the silver taken off the spoons—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the pint ewer which I made from the half-pint—he had seen some coffee-pots which were being made when he called while I was away ill; he afterwards told me that he would have them and gave me two old salt-cellars with hall marks on them which I was to put on the bottoms—the old hall marks on the bottoms of these coffee-pots came from Mr. Gooch, they were on the saltcellars he gave me and were transferred in my shop—that was early in February—I have no doubt he saw the work while it was going on when he called about another job, a beaker, which I have omitted to mention, and which I sold to him in the rough for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the ounce; I asked him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at first—I took home two of them, they were a pair, but they were chased differently—the cream ewer was not done then, I was removing and it was delayed and was sent home afterwards—this work was done by Price a chaser in my business, another workman soldered the bottom in—in May after I had removed to Princes Street—Gooch came and said that he had been served with a writ from Goldsmith's Hall concerning the coffee-pot and the pint ewer—I said "Did not you register them?"—he said <hi rend="italic">Register</hi> be d—d, you talk like a fool"—nothing took place then, because; I was very busy, and he went away very vexed and agitated—he came in a Han-som's cab—I went to his place on the Monday to know more about it, and he said that he was going to Goldsmith's Hall, and he should have to say that I had made them for him and tell my name—I said "You need not tell my name, because they already know"—every man who works in silver and has it assayed at Goldsmith's Hall has a mark, but you misunderstand me—I told him that they knew of this affair, because Price had told me he</p>

               <p>should go to Goldsmith's Hall—he and I had some words and I thought they would not have come to him without Price having told them—Gooch said "I shall go down and pay the fine," and I left him under the impression that he was going to do so—I saw him about 5 o'clock next day at his shop and he said "I have been to Goldsmith's Hall and they refuse the money unless I give you up"—I said "You may as well, because I am sure they know"—he said "To-morrow I shall send the money down," and next evening at 10 o'clock or 10.30 he came to my place and knocked us up, we were all in bed—he told me that he had sent the money down and they had accepted it, and he had not told my name—on the next Saturday he brought me some work to do, but I do not remember that anything took place about this—I was taken up on, I think, the Wednesday following, and next day, the 17th, I was taken before the Magistrate and remanded—on the 24th I was brought up again—Gooch appeared as a witness against me and I was committed for trial—my solicitor communicated with the Goldsmith's Com-pany—he advised me and I acted almost entirely on his responsibility.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not deal in silver articles or buy and sell them—I am a manufacturer; I-have no liceuse—I had been introduced to Gooch six months before this for business purposes—it was said "This man is in the trade if you can find him a job"—what I ultimately understood him to mean was that I was to make a basket and transfer these marks to it—I did not then think it was wrong, I did not give it proper consideration, but in the course of making it I thought it seemed very strange, as all things go to Goldsmith's Hall—I thought I would make it and, take it home, and then it would be cleared up—I wish the jury to understand that I did not think at the time I was doing anything wrong—that was the first transaction between us; the second was the salt cellars—I asked him if that was not wrong, and he said that he had been in the trade long enough to understand his own business—I thought it right if he said so, it seemed so to me, because he explained it to me—I know different now—I do not remember asking him why he wanted the marks transferred, he said that he had been in the trade long enough to understand his own business, and I thought if he ran all the risk and responsibility it was surely right for me—my name was at Goldsmith's Hall and I took things there to be stamped and knew the meaning of it—I was not present when Gooch told Price what to do, but he seemed to know all about it—in the morning when I went up, Gooch said that he had an order for a beaker and could not get one and would I make him one—he wanted one about 9 inches—this was made in the interval and that was the cause of its being delayed, and he gave instructions to Price in my presence and objected to the fluting he had done—I am not referring to the chasing—I did not direct Price to transfer the old marks to the coffee pot and cream ewer from the salt cellars, nor did I do it—I told a man named Green to do it and he did it—I cannot say whether Price was present, I will not swear he was not—I don't remember seeing Green transfer the marks, because my place is at a different part of the shop—I was in the shop and I dare say Price was there when he did it—the shop is not quite so large as this room—I was out for a considerable part of the day—I do not recollect doing anything else that was wrong—I know Mr. Weatherby—I pledged a waiter for about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Mr. Attenborough's which I had to work on—I do not know the value of it—I did not hand Mr. Weatherby the money—I do not know whether it is still in pledge; I was unable to take it out—I did not owe Gooch any money</p>

I did pawn it to get a little money—with the exception of pawning that waiter there is nothing that I have been in trouble about—when the sugar basket was made, Gooch told me to register it, and that he should have to pay 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce for it—that is what I was, alluding to when I asked him if he had registered it—I very seldom had to go to Goldsmith's Hall, it was generally jobbing work and electro-plating that I was engaged in, but I had an order and took that there, and they told me I must have a punch made, and I did—my stock consisted of articles being, made up, and my tools and plant—Gooch brought me a little thing with a spoon upon it, which he wanted made into a beaker and he complained of the chasing on it, he wanted it taller, and he said "I wanted to make it taller, but Brown would not let me"—the date of the pawning of Attenborough's plate was about 4th March, 1876; of course it was my intention to get it out of pawn, that had caused me extra expense.</p>

I am a chaser—I worked for Edward Brown about twelve months, first in Poland Street, and then in Princes Street—I chased this cream ewer, and also worked on this coffee-pot, which was made at 19, Poland Street—there was no bottom to it when it was first made—Gooch came and saw it about February or March, but he did not see me at work upon it—he examined two of them and said that they would make very nice little things—I saw a bottom put into the coffee-pot, it was an old salt cellar—a man named Green put it in; I do not know where he is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I worked on it, but had nothing to do with putting the bottom in, I am only a chaser—when I had finished with it I gave it to Brown—I did not hear what Brown said to Green—Green moulded it in my presence—the bottom was in before I chased it; I had it twice—I was there when Green put the bottom in and saw that there were old marks on it—I thought that was wrong—I cannot say whether Brown was there—I</p>

               <p>did not remonstrate with Brown or Green—I said before the Magistrate that I did not recollect writing a letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I now recollect writing a letter—Mr. Brown was away ill, and he owed me a considerable sum of money—I saw Mr. Gooch, he merely mentioned the first time about making nice little things—I do not think the bottom was in it when I began to chase it, but the second time the bottom was in—I saw Green putting the bottom in—I gave information to the Goldsmiths' Company in March.</p>

I am now in the employ of Mr. Pashley, of Leicester Place, and am a worker in silver and electro-plate—I was in the employ of Mr. Brown in Poland Street and in Princes Street—I am his nephew—I remember this coffee-pot being made, and when it was half made I saw Mr. Gooch at Brown's place—Gooch was not there, but Price was—I heard Gooch give Price orders for it to be made autique—I remember Gooch coming again on a Saturday evening—I think he came in a cab.</p>

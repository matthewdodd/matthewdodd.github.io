                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—I now live with my mother, at 5, Thomas Street, Doctor's Commons—I lived with the prisoner up to three weeks before this assault—I do not know where he lived at the time of the assault—I had ceased to live with him because he had been constantly ill treating me; and the night before, he took away the furniture, and broke up our home—I remained in the house till the next night, and then went to my mother—on 20th December I left my mother's house, unknown to her, and went to Forest Hill after my husband, as I heard that the Slate Club was held there—I found him there, beckoned to him, and told him I wished to speak to him—he beckoned to me to come outside—I asked him if he had not forgotten he had a wife, as he had not given me a farthing, but had promised me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he said, "Go in, and have your drop of gin-and-water"—I did not go in directly; but said, "Let me understand you; do you intend to let me have any money to-night? if not, I will go home to my mother, as I did not come out for gin-and-water"—he said, "Yes, I will let you have what I can," and we went into the house together, and he took the gin-and-water, and behaved very kindly to me, and introduced me to several of his friends as the <hi rend="italic">Old Queen</hi>—after his friends had left we went outside, and he began to insult me, and call me bad names—he walked away, and I followed him at some distance—he turned round several times, as if he was going to spring at me, and said, "What are you following me for?"—I said, "You know what I am following you for"—he turned round and attempted to strike me—I escaped the blow and ran away, and, when I saw he was pursuing me, I took up a handful of gravel, and, as I found he was gaining ground on me, I threw the gravel over my shoulder to confuse him, and he stumbled and fell, and I ran on as hard as I could—I saw a man, and said, "For God's sake! do protect me from his violence"—he came up very near to the man, who moved backwards and forwards before him—he tried to strike the man, who moved on one side; the blow came on my left breast, and I fell in the gutter—I sprung into a sitting position, and he seized me and beat me on the head—I pressed my face into my lap that he should not strike it, and he beat me ever the head with his fist as hard as he could—I felt my senses leaving me, and fell back—he jumped on me, and I found myself at Guy's Hospital next morn<lb></lb>ing, where I remained a fortnight.</p>

               <p>—I did take some money when you were tipsy to prevent you getting rid of it; but I deny coming in the middle of the night—I kept you for thirteen weeks, and afterwards seven weeks, when you were out of work, and when you got work you would not give me money to pay people—I have been your wife seventeen years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—on December 21st, about 1 a.m., the prosecutrix was brought there unconscious—I examined her, and found an abrasion of the skin of the left side, in the neighbourhood of the ribs, and one of her ribs was fractured—she remained insensible till 4 o'clock, and was in the hospital till January 3rd—a person kneeling on her, when she was on the ground, would be likely to cause a fracture of the ribs—the abrasion of the skin would be likely to be caused by blows—it is pos<lb></lb>sible, but very improbable, that her ribs could be broken by a simple fall on the ground.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The keys of my street-door, and of my bed room were taken away one night, and when I awoke, next morning, I found my bed<lb></lb>room door half open, and missed 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my trowsers pocket I found my wife up stairs, in her petticoat and stockings. I asked her for my money, and she said she had not taken it. That was on 27th November. I had to borrow money to replace my tools, so I left her the bed and bed<lb></lb>ding, and sold the rest, and did not see her till 20th December, when she came to the bar. We were very comfortable at first, but afterwards she called me names, and struck me with her fist; but I never struck her a blow, that I am aware of, that night. I told the officer I was the party assaulted. She has been imprisoned, at Maidstone, for assaulting a lady, whose son is here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Francis Tapley, a fish salesman, of Thames-street—we receive, from time to time, large quantities of salted salmon, which come from America in tierces containing from thirty-five to forty-five salmon—on 2d March, in consequence of certain information that</p>

               <p>reached me, I caused a tierce of salmon to be opened in the warehouse, and in the evening after the place was closed and all the men had gone, I went into the warehouse and counted the salmon that remained in the tierce—there were thirty-one—I marked each of them—the prisoners were in our service—they came to the premises on Tuesday morning, 3d March—on that day I went with Hyams to examine some salmon that had been left with Hannah to mind—I there saw three of the salmon that I had previously seen in the tierce—they had the mark on them which I had made—I then went back, and found that three more were gone—Hannah made a statement in my presence—I sent for Simpson, and asked him about the salmon—he said he knew nothing about them—Smith came in just afterwards, and I asked him about them—he looked rather confused, and said he knew nothing at all about them—I told them they had been in the warehouse that morning—they did not deny it—it was part of their business to bring fish in baskets to and from the warehouse.</p>

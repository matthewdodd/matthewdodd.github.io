My wife, seeing the prisoner go out at the door, said a man was gone out with something under his coat. I followed him, and when he was on the other side the street I laid hold of his collar. I saw the tea chest, and said to him, How came you by these things? Not very honestly, said he. I said, Come back. He said, I am hanged! I am hanged! I am transported! I said I will not hang you. I took him back, and up stairs into the room where he took them from. He put the chest down from under his coat, and the Bible and bell from out of his pocket. (Produced and deposed to.) They were taken from a two pair of stairs room forward, where I lie. I asked him what business he had there; he said he had no business there at all, and was very sorry, and hoped I would not hang him; and that he would down on his knees if I would pardon him. When before the justice he owned he took the things.</p>

               <p>I pick up rags and broken bottles, and black shoes. I was coming by, and he called me names. I ran in after him. Then he said I stole the things. They were not about me. I must be very impudent to take away those things at that time of the day. I have got three children in England, and one in Ireland; and I lost the use of my sight at Leghorn. If I get a drop of beer, I am not my own man.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner twenty years, and know him to be a just, honest man. If I had a thousand pounds in money, I could trust him with it all. I am a weaver, and live in Rose and Crown Court, Whitechapel. The prisoner worked with me. He followed weaving twenty years ago. When he came from sea, his eyes were so bad he could not see to bring in his threads right. He ought to be in Greenwich College, having served in four or five men of war.</p>

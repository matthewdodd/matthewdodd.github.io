               <p>Stephens. No; the Woman was selling Mufles; the Minute before she came in to sell the Mufles, I went out, and just as I came in again, I missed it; I charged her with it, and she denied it; I sent for a Constable, and she said, if I would not prosecure I should have the Mug again; and she carried me and the Constable about twenty Yards from my House into the Church-yard, and she bid me feel in such a Place, and I should find it: Accordingly I did. She said she did not take it with a Design to keep it; but, my Lord, this is the very Mug, and there is some of the very Mould in it now.</p>

The prisoner came into my service on the 28th September, and in November I gave him notice to quit on the 12th of December, and on that morning, I said he had better leave off work, as he had to go to Uxbridge; he made his wages more than they were; I said.</p>
               <p>"Richard, there are 3 lbs. of candles which you stole, I shall stop for," he agreed to it; my boy said he thought I ought to search his box, I got a constable who found a plate leather in his pocket; I had missed ten. Not having room for him at home, I had taken lodgings for him in George-street - we went there, and in his box, which was not locked, I found a picture of my lodgers, four new shoe brushes, with my mark on them, four tooth brushes, a bottle of capers, and a square of soap. He asked for mercy before we went to his lodgings.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How long have you had it. A.Some time; it is not hemmed - I had it twelve months, but had not used it much; I had used it before that day - I know it because I have another exactly like it; I do not know whether the prisoner had a handkerchief of his own - I felt outside his trousers, felt this handkerchief, and took it from him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Where did you keep your handkerchief when you had it not in your pocket? A.With the rest of my clothes, in a box at home; I have had it about my person two or three times - the prisoner asked me to forgive him; one of these handkerchiefs had been washed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Which side of the Bell and Crown was this? A. On the City side; I do not know where the City ends, but it is somewhere in Holborn.</p>

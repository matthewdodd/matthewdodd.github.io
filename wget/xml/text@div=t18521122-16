                  </hi>. I live at 11, Mollineux-street, Edgeware-road. I knew Charles Baker, he lived at 17, Mollineux-street—I was there on Friday, 5th Nov.—I am not a relation of the Bakers—Charles Baker had had his dinner, I was sitting in the corner by the window, and he was by the table—William Baker, the prisoner, came in, and Charles said to him, "You have no business to come in at this time, and you shan't have a clean knife and fork;" there was a dinner knife and fork on the table—the prisoner said he should come in at what time he liked, and take what sort of knives and forks he liked—they bad some words with each other, and threatened to tell their</p>

               <p>mother—the deceased said he had no business to be playing out with Guy Fawkes—(that was the reason he was late)—the prisoner then sat down at the table to his dinner, and took up the knife and fork; Charles took up the lid of a saucepan and hit the prisoner on the back—I do not know whether it was very hard, it did not seem to hurt him; he did not say or do anything—Charles went towards where he was standing before, and William had the knife in his hand, and threw it at him; it went into Charles's left side and stuck there; it did not fall to the ground, he pulled it out, and gave it to the prisoner, who laid it on the table, and told him he did not mean to do it, but Charles told him he had done it—Charles ran downstairs into the first floor room; clung round a woman's waist, and told her that William had stabbed him—William was about two or three yards and a half from Charles when he threw the knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge on the first floor, at 17, Mollineux-street. On 5th Nov. the deceased came down into my room, and said, "Mrs. John<lb></lb>son, <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> has stabbed me"—I said, "Where?" he said, "Here," pointing to his side—the prisoner followed his brother down, stood on the mat at the door, and said, "Yes; oh! Mrs. Johnson, forgive me, I did not mean to do it"—I said, "Run for a doctor," which he did—a doctor came, and the deceased was taken in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Hospital—I have known the prisoner from a child; he is a very kind-hearted good boy, but very passionate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon, at St. Mary's Hospital. The deceased was admitted there on 5th Nov., about a quarter to 6 o'clock—he was very faint, pale, and almost pulseless—he had a wound, three-quarters of an inch long, between the fifth and sixth ribs, on the left side, about three inches behind the nipple—I cannot say the depth, as it was improper to ex<lb></lb>amine—he died about twenty minutes past 1 on Sunday morning the 7th—I examined his body, the cause of his death was a wound of the left lung and heart, such a wound as this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would cause—I found about three pints and a half of blood in the left side of the chest—the cause of death was the bleeding and the wound.</p>

               <p>MRS. LLOYD. I was at tea, I heard a person scrape their shoes across the railing, I thought it was some person wished to come in; I went up to the door, my light went out; I returned and got another light, and got the key and opened the parlour door, and saw the sash thrown up; I saw all the bed clothes off the bed, the two pillows and the bolster were laid at the foot of the bed ready to go out of the window, one half of the bolster on the parlour window and the other half on the bed; the bed stands close to the window. I called my husband up. I saw no person there.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street office. On the 9th of December last Frost and me were on duty in Old-street, we saw the prisoner with a bundle before seven; we crossed over to him and by that time he got into Sycamore-row; I went up to him and asked him what he had got there; he said, bedding; I asked him if it was his own property; he said, yes; I then said, where are you going to; he said, to No. 6 in St. John-street; he said, you alarm me; I said, you have no occasion to be alarmed if it is your own property. I took him over to the Pitt's Head, the corner of Old-street; I untied the bundle; I found the blankets and sheets, and a bunch of matches tumbled out; I found in his coat pocket a black petticoat; I said, if they are yours I will go with you to No. 6, St. John-street to see whether they are your property or no. We came out with him; I asked him where he had brought them from, he said, the sign of the Hare, Hackney. We walked about one hundred and fifty yards, he then said if you walk with me all night I will not tell you where I am going to take them to; I said as that is the case I will take you in custody immediately. I took him into custody. We walked a few yards, and then he said I will not go any further until I have something to drink; there came a great mob of people; I took him into the next public-house, the sign I do not know; when we got him there he began to be troublesome; I searched him further, I found two bundles of matches in one breeches pocket, and a bottle of phosphorus in the other breeches pocket; I asked him what he called this; he said, a smelling bottle. We tied his hands and took him to Bow-street. The next day I found the prosecutor.</p>

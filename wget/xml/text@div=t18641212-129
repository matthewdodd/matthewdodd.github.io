                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's half brother, and live at 3, Monk street, Woolwich—on the evening. of 24th November, I was going to my father's workshop in Union-street—as I was entering the gate I saw the prisoner coming out of the shop with this pair of cart springs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not know them at the time—I followed him down Union-street—he went round at the back of the beershop at the end of Union-street, and out into High-street—I then saw he had not got the springs with him—I thought he had left them in the dark passage—I followed him down High-street, and up Eyre-street—I went from there to the alley again, and there I found the springs standing up against the wall—the prisoner saw me before he went into the passage—he looked twice—he was not employed at my father's.</p>

I am the prisoner's father—I know these cart springs; they are my property—I bought them of Mr. Pownall on Brixton-heath—to the best of my knowledge I saw them safe two days before they were taken—the prisoner has been living with me since he came home from soldiering, and behaved very badly—he had no authority to take these.</p>

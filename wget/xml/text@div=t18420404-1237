                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, living in Popham-street, Lower-road, Islington. The prisoner is my son—he was at work for me up to the 3rd of March—he left me on the 4th of March—he lodged at my house—I had a stack of wood there—I examined it a day or two before he left, and missed some chesnut and five leaves of pine—in consequence of some information, on the 4th of March, I went to a house in Gee-street, Brick-lane, about half-a-mile from my place, where the prisoner was at work—I there found this wood in the kitchen—he was at work on it—it is mine, and had been on my premises—I spoke to the prisoner about it—he denied it, called me every thing he could lay his tongue to, and said he bought it—I also saw a plane and screw-driver in the place, which I knew to be mine—after he was taken I searched the room in my house which he had occupied before and found some wood in a box there, some chesnut and two planes—the box was shut and locked, and the prisoner's wife kept the key—I also found some varnish in the box, which I knew to be mine.</p>

I have known the prisoner about five months - he was once in my service, and left about a week or fortnight before Christmas; he never slept in the house - my house was broken open on Monday morning, the 8th of February, and this property taken; I am not sure that any stockings were taken - my daughter knew my stockings; I have seen nothing since but some old stockings - the persons got in at the back of my brewhouse, which is at the back of the house, but detached from it a little; they got into the house by throwing up the back kitchen window, which, I am sure, was down the night before; I was the last person up in the house, and am sure it was down when I went to bed, they could get into the house by lifting up the back kitchen window - they could not have got in any where else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time did you go to bed? A. About eleven o'clock, my son was the first person up; I never lent the prisoner any stockings - two or three persons have been taken up.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the evening of the 8th, performing as clown at Haydon's theatre - I found a pair of stockings on him sewn to his drawers; he was wearing them - I produce them; I have had them ever since; and I found this pair of stockings at his lodging - he told me he lived in the back room first floor, No. 8, Southampton-street, Seymour-street; I there found another pair of stockings laying on a chair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who else was taken up? A. Durden and a prostitute the prisoner lived with - Durden slept with the prisoner on the night of the robbery - I only heard that from Durden; the prisoner told me the particular room he lived in - that was before I told him what I took him for.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter. I know these stockings to be my father's - my work is not on them; I know them by a mark on all four - I did not mark them; it is wove into one pair - they were wove for my brother, who ordered them; that was only one pair - I know the other pair by a mark, and have seen them; they are not very valuable - I had seen the stockings on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The initials are wove in? A. Yes; not the name at length - the mark is J. W.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. One pair of the stockings belonged to my father - my mother gave them to me when he died; - the other pair Mr. Whitaker's son gave me, with several old things which laid on a dust heap.</p>
               <p>MARY WHITAKER. My brother is twenty-one years old. One pair belongs to my father, and were given to us by my aunt; they are marked R.; those with the initials wove in belong to my brother.</p>

On the 7th of February, as I was out late, I slept with him - we went to bed about twelve o'clock, and got up about half-past six; he could not have gone out without my knowledge - I gave myself up to the Police as I understood I was charged with this; I told Mundy, I had slept with him.</p>

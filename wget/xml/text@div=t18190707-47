I saw her go out about half-past seven o'clock, I then went and looked out of my first-floor window, heard her door open, and saw a man come out with a bundle in his hand - the knot slipped at one corner, and the clothes fell out - he ran away down Perkins's-rents. I believe the prisoner to be the man. I pointed him out about a week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. Do you doubt his being the man - A. I have since seen a man in Oxford-street so much like him, that I thought the prisoner was liberated; I followed him to be certain, and then found it was a mistake. I saw the prisoner at a public-house next day, and said he was the man.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the 2d of June I was applied to about the robbery, and went to No. 5, Stretton-place, and enquired for a hackney coachman, but was told none lived there. Next day, I met the prisoner in Tothil-street; he asked me what I was doing at his lodgings the night before? I told him I had a charge of felony against him. I took him to the public-house, and told him to go into the parlour alone (the prosecutrix and Blackburn were there), and if nobody there knew him he should be let free. He went in and came out - Blackburn immediately said he was the man - she identified him twice before the magistrate. I could not find her at the third examination.</p>

On the 9th of January I had been up and received 4l. 19s. 9d. as my pension - I was going to Radnorshire, in Wales, to see my father - when I got to the Castle public-house at <placeName id="t18270215-61-crimeloc337">Isleworth</placeName>

When I was going out, the two prisoners and the other man were still in the tap-room - I am not acquainted with that part of the country; I meant to sleep at Hounslow if I could get a bed; if not, I meant to have gone on all night in a waggon. As I went away I asked the landlady the road to Hounslow - she directed me, and I went away; after I had got about two hundred paces on the road I heard the voice of somebody saying, "You are going the wrong road, man" - I turned directly to the right about, and took the opposite road, which turns towards <placeName id="t18270215-61-crimeloc338">Brentford</placeName>

I had put my gold where they could not find it; they lifted up my head and let it down again; they then left me - I fainted afterwards, and recollect nothing more till I found myself in the hands of Whitehouse, the parish beadle - I had been in the tap-room from between seven and eight o'clock till ten - I am not certain whether it had struck ten, as there is no clock in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, at that time, such means of knowing the persons of Sanders and the other man, as to be sure of them? A. Yes, they are the two men, Sanders and Manning, who is not yet taken - Whitehouse asked me about the persons; I described them to him immediately - Sanders had either a light-coloured flannel or fustian jacket; the other had a coloured plush waistcoat, with fustian sleeves - I did not see the prisoners before the Justice till about a fortnight after - I was in the workhouse in consequence of my blow, but not confined to my bed - when I saw them before the Justice I stated directly that Sanders was one of the men who had robbed me - Wasley has a wooden leg.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is not a white jacket a very common dress? A. Yes; before I went to this public-house I had called at the Black Bull, at Brentford, about three or four o'clock, and drank a share of a pot of beer there, nothing more; I did not dine at all; I had a glass of gin at Kew-bridge, about half or three quarters of an hour before I got to the Black Bull - I had come from London, but took no refreshment in town; I slept at Chelsea the night before; I paid away about 30s. of my money, and had about 9s. in silver left when I left London; I paid 2d. at Kew, and 6d. or 9d. at the Black Bull, as I had some bread and beef with the share of the pot of porter; I drank nothing more on the road, nor any thing in London - I had been to no public-house in London, or at Chelsea; I had a share of two or three pots of beer at the Castle, or it might be three or four; but I drank very little out of them, and half a pint of purl - I do not exactly know how much money I paid - I dare say I paid 3s. or 4s., but not for what I drank myself - I will say we had four pots of porter, that was 1s. 8d. - I could not have paid more than 2s. for my share - that was for the porter and purl, which is gin and beer.</p>
               <p>Q. You were knocked down by a large dead wall? A. Yes, that threw a shade; they knocked me down the instant they came up; they were desperate blows; they stunned me and frightened me. I had my gold in my watch-fob - I cannot say whether Sanders was handcuffed when I saw him in the Justice-room - I did not notice; he had handcuffs on when he went away - I had not seen them put on.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you perfectly sober when you left the public-house? A. Sober enough to walk any where, or see any man's face and know it again - I suppose I was knocked down ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I was called to - I had no opportunity of seeing them till they attacked me.</p>

            . My husband keeps the Castle, at Smallborough-green, in the parish of Isleworth; the two prisoners were at my house on the night in question; they came in together before the prosecutor; when Price came in he called for half a pint of purl; there might be two or three more people in the tap-room, but I was not in the room; the servant collected the reckoning. I remember Price going away; he asked his way to Hounslow, and I directed him; he seemed perfectly sensible - directly after he was gone, the prisoner Sanders, and a person, who is not here, left the tap-room; that person lodged at my house at that time, and generally sat there in the evening, and went to bed about half-past ten, or a quarter to eleven o'clock; he came home that night five minutes before eleven; we were shut up and going to bed at the time; his father and mother live close at the back of our house; he went out early next morning before I was up, and I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That man's name was Manning? A. Yes; half a pint of purl comes to 3d. - I cannot say what beer was drank - we call it porter, but it is country beer - it is good strong liquor - 1s. 8d. would pay for four quarts.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whoever the prosecutor shared it with (if he had it) you say that he was sober? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to W. PRICE. Q. Did you not swear that 2s. was the share of what you drank? A. No; I said I might have paid nigh 2s.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How many persons shared the beer with you? A. We were drinking in company; I believe Wasley paid for one pot - I paid at separate times, when I was asked - I believe I paid for all that was drank between us four, except the one pot.</p>

            . I am beadle of Isleworth. On the night of the 9th of January, I was going from home to Smallborough-green, and saw the prosecutor laying across the footpath, quite senseless and dead to all appearance - I stopped with him, finding he was not dead - as soon as he could speak, I said to him, "Come, my man, try to get up, or you will be robbed;" the first words he said were, it was not to be done, for it was done- I went to Smallborough-green, and sent two people to carry him - I kept him in the toll-house during the night- he gave me an account of the robbery - he was quite sensible as soon as he recovered from the blows, but fainted away two or three times in the course of the night, and I thought he was dying.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoners in the Justice room? A. Yes - I do not know whether they were handcuffed - I was not near enough to see, but I believe they were - I know they were brought there handcuffed together, and went away so - there were no other prisoners there but them - if a person faced them, he could see whether they were handcuffed.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the prosecutor, on the night of the robbery, give you an account of it, and a description of the persons? A. Most distinctly - he said he had never seen them before that night, but he was some hours with them at the public-house, and mentioned their dress.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not ten o'clock a very usual hour to leave a tap-room? A. We shut up at twenty minutes past ten - I received no money from Manning, as he lodged in the house - I do not recollect receiving any thing from Wasley - Price had a pot of beer and half a pint of purl, which would be 8d. - he paid for it as I brought it in - I believe he did not order more than one pot in my presence, and paid me for only one pot and the purl - I am sure of that - I cannot say how much the other men paid - there was money paid between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Price did not pay nearly 2s.? A. No, he did not - I believe something was set down to Wasley- he had a score.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Wasley staid behind after the others left? A. Yes, half an hour - the boy slept in the house - I merely received Price's money as he paid it, and handed it to my mistress - I let Manning out at six o'clock in the morning - I did not see Sanders or Wasley again till they were at the Justice room.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is that from the Castle? A. Nearly a quarter of a mile - I did not hear of the robbery that night - I heard a word spoken in the Waterman's Arms that night by one of the prisoners, about a man being knocked down and having his pocket picked- Sanders said that publicly - they were sitting there drinking.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had any body charged him with a robbery? A. No - a young man in the tap-room said to him, "You have robbed some one to night, or you would not be so flush of money;" there was a talk about some money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the young man say this before, or after you heard of a man being knocked down and robbed? A. Before - and Sanders replied, "You fool, I have knocked a man down and picked his pocket" - I had not seen Sanders with any money - they continued at the house till within a very few minutes of half-past twelve o'clock - William Gadley keeps the Waterman's Arms - it is not usually open so late - this conversation passed soon after they came in.</p>

               <p>WASLEY'S Defence. I was at the Castle, and scored six pots of beer there - Price took a share of it; when I got to the Waterman's Arms I laid down, and went to sleep - I had no money to pay for beer - when the officer took me I had no money - I wish him to be examined.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search Wasley? A. Yes; I found no money on him, and only 9d. on Sanders - I took them both at Isleworth, which is about a quarter of a mile from the Castle - Price did not appear till the 16th, on account of a doctor's certificate of his illness.</p>

            . My father keeps the Waterman's Arms - I attend as bar-maid. I let both the prisoners into the house about a quarter before eleven o'clock; they staid till a few minutes past; this was on the Tuesday night; I heard of the robbery next morning.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Then they did not stay till near twelve o'clock? A. Certainly not; several people were in the house; they are not here; we shut up a few minutes past eleven o'clock, and not a soul was there after; Sanders comes to our house about once a week, or once a fortnight; our house was shut up, and every body out of it, a few minutes after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SANDERS to W. PRICE. Q. How much money had you altogether? A. I received 4l. 19s. 9d. I spent 30s. in town, and nothing more, except what I paid on the road; I had two sovereigns and a half in my pocket; on calculating at the workhouse, I thought I might have nearly 10s. left, but cannot say to a shilling or two.</p>

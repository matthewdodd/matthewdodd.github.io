                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Batter, a tobacconist, in Cheapside. On the 6th of Jan., between two and three o'clock, I was minding the shop—the prisoner came in (there was a gentle<lb></lb>man sitting at the end of the shop, smoking a cigar, during the whole transaction, but he did not leave his seat) the prisoner asked for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., worth of cheroots—I served him, and he laid down a good sovereign to pay for them—I proceeded to give him change—I had three half-sovereigns in a little box in a drawer behind the counter—there was no other coin there—I had seen the three half-sovereigns there at eleven o'clock that morning—I took them out to see how many there were, and saw they were all good—I am quite certain of that—I laid the prisoner down one of those half-sovereigns—he could see me open the box, and that there were more half-sovereigns there—I proceeded to get some silver—I saw him take up the half-sovereign which I put down</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020021"></xptr>
               <p>—he said, "I wish you would oblige me by changing this, for it looks as if it was light"—I took it from him, and put it into the little box on the top of his sovereign, which I had put into the box—I did not examine it to see if it was the same I had given him—I gave him another half-sovereign in ex<lb></lb>change, which I also took out of the box—he took it up, then laid down an<lb></lb>other half-sovereign, and said, "Will you oblige me with all silver for this? I had rather not have any gold at all"—I noticed it, and saw it was a bad one, and am quite sure it was not the one I had given him—I then looked into the box, and found the one on the top of the sovereign as I had placed it, and that was bad—it could not have been the one I had first given him—on finding them both bad, I walked round the counter, shut the shop door, told him he had given me two bad half-sovereigns, and demanded the half-sovereigns of him which I had given him—when I went to the door I had laid the one he last gave me on the glass case on the counter—he stood close to the glass case, leaning against it, and within reach of the half-sovereign—my eyes were off him while I was looking at the first bad half-sovereign—(I had it in my hand at the door)—he said he had no half-sovereign at all about him—that he had had nothing but the sovereign in his pocket—I asked him for the half-sovereign I had given him at first—he said he had no half-sovereign at all about him, that the one I gave him first was the one he gave me back, but when I called the policeman in he said, "Here is the half-sovereign you gave me first," and produced one—that was after he had de<lb></lb>nied having any about him—I took possession of it, and put it into the box—it is here to-day—I afterwards went to the glass case where I had placed the one he gave me last—it was not there, and I have never found it—the pri<lb></lb>soner said nothing about it—the gentleman did not interfere it any way, or leave his seat—I gave the bad half-sovereign to the officer, and the good one too.</p>

I know the prisoners—I saw Fuller on 28th June—on 4th July I saw them at the corner of Britannia-street, about 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon—they were together—Fuller presented a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to me, and asked me if I could give him change for it—I said no, I had not sufficient money in my pocket—Mr. Harding, a friend of mine, was present; he is town traveller to Smith, and Garratt, perfumers—I said to Fuller, "There is Mr. Harding, most likely he can give change for it," and I handed the note over to him—we then all four went to a beer shop in Whitecross-street, kept by John Twohy—Mr. Harding and I went in first, the prisoners came in afterwards—Mr. Harding asked Mr. Twohy if he could give him change for a note, and he handed the note to him—he took it, and left the house with it, with the intention of getting it changed—on his return he said it was a forged note; that could be heard by the prisoners—I then went to the station house, and gave information to the police—I came back, and went to a house at the top of Whitecross street, in Chiswell-street, where Mr. Harding and the prisoners were—after I went in, sergeant Foulger and another officer came in—I did not hear what he said; Harding pointed out the parties—the prisoners denied knowing me, or Harding either, and said they knew nothing about it—they were then taken in charge—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

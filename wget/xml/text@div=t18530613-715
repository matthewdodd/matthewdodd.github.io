                  </hi>. I am a weaver; I live at 3, Hodson's-court, Mile-end New-town. I know the prisoner by sight—on the evening of Friday, 27th May, about 12 o'clock, I was at the Jacob's Well public house, playing at cribbage—the prisoner came into the tap, and turned up the cribbage board—I said, "What did you do that for?"—he said, "Because I like"—I had not spoken to him before—he said he would fight me, and said, "I will give you a <hi rend="italic">spank</hi> across the nose"—I said I did not want to fight, and then he gave me a backhanded blow like this (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—that did not put my mettle up—we did fight, and were parted, and then I went and sat down—he was taken away by some one that he knew—while sitting down he came and said he would fight me for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he took up the cribbage board, and made a hit at my head—he missed my head, but broke the pipe in my mouth—then we went out into the street and had another round—I saw a policeman, and went towards my house—somebody hallooed out, "He is behind you"—I turned round, and saw the prisoner <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> up to me—I went into the road to defend myself, and we had another round—we both fell, and while we were down he tried to bite me in the private part of my person, and as I was getting up he pinched me also in the same place—he caught hold of my trowsers with his mouth near that part—when we got up he came up <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi>, and stopped to tie a handkerchief round his head, which he took out of his pocket, and I saw him pull out a knife, shut up, from his right band trousers pocket—he began <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> up again, ran at me all of a sudden, and stabbed me under the left eye—he then cuddled me round the neck, and stabbed me on the top of my head—he then threw me down, and as I was trying to get up he stabbed me again near the left ear—I said I was stabbed, and he ran away—I called out" Police!"—a policeman came, and I gave him in charge—I found him at the door of the Jacob's Well—in going to the station house he said he would give me one that I should remember when he came out—I went into the London Hospital the same night, the wound was dressed, and I remained there till Monday morning—the surgeon attended to me—I have been weak ever since, and not able to follow a day's work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, of High-street, Mile-end. I was at the Jacob's Well that night—there was a quarrel—I saw them go out of the house—after the third round, I heard one of them say he was stabbed, and I went up, and lifted one of them off the ground—the prisoner was in the act of closing a knife—he put it in his right-hand pocket—it was a similar kind of knife to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prosecutor bled very much; the blood was running all down his clothes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you in the Jacob's Well? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I saw the commencement of the fight—I seconded him—they had three rounds—at the time he called out he was stabbed, I believe they were on the ground—there was that amount of confusion at the time, that I did not know which I picked up—they had been down hardly a minute, no time I considered—the prisoner was getting very much the worst of it—I did not see him take the knife out—I am certain I saw him put it in his pocket directly afterwards—I turned round, saw him on the pavement, went up, and said, "Did you use the knife?"—he ran away—the other one ran after him, and called out "Police!"—I never saw the prosecutor before that night—I think there was also a friend with the prisoner—it was the last round when the knife was alleged to be used—there were two rounds in the same place, and they had fallen in the middle of the road—the prosecutor came up to the prisoner in the last round just the same as in the others—there was no difference so far as I saw—there was a struggle and confusion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon to the London Hospital. The prosecutor was brought there at a quarter to 1 o'clock—I examined him, and found a wound on the neck, one at the top of the head, and another under the ear—the wounds were such as could be caused by a knife like this produced—he did not bleed much after he came into the Hospital—his clothes were covered with blood—I dressed his wounds—he remained till the following Monday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What kind of wound was that under the ear? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A punctured wound, produced by a point—not such a wound as might be produced by a fall or a stone—they were not dangerous.</p>

On 27th March I saw Graham, in Cheapside, by Lawrence Lane—Jackson went up, and spoke to him—they walked up Cheapside, and were joined by Smith—they stood at the corner of Foster Lane, where Graham left them, walked towards the Post-Office, and returned, and they all went down Newgate Street—Graham stopped at the corner of Rose Street, while Smith and Jackson looked into the shop, 18, Newgate Street, three doors off—Graham stood looking towards them—he afterwards went up to them, and they all three went down Warwick Lane, into a public-house—they came back in five minutes, into Newgate Street, and stood talking at the corner of a hoarding for about five minutes—Graham then went to the corner of Rose Street again, and Smith and Jackson went and looked into No. 18, and Smith picked tip this roll of cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and handed it to Jackson—Graham was then three doors off—he made a signal to them as they took it—they passed him, and I pursued them down Rose Street, calling "Stop thief!"—when they found I was behind them, Jackson threw down the cloth—I took him in Oxford Arms Yard—I found Graham in Newgate Street, in custody.</p>

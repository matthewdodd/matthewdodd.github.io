            's house. On the 2d of December the prisoner came to lodge with me - She slept with me that night and the next. On the 4th of December I went out about twelve o'clock, and left her ironing my things-some were my own, and others I had taken in to wash; she said she would iron them for me - I left no person there but her. I returned at nine o'clock, and found my place covered with rags; my drawers, boxes, and every place were open, every thing off my bed, and all that I was possessed of taken away. I never saw her afterwards till she was at Bow-street. I found nothing of mine there except a silk handkerchief, which she had round her neck. I found eight gowns, twenty napkins, three handkerchiefs, two petticoats, a mustard-pot, a jug, ten caps, a tea-chest, a pair of sugar-tongs, a shawl, a cloak, a pair of ear-rings and a piece of lace, at the different pawnbrokers, who gave them up-the articles were worth 3l. 1ls. When I saw her at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140020"></xptr>office, I told her it was a very hard case, as she knew my husband was dead. I claimed the handkerchief on her neck-she said it was mine, and gave it to me. I asked her where the other things were? she gave me the duplicates of some of them-she did not deny it.</p>

            , in Fleet-street, near the three cranes, I had a boy with me going home, they said, my jolly young waterman will you give us a ride for pleasure, we care not where, I said yes, I took them into my boat, and landed them at Alderman Parson's stairs, I sent the boy home, and we went to a house, the corner of the dark entry; I asked the prisoner to go up stairs to bed, and we went to go to bed. I pulled off my coat and waistcoat, and laid them on a chair by the bedside, my fob being bad, I put my watch, chain, and seal into my side pocket, and I thought it was safe there; we went to bed agreeable together, upon which the prisoner at the bar said she would fetch Elizabeth Young up, Young came up, and we agreed together; Young asked me what I intended to give her, I put my hand into my pocket, I had a guinea and an half, and a silver sixpence, and four or five halfpence; I shewed her what small change I had, I gave it her, which I belive was the value of 8 d. or 9 d. I told her I would give her the remainder when I changed my gold below stairs. In putting on my cloaths I missed my watch, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110078"></xptr> I charged Young with it, in searching her I could not find it on her; the prisoner absconded and I kept Young till she told me where the prisoner lived, and we went and found her at her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Court. It was when Young was in the room that you missed your watch? - Yes, we searched the prisoner and found nothing upon her, then we carried her to justice Sherwood's, I told her if she would confess where my property was, I would pay all expences and get her a coach to her own habitation, as she was in such a wretched condition at that time, till at last she confessed she had pawned it for a guinea and a half at one Mr. Lieufe's in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Court. This was after you had promised her that in case she would confess you would pay all expences and send her home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. A confession obtained by promises ought not to operate against the prisoner.</p>

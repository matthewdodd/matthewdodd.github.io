I was near the shop; I had seen the prisoner and another together, and the other one made an attempt at twenty or thirty shops - they at last came to the prosecutor's, and took this sugar - I gave the alarm; I cannot say which of them took it, but I saw the prisoner with it, and took him with it.</p>

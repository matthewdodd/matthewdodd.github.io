I am barmaid at the Boar's Head, Cannon Street—on 3rd October Johnson and Wadeson came in for two glasses, of stout and mild—Johnson tendered a bad florin—I broke it in three pieces in the tarter—he then gave me a good one; I put it on one side, and, at his request, returned him the largest piece of the other—I told Mr. Jones, junior, the landlord's son.</p>

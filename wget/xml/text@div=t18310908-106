            . On the 30th of June my son wrote these letters by my direction - I sealed them, and on the next morning (Friday, the 1st of July,) gave them to my son, Ambrose, with 2s. 6d. to pay the postage; I went to three of the places where I had appointed meetings, and none of the servants came.</p>

               <p>AMBROSE WILLY. On the 1st of July I received nine letters from my father, with half a crown; I took them to the post-office, and saw a little girl at the door - she called Aunt! and the prisoner came; I will not be sure she is the woman - it was a stouter woman, I think, but I gave that person the letters, and the half-crown; I do not recollect whether I said any thing - the postage came to 2s. 3d.; I waited a few minutes while she stamped one or two of the letters - I then left, and forgot the change; I went back in about an hour, and got the change from a woman - I do not recollect whether it was the same person; I stopped at the door on my donkey - she brought the change out to me directly; I took the letters to the post-office about seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you sure it was not near eight o'clock when you got there with them? A. I do not know; I went directly I got them from my father - our house is about a quarter of a mile from the post-office - I do not know whether I was known there; I did not see the postman come in - when I returned for my change; I did not say who I was - I stopped outside, and asked for 3d. which I had forgotten, and she gave it to me.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLY. I gave the letters to my son about seven o'clock - I have seen the prisoner at the post-office at Teddington; she had a niece there - I sent my son back about nine o'clock for the threepence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner knew who you were? A. Perfectly well; I have lived there six years- my family are very likely known there.</p>

            . I am a letter-carrier. I carry the letters from Teddington receiving-house to Twickenham - Mr. Edwards kept the receiving-house at Teddington; the prisoner generally acted for him - she used to take the letters out of the box, and stamp them by the time I came, and give them to me, with the postage; on Friday, the 1st of July, I received the unpaid letters, and two paid letters, with 6d.; I remember it well, because Mr. Willy called on me about it on the following Monday; this is the bill which I received on the 1st of July, (looking at it) - I put down on it "Seven unpaid, and two paid, 6d.;" it is dated the 31st of June, but I did not date it - here is the entry of a money letter on it; I have seen the prisoner write, and believe that entry to be her writing - the letters were taken out of the box at the time I went, and laid on a table; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080056"></xptr>prisoner gave me the 6d. - I took all the letters which I received to Twickenham, with this bill; Mr. Willy made some inquiries on the Monday of me - I immediately went to the post-office, to the prisoner - nobody else was present; I asked if she remembered receiving nine letters from Mr. Willy on Friday morning; she said she remembered receiving nine letters from Mr. Willy's son, but it was on Saturday morning, not Friday - I said I was sure they did not go on Friday morning, nor on Saturday, for I should have remembered them going through my hands - I do not remember, during the eight years I have fetched them, having so many paid letters in a morning; the afternoon delivery contains general-post letter - she said she was quite sure it was on Saturday morning, and it was as long back as Saturday week; I said I had not the slightest recollection of the letters myself - I had seen Mr. Willy at my house about seven o'clock, and got to the post-office about half-past seven o'clock; I should be there a quarter before eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you in the habit of filling up the columns in the bill? A. Yes, my predecessor had done it - the prisoner was always by me when I made out the bill, when at home, and was so on the 1st of July, when I did it; she said, at the post-office, where there was an examination, that her niece was present, and heard her observe to me "What a number of paid letters there are to-day;" that this was the morning the nine letters were brought - I know her niece was not in the room on the Friday morning - she might have been standing at the door; she certainly did not make that observation to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you always very punctual to your time of half-past eight in the morning? A. Yes, in my collection; I sometimes got the prisoner to deliver letters for me - I paid her for it; I have got others to do it- I do not drink till after my duty is over - I have got a man named Kembly to deliver letters for me; I may have been drunk once or twice during the time I have been at Teddington, and he has delivered letters for me when I had a friend whom I wished to be with - the evening collection is at three o'clock - I was never at the office so late as ten o'clock at night; I dare not leave in the morning till a quarter before eight o'clock - I was in the house on the 1st of July at a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning; I was there perhaps about five minutes before I received the letters; I did not state that I was in a hurry - the prisoner was standing by the table when I went in; I did not see these letters brought - I will swear the niece was not in the room; my regular time to be at Twickenham is twenty minutes before nine; it is better than a mile and a half from Teddington - I was there in time that morning.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not take the letters and stamp some of them yourself? A. I did not on that morning - I have done so: I heard the niece say at the post-office, and at Bow-street, that her aunt had observed to me what a number of paid letters there were; I remember one very wet day in the winter getting Stevens, the watchman, to deliver a letter at Dr. Vint's, which is opposite his box - I cannot say whether the two paid letters on the 1st of July were directed to initials.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not take the letters off the counter, professing to be in a hurry, and carry them away? A. I did not; I received the prisoner's salary for her, and she had said, "Let me have 1l., I do not want the rest till my rent is due; if I have not got it I cannot pay it away;" about six months ago she said her rent was due to-morrow, and she should be obliged to me for the money; I unfortunately had not got it in my pocket, but she had it, I believe, next day; I had received it about a fortnight - she did not threaten to complain to the post-office of me.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q.Where do you receive the money? A. We receive an order from the office to pay it out of the money we collect; it sometimes takes a week to collect what we have to pay, which is three offices - she had 8l. a year; I was sober on the morning of the 1st of July, and employed nobody to deliver any letters.</p>
               <p>Q. On what morning did the little girl say this conversation had passed? A.She did not say it was not on the Friday morning.</p>

            . I am one of the presidents of the Twopenny Post-office. On Saturday, the 9th of July, I went to Teddington; I saw the prisoner - I said I had come from the Post-office, in consequence of an inquiry made by Mr. Willy, and asked if she remembered receiving nine letters from his son on the 1st of July; she said she did remember receiving the letters, but thought it was before that period - I said, "What did you do with them?" she said, "Sent them to the office;" I said, "That is impossible, for on the morning in question there are only two letters entered," and for a week previous there were not any letters to correspond with that number - I produced the bill, which she looked at, and said, "The figures are not my hand-writing," that Weal had put them; I said that was extremely improper, against the positive instructions, and I should say no more till Weal was present - I left, and returned about a quarter before three o'clock, with Weal, and asked him, in the prisoner's presence, whether he had received that number of letters; he said he had not - I asked how he came to put the figures in the bill; he said they were frequently in a hurry, and the letters were not always ready when he called; that he had been in the practice of doing so, and his predecessor also - the prisoner also said that it was in consequence of his being in a hurry that he put them there, but did not admit that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080057"></xptr>he always did it; she said she was quite sure that all letters she received she gave him, but she could not be quite sure on what morning these came - I told her nine letters were an unusual number, and could she recollect having paid him any particular sum of money; she said she could not, but all the money, and all the letters she had received she gave him - on Thursday, the 14th, she was at the Post-office; the solicitor had her into his room - he first cautioned her not to say any thing to prejudice herself, but that she might answer what questions she thought proper, and that the answers she made might be brought in evidence against her; he wrote down what she stated, and I witnessed and signed it - this is it (looking at it) - (read)</p>

            . I am the daughter of Joseph Edwards of Teddington. The prisoner (my aunt) lived with us; I recollect Mr. Willy's son bringing nine letters - I do not know that it was on the 1st of July; he put down half a crown and was to have 3d. change - I called my aunt down to him; he went away and afterwards came back on a donkey; I recollect Weal coming that morning, I do not know at what time - I was in the room against a chest of drawers: my aunt took the letters out of the box; Weal appeared in a hurry, I did not hear him say he was so - I think I saw him stamp the letters; I did not see the bill - I do not recollect his taking the letters up; it was about an hour after Willy's son had gone - I heard my aunt say to him, "There are a great many paid letters;" he must have heard her say that.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Were any of the letters stamped before little Willy left? A. Yes, but not all, for he went away without his change - I do not know how many my aunt had stamped; I saw her stamp them all afterwards, and put them into the box - it was the unpaid letters that Weal stamped; my aunt stood at the table when Weal was there - I did not see him writing, because his back was towards me; my aunt and him were standing side by side.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him with a pen and ink before him, I suppose? A. Yes, my aunt could see what he wrote; I remember Mr. Smith coming from the Post-office - I think I told my father and aunt before Mr. Smith came, that I had heard her observe, what a many paid letters there were - I heard my father talking something about it, and mentioned it; I am sure it was before Mr. Smith came; they said Mr. Willy had lost some letters - they did not say Weal had said so; it was about two days after the letters were brought there - it was on the Monday I am sure; it was on Monday morning, after Weal had been -I saw Mr. Weal there on the Saturday afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. On the morning Willy brought the letters must Weal have seen you, or were you hid? A. No - I stood against the drawers by the middle door, he did not speak to me; his back would have been to me ask he stood at the table - I told Mr. Smith what I have stated now.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GEENERAL. Q.What, when he first came? A. No, it was the second time; it was not by my aunt's desire, he asked me.</p>

            . Q. You keep the Three Sweedish Crowns in Old Gravel-lane. - A. I do. On Tuesday the 30th of June, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and called for a glass of gin; he tendered me a shilling, the gin came to two pence. About ten minutes before that a man came to my house, he had a glass of porter, he gave me a shilling, I refused that, he gave me another, and I gave him ten pence halfpenny; I found that to be be a bad shilling. This man came soon after, he gave a shilling, I thought that to be a bad shilling, I came from behind the counter; he thought I was coming to take him in custody, he said he could give me copper enough; I fastened the door, I told him I was an officer of the parish, I insisted upon taking him in custody; I told him there had been another just come in before him, I had taken a bad shilling of him, and as I had every reason to believe they were in colleague together, I would take him in custody. I sent for

             the headborough; the prisoner wished me very much to let him go, he said he was not the man that I supposed him to be; he shook very much and was in great agitation; I told him I should not let him go. Mr Charlton came in, then I left him for the purpose of getting the other man; I returned in about ten minutes unsuccessful; When I came back we searched him. I found three other shillings that were like the same that he tendered me, and there was a good sixpence and ten pence halfpenny; I said to Mr. Charlton you had better step with him to the magistrate. On the road he offered me any thing to let him go; I told him I could not think of that; we then took him before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the shilling that he gave you - A. I have it in my pocket, I have kept it separate, I I am sure it is the shilling that was tendered by him; I have kept it separate locked up in my desk ever since. I produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has got the other shilling that was tendered by the other person - A. Here is the other that I had just before taken of the other man; and the three shillings that was found on him. I took them out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. When this man came into your shop, there was no other person in the shop but you and him. - A. There was my sister in law.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you left him when you went out of the shop with the constable and your sister in law. - A. Yes; when I went in search of the other man I left the shilling on the counter, and when I came back I found it there, and the other three with it.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were gone did not he put that shilling with the other three. - A. No. The magistrate asked me if I knew it; I had mixed them; I told the magistrate that I knew it by the marks of my teeth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in point of fact you had got the four shillings in your pocket altogether. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not feel a difficulty at this time. - A. No. I told the magistrate I could discover that one by the head and by the marks of my teeth.</p>
               <p>Q. I see there is a B put upon this. - A. Yes, the magistrate desired me to mark it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for you to try them with your teeth. - A. Yes, if I suppose it to be a bad one. I can swear to the shilling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Look at that shilling, and see whether you know it. - A. That is the same shilling.</p>

I lost a waggon out of my cart-house on the 30th of July; I missed it in the morning; I made enquiry among my neighbours, but could hear nothing of it. On the Saturday following I went to Reading and advertised it, and dispersed a number of hand-bills, but to no effect. I had afterwards intelligence of it by two young fellows who had been at work at Enfield-Chase and came home in the month of April; they said, they had seen such a waggon in the possession of

            , who is known in that country by the name of Black Dick. In consequence of that information, I went to Southgate and found the waggon at Mr. Groves's on Tuesday the 25th of April. I could swear to the waggon, though they had disguised it all they could; it was a different built waggon from any in the neighbourhood, it was a kind of half-bed waggon, it had rails and hoops over the wheels; when it was with me I painted a groupe of wool-packs on the head of the waggon, on one woolpack I painted my name, and on another the country; they were all painted out when I found it; the board was black, there were no traces of it at all.</p>
               <p>Do you undertake to swear it was your waggon? - I do. I found Holloway at Southgate and took him into custody, but he made his escape.</p>

               <p>The waggon came first to Southgate about August last; it continued working with me from August till Christmas, in the joint name of Holloway and Davis, as partners. I do not know of my own knowledge who brought it. I was told it was brought by the prisoners at Christmas; on a dispute they parted; the prisoner further paid some money, and the waggon became his sole property; he kept it till the 6th of March then I bought it of him for six pounds five shillings. The prisoner's brother-in-law, Howard, worked for me before they came out of the country; the waggon was brought first to his house, and he and the prisoner and Holloway worked with the team.</p>

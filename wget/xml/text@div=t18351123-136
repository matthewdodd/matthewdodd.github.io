                  </hi>. I live at Old Brentford, and am a labourer. I was engaged in takingup potatoes on Ealing-common, on Saturday, the 14th of November—I put them in sacks, and covered up the sacks with the potatoe-haums in the field—I left them between four and five o'clock, and went home, and met four <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> in the road, coming towards the field where the potatoes were—I went on—the man who was with me went back, and watched them—the potatoes are not here.</p>

I was working with Burrowes—I was going home with him, and met some men, which induced me to go back and watch them—I stood behind the hedge, and saw the prisoners go towards the heap of potatoes, uncover the haum, and take out the potatoes—I can swear to Fawns positively—I went towards them, they saw me, and ran away—I ran after them, and caught Fawns—he begged of me to let him go—some one ran after the others, but could not overtake them—I do not know the others.</p>

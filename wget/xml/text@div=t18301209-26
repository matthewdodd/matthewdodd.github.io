            . I am constable of Enfield. I received information on the 25th of November, in consequence of which I went with Watkins to the road near Mr. Mellish's farm-yard - about five o'clock the prisoner came up, and we stopped him; he had a bag of wheat at his back, in a basket - this stocking of wheat was round one of his thighs, and this other stocking round the other, and this bag of wheat was tied before him under his smockfrock; we took him to the watch-house - I said I should search him; he said it was of no use, he would give it up, and he did so - I said, "Have you any at home?" he said, "No nothing but a few potatoes;" we went to his house at Ponder's-end, and found about three bushels more of wheat - I have brought a sample of it, and there were eight or nine sacks of potatoes.</p>

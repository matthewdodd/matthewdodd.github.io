                  </hi>. I know the prisoner—I live in Laundry-yard—he lives in Great Peter-street, which is no great distance off—on Sunday morning, the 23rd of June, he asked me to go and have something to drink with him—I went with him to a public-house in Tothill-street—I think it was the Three Johns—we went up York-street to buy a pair of shoes—we had some more to drink—from there I went with him to buy a pair of stockings—we had a good deal to drink—I cannot exactly say how much—we were both in liquor—we went home, and I must say I aggravated him—I began the quarrel—he wanted to go out, and I would not let him—I told him I would have blood for blood—he took out a knife—I can recollect no more, being in liquor—my sister had not been drinking with me—if I led taken her advice it would not have happened—she was at home with my two chil<lb></lb>dren—she advised me not to go out—I do not know how it happened—I was struck with a knife in my left breast.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of the last witness; I have been married since this. On Sunday, the 23rd of June, between two and three o'clock, I was in the room—my sister and the prisoner came in—they were in liquor—the prisoner was worse than my sister—they brought in some mutton chops—my sister put them in the frying-pan to fry—her head was bad—she laid down—he wished her to get up and go for a walk—she said "No," she wanted half-an-hour's sleep first—he called her a name—she got up—he struck her nose and made it bleed—I got between them—he wished to leave the room—she said she would have blood for blood first before he left the room—I stood between them—he said, "Have you got a knife?"—she said, "No," she had not—I placed my hand against the cupboard door, for fear he should take one out—he drew one out of his pocket, and placed it by the side of him—he was nearly one or two minutes before he opened it—she said, "Perhaps you will do it," and in an instant his hand was over my shoulder—I took hold of his hand, and said, "For shame, John, how can you be so foolish?"—she</p>

               <p>said, "My God, I am stabbed!" and he said, "My God, Sarah, how could I do it? I did not know I had done it"—they were about to be married—they were not living together—he was living with his mother in Peter-street—I am certain he took the knife out of his pocket—he opened it down by his side—I did not know it was done, till she said, "Oh God, I am stabbed!"—she had given him no provocation at that moment, but saying, "Perhaps you will do it"—I took the knife out of his hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was she standing before the door, to keep him from going out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I stood between them, to prevent his striking her—she had hold of his hair before, when she was lying down—he wanted her to get up, have some dinner, wash herself, and go out—she pulled his hair, because he teased her—his knife was in his pocket when she said, "Blood for blood"—it was in his hand one or two minutes before he stabbed her, and when he had done it, he said, "I did not mean to do it, Sarah. My God! what have I done?"—I did not hear him say he did not know the knife was in his hand.</p>

On the 7th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came for a mutton-chop—it came to fourpence—he gave a half-crown—I gave him change—he left the shop immediately—I looked and saw it was bad—I looked out, and he was running as fast as he could—I put the half-crown into the drawer, in a corner by itself—I am positive the prisoner is the person—I have not the least doubt of it.</p>

I deal in beer, and live in Cross-street, Islington On Friday the 10th of March, between twelve and one o'clock in the day the prisoner came to my house for half a pint of beer—that was a penny—he offered half a crown—I saw it was bad—I went round the counter, and took him, and gave him into custody—I asked where he took it—he said he did not know, he took it last evening—I marked it.</p>

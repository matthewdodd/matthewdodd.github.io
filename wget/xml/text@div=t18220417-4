            . I am a labourer, and live at Hampstead. I know Mr. Read's house, the prisoner is his son. I met him on Sunday last, about half-past twelve o'clock, in Flask-walk; he asked if I wanted any money, I said Yes; he asked if I would have a sovereign, I said No, I would much rather have 1 s., for I should be better able to pay him; he gave me a crown piece, and after that shewed me a great quantity of sovereigns, which he took out of his breeches pocket, and a great quantity of silver, which he took from his coat pocket, tied up in a white cloth; I asked how he got it. He said he got into his father's house in their absence, and had broken the till, and had taken the money from it - I persuaded him to go and deliver the money up to his father, he refused to do it, and said he would take a coach, and go to London; I said I certainly would go and tell Mrs. Read; he said I might if I chose. I went to her, I took a cart, and overtook him at Pancras-church, on the roof of a coach. He got off, I delivered him to Batten, who took the money from him, and took him to the watch-house. I have known him about ten years. I think he was much intoxicated - he lived with his father, and worked for him. I never knew him to be weak in his mind.</p>

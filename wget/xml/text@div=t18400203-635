On the 24th of December the prisoner came to that market with a load of hay (I sell for Mr. Wood) I sold half that load in the market, and sent the rest, which ought to have been eighteen trusses, to Bolton and Miller—the prisoner went there with it—I saw him come out of their yard, and he had then two trusses of hay in his cart—Mr. Bolton paid me only for seven<lb></lb>teen trusses—the prisoner returned one—there ought to have been but one truss in the cart, and I saw two.</p>

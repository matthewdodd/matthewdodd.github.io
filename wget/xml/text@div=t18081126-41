               <p>Q.Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Perfectly well. On the 18th of August I let her a lodging, a two pair of stairs back room; she said she worked at the upholstery work; we agreed that she was to have the room at four shillings and sixpence a week; she came to take possession on the 19th, and lived in the room three weeks and a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what day she was missing - A. Some day in September, I cannot exactly say when; my husband opened the door of the room, we missed all the articles in the indictment. I have seen all the things again but the glass and the bolster.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BIRKBECK. Q. After the prisoner was gone did you go in the room that she lodged in - A. Yes; I had another key. I have seen some of the things that were missing. I saw the prisoner in about a week or ten days after she absconded, in Smart's buildings, Holborn; I asked her what she had done with the things; she said she had sold them, she said she could tell me to whom she had sold them, but she wished to make it up with her, as she had got in work; I asked her what she had done with the glass; I prized the the glass very much and should like to have it again; she told me where she had sold it; the person whom she sold it to said they had sold it.</p>

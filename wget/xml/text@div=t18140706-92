            . I am a printer at Shacklewell. I print bibles there, and testaments, for Messrs. Reeves and Strachan. On the morning of the 31st of May my warehouseman came to me. I went to the warehouse, and saw from the appearance of the warehouse there had been an entering into the one pair of stairs window. They had let down the upper sash, and opened the door of the warehouse. There were marks of crows upon the door. They had stolen a large quantity of bibles and testaments, and then they broke their way out. They stole bibles and testaments worth upwards of one hundred and fifty pounds. I have seen the bibles and testaments since; they were the identical things that were stolen out of my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. Were the bibles perfect - A. Forty thousand and eighty-five perfect, two hundred Italian testaments perfect, and sixty quires, part of an octavo bible.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember the morning that Mr. Rutt's printing office was broken open - A. Yes, on Tuesday morning. On that morning I was disturbed by a cart rattling at the back part of my house. I thought it rained. We are obliged to cover up our work when it rains. I am a brick maker. I went out of doors, and saw the cart. I followed the cart. One man was with the cart, and two behind it. I heard one say, I am afraid we shall not be off with this job now; I am afraid we shall be taken. They whipped the horse to go as fast as they could. They went towards Clapton. This was between two and three o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. Who the men were, you cannot swear - A. No. All I know, there were three men with the cart.</p>

            . I am a green grocer; I live at 101, Wentworth-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do; I have known him eighteen months, or upwards. On the morning of the 31st of May, between six and seven in the morning, I was getting out of bed; somebody knocked at the door; I went to the door; the prisoner came; he said, will you let me leave some things for half an hour; I said, yes, you can lay them down here. I was not dressed; I went into the room, and dressed myself, and came into the shop again; I found a number of printed papers. I said, what have you got here; he said, waste paper, the property of his brother, who was in that line. They were the same printed papers that has since been given to the officers. While I was dressing myself, I heard a cart coming along; when I came out, I saw no cart. After I was dressed, two men came in, the prisoner asked for pen and ink and paper; I gave it him. He wrote a note, and gave it the two men. He then said, I will put the paper down in the cellar; I said, do not put it there, the cellar is damp. He said, it is of no consequence, as it is going to be removed directly; he then moved it into the cellar, and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you the next day deliver that paper to any person - A. I did, by the prisoner's order, to a man of the name of Laugley; Laugley fetched away the paper by that written order, a part of the paper. The prisoner called again in about two or three days; I then said to the prisoner, how could you ask me to let you leave any thing in my shop for half an hour, and leave it here for two or three days; he answered very short. He said, I will take it away directly, and went off.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any suspicion that you entertained, did you remove these things out of your house - A. I did, to No. 28, in Wentworth-street, a house that I had the letting it. After that, I went to the office. The officers took the paper into their possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. Are you not known by the name of

               <p>Q. Have you ever had the pleasure of seeing me here - A. I have. I have been at the bar, where the prisoners are; I was convicted of a burglary.</p>
               <p>Then you were under sentence of death in Newgate - A. I was; I might be twenty months; that is twelve years ago. I have been here since, for an offence against the revenue; I was confined in Newgate for the offence against the revenue; I may<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060049"></xptr>have been twenty months out of Newgate for that offence. I was pardoned of the first offence.</p>
               <p>ISRAEL LANGLEY. At the time this transaction took place, I lived at No. 8, Cooper's-buildings. I went to Buckingham's house, and saw some printed paper by the information of Osborne. The prisoner went into the cellar with me to look at the paper; after I had seen the paper, I agreed to buy it. I fetched away about five hundred pounds weight. I bought it by the lump. I paid ten pounds in part of payment two days afterwards; I paid it to Osborne. That is the paper which the officer had. I went to the office voluntarily, and gave the same account which I have given now. I paid the money to Osborne. The prisoner did not receive a farthing of me; Jem Osborne received the money. Upon my honour I thought the paper was stolen. I lock the paper from a house in Harrow-alley, Petticoat-lane.</p>

            . In consequence of Mr. Rutt, laying his information at Worship-street office, I, on Monday, the 6th of June, in company with Mr. Rutt, found eleven bundles of paper in a room where a madman was laying in bed, which Mr. Rutt said, he knew to be part of his property; that was in a house in Harrow-alley, in Petticoat-lane, and on the 17th of June, I, in company with my son, went to 98, an empty house, in Wentworth-street; in a cellar we found the remainder part of the paper. We sent for Mr. Rutt; he knew it to be that which he had so lost. After I had found this, I went to Langley's house, in company with Mr. Rutt. I left word for Langley to attend at the office; he came voluntarily, and gave some information. Then I took some steps at Buckingham's house; he also attended. Then on Wednesday, the 29th of June, I, in company with my son, and Gleed, apprehended the prisoner on the charge of this robbery; I told him the charge; he said, he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q to Mr. Rutt. Have you looked over the property - A. Yes. I believe we have recovered the whole of the property.</p>

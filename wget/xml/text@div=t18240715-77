On the evening of the 23d of June, about half-past eight o'clock I saw her, she said she was without any lodging, as she had been out of the House of Correction but a week; I offered her a part of my bed till she got one - she went home with me, and I afterwards went to bed. There was a young man slept in the room, who was a visitor - the prisoner did not go to bed at all. I had a shift and a shawl in the cupboard. The patrol called me between one and two o'clock; the prisoner was then in the watch-house. In consequence of what the patrol said I looked into the cupboard, and missed them. The young man was then in the room. I went to the watch-house, and saw the clothes.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner and prosecutrix going home with a young man, and in consequence of some altercation. I listened at the door - I then saw the prisoner come out, and run away: she had got five hundred yards or more when I stopped her, and asked what she had got - she said nothing. I found the shift in her lap, and the shawl round her shoulders. The prosecutrix said,</p>

               <p>"How could you rob a poor girl like me;" she said she was going to pawn them. I asked the prosecutrix if she had given her them to pawn - she said No. I am quite sure she said she was going to pawn them.</p>

            . After I had done calling the hour of two, I came round silent, I met the prisoner with this pot; I asked where she lived; she said in Fleet-street, and had been washing, and had used her own pot.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she going towards Fleet street?</p>
               <p>Abel. She was standing stock still when I met her; I said, you must give a better account before you and I part; she was about seven or eight yards from Mr. Spink's house, when I first met her, she began to sting and tear to get away; she tore the clothes off her back to the waistband of her petticoats; at last she said, here take the pot, and let me go about my business; I said, no, you shall not quit me till I get to another place. I brought her to the watch-house; I went and knocked at Mr. Spink's door, and Mrs. Spink came and owned the pot.</p>

               <p>I was going to my daily labour; a man hired me to carry the pot, and was to give me 6 d. to carry it to Drury-lane. I live in Fleet-street; I took it, and left that man at the King's-head in Tyburn-road.</p>
               <p>Q. to Abel. Did you see a man with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Abel. I saw a man in the area when I first saw the prisoner, but he got away.</p>

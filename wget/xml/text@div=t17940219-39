               <p>On the 21st of January I lost the deal boards, I came from Dean street, Maryle-bone, I was informed by one of my men that somebody had broke in and took some of my boards. I know nothing myself of the robbery, no more than I was told by the witness.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 21st of January last I was in Thomas's Buildings, I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of a house with three deal boards under his arm, I said to him where are you going with these? he said nothing to me then; I said again to him where are you going with this? says he, I am going to the saw pit, this was between eleven and twelve at night. I said who set you to work at this time of night? I said, Conner, this is a very bad subject, he dropped down on his knees and begged of me to say nothing, and he put down the boards into the saw pit, the one part of the boards were down the saw pit, and the other out. In the morning when I got up to go to work for Mr. Thomas, I work near within a hundred yards. I was rather astonished to think they were gone, after I accused him with them, I goes to the door and found the door was shut, in the course of an hour I saw one of Mr. Thomas's men and told him of it, and he told his master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know they were Mr. Thomas's boards? - It was not probable any other boards would be in Mr. Thomas's house. I knew but little of him; where he lived, and where I live, and where he did the robbery is all within about one hundred yards; I know him merely by working on the same ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190100"></xptr>Q. To Mr. Thomas. Have you seen these boards since? - I don't know that I have, there were three of the same sort in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went in the morning did you find three missing? - I did not, because I have so great number in the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. May it please your worship I am a poor <rs id="t17940219-39-deflabel218" type="occupation">labouring man</rs>

Your lordship finds I am charged with stealing some boards, I work for Mr. Dover, in Edward-street, May-fair, there was a carpenter there putting a flooring in the house; after leaving off work, the carpenter asked me to take some boards to another building, which I accordingly did; after that we drank together, in going home I found a board near the spot, which I took up, and thinking it belonged to the rest, and I put it down a saw pit, thinking it belonged to the carpenter who sent me before with the other, but the other carpenter came up and took me into custody, charging me with the intention to steal. Your lordship will find there was no property lost, nor no intention of committing felony.</p>

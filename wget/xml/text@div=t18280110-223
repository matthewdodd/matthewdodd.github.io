On the Saturday, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, my money was all right in a little galleypot - I locked it up in a cupboard in the dining-room, and had the key in my pocket - there were seven sovereigns and, I think, six half-sovereigns. On Sunday night, at half-past ten o'clock, I was going to put some more to it - I found the cupboard unlocked, the gally-pot removed, and the money gone - I have never found any of it since; I inquired who had been up stairs, and could not find that any body had, except the prisoner, who had gone up at two o'clock, to shift his shirt, but he had not asked my leave, and had no right there. I had him taken about half-past eleven o'clock that night - he said he knew nothing of it, and had no gold or any money about him - I am sure of that; he was searched in my presence, and 1l. 2s. 6d. in silver, and some halfpence were found on him.</p>

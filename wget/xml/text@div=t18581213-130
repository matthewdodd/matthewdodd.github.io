                  </hi>. I am a sub-warder in the House of Correction, Cold bath-fields. On Tuesday, 30th November, I was in the dining-room of the prison, about 2 o'clock—the prisoner and the two last witnesses were there—the prisoner was sitting about 2 yards to the left of me, and about 12 yards from Goodwin—I saw him quit his seat with the pannikin is his left hand—as he passed me I took particular notice of the way that he held it; he was holding the pannikin in his left hand, the cuff of his jacket over the right hand, and his finger extended down the pannikin—he then passed on to Goodwin—the next thing that drew my attention was the sound of a blow, and one of the prisoners calling out "He has got a knife, sir"—upon looking in that direction, I saw Goodwin staggering, and bleeding from the mouth, and Morris rushing towards the prisoner, and exclaiming "What would you do, man?"—I saw the prisoner brandishing the knife over his head, holding it in his right hand like a dagger—on my way towards them I saw the knife descend twice on Morris—on pushing the prisoner on one side to get at him, I saw Morris was bleeding profusely from a wound in the neck—I then seized hold of the prisoner, and told some of them to take Morris away—while holding the prisoner, I said, "You silly man, what have you done?"—he said, "I hope to God he is dead, and there is two or three more of you want settling"—another warder then came in and took him away—he said, "I will go quietly now"—I then went for the governor, and the surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the prisoners in the House of Correction. On Tuesday, 30th November, I was in the dining-ward with the prisoner—I saw him walk up to Goodwin with a pannikin in his hand—he drew up a piece of meat in his hand, brought it out of the pannikin, and said, "Mr. Goodwin, this meat stinks"—Mr. Goodwin looked at the meat, and said that it was sweet—the prisoner said, "No! is it?"—he said no more, but struck Mr. Goodwin with his left hand—then he drew the knife, which he had concealed up his right sleeve, and was about to strike Mr. Goodwin in his neck with it; I saw the knife in his hand; I saw him draw it from his sleeve; he held it like a dagger, and struck down with it, so that the knife should not shut, as he made the stab—I called out to Mr. Goodwin, "He has got a knife, sir!"—Goodwin had his head partly turned round at the time;</p>

               <p>on his hearing the word "knife," he turned his head again, and in turning his head, instead of its striking him on the neck, it struck him on the mouth; if he had not turned, the blow would have fallen on his neck—Morris was close by; he tried to lay hold of the prisoner; he tried to stop him from striking Mr. Goodwin again—I saw the prisoner strike Morris twice or three times with the knife, and he was in the act of striking him again, when I laid hold of him by the right hand, in which he had the knife; he had the knife up then, going to strike Mr. Morris again—I do not know whether the knife was taken out of his hand, or whether it dropped down; another prisoner laid hold of his other arm—when I laid hold of him, he said that there were two or three wanted doing for there; and then Mr. Morley laid hold of him as well, and said that he must be a foolish fellow, to do a thing like that—the prisoner said that he would put their lights out for them in about a minute—he was then seized and taken away.</p>

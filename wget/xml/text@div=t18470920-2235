                  </hi> I am a porter, in the Borough-market, and live in Mint-street. On Sunday evening, the 25th of July, about half-past eight o'clock, I was in Mint-street, right opposite out door, and saw the prisoner assault the prosecutrix—she fell into my arms—the prisoner was leading his mother in his arms along the road, about five yards from me, and the children sat up a hooting, seeing her drunk—the prosecutrix was coming along with an empty jug in her hand—the prisoner was coming one way, and she the other—the prisoner stood still, and she looked him in the face, but never said a word—in about a minute, he said, "If you don't get out of the way, you young b----, I will kick your <hi rend="italic">guts</hi> out of you," and he no sooner said that than he dropped his mother on the pavement; ran towards the girl directly, and kicked her at the same moment—I went to assist her—she was about five yards from me—I caught her in my arms, if I had not, she would have dropped on the kerb-stone, and cut her head open—she was in a fainting state—I got a man to assist me, and took her home.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, and live in Great Suffolk-street. On the 20th of July I was called to attend the prosecutrix—I found her lying on the bed, very faint—I examined her person, and found that the bottom of her belly, in the * * *, it was a wound about an inch and a half long, and was bleeding very much—there was a wound and a bruise—there was a good deal of blood on her person—in my opinion, it was a dangerous wound—she is suffering from it now very much—the bladder was very much affected, and is now—as soon as she came to, she complained of very great pain at the bottom of the belly, great pain on pressure—I administered proper remedies—she is has complained more or less since of that pain—she at first suffered from not passing her water, but now she has great difficulty in holding it, and has great pain when she passes it—she feels much easier when she is in a recumbent posture—she has been confined to her bed up to this time—in my opinion, such a contusion and wound might have been caused by the kick of a powerful man—if it had been a little higher, it might have ruptured the bladder—she is certainly recovering now, but I expect she will feel the effect of it almost ever after.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you say there was a wound, do you mean to say that the skin was broken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I am quite sure it amounted to a wound—it bled—it could not have bled without the skin breaking—it must have been a very violent kick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You told Mr. Cottingham it was not much of a wound, and not near the bottom of the belly, and that very trifling blood ran from it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never said anything of the kind—the Magistrate said if there was any danger to her life I was to get further opinion, that the prisoner might have the benefit of all the medical advice that could be obtained, because, if the girl died, he perhaps might be committed for murder; but as the girl was getting better the mother did not wish anybody else called in.</p>

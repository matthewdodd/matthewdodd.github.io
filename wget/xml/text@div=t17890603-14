            , on the 20th of December last, I was going to Mr. Clempson's, the glover, in Berkley-square; about half past nine at night to take home ten dozen of fine head kids, to make ladies and gentlemens fine kid gloves; they are called head kids for fine, best; I had them then in my possession in a canvas bag; as I was going down Long-acre, I thought I felt somebody behind me, but I did not turn back; but as I came to this first end of Piccadilly, I was sure some somebody felt the leather, as the ends of the leather turned down; I did not turn back then, because so many people were in the street; I carried them under my arm, the bag was tied, and I turned the bottom of the bag under my arm and the ends of the leather hung down.</p>
               <p>Could they take out part of these skins? - No, that was a thing impossible; in Dover-street they were taken from me totally together; as I went up <placeName id="t17890603-14-crimeloc66">Piccadilly</placeName>

               <p>At that time when you saw the prisoner, had any body plucked at the skins? - Yes, that moment.</p>
               <p>Was there any body near you at that time but the prisoner? - No, nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - No, never, that was the only time I saw him.</p>

               <p>When the skins were taken from you, you did not see the person that took them? - Yes I did, the prisoner is the man that picked up the property; I did see him then, it was not a dark night, and the lamp gave a good light.</p>
               <p>And you are sure that the prisoner is the same person that you saw opposite St. James's Church? - Yes, I verily believe I am right.</p>
               <p>You verily believe; but you must swear properly? - Sir, I have proper witnesses, but I verily believe him to be the man: four men surrounded me;

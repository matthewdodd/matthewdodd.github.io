On the 22d of July, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop with two other soldiers, and asked for some silk handkerchiefs, I told my man to serve him. He sat on a stool, and put his cap on the counter. I saw him take something off the counter, put it in his cap, and put his handkerchief over it, he then put his cap on his head. In a few minutes I said, "Is not your cap very heavy this warm weather?" and asked him to let me feel the weight of it. One of his comrades presented his cap to me to feel - I pretended not to see it, but took the prisoner's off his head, lifted his handkerchief out, and found the shawl under it - He attempted to escape, but I gave him in charge. He wanted to compromise the business; I refused.</p>

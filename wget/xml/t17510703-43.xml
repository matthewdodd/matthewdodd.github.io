My house was broke open the 29th of April, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning. My door and window-shutter were fastened over night, and the watchman call'd me up about one. I unlock'd an inward door and went into the room where my children are undressed to go to bed, there I missed eight pewter dishes from off the shelf, and my childrens things, gowns, petticoats, and stays; I have six children and all their things were gone. The window-shutter was broke, and the watchman had stop'd the prisoner and brought all the things in again.</p>

            . I was coming up Holbourn and I met Dodwell, an acquaintance of mine, the 28th of April last, he was executed at Tyburn among the last, there was another man along with him. Dodwell ask'd me, where I was going, and desir'd me to go with him. He stop'd at a door and desir'd me to stay there, so he and the other man went into a long entry.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other man?</p>
               <p>Cullen. I believe it was the prisoner at the bar, I never saw him before. They both came out again, Dodwell struck a light and had a dark lanthorn in his pocket: then Dodwell desir'd the man to stand at the door, and he and I went up the entry and he went in at a window: he handed out to me several things, some pewter dishes, some wearing apparel, and one saw; I put them down by the window, and handed some of them to the other man, but the watchman came and prevented us from taking them away.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give evidence here before?</p>
               <p>Cullen. I did against Dodwell and Talbot, and I made information against one Natt, for Dodwell call'd him Natt that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body give information before you did?</p>

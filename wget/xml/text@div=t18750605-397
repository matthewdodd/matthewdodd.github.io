               <p>I was asleep—there were two other <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> with him named Barnett and Taylor—I was awoke by receiving a kick in the stomach—I got up and asked the prisoner what he kicked me for—I had known him before, ho was in the same regiment—he said "Where is your billet"—I said "I shall report you for kicking me"—he said "What are you"—I said "I am an old hand"—I meant that I was a recruit last year—the prisoner then struck me with his fist and knocked me down—I got up as well as I could and he struck me again—I could not see whether he had anything in his hand or not—I was knocked down and stunned, when I came to I found my nose and teeth and lips were all sore, and my forehead was strapped up—I did not challenge the prisoner to fight, or do anything to provoke him in any way.</p>

                  </hi>. The last witness and his brother lodged three doors from my house with their uncle—on this Saturday night I went outside the door to shut my gate, and I saw Charles Brown and his brother asleep on their uncle's door step—the prisoner came by with two other men he went up to Brown and gave him a kick, which awoke him—Brown asked him why he kicked him—he said "You did not seem to like it; where is your billet?"—Charles said "What's that to you," and the prisoner hit him in the face and knocked him down senseless—he got up, and the prisoner walked round and put his hand in his pocket, and walked round again to him and said "You don't seem to like it"—Brown said "What did you kick me for, I gave you no provocation?"—the prisoner made no more to do than he up with his right fist and sent him sprawling—what he cut him with I don't know—he struck him in the face and he was knocked lifeless—he bled and I assisted to take him home—it was about 11.15 when the prisoner first came along, and it was a few minutes to 1 o'clock before we got Brown to—he had a large gash in his forehead—Brown never challenged the prisoner to fight or spoke a word to him, except what I have told you—I saw the prisoner again that night, and I had to run indoors and slam the door in his face because he threatened me—he said "That's the b----that told them all about it"—his companion, Barnett, told him to off with his belt, and he told Barnett to out with his knife—the Militia were out on Uxbridge Moor for training.</p>

I live just opposite to Mr. Robinson, where Brown lodges—on this Saturday night I saw the two Browns at the door—I spoke to them; they could not get in—while they were on the door step the prisoner and two other men came by—he walked up and kicked Brown—I ran across the road directly—he said to him "Where is your billet?"—Brown said "What odds does that make to you?"—the prisoner said "Where is your billet?" and Brown said "I will report you"—the prisoner said "Oh, you will," and he up with his fist and caught him under the nose—I said "Mind, Charles, he is taking off his belt"—he did not take it off, but he struck him again and laid him insensible—I caught hold of him and found</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical man, residing at Uxbridge—I was called on Sunday morning, about 1 o'clock, to see Brown at Uxbridge Moor—I found a gash, an incised wound, about an inch long, on his fore<lb></lb>head, just over the left eye, apparently done by a knife—I strapped it up—his nose was swollen and bleeding from both nostrils—on the Monday night he was removed to the Militia Hospital—he is quite well now—the gash must have been caused by some sharp instrument; it could not have been done with the fist, it penetrated to the bone.</p>

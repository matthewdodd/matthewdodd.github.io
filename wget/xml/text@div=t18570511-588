On 28th March I went to Angel Lane, Stratford, to levy a distress on the prisoner's goods—I dis<lb></lb>covered there about thirty new waistcoats, a quantity of silk, a quantity of buttons, thread, cloth canvas, waistcoat backs, sleeve linings, several pairs of trowsers, and a great quantity of other articles belonging to tailors—I observed on the waistcoats Messrs. Moses's mark in figures, but I was not aware it was their mark at the time—it was a very small mark, in ink—I questioned the prisoner as to how he became possessed of them—he said he could not account for them—he said he had had some of them a long time, and then he said, supposing he bought them, how would it be then?—on the following Monday I revisited his house, and then thirteen of the waistcoats were missing, but I found the cloth, and some other things—I noticed a</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. The prisoner has been in their service for ten years—he was employed in the workshop—in that workshop Was a box, which I placed a seal on, and delivered it to the policeman—that box was used by the prisoner himself, and I have seen him wear this coat that was taken out of it—this silk is the kind of silk that was used in the workshop, of which the prisoner was the overlooker—he had no right at all to any of this silk as perquisites—this silk is worth about 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound—this cloth is the property of Messrs. Moses—it is in pieces, but every particle of this cloth could be brought into use for making boots—I have examined all this property—to the best of my belief, it is all my employers'.</p>

Moses's—they are cut in this way for their business—here are six bundles of this linen—I do not identify these buttons, but I can identify the boxes they were in as having my mark on them—we buy them from different manufacturers—when the buttons are used the boxes become waste boxes—I identify these pieces of cloth with the seal on them—I believe I have examined all the pieces in these bundles—a great many have no mark—I am only able to</p>

Moses twelve years—I have sold the prisoner a trowsers length of cloth, for which, of course, he had a bill—I do not know whether there were bills found in his possession; there might be—if I have sold him anything, it would be a length for a pair of trowsers—I may have sold him other things for his own wear; I really cannot tell—I do not know whether he had a shop—I will not undertake to say that he did not keep one—I may have sold him cloth; I never sold him silk—I do not recollect that I ever gave him things to take home to work at; I might have done it; I cannot tell what, nor when, nor what sort of things; it must have been clothing—he was to work at them, and make them up—he was not to cut them out—the cutter would cut them out—they would not come into my hands after they were out out—the material is given to the cutter to cut out—it would then go to the trimmer; he would put the trimmings—they would then come to the giver-out, Mr. Griffiths, and it would be his business to give them out—I give them out occasionally—I know a person named Kelly—I do not recollect that I have sold cloth to him; I might have done so, not on many occasions.</p>

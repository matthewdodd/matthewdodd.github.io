            . On Saturday the 21st of July, late in the afternoon, four cases were landed as passengers' baggage, under a sufferance, there was not time to clear them. M'Donald and Slater, the Dock Company's officers, had the charge of them; they were placed on the wharf, and contained seeds, roots, stuffed birds, and insects, from the Cape of Good Hope. I stopped them for the duty, and put the broad arrow upon them, that they might not be removed until the duty was paid. I saw them on the wharf on Monday, and afterwards before the Magistrate, they contained the same goods; the Magistrate ordered the articles to be delivered and the boxes kept.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The vessel was seized once or twice for smuggling - A. I never heard it. Nothing was stolen.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Were they landed from the ship - A. Yes, and put on the wharf; the prisoner's duty was on board the vessel, he had nothing to do with the goods on the wharf.</p>

            . On the 21st of July, I was fireman on board the Venus - she was cleared that day; I slept on board, and on Sunday night, the 22d, about eleven o'clock, I was in bed and heard somebody on deck, I came on deck and saw the prisoner fetch them on board, he stood with one foot on deck and the other on the quay; he was on board as a Custom-house officer; I asked what he was about; he said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, it will not fall on your head." I said I would take good care it should not, and he had better have nothing to do with them, and put them on shore again; he had one on board and one in his hand when I spoke to him. On the Monday the officers came on board to search for them; the prisoner came to me and said,</p>
               <p>"I will give you a pound note if you say nothing;" I asked, about what; he said,</p>
               <p>"About what happened last night;" I told him his pound note would not save his neck, nor me from transportation. The officers took the boxes. When he took them on board he was very tipsy, but could walk well. When he got them on board, he asked for a light; I told him he could not have one, for it was after hours.</p>

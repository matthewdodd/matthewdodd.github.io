                  </hi>. I am the son and clerk of John Hogarth. Amongst the consignments of iron we have at our wharf, we have same—Blenarvon and some Coltness iron—there is no other place within two miles and a half of our house to which Coltness iron is consigned—it comes in ships from the works, and comes to our wharf in barges—after it is stacked it cannot of itself fall into the water—we had several cargoes of Coltness iron landed lately, and from two or three of them we found a deficiency—as we were landing it we weighed it, and when the whole was landed we found a deficiency between the quantity consigned to us and that we received—the barge does not generally lie off our wharf more than half a dozen hours before the iron is landed—it may lie one day—we knew of this iron being landed, and we missed some, according to the bill of lading—we missed some of the Blenarvon iron after it was stacked, but not of the Coltness iron—I should think the Coltness iron must have been taken from the barge or from the wharf—it had been all landed before we weighed it—we landed 200 or 300 tons, and it might have been a week before it was weighed—during that time it was lying in a loose state—it could not have tumbled into the water—a week or ten days previous to Kennett's being apprehended I went to Cox's shop, in the Broadway, Rotherhithe, 400 or 500 yards from our wharf—it is more properly a long shed—it contains rope, and rags, and iron—I was passing by the door, and I saw a quantity of pig-iron, which I knew a person carrying on the business that he does not deal in—it is iron from the mine, which has never been worked—anybody cat tell that this is unwrought iron—it is cast in the mining in pigs, and brought here in pigs, and then put into the furnace and melted—I went into the shop—Cox was engaged with a customer—I walked round, and I said, "Mr. Cox, I believe we have been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185105120154"></xptr>
               <p>robbed of this pig-iron"—he said, "Stop a minute; I will speak to you"—I said I was in haste, I could not stop; I would call again—I told him not to sell it till he saw me again—he knew me—we used to buy old iron of him—he knew the character of the iron—he has been frequently on our wharf—I then left him—after Eennett was taken, I went to Cox's again with the policeman—I asked Cox what he had done with the pig-iron I had seen pre<lb></lb>Blenarvon in the shop—he said he had sold it—I asked him where he had sold it—he said he did not know that he was obliged to tell me; it was very unpleasant for him to tell me who his customers were—I had an officer with me in uniform, and he said, "Well, Cox, I have a man in custody for stealing some iron belonging <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Mr. Hogarth, and I must see the iron"—Cox said, "Will the afternoon do?"—the officer objected, and said he must see it at once—Cox then asked him to let him go and put his hat on, and he joined us in about five minutes at the Europa Inn—Cox had told me in the shed that the iron was over the water—I asked him if we should take a boat—he said, "Oh, no; it is on this side of the water"—he then took us to Mr. Hart's foundry, in Cottage-grove—we looked over his stock, and found llcwts. of pig-iron all broken in pieces—there were no whole pigs—some of the pieces had the brand on them, and some had not—I examined it carefully, and hare not the least doubt of its being our iron—the greater part was Coltness iron, but there was some Blenarvon with it—I believe they were our property, and taken from our wharf—some portion of it was taken to my father's wharf, but not this part that is produced—this brand is not our own brand; it is the brand of the works; but all that has been sent to London this year has been consigned to us—when I found this iron, Cox said it was the same iron that I had seen at his place, and that he had sold it to Hart—I asked him of whom he had bought it—he said, the greater part of Powell, of the dredging-machine, and that he had bought from 2cwt. to 3cwt. of the man we had in custody, and the entry would be found in his book, under the name of "Smith"—I said, "The man we have in custody has given the name of 'John Kennett,' and has given no address"—(Cox had not seen Kennett at that time, to my knowledge)—I do not know Powell—I know the dredging-machine; it is in various parts of the river—it has been lying at Horsleydown, about a mile distant from us—I told Cox he ought not to have sold the iron when I told him not—he said, as I did not call, he thought he bad a right so to do—about a week or ten days elapsed between my calling on him and my going again with the officer—he said the man he bought it of, told him he got it from the mud in front of Hogarth's wharf; that he had only bought of him on two or three occasions, and the last time he told him not to bring any more, he would not buy it—he told me he only sold one lot of pig-iron to Mr. Hart.</p>

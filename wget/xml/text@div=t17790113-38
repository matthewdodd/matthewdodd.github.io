On the 1st of January I desired two of my neighbours, Mr. Bailey and Mr. Ward, to mark some money, and send it for goods to my shop in the morning. I counted the money in the till before I went to bed. In the morning I staid up stairs till after breakfast to give them an opportunity to come; when I came down I counted the money, and found there was only six-pence farthing more in the till than there was over night. I then went to Mr. Bailey to know if he had sent; he said he had sent his boy with a marked shilling to lay out eight-pence halfpenny. I then went to Mr. Ward, he had not sent; he said if I would go home and send my wife up stairs out of the shop, he would send his man with some marked money I did, and then returned to Mr. Ward's, and he sent his man, whose name is Dunbar, for some beans; Dunbar came back, and said the prisoner served him, and took the money; on which I went home, and looked in the till, and found the money was not put in the till.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Thomas Lark<lb></lb>combe, and live in Sun-court, King David-lane, Shadwell. Early in the morning of the 17th of September I heard a person walking about over head—I think it was about three o'clock—I afterwards heard steps come down stairs and go up again—Catherine Bryant lodges up stairs—I went up at half-past five, naked, and saw a man at the top of the stain—I called my husband for my petticoat, and the moment he saw me he threw himself on his stomach at the foot of the bed—I missed every thing off the shelf, and said to the man, "You are not tipsy, tell me what you have done with the things"—it was the prisoner—he would not answer—I found these two pot-trays in his bosom, and these two ornaments in his trowsers' pocket—I awoke Bryant, and she missed her things—I said, You had better get a policeman"—he still said nothing, but when the policeman was gone</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184009140094"></xptr>
               <p>for, he said, "Let me go"—I said, "No, I will not"—he said, "For God's sake, let me go"—I said, "No"—he said, "Let me go to get a drink of water"—I said, "No"—the policeman then came, and he put his head down on the bed, and pretended to be just as stupid and sleepy as ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> A woman took me to the house—I was tipsy, and took the things off the mantel-piece, but did not know what I was about—I did not mean to keep them. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not sleep in that room, I was in bed with my husband—I at first heard a snoring, which I thought was Catherine—I then heard a man walking about, and went up and found him—my husband rents the house—when I went to bed Bryant was out, and I left the string of the street door out, and that is, I suppose, how he got in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman. I went out on this morning, and saw the prisoner on the step of a door in the street—I returned in about a quarter of an hour—he was then on the opposite side, trying the door and shutters of another house—I shut the door of our house when I went in, but forgot to take the string in, by which it could be opened from without—the door was latched, but by pulling the string the latch would come back—I went up to my room—there was a young man there—I was afterwards awoke by the landlady, and found the pri<lb></lb>soner in the room, and saw a shell in his hat—I fetched a policeman, and missed these things—I asked the prisoner where they were—he would not tell me—I found a bundle under the bed tied up, ready to be taken away, with the articles missing in it—he pretended to be asleep, and tipsy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Bryant called me to the house—I found the prisoner in the room up stairs—he appeared intoxicated—I saw the shawl taken from his hat, and a bundle under the bed—the women charged him with having tied the bundle up, to take things away—he pretended not to understand any thing—the bundle contained the articles stated—I believe it is a house of ill fame—my opinion is, that the prisoner was drunk—the sergeant considered so at the station-house, for he could not tell his name—I found no money on him.</p>

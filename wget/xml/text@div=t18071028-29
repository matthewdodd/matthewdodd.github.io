               <p>Q. What shop do you keep. - A. A coal-shed; the coal-shed is part of the dwelling-house. On the 29th of September, about eleven in the morning, the prisoner came to my shed, he enquired after my husband, he asked me where he worked, I told him in the Borough; he took a chair and sat down in the parlour; the parlour is behind the shed. I had occasion to go into the shed to serve a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been in the parlour before you went into the shed. - A. About half an hour. I shut the door of the parlour when I went to serve the customer; I staid about two or three minutes in the shed, then when I returned again into the parlour I met the prisoner coming out of the parlour door, he said, good morning Mrs. Stently, give my best respects to your husband, and he went out. About an hour after he was gone I went to wind up the watch; I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had that watch been. - A. It hung up by the side of the mantle piece in the parlour; I had seen it about half past ten; I asked the time of the day, the prisoner looked up at the watch and told me, as I was on the other side of the fire place.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he came in about eleven in the morning, he told you it was half past ten then he was there then. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a silver watch. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After missing this watch what did you do. - A. I went to the George public house in Monmouth-street, I had seen the prisoner go in there, he was sitting in the tap-room drinking a pint of beer. I asked him for my husband's watch that he had stole, he denied having the watch, and got up and said he would go home with me; he came out with me but he would not come with me home; I asked a man going past to assist me, that occasioned a mob, and there were some people amongst them I knew; they assisted in taking him to Bow-street. Before we came to Bow-street he said Mrs. Sently, I want to speak to you, come into a public house, I will tell you; I said whatever you have got to say, say it now; then he told me he had stole the watch and pawned it for eighteen shillings; he would give me the ticket and the change to take it out. I would not take it; when we came to the top of Bow-street, we met the officer who took him in custody. On searching him at the

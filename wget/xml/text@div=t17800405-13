             sworn.</p>
               <p>I lost three handkerchiefs out of my shop last Saturday was a week. The prisoner with another woman came into the shop to look at some prints; after they had looked at a great many, there were none of them would suit. She dropped a large parcel of handkerchiefs from under her cloak in the shop. The young man who served in the shop, suspecting she had more, followed her out of doors. I saw him follow her and bring her back, and I saw him take the handkerchiefs from under her cloak. I delivered the handkerchiefs to the constable.</p>

               <p>Being a country woman I lost myself; at last I saw a gentlewoman standing at that gentleman's shop; she was looking at some cottens. I enquired the way to Whitechapel. She said she was coming my way, if I would stop, that she was going in to buy a gown, that they sold them cheap there. I said I would go in with her, and we would buy two together. We saw nothing that suited us; we turned out of the shop again. I was not above three yards out of the shop when I picked up this cotton handkerchief; I held it up in my hand and asked the gentlewoman that I went into the shop with, if it was her property; she said it was not, and I held it in my hand; I declare I never concealed it.</p>
               <p>Court. Had she it under her cloak, or where was it? - She had it under her cloak. She went out and looked back five or six times, and was gone forty or fifty yards before she was brought back.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am a silk-weaver. I have known the prisoner three years and two months. I never knew any thing of her but what was just and honest. She worked hard for her living and took great care of her family. She nursed my wife six weeks ago in her lying-in.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. What is the value of the handkerchief? - About half a crown.</p>

               <p>Perhaps you did not hear any thing of her being angry about the sailor telling she took the things? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you insist upon it then, and tell the constable and the prosecutor? - I gave charge of the sailor to Mr. Taylor.</p>
               <p>Wa s the sailor in the shop before you came? - Yes; he just came in.</p>

               <p>You did not go into the shop, nor you did not follow her? - I cannot tell, I cannot swear I saw something on the floor red and white, but I did not see any body take any thing up; this woman went into the shop, I saw her going into the shop.</p>
               <p>Did not you stand at the door? - I would have gone into the shop only the young man did not like to buy the cotton.</p>

               <p>Court to Halfwright. Did the woman give you a hint to drink part of a pint of beer, after you had given a hint about the the linen? - Yes; I saw the woman come in and the two men; I am sure the linen lay on the compter at that time; it lay to the right hand.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did that man buy any stockings? - No, he did not.</p>

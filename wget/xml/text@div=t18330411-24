            . I am a bed-sacking weaver. I have seen the prisoner at Macquillan's - he brought the box there on the 18th of February, and played a tune or two on it; I asked if he did not want it for a day or two, to let me have it - he said I might have it; I asked who it belonged to - he said he had borrowed it of a friend, whom he did not name; the box remained at Macquillan's about five days - I then took it home, and it remained there eight days; it was then delivered to Henman at my house - I afterwards saw it in his possession before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HENMAN. I am a constable. I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner on Monday, the 4th of March- he was charged with taking away this musical-box; I took him into another room to search him - I cautioned him, and told him he might do as he pleased, he might say nothing, or he might save me a great deal of trouble; he denied it - I said it was useless denying it; he afterwards said I should find it in Old-street-road, at Mr. Coates' - a woman gave me the box there from between some bedticking on a shelf; I took it to Mr. Sawer - he put the clock on it, which exactly fitted it.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

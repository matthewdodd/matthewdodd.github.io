I am a jeweller, at 45, High-street, Lambeth—on Monday, 3d August, about 12 at night, I saw the deceased run out of the Windmill public-house, and the prisoner after her—she stopped about seven or eight yards off, and a person named Cooke with her, and the prisoner took and knocked her down—she either fell or slid down, and when she was down he kicked her—I only saw him kick her once—she then got up and ran and sat on the door of the public-house—he then hit her again, and made use of bad words, and said, "I will kill you"—he did not kick her that time—he asked her for his tickets—she said, "I have got a pretty face for to work in the morning"—I observed that she had a black eye as usual—I have seen her a good many times with those marks—he accused a woman who was standing there, of getting her out to drink, and pawning his things for drink—he then went across the road and left her sitting there, and I came away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 25, Church-street, Lambeth—I was called to Windmill-court, and saw the deceased lying in the arms of a woman, who was supporting her on a chair—she was then dead, and had been dead about ten minutes—I made a very superficial examination at that time—I saw that she had a black eye—on the 8th I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> ex<lb></lb>amination, by order of the Coroner, seventy-two hours after death—on removing the skull-cap, I found the membranes of the brain highly congested, the brain itself softened, and extravasation, had gone on at the base of the brain on the left side; that was recent—I found the lungs congested, and on the right side a transverse fracture of the anterior sixth rib, which had per<lb></lb>forated the pleura; that was of recent date—the liver was enlarged, not nutmegged; it was adherent to the side from previous inflammation—the gall-bladder contained a minute quantity of bile, the stomach was softened, and there were traces of inflammation of a sub-acute character, such as we find from intemperance—the heart was suffused, rather below the average size, the walls thin, but no organic disease beyond—I came to the conclusion that death was caused by the shock to the nervous system, arising from the injury to the pleura—that might originate from a blow—it arose from violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You speak of the membranes of the brains; do you mean the vessels surrounding the brain, or the substance of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The vessels surrounding it; there was a coagulum formed at the posterior lobe on the left side—that would not of necessity cause insensibility; it does sometimes, but more frequently paralysis—the period at which it produces insensibility differs according to circumstances, from a week to a fortnight—there was about a table-spoonful—the extravasation appeared to have been recent; I mean within twenty-four hours—she was a person of a debi<lb></lb>litated state of health, not extremely so—she was in that state that any</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186308170088"></xptr>
               <p>shock to the system would turn the balance against her—she was, no doubt, a person given to drink—the brain may have become softened by dissipated habits—softening of the brain frequently causes death—death might have arisen from the softening of the brain, or from the effects of the fracture of the rib, penetrating the pleura—in my opinion the latter was the cause of death, not the softening of the brain—the vessels of the brain would be con<lb></lb>gested by excessive drinking, and a fall or a succession of falls might pro<lb></lb>duce a rupture of an artery, and cause such a coagulum as I found, and that pressing on the brain might produce insensibility; not within half an hour—I know the works of the Dutch author Vandercrofts—he is considered an authority on these matters—death would no doubt have resulted ultimately from the effect of the softening of the brain—it is possible, but not probable that a succession of falls might cause the rupture of the artery, and so produce death, but in this instance we had a blow on the eye, and effusion going on at the posterior base of the brain as if from a blow—it is possible that injury might result from a fall—I have known persons live for years with softening of the brain—I should not expect in the case of a person so suffering, addicted to drink, and meeting with a fall, that death would supervene—I should undoubtedly expect that a person suffering from perforation of the pleura would exhibit symptoms of excessive pain within a few hours—a transverse fracture of the rib might be produced equally as well by a fall as by a blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any means of ascertaining how recently before you examined the body the rib had been broken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was evidently within forty-eight hours—a person might be able to go about after meeting with that injury, but suffering excruciating pain—I have no doubt the per<lb></lb>foration of the pleura took place at the time the rib was broken—but for the broken rib she might have lingered for some time—the symptoms I saw in the brain were consistent with her living for some time—I take it that the shock to the system, from the effect of a blow, proved fatal.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What would be likely to produce the extravasation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may arise from natural causes, or from the effects of external injury, such as a blow—I attribute the death to the injury to the pleura, and not to the effect of the extravasated blood on the brain.</p>

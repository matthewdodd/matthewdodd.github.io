            . I am an officer, I was sent for to the shoemaker's on Sunday the 2nd of July. I went up in the prisoner's room in company with Mr. Swift. I found the prisoner and her husband there, I asked them if they had got any bank notes whatever in their apartment, the husband said he had got a one pound note which he had taken for his labour, he produced it. Mr. Swift looked at that note, and said that was not the note which he had lost, I then saw the woman was flurried, I searched her as far as decency would let me, she put her hand under her stays and sat down on a box by the side of the bed, Mrs. Swift was called in, on the bed was this hussiff containing this one pound note, Mr. Swift said it was his.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

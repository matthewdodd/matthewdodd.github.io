               <p>Jury to Dolland. Was he in your employ at that time? - Yes; he worked in the upper part of the house.</p>

               <p>To Dolland. Had he absented himself from the work? - Not at all; he was at my house that morning to open shop, it being a holiday, he was the only man that came; there was nothing else found about him.</p>

               <p>A box produced with some things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dolland. Here is another pair of spectacles among the articles, they have not the glasses in now, but they had when first made, there were some glasses found in his lodging, and some implements used for no other purpose than putting these glasses in, other glasses are put in I am positive to that, on account of the mark.</p>

               <p>Jury. How had the prisoner behaved during the fifteen months? - Tolerably well.</p>
               <p>Was he ill any time during his servitude? - He was, a short time; I enquired after him, that he should not be in distress; I was told his father-in-law was come from sea, and had supplied him with money, his wife declared the same.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was his pay intermitted during the time of his illness? - Certainly it was.</p>

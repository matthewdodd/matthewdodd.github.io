               <p>I am an excise officer, and was so in the year 1789; my business was at Plymouth Dock; there were some people at Mutton-Cooe, between one and two in the morning, landing some casks; every man had a cask<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230072"></xptr>and a large stick; I was concealed in the rocks; they passed me and the other officers towards Plymouth Dock; we followed them and took some of the casks away; the prisoner was among those who was in the boat, and he was one who had a cask taken from him; they went behind an empty house, and deposited their casks; I went up to them, and one of them struck me on the head with a bludgeon, and cut my head very much, then three or four fell upon me, and the blood flowed all over my face; they throwed stones after me, and they broke my leg; then they took me to a door, and presently they brought an anker of gin and put beside me; then James Taylor was brought and laid down by me, and his leg was also broke; then the smugglers came and said kill the b - rs; one of them said, O! d - n me, they are dead enough. I don't know that the prisoner did any damage.</p>

               <p>I was an excise officer. On the 2d of April, 1789, I saw the prisoner with a keg on his back, and a bludgeon; my father was laid on the steps of a public house, called the Fortune of War. I am sure I saw the prisoner go back, after my father was beat, to the gang; I saw the prisoner afterwards between the distance of one month and seven; I saw the prisoner at Caursand, with a bill-hook in his hand; I saw him again in a public house, and he asked me to drink, and told me I should not be hurt, I drank with him, and he said I was in the company, but I did not strike; they will all say so.</p>

            , he called it a letter; he said he had found a letter, and so he gave it me.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing else? - No, he did not say much else.</p>
               <p>What did you say in consequence of receiving that letter? - I could do nothing with it, only kept it in my possession; I had more before and behind.</p>
               <p>Who were they delivered to you by? - His wife and he chiefly, both of them; and one I found on the hole of the necessary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd Prisoner's Counsel. Only tell us about that one letter.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecution. This letter dated the 7th of March, you are sure you received from him? - Yes, they pretended to say they found them.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find out who sent them? - No, we never found out who, nor how.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. I believe you live in the neighbourhood of Harrow school? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe you were unfortunate enough Mr. Dancer, not to be very popular among the Harrow boys? - No, but they did not owe me any ill-will after this time.</p>
               <p>Had not you got them flogged three times before these letters were sent? - They were, twice.</p>
               <p>The Harrow boys had plagued you a good deal, before you got these people in the house, they had locked you up in the stable, and things of that sort? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not the boys come and threaten to be revenged? - They did not threaten to be revenged.</p>
               <p>They did not pull part of the roof down? - They never did visit my house in that way; I do not know that they pulled the tiles off; it was not them that brought these letters.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath now, did not they plague you handsomely? - They never touched me, nor hurt me.</p>
               <p>You did not come out when the boys came I believe? - I had no occasion to come out.</p>
               <p>Did not the boys come and plague you from time to time? - Yes; school-boys will do so.</p>
               <p>Were not you the constant object of their fun? were not they always coming to teize you? - They were not always, now and then.</p>
               <p>Did not you get these people into your house for the purpose of protecting you from these boys? - No, not them boys, there were others, thieves.</p>
               <p>Was not the whole parish against you? - I do not know that the whole parish was against me.</p>
               <p>How long did these people live in your house? - Nearly half a year.</p>
               <p>How long after you received this letter? - I did not set down the day of the month when they quitted it; I believe it was in March; they set it down at Sir Sampson's, and I did not take the account any further.</p>
               <p>Tell us any where within a month, what time they quitted you? - I suppose it got towards April before they quitted me; it is entered down.</p>
               <p>These people used in fact to do business for you as servants? - They never did any thing for me, for I did not care to set people to work that I could not satisfy.</p>
               <p>Did not the man set up all night once? - He was paid for that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230104"></xptr>Did not this man sit up constantly to guard your house? - He did with other people a while.</p>
               <p>Did not the Harrow boys know he was your guard? - I do not know that they did.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear them when they came in a posse, swear revenge against Hammond as well as against you? - I never heard that from them.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear it from any body else, that Hammond had been threatened by the boys? - His own wife might say so.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear it from any body else? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Hammond himself brought you this letter? - Hammond delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>Did not Hammond tell you he found this on your premises, and therefore he gave it you? - Yes, he told me he found it.</p>
               <p>Why I see in this letter that Hammond is threatened? - That is only a sham of his wife's.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was a sham of his wife; who put you in the head of this notable prosecution? - Who put me in the head of it, all the neighbours; they said, they found them in the house of office, where I never went in half a year; she went there, and nobody else chiefly.</p>
               <p>Was not this man one of your guards? - The neighbours all told me, that the letters came from them.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, after you received this letter, did not you yourself, appoint that man to be one of the guards of your own house? - He appointed himself; he proposed to be one, and I did not refuse him; I suffered him to be one, and he was one.</p>
               <p>Was not he one for a month? - He never was paid for a month, he was paid for about a fortnight; he served me about a fortnight as a guard; I did not appoint him, he was willing, and I was glad; and I was willing to take a mad dog for my safety.</p>
               <p>Had not you two other guards as well as that man? - I had three more, I did not think them all too much; I had no right to be burnt, and set fire to, and killed.</p>
               <p>How often had your house been attacked? - Several times.</p>
               <p>How many times during the two last years; how often was you robbed within the two last years? - I was robbed about twice, and pilfered; my house has been broke open more than once, it was broke open in the night; I did not see the persons in particular.</p>
               <p>However, before this thing happened, the Harrow boys had been about your house, and you had had them flogged for it. - The Harrow boys were not concerned in this.</p>
               <p>(The Letter read.)</p>

               <p>Had you then seen this paper at the time you said this to her? - No, Sir, I had not; she said I know you can, Mrs. Mason, but I do not trouble my head about you, for you cannot swear to it, nor any body else, for it is wrote upon whitish-brown paper.</p>

               <p>When you told her you could clear her from it, she said no, you cannot, for nobody can swear to it; can you write yourself? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>So you mean to say that you have seen that woman write so often, you not being able to write yourself, that you can venture now upon your oath to say, you believe it is her hand-writing? - I was sent for to look at it; I was told nothing by any body that sent for me.</p>

               <p>Of course, I suppose you talked to Mrs. Newman about this afterwards? - No, Sir, I do not know that we did, I said to Mrs. Newman, how foolish she was to talk so; Mrs. Newman told me she heard the conversation.</p>
               <p>When did she tell you that? - She heard it then, as well as me.</p>
               <p>When did you talk about the conversation with Mrs. Newman? - A great many times.</p>
               <p>Then Mrs. Newman told you she heard what passed? - Yes, she did several times.</p>
               <p>It unluckily happens that Mrs. Newman has told us, that she never told any body of it till she was supoened? - Only me, she has told me.</p>

            ; I have seen her write.</p>
               <p>Look at that paper, what do you believe? - I believe it to be her writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Can you write? - A little, Sir.</p>
               <p>Why when did you ever see her write? - I cannot justly say when it was; it must be about a year and a half ago, I saw her write twice.</p>
               <p>Do you undertake upon your oath, to swear to your belief of her hand-writing? No, Sir, I should not chuse to do it; I swear to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear upon your oath, that in your conscience you believe that to be her hand-writing, from the knowledge you have had of her writing? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Never having seen her write but twice in your life? - I do not know what she wrote, I saw her in the act of writing; I did not read it.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did you stand? - By the side of the table where she sat.</p>
               <p>Did you look over her? - No, Sir, I did not see the words that she wrote; I do not know that I could swear what she did write, because I did not see it directly, but I saw it in the house afterwards.</p>
               <p>When were you first applied to, to come as a witness? - I was subpoened by Mr. Dancer.</p>
               <p>Who had you told first that you knew her hand-writing? - Lady Tempest, I was sent for to her house.</p>
               <p>How came she to guess that you knew this poor woman's hand-writing? - Because she had written to my wife.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see her write? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at that paper; when did you see her write? - I have seen her write since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. But you cannot say as an honest woman, that it is her hand-writing? - I really cannot say that this is her handwriting.</p>
               <p>What do you know of this transaction of your own knowledge? - Why, Sir, they made Mr. Dancer believe that my sons were concerned in bringing these papers, he said he never had.</p>
               <p>LADY TEMPEST sworn.</p>
               <p>Your Ladyship knows the situation of this man's premises I understand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is the necessary near the room where this woman lived? - Very near the end of the window where they lived.</p>
               <p>How close? - I suppose they could not go by it, unless they went over the ditch, without the next door neighbour seeing them.</p>
               <p>Do you know the hand-writing of this woman? - I have seen her write; I verily believe that to be her hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Does your Ladyship know whether this poor man can write at all? - He told me he could not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. You say, Madam, you have seen this woman write? - I have since this letter was sent.</p>
               <p>I believe your Ladyship sent for this woman to write for you? - To write for me, no, Sir; Mr. Dancer commonly used to bring letters over to my house for me to read them.</p>
               <p>I only ask you as to having seen her write herself; did you ever see her write before these letters were sent? - Never before I saw her write at my own house; I sent for her.</p>
               <p>You desired her to write? - I desired her to write for this reason, because Mr. Dancer had brought the man over to assign some reason; he declared his innocence.</p>
               <p>You saw her write at your house, you desired her to write? - I accused them all in having that writing; I meant to vindicate her.</p>
               <p>Did she not write at your house at your desire? - I did not desire her to write at my house, I said, I have judged you very hardly, and so do all the neighbours as such; Mr. Dancer has brought me a bit of paper.</p>
               <p>Did not she write at your house? - Yes, before me.</p>
               <p>Your Ladyship told your suspicions before? - I had.</p>
               <p>And yet she wrote at your house afterwards in your sight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To furnish evidence against herself I suppose? - I hope it will be to vindicate herself.</p>
               <p>Had not you told her of your suspicions, Madam? - I had, she certainly knew it was for the purpose of comparing her writing with the letters.</p>
               <p>Then she must know if she was guilty; it was to furnish evidence against herself? - I suppose she must.</p>
               <p>Then it was from this subsequent knowledge gained by you after the matter happened, that your Ladyship can swear to her hand-writing? - I swear to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Your Ladyship sent for this woman to clear herself if possible? - I did; she offered to write before me; I said to her, I have judged you very hard, I have not judged you only in my own opinion, but I have spoke publicly.</p>
               <p>Court. You say, Madam, that you did not desire her to write? - Not at my house; I told her if she would write, if she was injured, as I had seen the name of

My Lord, in this case, though I have not much doubt on the subject, in point of fact, yet I think it my duty to take an objection, in point of law, to this evidence; your Lordship sees both the statutes, on which the indictment was framed, have constituted it a capital offence, if any person shall knowingly send a letter to any person, demanding money; or in the other case, shall knowingly send, threatening to burn his house, and such offence shall be deemed a felony; in this case, the evidence is (if it is any thing) that this man,

            , delivered this letter to Dancer; I submit that the policy of the law which made that a felony, was for the purpose of discovering people who secretly did send those sort of letters to other persons, by which means their peace of mind was hurt; and in short, they themselves were put in danger; but I submit that the act of parliament certainly did not mean to extend this offence to the hand that actually delivered it; for if you should think that delivering a letter is an offence within this statute, which it certainly is not, then you will take these words into your consideration also, namely, shall knowingly do so; now it would be too much, where the man who actually delivers the letter, and whose duty it was to do so, be it sent by whom it would, was a servant; this is not the case of a stranger coming and delivering a letter of this sort, in which the act of doing it would afford a suspicion; but this is the circumstance of the man at the bar, a servant, an inmate of the family, and whose duty it was, come from whom it might, unless he was the actual party who wrote it, and fabricated it, to deliver it to his master; therefore it requires a stronger evidence, in this case, to shew that he was the actual party; because, if the delivery should be held by your Lordship to be within the statute, still I submit it must be a delivery by a person knowing the contents of it, and not merely by a servant; my Lord, there was a case before Lord Mansfield, in the County of Kent; the name of the case I do not recollect; it was an indictment on this statute; there the man who was indicted, was the party who brought the letter to the prosecutor, and who delivered it to him himself; and I recollect taking this objection there; and I am pretty confident my Lord Mansfield said he thought the policy of the law was meant against the persons who secretly sent these sort of letters to others, and meant the man who knew the contents of such letter; my Lords, in considering a penal act, you will be strict in seeing that the offence comes precisely within the words of it; when I mention the uniform construction of your Lordships on the statutes of private stealing from the person, which is made a felony, without the benefit of clergy; so strict have all the Judges been, that the smallest knowledge of any human creature, that a man was in the act of stealing at the time, has always been held to take it out of the statute, because the strictest construction of the act must be complied with; and if your Lordships have been so strict in that case, I trust you will also in this, where it has been said, that knowing of the sending a letter to another person, shall be deemed a felony, without benefit of clergy; you will not think the delivery is within the words of that statute, and it seems to me to be scarcely within the policy of it, which is to prevent secret acts; I submit therefore, in this case, it will intitle me to an acquittal; but if your Lordship should think that any thing does lay against the man, still I think at least the woman is intitled to her acquittal, as being the wife of the man, and as to the man himself, he cannot write.</p>
               <p>Court. When I sum up to the Jury, I certainly shall tell them, that in case they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230109"></xptr>think this was done in the presence of the husband, and by his privity, that the law will not impute it to her as a crime; on the other hand, if they should suppose that she did these things without his privity, and only made use of him as the instrument; in that case she may be guilty separately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen spoke on the same side; Mr. Silvester, in answer; and Mr. Shephard replied.</p>
               <p>Court. In all cases where an offence is made so very penal as this is, at certainly is necessary that it should appear to be within the intention of the legislature, and likewise within the act of parliament itself; now the words of that act are, that if any person shall knowingly send, &amp;c. they shall be guilty; now I own myself, I cannot think, that under these words,</p>
               <p>"send any letter" that the carrying of a letter does come precisely within the terms of the act of parliament; if the legislature had been asked at the time when they passed this act of parliament, whether it was an offence of the same kind, I have no doubt but they would have said, Oh, yes, by all means; but we are not to say what the legislature ought to have done, but what they have done; now it seems to me at that time, when the act passed, the legislature never had it in contemplation, that any man would have been the carrier of his own letter, but that they should go either by the post, or by some conveyance which would never bring it to the knowledge of the prosecutor by whom it was sent; if they had had the case in view, they would have provided for it; therefore I own myself, it is very clear that this is a case that does not come within the words of the act of parliament; and an act so penal as this is, ought not to be extended by construction; another circumstance that makes it appear more strongly is, that in another act of parliament, which is not so penal as the present, it is said, that if any person shall send or deliver any letter, to accuse another of a crime, with a view to extort money, &amp;c. now that shews, that where the legislature had meant a particular act to have created an offence, that they knew how to make use of the words proper to do it, and that is in my mind a convincing proof that they had it not in their contemplation at the time.</p>

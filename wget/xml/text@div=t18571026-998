                  </hi>. I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi> last year. We sailed from Hartlepool in May to Pont de Galle—she was 508 tons burden—the defendant was the master; Robinson was the first mate, and Gibson the second—there were three apprentices on board, and one of them, Robert Eastick, was the cabin boy—I remember a boy being over<lb></lb>board on 18th Aug.; on that morning I was at the wheel between 8 and 10 o'clock, and the captain asked me how she was steering; I said, "Middling"—he then went down into the cabin where the boy was, and I heard him say, "What is this knife on this table?"—the boy said, "That is the knife you cut some cheese with for breakfast"—the captain said, "I did not"—the boy said, "Yes, Sir, you did," and then I heard the boy <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> out, "Murder!" and saw him try to come up on deck—he was about two steps below the deck, and the captain caught him by his neck behind, and came on deck in front of him, and said, "Go and do your duty"—the boy said, "No, I shall not if you use me like that"—the captain then came in front of him, and caught hold of his hands while his arm was round the companion sails—his arm was rubbed on the brass, and I saw the skin coming off as he tried to loose him from the companion—the boy said, "You rascal, what are you trying to do? you are trying to break my arm</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260002"></xptr>
               <p>and neck"—he had then hold of the companion, and said, "Hold on, some<lb></lb>body will take my part by and by;" and he <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "George, George, look what he is trying to do, he is trying to break my arm and neck"—I said nothing, but remained at the wheel—the captain got him loose from the companion, and gave him a kick in front of his head with his boot, and sent him down the companion into the cabin; he fell down at once—the captain was on the deck when he kicked him on the forehead—the stairs are about six feet high—about five minutes afterwards the boy came up on deck; the captain was on deck; the second mate, Mr. Gibson, was there, and the captain told him to let the boy go to his duty—the second mate said, "Go and do your duty," and the boy went down into the cabin to make some <hi rend="italic">duff</hi> for a pudding for dinner—I came from the wheel at 10 o'clock, and saw the <hi rend="italic">duff</hi> in a basin, which he gave to the cook, and complained to him of the way in which he had been treated—I saw his arm at 12 o'clock in the cook's galley; he showed it to me; the skin was off the middle of it, and it was red—in the course of that afternoon I heard a cry of a boy being overboard—I was in the forecastle; I did not see the boy, but I saw his hat in the water—it was a nice, beautiful day—we put the ship about to see if we could see him; Johnson, who was at the wheel, did that; he is not here—no orders were given by the captain when the boy went overboard—I heard the orders from the second mate to keep the ship away from the boy, to see if we could get him—there was no boat lowered; we had boats on board—no life buoy was thrown to him; there was one on board, I do not know how many—no rope was thrown to him—I heard the captain say one day, when he was flogging him with a rope's end, "You b—, I will make you rue the day you came on board the <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>"—I have seen the captain give him a great big handspike to carry on his shoulder, weighing about 25 lbs.—he has sometimes carried it for two hours, and sometimes for four, like a musket—the last time was from 8 till half past 11 o'clock at night—I have seen that twice—I asked the boy what it was done for—I did not hear the captain say what he gave it him for—I saw the captain flog him once besides, with a rope's end about an inch and a half thick—I do not know what it was for—he was about fourteen years old, and was a handy lad.</p>

                  </hi>. I was cook on board the barque <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>, from Hartlepool, in May, 1856—the defendant was the captain—that was my first voyage with him—I remember the day the boy went overboard; I heard the cry of "A boy overboard!"—it was about a quarter to 4 o'clock—I had seen the captain beat the boy very severely that day in the cabin—I was in the galley, and heard the boy crying out "Murder!"—I went to the stairs, and looked down the poop, and the captain had got him, beat<lb></lb>ing him down in the cabin, and he kicked him with his sea boot on the arm—the chief mate was on deck, and, as he did not interfere, I did not go into the cabin, but returned to the galley to see about dinner—I did not hear any more cries then; the boy came to the galley about 12 o'clock for the captain's dinner—his arm was then black and blue, and part of it was red, with the blood ready to gush out, and he said, "Look here, how that fellow has hit me"—I had frequently seen the boy at other times going out, and made to walk the deck, like a soldier, from 8 o'clock at night till 10—I have often seen that; when he did not beat him he starved him—he beat him with a reef point, what they reef the sails with; it is a little smaller than a rope, not so stout as a rope; it has a bit of twine at the end—there was no iron eye to it—I was in the galley when I heard the cry of "A boy overboard!"—the man at the wheel <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> it out; he was a man named Johnson—John Stowe, one of the able seamen, ran forwards, and put the wheel down himself, without any order from the captain—the captain did not give any order at all—no boat was lowered, nor any rope thrown—the captain had the life buoy in his hand, and never attempted to heave it overboard—I did not see the boy's hat on the water—it was smooth water—we were going four or five knots an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I was second mate on board the <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>, which left Hartlepool for Ceylon. I knew the lad Eastick, who was an apprentice—the defendant was the captain—I had not sailed with him before—there was also an apprentice named Lashbrooke, and another named Potter—I left the vessel through sickness at Colombo—the boy was missing before I left—I do not know how he came overboard—he was much under my eye—my berth was five yards from the captain's cabin—the boy acted as steward, and waited on the captain, and on me, and the first mate, at dinner—he was generally occupied below, and about the captain's cabin—he cleaned out my cabin, but not the chief mate's—I have never heard cries from the boy of "Murder!" or seen the captain flog or strike him—I have seen him when he has been washing himself, and he has been naked to his waist, all but his trowsers, but saw no marks on his back of ill usage—he was never off duty from sickness—hr never made any complaint to me of ill treatment on the part of the captain—I had never seen any indication that he was suffering anything—he took his meals regularly, as far as I know—he slept on the half deck—from there to my cabin is about fifteen yards—I have never known him what I call punished—I have seen the captain order him to walk the deck with a handspike or capstan bar, for negligence, or idle conduct—that is not a cruel or harsh punishment—I have known it employed on vessels—I should say one capstan bar weighs about 10 lbs., and the other about 7 lbs.—as he walked about the deck he could change the position of the capstan bar from one arm to the other—I have seen him rest at intervals when he has been walking about—as far as physical pain goes, a flogging would have been decidedly much worse than the capstan bar—I have seen other of the apprentices ordered to carry a capstan bar when they have had misconduct alleged against them—the youngest boy next to him had to do so when he had done something which he ought not—from my being close to the captain, and having the boy near me constantly, if the captain had been regularly in the habit of flogging "him, and if he had been in the regular habit of crying out "Murder!" I believe I must have heard it—the boy was missing on 19th Aug., 1856—I saw the captain holding the boy by the arm on the companion ladder that day, about 11 o'clock—the boy was standing on the second step of the companion ladder—the captain told him to go below, and clean the cabin out—he said that he would not—I was coming along to get some rope yarn, to make a sail up, and I said to the boy, "Go below"—I immediately went down, and he was in the fore cabin, but he never spoke to me, or said anything—that was all I saw of the companion ladder that day—I was afterwards in bed, and the captain <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out to me as he was running up the companion ladder—I jumped up, drew on my trowsers, and there was a cry of "Some person overboard!"—I rushed on deck—the mate was there—we shortened sail, and got the ship on another tack—that was the right thing to do, and the likeliest thing to find the boy—that was done by the captain's orders—if I had been in the same position I should have done the same thing—I could not have done anything better—we got her very nicely on another tack within twenty yards—we continued about an hour looking for the boy—there were two men on the fore top-sail yards—no boat was lowered—the boat was lashed and cross lashed—it would have taken us about half an hour to lower the boats—if we had lowered them, instead of tacking, we</p>

               <p>should not have been more likely to have found the boy—the captain had not a life buoy in his hand—there was one on board—I should have <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> it at any object if I had seen it—it would have been of no use to hurl it out before we saw an object—I should have hurled it over his head if I could—Mr. Robinson had it—I never saw a line to it, and I should not think it would be advisable—the weather was fair, and the sea smooth—we dined that day at 12 o'clock—that was after what had occurred on the companion ladder—the boy waited on us at dinner—there was no mark of a kick on his forehead—I saw him having his dinner that day—he ate it heartily—I saw no bruise on his arm—I saw him cleaning out the cabin after dinner, when I went to bed—he would have to fetch the water from the ship's side—there was nothing in his demeanour or manner which struck me in waiting on us at dinner—everything was the same as usual—he got his dinner in the fore cabin—he had the control of the cooked meat in the cabin—there was no cheese lost on the voyage—I am in the captain's watch, and am at least twelve hours out of twenty-four in his company—I have never seen him ill treat the boy.</p>

               <p>consider that a more lenient punishment than flogging, decidedly; I have known it adopted in other vessels, and have adopted it myself—I have authority to punish boys when they require it—one capstan bar weighs 7 lbs. and the other 10 lbs.—the boy was in good health on board, he never made complaints to me—he used to wait on the captain and the second mate and me at dinner—he had access to the cooked meat, and could have helped himself to it, and would not have been blamed—my berth is about three feet from the companion—I have seen the boy washing, but saw no marks of ill-treatment on him—if he had been constantly ill-treated and screaming "Murder!" I must have known it—I know Prince Montague—I heard him make a threat against the captain after the hearing at the police court, on 19th or 20th Aug.; he was going from the ship, and I heard him say that he would have his certificate taken away and ruin him from going captain of a ship any more—George Hicks was standing close to him when he used those words—coming home we had, I think, a fortnight longer voyage than we expected—when the boy was overboard everything was done by the captain that could be done to find him; the vessel was put about immediately; a life buoy was not thrown out, but it was ready—the boats were not lowered, because we did not see the body floating; they were lashed and cross lashed, it would have taken half an hour to get them out—the steps that the captain took were the speediest that could be if the body appeared.</p>

             sworn. - I am a serjeant-major; I saw all the prisoners at the Thistle and Crown, Charing-cross, on or about the 3d. of October, I cannot exactly speak to the day; I went there with a recruit; Jeffreys was taking with a man there, and the other two came in afterwards; I saw that outside man, Dempster, take the bag, and go out of the room with it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the bag was taken away, did they all go? - A. No; the next man, in the middle, Draper, went out directly after him; and Jeffreys went out in about five or six minutes after the other two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pursue them? - A. I did not; about four o'clock, the same days, as I was going into Backingham-street, I saw Jeffreys along with the other two prisoners, and the other two had got the three bundles in their possession; I had got a comrade along with me, and I said, I suspected these men had got the Jew's property, and we would take them if we could; I immediately cried out, stop thief; and, in turning Denmark-street, they threw the three bundles into an area; I still pursued them, I could not overtake them; but Jeffreys stood still, and the other two men made their escape; when I found I could not overtake the other two. I laid hold of Jeffreys, and told him he should go back to where the property was, as he was in the room when it was taken out; he said, he would knock my b-y eyes out, and he would do me; but I was determined not to let him go till I had got him to where the property was; it was brought out of the area, and the gentlemen of the house sent his servant with me to the Thistle and Crown; Jeffreys was wrested from me by another guardsmen, and I was obliged to let him go, or else I was going with him to Bow-street.</p>

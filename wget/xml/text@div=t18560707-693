                  </hi>. I am a colour grinder, in the employ of George Spill and others, in St. George's-street, East. I was there on 13th June—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070040"></xptr>
               <p>prisoner was colour grinder and engine driver in their service—I saw the prisoner that day in front of the mill—he filled a keg of white lead from an iron tank—it was my master's property—he took it part of the way throng the shop, and left it between two casks—he went to the back of the pre<lb></lb>mises for two or three minutes—he then returned, and took the keg of white lead outside the door—in a few minutes afterwards he returned to the front of the mill, and told me he was going out for a short time, and if it should want any fireing put on, would I do it—I said, "Yes"—after that he went out of the premises, and in the course of a few minutes he went by the front of the door with something under his left arm, which appeared rolled up, and covered with some kind of cloth, similar in size to the 56lb keg that I had seen him with—I afterwards saw a pot of Prussian blue, which my employer said was in the wrong place.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you happen to get hold of any money which you were about to throw into a tank to conceal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not sink it in a tank when I was in the counting house—I have not told the prisoner that I was going to sink it in a tank, when Mr. Oxley found me—I gave it up to Mr. Oxley—I did not get hold of some 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. papers of coppers, and keep them—there was a <hi rend="italic">Sandy</hi> Lawson employed there; he and I did not get hold of a barrel of beer, and roll it in, and drink it, and burn the cask—I can bring the publican to prove different to that—the men did not get drunk with the beer—there is no truth in the statement about the money and the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. peeked—all the copper was 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;, and we told Mr. Oxley of it, and he told us to spend it—I did not tell the prisoner that I was about to throw the money into the tank, and about the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. papers of halfpence and the barrel of beer; it is not true—I left Mr. Hubbock's for getting drunk, but it was not with that barrel of beer—it is about two years since I left Mr. Hubbock—I lived with him about nine years—the fire happened about twelve months before I left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, be careful; in the course of conversation with the prisoner, a short time before he was taken, did you not tell him those things which I have mentioned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all, Sir—the day I saw this was 13th June, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning—it was on a Friday—I never said it was on Thursday.</p>

I was on duty before the pro<lb></lb>secutor's premises on 13th June, and saw the prisoner about 10 minutes before 7 o'clock come out with a keg, and go into the Rose and Crown public house, next door, kept by Mr. Matthis—in about five minutes he came out, went into the prosecutor's premises, stayed there about five minutes, and came out again with something wrapped in a smock frock—he went round the Highway—I followed him to take him, but lost sight of him—the parcel was about the same size as the keg.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 149). I took the prisoner on Saturday, 14th June—he said, "I suppose they have got hold of something, but I will I make them suffer for it"—I told him he was charged with stealing a keg of lead from his employers—I went to his house, No. 16, Upper Grove-street, and found this pot of Prussian blue in one corner of the two pair of stain room, which is his room—after I had him in custody, he did not speak to any one—he put on his hat and coat, and went with me.</p>

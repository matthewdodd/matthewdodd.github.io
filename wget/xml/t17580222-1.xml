               <p>Q. How long were you together there?</p>
               <p>Lewis. About half a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go into the house?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No, she did not. I had been to receive my wages, which was twelve shillings and a thirty-six shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you called any where going along?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No, I had not; nor spoke to any body in the street besides the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your money when she and you were together at the door where you lodge?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I am sure I had it in my pocket when I first met with her. When she went from me she fell a running. I felt in my pocket, and found my large piece of money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. In which pocket was your money?</p>
               <p>Lewis. It was in my left-hand breeches pocket, and my knee buckles in my right.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon, after you missed your money, was it that you took her?</p>
               <p>Lewis. In about three or four minutes. I found she had her hand clinch'd. She drop'd two shillings and one of my buckles on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her drop them ?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No; but she pointed to it on the ground, under her, and said, there lies your money. I took it up, and said here is not all, I have lost a piece of gold; if you'll give me that you may keep the silver. She said, she had got no gold. I call'd the watch, and he took her to the Round-house. She was searched, but nothing except two halfpence was found upon her.</p>

               <p>Duckworth. It is about two or three hundred yards. She was searched at the Round house, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220003"></xptr> only two halfpence were found upon her. When she was going to the goal (I was with her) she desired to go into a shop, to buy herself a pair of stockings. She went in, bought two pair, and produced a 36 s. piece of gold to pay for them. The gentleman changed it for her.</p>

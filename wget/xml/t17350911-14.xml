My right Arm was held up so that I could not get it down. The Prisoner was close behind me with his left Hand on my Shoulder pushing me along. I felt my Watch pulled out of my Fobb, for my Breeches were prodigious tight. At the same time I saw the Prisoner's right Hand in between the Skirts of my Coat, but before I could get my Arm down he had got his Hand out and turned it behind him. In that posture I seized his Hand, G - D - ye, says I, You have got my Watch. I your Watch? says he, You are a Scoundrel, I have none of your Watch. Then says I, You have handed it to some of your Companions. Sir, says he, I am a Man of as good a Character as your self - but do not raise a Mob, and I will go with ye to the Tavern. So we went into the Tavern Kitchen, and there he readily pulled off his Coat, and I searched him, but to no purpose, upon which, he began to taunt, and threatned to make me suffer for scandalizing him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. By the vertue of your Oath, Did you see me hand the Watch, or so much as speak to any body?</p>

            . On Sunday Night the twenty ninth or thirtieth of June, between nine and ten o'Clock the Prisoner and I went to the Hoop Tavern. The Room we went into was a Ground Floor on the Right-hand going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173509110007"></xptr> up the Court. He called for half a Pint of Wine as soon as we came in, and afterwards for a Pint with Lemon and Sugar for a Cool Tankard, which were brought with a large Silver Tankard. He spoke for something to eat, and some Steaks being brought, he ordered a Tankard of Oat Ale, and that was brought too. He sent the Porter to some House in Cheapside to enquire for some Man, but I do not know what name - When the Porter returned, he sent him again to the Bull Head at Temple Bar, and when he came back from thence he bid him go to

               <p>Gaffney. This Man was catched in a Capital Offence - He was taken up for a stolen Mare, and he swears this to save his own Life.</p>

The other Tankard was melted down in three or four Lumps in Gaffney's Room while he was present, and three or four Days afterwards I carried it my self to Barthelemi; he weighed it, and gave me nine Guineas, but I said it came to nineteen Shillings more. He reckoned it at four Shillings and nine Pence or four Shillings and ten Pence an Ounce, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he ask ye no Questions?</p>
               <p>Ratcliff. He asked me if I dealt in the Country, and I answered, Yes, I deal in small Wares. I sent Charnock next Day for the nineteen Shillings, and he gave it her.</p>
               <p>Barthelemi. I bought the first Tankard for the full worth - As to what he brought I do not know what it had been, for it was melted down, and it weighed but forty three Ounces: And he being well drest, and telling me that he dealt in the Country, I had no suspicion of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Deveil. When I had examined Ratcliff and Charnock. I sent a Warrant for the Prisoner Barthelemi. When he came I read Ratcliff's whole Information to him, and he absolutely denied that he knew any thing of the matter; but when I brought out Ratcliff and Charnock to confront him, he owned that he bought the Tankards, and said he gave ten Pound seven Shillings for one of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shirly. As one of the Tankards was whole, I desired him to return it, but he told me it was gone to the Refiners - And when Justice Deveil prest him to produce it, he said he had sold it. It was marked IER for I bought that and other Plate of the Widow Emery, who kept the Cardigan's Head. He had frequented that House, and had often seen the Tankard there, and afterwards knew that I bought it: Besides, I advertised it, with a Description of the Mark and the Weight which was set at the bottom, and one of these Advertisements was left at his House (as will be proved by the Man who left it) but a few Hours before he bought it.</p>

            . Gaffney, and Ratcliff and I, all lodged in the same House. They came home together on Sunday Night, the twenty ninth or thirtieth of June, and brought two Silver Tankards which they said me they had got from the Hoop Tavern. Next Day about three in the Afternoon, I went to Barthelemi's House with the small Tankard. He was not at home, but his Wife desired me to stay, which I did. And soon after he came in, he lighted Candles, and shut up the Shop. He asked me no Questions how I came by it, but I told him without asking, that I came from Mr. Ratcliff.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173509110008"></xptr> Then he weighed the Tankard in a Room behind the Shop, and cast it up on a Piece of Paper, and told me how many Ounces it weighed, and how much it was an Ounce, but I have forgot both, only I remember he said it came to six Pound three Shillings, or wanting three Shillings, I do not know which. Then he asked me where I lived, I told him in Holborn - I then lived in Gray's Inn-lane - He said he was going that way to meet some Company, and he would see me so far homeward. So he went with me to the upper end of St. Martin's Lane in Long Acre, and would have gone farther but I refused, and so we parted, and I carried the Money to Ratcliff, who gave half of it to Gaffney.</p>
               <p>Barthelemi. Did not I ask you how you came by it?</p>
               <p>Charnock. No, not a Word.</p>
               <p>Barthelemi. Did not you pass for the Wife of one Johnson, and bring a Note?</p>
               <p>Charnock. No.</p>
               <p>Barthelemi. You did, and you said your Husband had had a Suit of Law in the Country, and on that account you was forced to sell the Tankard - What Letters was it marked with?</p>
               <p>Charnock. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Barthelemi. It was not on Monday that you brought it, but on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Court. Produce your Books and contradict her if you can, by shewing a regular Entry.</p>
               <p>Barthelemi. I keep no Books - I cannot write -</p>
               <p>[As this was hardly spoke loud enough for the Court to hear him distinctly, he dropt this Pretence and said] - I set it down so in my Book, and that I gave her six Pound nineteen Shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Deveil. After I had brought him to own that he bought the Tankards, he took me aside into another Room, and told me this matter might prove very troublesome to him, but it was in my power to make it more agreeable, and if I would go to his Shop he would make it easy to me, or Words to that effect: When I came back with him into the other Room, I asked him before twenty or thirty People, if he was not ashamed to offer to bribe me? He answered, that what he intended to give me - was only his Prayers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shirley. He sent for me into the same Room, and offered me twenty, twenty five, and then thirty Guineas if I would be easy - Will your Lordship please to ask Charnock about her selling him a Silver Pint Mug that was stolen from the Crown Tavern by GuildHall.</p>
               <p>Court. No, I cannot enquire into particular Facts for which he is not indicted.</p>
               <p>Barthelemi. I gave her five Shillings an Ounce for a Silver Mug.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pattison, a Turner. I live opposite to Barthelemi; he works hard in his Shop from Morning to Night - I have seen him buy Goods publickly, and never thought that he would buy any thing in a private clandestine way; for I took him to be as honest a Man as lived.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you never heard of his absconding on some account?</p>
               <p>Pattison. I have heard that an Action at Common Law was brought against him for a Watch; and that thereupon he went abroad because he had not Money to pay for the Watch and Charges.</p>
               <p>Barthelemi I stopt a Maid for offering to sell me a Tea-pot, till she sent for her Mistress.</p>
               <p>German Bonette. I was not present when the Maid came by her self, but I saw the Maid and her Mistress together in his Shop; and he told me that he had obliged the Maid to send for her Mistress.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 22nd of September, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming along Holborn-hill, and saw the prisoner and another boy following two gentlemen, who turned into Furnival's Inn; they then followed two other gentlemen, and when they got to Turnstile, the prisoner took this handkerchief from one of the gentlemen's pockets, and put it into his breast - I seized him, and dragged him some distance; I left him in custody, and went for the gentleman, who came and gave his card; he attended at Bow-street, and identified his property; but he is now gone to Paris - his name is Dr. John Murray, and his initials are on the handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along, and saw the handkerchief on the ground - I took it up and put it into my bosom; the officer came up, took me, and said,"What is that you have there?" - I said, "Is it yours?"</p>

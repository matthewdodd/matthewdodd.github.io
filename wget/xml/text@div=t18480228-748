Barclay's recently—he said no, he did not recollect having done it at all, or if he had it was a very long time ago—I asked him if he should know his own writing, and produced the three receipts—he examined them, and said they were his writing, and he had received the money for the casks—I asked what he had done with the money—he said he had given it to Arnall, excepting the porterage, which he kept for himself—I had him taken to the station—I knew Arnall well—I went to the Talbot—he had left—I found him in bed, at his lodging, in the Mint, at twelve o'clock at night—he said, "I suppose you are come about those casks?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Would not the morning have done for this?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I suppose I am to go to the station?"—I said, "Yes, Bishop is there"—I asked what he had done with the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he received of Bishop for the casks—he said he had given part of it to a man named Bash<lb></lb>ford, and had kept the rest himself.</p>

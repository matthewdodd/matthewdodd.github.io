I missed two shawls, which I had seen safe three hours before near the door; in consequence of which I went to the station-house—these are the two shawls (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); I know them by the pattern—I afterwards went with the policeman to the prisoners' father's house—I saw the father and the two prisoners; I went with the two prisoners, who were in custody at the time on another charge—we went about a shawl which has been before spoken of—I said his daughters had stolen a shawl, and the man said he had more shawls in his box given to the younger prisoner by Mrs. Stride, her mistress—the box was opened in the prisoners' presence, and two other shawls and several other things were in it—the policeman found these shawls, they were not in the box at all.</p>

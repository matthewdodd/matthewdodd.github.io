C.; one had a ring and the letter W., and a spot on the hip. Lamb's were marked on the shoulder, and one had a little pitch on the head. - I saw them afterwards, on Friday, the 24th, at the shop of Goodwin, a butcher, in Tothill-street, Westminster - I can swear the five are master's, and the other two are marked the same as Lamb's. The gate of the field was not locked, but was fastened with a spring latch. I have seen Royal Keates before, at Southall market.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Thursday, the 23d of November, at ten minutes past two o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners on the road leading from Barnes-common; I did not know them before, but am certain of them; they were coming towards Putney, with seven sheep; I stopped them, and asked where they were going with the sheep at such an unusual hour; they said they were going over Vauxhall-bridge, to Vauxhall-row; I asked if they had any ticket, to show to that effect - Royal Keates said No; I then asked where he brought the sheep from; he said from a grazier's at Windsor-park, that a countryman came out, and gave him the sheep at ten o'clock at night; I said, "Did you take no note down for the sheep?" he said, No, but Mr. Mills had purchased them some time ago; I asked what he was - he said he was a drover; I asked where his badge was - he said he had left it at home; he walked on a little way, and then said he had pawned his badge for 1s.; I asked William Keates what he knew about the sheep - he said his brother had spoken to him on the Wednesday, to go down into the country with him to fetch the sheep - that he went down with his brother by the coach, to Brentford, and being tired he stopped at the Castle public-house, at Brentford - that his brother left him, and returned in an hour and three-quarters, with seven sheep; I said it was impossible he could go to Windsor, fetch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070004"></xptr>the sheep, and return in an hour and three-quarters; he then said he knew nothing about it, it certainly was impossible for him to go to Windsor and return in that time. Royal Keates said three of the sheep were marked W. B. - I let them go on, but kept close to them, and followed them over Putney-bridge, leading towards the King's-road - I followed them five miles in all, and at half-past five o'clock, as it was getting day-light, I looked at the sheep, and said, "I don't see any W. B.;" there was no such mark; both the prisoners said, I might depend upon it all was right - that Mr. Mills had sent them to Windsor for the sheep - that Mills was a butcher, living in Vauxhall-row, over Vauxhall-bridge. I told Young, my partner, to remain with the prisoners and the sheep, which he did, while I went to Vauxhall-row; I knocked at Mills' door, and heard a man's voice within answer me, but I did not see him - I returned, and told Young, in the prisoners' presence, that Mills had sent nobody after any sheep, and therefore I should take them both into custody; on searching William Keates I found a key in his pocket, which I afterwards found belonged to a little shop in Vauxhall-row, four doors from Mr. Mills' - I put the prisoners into the watch-house, and the sheep into the pound at Rochester-row.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. They did not offer to run away? A. No; William Keates was rather getting off - he was stepping aside, to go off, but I collared and handcuffed him - he had not ran off.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was with Warren. We first saw the prisoners about ten minutes after two o'clock, on Thursday morning, the 23d of November, near Barnes-common, on the road leading towards Putney, with seven sheep; we stopped them, and asked where they were going with them; they said to take them over Vauxhall-bridge, to Mr. Mills, who had bought them some time before, and he had sent them to Windsor for them, and had given them 5s. to fetch them - that they met a man near Windsor-park, with the sheep, about ten o'clock; they said Mills was a butcher living in Vauxhall-row, on the other side Vauxhall-bridge; we asked if they had any note with the sheep; Royal said No; I asked if there were any marks on them - he said there was W. B. on three - it was too dark for as to see whether they were marked; they turned over the bridge, and we followed them to the King's-road, and at daylight we looked and could see no mark like W. B.; they went on then. Near Vauxhall-bridge we stopped them, and I detained them while Warren went over the bridge to Mills - he returned, and told me, in their presence, that Mills had not sent anywhere for any sheep; we then handcuffed William Keates, and drove the sheep into the pound; on the road, as we were taking the prisoners to the watch-house (we did not hold out either threat or promise to them), Royal Keates said, "To tell the truth, the sheep are stolen;" I told him I did not wish to hear any thing, if he had any thing to say to state it to the Magistrate; I then went to Mr. Goodwin's, in Tothill-street, Westminster, and, with his permission, I put the sheep into his stable; I put a mark on them, and they are the same that we took from the prisoners; I went frequently to see the sheep while they were there; they were killed by Goodwin. I took the skins into my possession, and have kept them ever since; I have them here. William Keates said nothing to me.</p>

            . Five of the skins produced belonged to Mr. Welch's sheep, and two to Lamb's - I can swear to them; they are the skins of the seven sheep I missed, and have the same marks - they belonged to the sheep I saw at Goodwin's; I had put them into the field on Wednesday, a little after three o'clock, and missed them a little after seven the next morning; the field is about a quarter of a mile from Southall, and in the County of Middlesex.</p>

            . I have seen the skins; five belong to Welch's sheep, and two to Lamb's - they are part of the one hundred and six sheep which were in the field - I had assisted in taking them out of the pens; they are the same I saw at Goodwin's last Friday, and last Friday week also.</p>
               <p>ROYAL KEATE'S Defence. I had been to Windsor, and on the road I happened to pick up these seven sheep in the middle of the road, between ten and eleven o'clock at night - at that time of night I did not know what to do with them; I went through Brentford, over Kew-bridge, and the officer stopped me at Barnes-common, with them, and asked where I was going; I said to Mr. Mills, over Vauxhall - they cross-questioned me so, I did not know what to say, but afterwards I said I found them, and was going to take them there, to be owned, and if they were not owned at the market I was going to advertise them. I lived close by Mills, and knew no other place to put them; immediately afterwards, as they were locking me up, one of the officers said, "You had better say whether you did take them or not?" I said I did not - he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070005"></xptr>"You had better tell me, and deliver yourself up, and I will see what I can do for you;" I said I had not stolen them, but picked them up on the road; my friends did not expect my trial to come on till to-morrow, and are not here.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM KEATE's Defence. My brother asked me to help him drive some sheep; I said, Yes, having nothing to do, and we rode down to the Castle public-house; I stopped there, saying I should go no further, it being late - he was gone about an hour and three quarters, and came back with seven sheep; he said he was going to take them to Mr. Mills; I did not ask where he got them, nor did he tell me. After our first hearing, Warren said,"You had better tell me the truth, and I will try and get you through it" - I said I knew nothing of it at all. I could have an excellent character - I have had a great deal of property in my care, to take to Goldsmith's-hall, from Mr. Thompson, of Air-street, Piccadilly.</p>

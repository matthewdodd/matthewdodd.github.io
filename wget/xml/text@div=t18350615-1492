                  </hi>. I am the son of Henry Newington, a glass-dealer, in Whitechapel. The prisoner was in our service—Mr. Dyte came and gave us information—we could not miss this glass—I swear these are my father's property—we keep these sort of physic bottles for only one customer, and mark them when we sell them to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. What can you swear to this glass by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is not such a bottle in London—it is graduated on both sides—I can swear to this tumbler by the make of it—there is no mark on it, but I know the make—we have them made for Mr. Coates, and they are all marked before they go into his house—the peculiarity is in the pattern—you will not find the same shape in London—we have often tried to match them, and are obliged to have them made—we should not sell them to any body but Mr. Coates—we never sell the goblets except to Mr. Coates, and we mark them all before they go into his house—I do not swear to these finger-glasses, nor this bottle—I can swear to this stopper, and can produce the bottle it belongs to—here are my gloves, which were found on the prisoner's person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was standing with George Ince—a little boy came up, and said, "Here George here is a stopper, will you have it"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "One of the school boys gave it to me, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—I did not know that it was in the indictment, or I could prove I bought it. He was selling some clothes; and after he had sold them, I saw the gloves lying on the ground—I took them up, and intended to give them to him, but did not see him, and forgot it.</p>

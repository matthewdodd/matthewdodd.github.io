                  </hi>. I am a coach-maker in Stanhope-place, Southwark-bridge-road. A few days before the 2nd of September Brown came to my shop—he asked if I had a headed phaeton to let on hire—I said, "Yes," and showed him one—he did not approve of it—I showed him another one, for which we agreed—he wished to hire it for three months—he told me he was a ship and insurance broker—that his offices were at No. 18, East India-chambers, and he resided at Blackheath—I saw him again on the 2nd of September, when he brought a memorandum of agree-ment with him—this is it—he inquired if the phaeton was ready for him—I told him it was, and he produced this memorandum, which he signed in my presence, and he brought another, which I signed—a man from a livery-stable brought a horse, which, was harnessed to the phaeton and he drove away—I saw him again repeatedly—in about a week after, he said he would buy the phaeton for a friend of his who liked it, if I would take 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I could not take that, and then he inquired for a new britska—he looked at one and made me an offer for it—I think I told him 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the price—he offered 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I refused—I never agreed to take 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he came a great many times after that about the britska—on some of these occasions Smith was with him—Brown came almost every day; perhaps five or six times—I agreed to sell the britska for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a German shutter and some other things were to be added to it—Isaw both the prisoners several times—Smith generally came with Brown in a phaeton which was hired of Mr. Gray—on—the 16th of September Brown came and asked if his clerk had been there—I did not know who he meant—I said, "No"—he said he should have been there half-an-hour ago, with a check for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay me for the britska—while we were talking Smith came in with a check for 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave it into Brown's hand—he said "What do you bring me this check for? this is 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; you should have brought me a check for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Smith said that was what Mr. Marsden had given him—Brown scolded Smith for not bringing him the cheek he ordered—it was dated forward—Brown said to Smith, "This is making it appear as if I wanted to do Mr. Clarke out of the britska"—he said to me," This is a very vexatious thing that he should have brought this—I can't pay you for it now, and I have made an arrangement to use this carriage—I wanted to use it for two or three days to go into the country—this will entirely put me out of my arrangement"—he told me that Marsden was a friend of his, in the corn-trade—that he had lent him 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make purchases in corn, and as corn was getting up, he thought it was a good speculation, and the money was to be paid when he demanded it—that he had seen Marsden and told him he had pur-chased a new britska and wanted a check for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for it; "and now," says he, "I suppose he thinks I want the money, and he has written me out this check, which has a few days to run, thinking it would be of service to him"—he then proposed to give me a bill, and he sent Smith for a stamp—it rained fast and Smith asked if I would lend him an umbrella—I went to get one, but had not one at home—after that Smith went out and was some time gone, and Brown and I had some conversation—I said "A gentle-man's word is as good as his bill; I don't require a bill if you will pay me the money before Saturday night"—he said, "The money shall be sure to</p>

               <p>be paid before Saturday night"—Smith then returned, and the two prisoners rode away in the britska—a horse and harness was brought to take it—in a day or two, Smith came and asked me for something, as it was usual to allow the servant something—I said, "You are not his groom or servant, you are his clerk"—he said no, he was not, but his servant had asked him to call for him, as he was unable to come from Blackheath to receive it—I said, as Mr. Brown was to pay on Saturday, after I received the money I would give the servant something—Brown came about the 18th or 19th of September, about buying the phaeton—he agreed to buy it for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after that he brought the phaeton he had hired of Mr. Gray, and asked what I would paint it for—he said it belonged to a friend of his—I afterwards found it belonged to Mr. Gray—he said he and his friend would call the next Monday—he did not leave it, and I never saw him again—on the Saturday on which I was to have been paid for the britska. I received a note from Brown—I afterwards found my phaeton at the police-office, and the britska at the Red Lion, Maidenhead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sadler, and live in the Borough. I saw both the prisoners at my shop in September—Brown came in, while Smith sat in the phaeton—Brown asked me the price of chaise and carriage harness, but more particularly of carriage harness—I agreed to make him a set of carriage harness to order for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the chaise harness was not determined about—he said he resided at Blackheath, and had Cham-bers at the East India Chambers—the harness was to be made and sent by that day fortnight—he said the horse he had at Blackheath was of the same size as the one at the door, and one collar would fit either—after we had agreed about the harness he said he wanted a saddle and bridle immediately, to ride the next day, being Sunday—we looked one out—he said his servant, meaning Smith, would call for it in half an hour—I think he was to pay five guineas for that—Smith called, and took away the saddle and bridle—I have never been paid for either.</p>
               <p>— <hi rend="smallCaps">BLACKWELL</hi>. I live in Oxford-street, and am a sadler. Brown came to me in a phaeton, and agreed to purchase a carriage harness, for which he was to pay twenty-five guineas—if was lo be made for him, and paid for before delivery—he gave me a card with "East India Chambers" on it, and said he lived at Blackheath—a saddle and bridle were to be sent by the carrier to Blackheath, as he said he wanted to ride on the Sunday—Smith was sitting in the phaeton as a servant—Brown went to the carriage again, and said he was going to dine at Connaught-square, and his servant should call for the saddle and bridle as he returned—I said it should be ready, and asked for a reference—he looked at my book, which was on the table, and said he knew several of my customers, and said they were friends of his—Smith came about half ah hour alter, and took away the saddle and bridle—I asked him where his master resided at Blackheath—he said, "Very near the Hare and Billet public-house"—I said, I never was there but once, and did he know Admiral Oliver's—he said, "Yes," it was a very little way from there—he took away the saddle and bridle, and I heard no more of them till they were at Union-hall.</p>

               <p>to me about the 20th of September, he said he wanted to look at some phaeton harness—he ordered some to be finished by the following Monday, and then he spoke about some saddlery and horse clothing—he chose a saddle and ordered it to be finished—he gave me one of his cards at the East India Chambers, and said, his coachman should come and have the horses measured—as he was going away he turned and said, "Could you oblige me with the saddle in half-an-hour?"—I said, "Yes," and Smith came and had the saddle—I said to him, "I don't know who I am indebted to for your master's custom"—he said he did not know, and said, Did he order a harness of me? I said, "Yes," where did he live, he said his country house was at Richmond.</p>

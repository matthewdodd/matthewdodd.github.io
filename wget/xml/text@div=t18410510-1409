                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Hardwick, in New Bonds street—he is in partnership with his son. On the 27th of April, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoners came into the shop, and Williams asked for some mouslin-de-laine—I showed her some—they purchased two yards and a half, which came to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Williams then asked to look at some lace, and had two yards cut off, at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—I observed her laying some whole pieces of lace towards Davis—they sat close together—Williams then asked the price of another piece of lace, holding it up away from Davis—when I looked back again I missed some lace off the counter, as she had drawn my attention in the direction she was holding the other piece, and when I looked again I missed some lace off the counter—I could not tell whether it was one or more pieces—she laid the lace aside two or three times, and it was taken off—after doing this once or twice, she made another purchase of two yards more, at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she did it again a third time, in the same manner, handing pieces of lace towards Davis, and then drawing my attention to another piece, by asking me the price again—they sat facing each other—Williams had her back to the window, and Davis her face to the window—she held it up towards (he window—I then cleared the counter of all the remainder of the lace, and requested them to walk with me into the counting-house—Davis asked what I wanted in the counting-house—I told her I should let her know when we got there—they got up from their seats, and Davis dropped a quantity of lace on the floor—I heard it drop, but did not see it—it was not on a card, it was in par<lb></lb>cels—I came round the counter, and saw it on the floor—I walked with them to the counting-house—I called Simmons, a policeman, leaving them in charge of Mr. Hardwick—Simmons took them into custody, but be<lb></lb>fore he left the counting-house, he pointed out two pieces of lace under the desk there—I took it up, and gave it to Simmons—we do not keep lace in the counting-house, and it was all squeezed into a heap, not as it is kept—the cut lengths are kept on cards, and the whole pieces as we have them in, not wrapped round any thing at all—one of the young men picked up the pieces of lace in front of the counter, gave them to me, and I put them in paper—I saw him take them off the ground before I went into the counting-house—he said he gave me the same pieces—he is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called to Mr. Hardwick's shop between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I went into the counting-house, and saw the prisoners standing there, and Mr. Hardwick with them—he said he would give them into custody for stealing lace—I took them in charge with six pieces of lace, and these two pieces were lying in the counting-house, behind the prisoners, who stood with their backs against a small writing-desk—the two pieces kid under it, about two feet from them—I pointed them out to Gumps ton, who took them up, and gave them to me—I searched them at the station, but found nothing on them—I did not discover any place under Davis's shawl where any thing could be concealed.</p>

The prisoner was a clerk in my service—it was his duty to transact the whole of the business, in Nov. and Dec., while I was ill, and that was the time he took advantage of me—he was to attend to all the duty that I had to attend to when I was well—he was to receive money, and take it to the Custom House—it was his duty to receive money on my behalf from the last witness, and, when he received it, to go to the Custom House and pay the duties—at the beginning of Jan I recovered my health, and I made inquiries about what had been done by the prisoner—I received this note (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) from Messrs.

             sworn.</p>
               <p>My husband is a taylor, I rent the house in Plow-street, where Pearce and Hurford lodged in a ready furnished room; Hurford came in the name of Barker; I let the room to them as man and wife; I heard somebody come down stairs softly, I thought they went out, that was a little before six, they left the street door open; presently they came in and went up stairs, and left the street-door open; then I heard goods rumbling in the passage, and I jumped out of bed, and Pearce was lighting a man with a large mahogany table; I asked her who the goods belonged to, and who gave him liberty to bring the table there; she said she did: they bid me make myself easy, that they were moving goods for a person in Whitechapel; I said, I was afraid they had been a housebreaking; Hurford came down stairs, and said it was his shop-mate's table, that his wife had threatned to set the house on fire, and he was taking them away because they should not be burnt; he said he knew the man that made it, and he was with him; he turned to Pearce, and said, I will take and carry it into Glass-house yard, then it will be safe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hurford. What time did I go out? - I believe he must have been out all night, for the door was double locked when my husband went out.</p>
               <p>Court to Overton. When you heard that the door was open, and the things were stole, did you go and look at the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing broke about it? - Only the window; by breaking this pane, they could put their hand round and unscrew the sash; the sash is a sliding sash, it was open in the morning.</p>
               <p>Could a man go through it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did your clerk sleep there? - Not that night, nor the next night.</p>

               <p>I went out about five in the morning, and I saw these two tables laying in the field, and I took them home, and I met this man, and begged him to take one, while I went and fetched the other.</p>
               <p>PRISONER WELL's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was going along the street to Mr. Wilson's yard, the King's wheeler; I met this man in the street, he asked me to carry a large table to Plow-street, and put it down under the lamp, and he would give me 6 d. I put it down there, and saw no more of it.</p>

An out-house, joining to a house, as this has been described, is the same as the dwelling house, and in consideration of law, constitutes a part of the dwelling house: and the crime of burglary consists in breaking and entering a dwelling house at night, and committing a felony, or with intention of committing a felony.</p>

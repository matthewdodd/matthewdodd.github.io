            . I am a Police-constable. On the 15th of February I saw the prisoner drunk in Tottenham-court-road - I had not known him before; I advised him to go home, but he would not, and I took him to the watch-house; I found two stone bottles on him - he said one contained gin, and the other sherry; I asked where he got them - he said he bought them of Mr. Henekey, where he worked; I went down, and found he did not buy them there - the next morning Mr. Henekey charged him with stealing them, and he acknowledged, in my presence, that he took them - these are the bottles.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. I believe he was very drunk? A. Yes, he could not stand.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Henekey's employ. The prisoner was at work in his cellar for about three months, during which time he has had bottles and spirits in them, but not wine; I have sold him spirits in larger bottles than these - he had left a deposit for the bottles he had of me,</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What you sold him was by your master's permission? A. Yes - I sold him gin; these are both sherry.</p>

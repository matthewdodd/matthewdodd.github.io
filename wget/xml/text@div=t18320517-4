On the 3rd of April, I had in my wardrobe, which is in my bed-room, a box, containing 120l. in Bank-notes, two watches, one a double case gold one, and the other enamelled, set with pearls, a miniature painting corresponding with the watch, two seals, a pocket-book, nine rings two guineas, five brooches, an emerald pin, three gold chains, and some ear-rings; I cannot say whether the wardrobe was locked - I can identify all the property; I generally sleep in that room, but did not that night; I had seen the property safe the day before it was taken; I was awoke by a noise between one and two o'clock in the morning - I rang my bell, and called my servants; I found the window of my bed-room broken into, and broken to pieces, frame and all; it is on the first floor - it was not broken when I went to bed; I heard no noise till I was awoke - I then heard footsteps in the room; the prisoner had once lived with us for seven months as servant.</p>

            , and lived with him in March and April. The prisoner came there on Sunday, the 18th of March, and on the following Saturday, and slept there all night - he did not come to see me; master and mistress did not know of his being there - he slept in the same bed with me- he got up about five o'clock in the morning, and breakfasted with me; he went away about six - he lent me a round smock-frock, to go up a chimney to alter the flue; it had no mark nor stains on it then - I saw it afterwards, and saw stains of blood on it; it was exactly like the one he lent me, but I cannot swear to it. On the morning of the 4th of April, between one and two o'clock, I heard a noise, like a window smashing; I was in bed - I heard it about three times, and heard footsteps in mistress' bed-room, and heard the person go out of the window; I sleep up one pair of stairs from that bed-room - nobody slept in the room that night; mistress slept, in the next room to it that night - I heard a noise as if a drawer was drawn open; I went into the room between one and two o'clock, and found the window all beat in - it is a sash window; I went into the room with mistress, and she missed a box - I looked out of window, and saw two ladders tied together up at the window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. Do you keep a memorandum of the days people come to your house? A. No; he left master's service on the 13th of March - he did not come to see me afterwards; there is a maid-servant in the house - he was only there two days while I was there; I cannot swear to the smock-frock - I think it is the same.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FAIR. I am a horse-patrol, of Bow-street, On the 9th of April I went to Acton, and searched two boxes of the prisoner's at the Police-station; I found a smock frock, with several spots of blood on it, a few by the arms, and one on the left-hand pocket hole; I found a silver penny in the pocket of it, which the Police-serjeant has; I apprehended the prisoner at Barkham, in Berkshire, on the 7th, and brought him to Hayes - he was examined on the 9th before Mr. Newdigate, in my presence - I said nothing to induce him to state what he did; what he said was taken down in writing - I advised him not to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170019"></xptr>say any thing; about two hours after I locked him up I had a message to go to him - I went, and took him out of the cage; (I had told him when I took him that it was for Mr.Freeman's robbery) - he said he had been very unhappy in his mind ever since Mr. Freeman's robbery, and wished to make some confession; I said nothing to induce him to state any thing - I took down what he said at the time(reads); he said that he tied Mr.Freeman's two ladders together, and placed them under Mrs. Freeman's bed-room window, then went up, broke the whole of the lower sash, and entered the room - went right up to the wardrobe, took out the box, heard an alarm, ran to the window, and down the ladder; he cut his hands in getting out - that he went away, and opened the box, examined it, and found it contained the same quantity of jewellery and money, as Mr. Freeman had stated that day before the Magistrate; that he was truly sorry for the office, and ready and willing to discover where he had concealed the property - I went with him to Barkham the following day; he took me to his father's farm-house - he took me to an out-house, took the property out from where it was concealed, and put it into my hands; I have had it ever since - here are two gold watches, nine gold rings, five brooches, a breast-pin, a pair of ear-drops, three gold chains, a miniature picture, two pairs of bracelets, a hair-locket, a spoon, a scent-bottle, two guineas, eight 10l., and seven 5l. Bank notes; he produced all these, and said he had thrown a paper with some small coins over a fence at Acton, and that all the property was Mrs. Freeman's - I was present before the Magistrate at his examination; this is his statement (looking at it) - I saw the Magistrates put their names to it, and saw him sign it; it was read over to him - (read)</p>
               <p>David Elliott, charged before us with burglary, voluntarily says, that in the first place he went to Mr. Freeman's house, at Hayes, at eleven o'clock at night, and went to the cow-house, remained there two hours, and tied two ladders together, put them up against the house, and broke a bed-room window, and thereby got into the house - went direct up to Mrs. Freeman's wardrobe, and took out the box, heard the bell ring at the same time, which made him (the examinant) make a frightful noise to keep Mrs. Freeman out of the room, then took the box, and made his escape out of the window; was not in the room two minutes, cut his thumb with the glass of the window, went off as fast as he could run to the bottom of Botwell-common, when he broke open the box, took out the property, and tied it up in a handkerchief; whether he lost any of it he does not know- went as far as Richmond-bridge, and did not know what to do, sat on the bridge a long time, after that went to Acton and Wormwood-scrubbs, then at twelve o'clock in the day went back to his lodging at Acton, took the property out of his hat and placed it in his boxes, the next morning he concealed the property in a ditch bank close by; then he had no rest night nor day, was truly sorry for what he had done; on the Friday morning Mr. Frogley's coachman called him up, after that he buried two handkerchiefs which were covered with blood - he was afterwards taken up, and his boxes were searched, and after being taken to Hatton-garden Police-office he was discharged; his father then took him home to Barkham - he first took the property from the ditch bank where he had left it; when he got home at his father's he concealed the property in a stable and afterwards in the thatch of an out-house; sometime this week he intended to send it all home, but was taken up again; he afterwards confessed to the Policeman Fair, and pointed out the property to him - 8l. of the property produced by Fair a 5l. note and three sovereigns, were his own property; the Policeman did not hold out any promise to him, to induce him to make the confession to him.</p>

               <p>THE REV. JOHN NEVILLE FREEMAN. I do not think the prisoner's intellect remarkably strong; I always thought him very honest - my opinion is that it is his first offence, and that his mind was weak.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

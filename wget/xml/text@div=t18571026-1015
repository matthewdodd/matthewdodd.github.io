Witness. I am sure he is the person—I did not say that a policeman was after him—I did not give him a bit of card with the policeman's number—I watched him from Worship Street to near Spitalfields Market, and when I got there, there were several of his pals, who threatened to knock my brains out—that was after Hollyfield was remanded.</p>

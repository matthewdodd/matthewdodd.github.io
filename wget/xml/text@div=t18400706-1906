                  </hi>. I live in Price-street, in the parish of Christ Church, Surrey, just over Blackfriars-bridge. On the 27th of June I went out at twenty minutes before four o'clock in the morning—the house was safe then—I opened one shutter to give me light to put my things on—I shut it too again, and left the doors and windows and every thing fast—there is a chain inside the window—I do not know whether it could be shaken down or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Grove, a gas-lighter, in Dyer's-buildings, Gravel-lane. On the 27th of June my husband was taken very ill, and I went to get another man to do his work—I went down Guilford-street, to the Phoenix Gas Company—as I was coming borne, I came up Price-street, and saw the prisoner on the window-stone of the prosecutor's house—the window was up as far as it would go, and his body was in as far as his waist—I stepped on the pavement, and the pri<lb></lb>soner jumped down, and went down Goodwin-court—I turned round and saw him watching me, and called "Stop thief"—I never lost sight of him till he was taken.</p>

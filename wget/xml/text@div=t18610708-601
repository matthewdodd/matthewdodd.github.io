I live now at 9, Featherstone-buildings, Holborn—at the time this matter occurred I was living in service at Colney Hatch—on 17th June my employer gave me a holiday, and I came to town—I met the prisoner Adams by King's-cross; I did not know him before; he came up and spoke to me, and asked if I would go and take a walk—I consented to do so—I do not recollect going with him to a public-house; not in the afternoon—I came to town about a quarter-past 10 in the morning; between that and 2 o'clock, when I met Adams, I had been walking about some time—I had a glass of ale as I came down from the train—I came up alone—the glass of ale had no effect upon me—I do not remember being is a public-house with Adams—he did not give me anything to drink that I know of while I was walking with him—I had only had one glass of ale that morning—I do not remember having anything with him—I had a silver brooch fastened to my dress—that was quite safe when I met Adams—the next time I knew anything was when I was in the police-station, for</p>

I live at 15, Tonbridge-street, St. Pancras, and am a painter by business—on the afternoon of 17th June, about 6 o'clock, I was outside the Lord Wellington public-house in Brighton-street, against the door—whilst there I saw Adams come in with the prosecutrix—she ap<lb></lb>peared as if she had been having something to drink—I went to the door and saw them standing at the bar; they had some drink—Adams then came out leaving the girl there, and she followed him to the door—she returned back again, Adams did not—Batchelor was outside, and three other men; Adams took a brooch from the prosecutrix's breast, gave it to Batchelor immediately, and said, "Now I am off," and went away, and Batchelor also—that was not inside the public-house; it was outside the door—I saw it distinctly—I saw Adams undo the brooch—the girl then went back again; she was not quite insensible but nearly so—she was silly or foolish like, as if she was either silly or tipsy—Batchelor and the other three men went into the public-house to her almost instantly afterwards.</p>

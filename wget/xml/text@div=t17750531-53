            . I am one of the patroles employed by the parish of St. Andrew's above the bars. On the 7th of March, my walk was in Lambs-Conduit-Street: near two in the morning, I observed Herbert in Lambs-Conduit-Street, opposite Great Ormond-Street: two men went before him down towards the fields, and he followed them. Knowlan and Reading were the two men that went before, my partner and I thought them suspicious people, and followed them. When we came to the corner of the pond in the Foundling-Hospital-field, we listened, but could hear nothing; then we concluded they were gone another way. As we were returning back, we met Reading and Knowlan: I said to my partner Cameron, they are the two men that passed us first; he said they were, and that he thought it was best to follow them. We went after them, and overtook them by the pond, and asked them where they were going, and whence they came? They said they were going to Tottenham-Court Road, and came from the bottom of Gray's-Inn Lane. By the Foundling wall, I said, How can that be! did not I speak to you at the corner of Great Ormond-Street? No, said they, it was not us: I said, I was sure it was, and that they should go to the watch-house and give an account of themselves: then I asked them where the third man was that followed them? they said, they knew nothing of any third man: upon that the third man came out from a corner of the garden wall and joined in with them: that was the prisoner Herbert. I thought he had a mind to speak to them; but he did not, as I could hear. We told them, they should all go to the watch-house and give an account of themselves. My partner walked before, and I behind. We had not hold of them when we came through the posts in Lamb's-Conduit-Street; Herbert sprung into the middle of the street, and I sprung after him; on that he turned round and fired a pistol at my neck. There were two balls found lodged in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310047"></xptr> handkerchief. When I was carried to the watch-house; there were two holes in my neck: they went in at one and out at the other. I was so close to him, that the powder burnt my handkerchief, and burnt my face. I bled a great deal. Two or three days afterwards another ball was taken out of my neck at the hospital. I am sure Herbert is the man; but he was not taken till eight weeks after. I never saw Herbert before that night; but saw him twice that night before he shot me.</p>
               <p>On his Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>"He said, that he never did say that he</p>

               <p>"that he walked beside him two or three</p>
               <p>"minutes, and having a suspicion of him,</p>
               <p>"looked very full at him; that he desired</p>
               <p>"him, two or three times, to keep his hand</p>

            . I am a watchman: on the 7th of March in the morning, as I was crying the hour two in Lambs-Conduit-Street, I heard a pistol fired; I turned myself short round and saw the wadding of the pistol fired upon him: I was not two hundred yards off. I made towards where I heard the fire. I met Cameron with Knowlan and Reading (looks at Knowlan) I am sure he is one of them; Cameron said, Roan take charge of these two scoundrels till I go and see what is become of Butler; for he was shot. I set down my lantern and staff on the flags, and took one with my left hand, and the other with my right, and detained them till two more watchmen came up and desired them to take charge of the two men till I went to assist Cameron. Going down I met Cameron bringing up Butler: he desired me to go to the constable of the night, and desire him to get a doctor, for Butler was shot. Knowlan and Reading were taken into custody that night: Reading was afterwards admitted to bail because the principal was not taken.</p>

I desired to put my trial off five or six hours. When I was brought into prison I told Knowlan I was taken for the same thing he was, and asked him if he knew me? He said, no, that the man that fired the pistol seemed to be as big again as me.</p>
               <p>Knowlan was not put on his defence.</p>

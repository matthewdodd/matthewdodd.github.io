                  </hi>. I am assistant to Elizabeth Gooch, who keeps an eating-house in Whitechapel-road—on Saturday night, 28th July, the prisoner came at a little before 12 o'clock at night for a pennyworth of pudding—I served him, and he gave me a shilling—I looked at it and said it was bad; I broke it in the detector in two pieces; I laid them on the counter—the prisoner took from his waistcoat pocket a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and held it in his hand—I said, "That is a bad one, let me look at it"—he said, "Oh, no, I don't think it is"—I had before told the boy to shut the door, and I went round the counter and beckoned to an officer who was there in plain clothes—I seized the prisoner, but before I seized him he put his right hand in which the florin was to his mouth—I seized him by the throat, and, as the officer came, I said, "He is swallowing a bad 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece"—the officer seized him and took him in custody—he searched him in the shop; he fouud on him some silver, some coppers, and a florin, which he laid on the counter—it was a bad florin—the officer took possession of the two pieces of the shilling.</p>

               <p>prisoner came in, and I heard the last witness say, "This is a bad one"—he tried it in the detector and laid it down on the counter—he beckoned me immediately afterwards—I went, and saw the shilling lying on the counter, broken in two; these are the pieces of it—the last witness had hold of the prisoner, and said he was trying to swallow a bad two-shilling piece—I seized him by the throat, and he made a gulp as though he swallowed it—I asked him to open his mouth; he eaid, "I have got seven or eight there, put your finger in and feel" I said, "No, I will see what you have about you first"—I searched him, and in his breast coat-pocket I found a bad 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, four sixpences, and 9 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I put the money on the counter, and Mr. Gooch said, "That is a bad 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece"—I said I did not think it was, but he tried it and it was bad—the prisoner asked me who I was, I told him I was a police-constable—he resisted very violently; I had to put the handcuffs on him to take him—I think there were only three persons in that room—none of them got hold of the florin.</p>

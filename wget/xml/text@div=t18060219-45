               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to her to induce her to confess. - A. I did not; I do not know what the other witness said to her before Mrs. Peircy; I produce the watch.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you threaten her at all, or tell her it would be better for her if she confessed. - A. I did not; her mother lodges with me; after she had her hearing at Hatton-Garden, I went back to her in prison, she spoke first to me about the things, she said if she thought she should get clear, she would tell me all about it; I went with her to the different pawnbrokers, where she told me she had pledged them; she said that she and Mrs. Green went together to pledge them, and that Mrs. Green had the duplicate of the watch, and that she had sold it to Mr. Banfield in Surrey Road, where I found him; she told me that Mrs. Green came to her after she had her hearing, and told her if she would keep her own counsel she would give her a shilling and find her a home.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Is that your watch. - A. I can swear to it, I know the maker's name and the number.</p>

               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Did you make any promise when you were at Hatton-Garden, or before she was taken in custody. - A. I told her I thought she was the person that took my things, if she would tell me where they were I would not mind taking them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise her any thing. - A. I did not say I would prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise her any favour. - A. I promised I would think no more about it, if she would tell me; it was before she was in custody.</p>

               <p>Court. We have no evidence against the prisoner but what she herself has said; it turns out from the examination of the prosecutor, that what she said was after she had the promise of proceeding no further, which is the same as if they had promised they would not prosecute; it appears though she gave this full account, she was induced to do it by that promise, though perhaps we may not have any reasonable doubt; the law is, we cannot hear what she said; where there were held out hopes of forgiveness, or whether she was frightened, we must adhere to the rule of law, independent of that.</p>

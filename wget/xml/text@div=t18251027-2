            . I am the prosecutor's brother. On the 12th of May I went with him, and took this mare to the prisoner at Barlow-mews, Bruton-street, Bond-street - my brother left the mare with him to dispose of: he was not to sell her under 70 l.; my brother went to Twickenham. I called at the stables daily to inquire if he had sold it, and on the Sunday following he said he had sold it for 70 l., to General Conrad, who had paid him an order on Kirkland, an army-agent at Charing-cross. I saw the mare delivered at the General's stables, and saw the order, and asked the prisoner for the money - I went with him to Mr. Austin's, and three or four houses, to get it cashed, but could not - it was Sunday; it was the prisoner who proposed to get it cashed. I did not go into any of the houses with him; he came out, and said he could not get it done. I then begged he would give me the order, which he refused. I was very pressing for it, he still refused; I saw the order, and read it; he began to be very noisy, and asked if I thought him dishonest, and was afraid to trust him - I still insisted on having it; he refused, and eventually left me. I went to Twickenham to my brother, returned with him to town, and saw the prisoner again that evening, in Barlow-mews; my brother demanded the order - he would not give it up, and said he should neither have horses or money, and he would give him a good thrashing into the bargain. He afterwards went out with us to get it cashed, to Mr. Austin's, in Windmill-street; we waited outside: he said he could not get it cashed, but would pay us next morning, at ten o'clock, at Barlow-mews. I went there next morning alone, waited a quarter of an hour, and did not find him; I went to Charing-cross, and saw the prisoner in a gig, coming in a direction from Kirkland's; he merely passed me - I did not call to him. I saw my brother coming out of Kirk-land's - I was in a gig; I got out; my brother got into the gig, and drove after him; Mr. Hill was with me at Bruton-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270004"></xptr>and went with my brother in the gig. I walked after them to the British-hotel, Jermyn-street, where the General lodged; I met the prisoner, accompanied by General Conrad and Mr. Hill, walking in a direction from the hotel; my brother was following them in the gig. I followed after them, and waited in Market-street, in the gig, while they went into the General's stables; the next thing I saw was Shaw riding very fast by me on my brother's mare; she had no saddle on. My brother came running out after him, with Hill; they requested me to drive after him, but I could not see any thing of him; we went to Barlow-mews, but he did not come there. I did not see him again till the 23d of September. I went several times to the mews, but could never find him. I had him apprehended at Brentford, on the 23d of September.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is the date of the transaction? A. The 16th of May. The prisoner gave the order into my hands - it was for 70 l., and I believe was genuine. He said he must have something for selling it; he did not say how much that I recollect; I do not remember his asking for 3 l., but will not swear he did not. I said. "Give me the money, and I will give you what is fair;" I did not say I thought half-a-sovereign sufficient. The horse was delivered on Thursday, and sold I believe on Saturday. I believe Austin is a horse-dealer. I think Kirkland's office opens at ten o'clock; it was about a quarter past ten when I saw him coming from there; I had known him about ten days; he had two other horses in the stables; a horse of my brother's had been put up there to bait for one day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any reason to believe General Conrad is not now in possession of the horse? A. I have - the order was payable to the prisoner, and not to the bearer.</p>
               <p>HENRY TUBBS. I went with my brother when the mare was delivered to the prisoner - I had known him about ten days before. I went to Twickenham - my brother fetched me to town on Sunday; we went to the prisoner; I demanded the order, which he refused. He made no demand on me, but behaved very insolent; we went to Austin's, but did not get the order cashed - he said he would pay us at his own stables on Monday, at ten o'clock - I went that evening to the General, at the British-hotel, and before eight o'clock the General and I went down to Kirkland's, to stop payment of the order. I came home, and went to the General's about half-past nine o'clock; I did not see him, and walked down to Kirkland's, and saw Mr. Kirkland; the prisoner came in there about ten minutes past ten o'clock, to have the order cashed - it was refused - he went out, and I drove to General Conrad, with Mr. Hill. I saw the prisoner, and the General together, in Jermyn-street; they went with me and Hill to the stables - the prisoner got on the mare directly I came into the yard; she had merely a bridle on, no saddle; Hill was in the yard before me. I laid hold of the bridle, and said, "Give me up my property;" he made no answer; I let go in consequence of what Hill said, and Shaw rode away; I ran after him, but lost him - went to his stables directly with my brother, and staid two hours; I went again next day, and five or six times afterwards, but did not see him; I saw his hostler. I saw the mare in Mr. Fitzroy M'Lean's stables, Cadogan-place, three weeks or a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there not some dispute about what poundage he was to receive for selling this horse? - A. No; I do not think he asked for any thing for his trouble in selling it. I received a letter three weeks after, but cannot say it came from him. I did not go any where to receive the money in consequence of that letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say he must have 3 l. as poundage, as he had promised it to the General's servant? A. He did not, at any time, nor did I offer him any sum; the letter I received stated I might receive 65 l. - I was to direct an answer to Barlow-mews, but the Magistrate advised me not to write.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you owe him any money? - A. Yes, for the keep of a horse for one night; nothing else, except for selling the horse. The General gave the horse up to the prisoner. I had no time to speak when I entered the yard, before he rode away. I never agreed with the General to put an end to the bargain.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to CHARLES TUBBS. Q. Did not the prisoner tell you he was ready to pay for the mare? A. He said he would pay it by degrees. When I went to the stables afterwards I saw the same hostler there.</p>

            . I am an attorney, of Gray's Inn. On the 16th of May I accompanied the prosecutor to General Conrad, at the British-hotel, Jermyn-street, about eight o'clock in the morning, and about ten I saw the prisoner with him in the neighbourhood of the hotel - I got out of the gig. The General said he would deliver up the mare to the prisoner on receiving his cheque, and would have nothing to do with the dispute. I told Shaw he should not have the mare again; he said he would not part with her, for Tubbs owed him an account; I offered to pay him: he said his demand was 10 l. or 12 l.; he could not tell the exact amount without going to his stables. He, myself, and the General went to the General's stables, in Market-street; the General asked for the cheque; Shaw stepped back from us, and soon after I saw a paper in the General's hands; the General said, "Now bring out the horse:" Shaw asked for the loan of a bridle - one was lent him; the mare was brought out - Shaw got on her; the General's servant put on the bridle. I then said," You will meet us at the stable;" he made no answer. Tubbs stepped up, and laid hold of the bridle; I said, "Don't do that - he promises to meet us at the stable." Tubbs let go, and Shaw rode away. I went to the stables, and waited a quarter of an hour; he did not come.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What dispute did the General allude to? A. He said he would deliver the mare to nobody but Shaw.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You allowed him to ride away with the horse? A. It was understood he was to meet us at the stables.</p>

            . I am an officer. I had a warrant, dated the 11th of May, to apprehend the prisoner; I went repeatedly, early and late, to Barlow-mews, but could never find him there; he was given into my custody afterwards, and I asked him what he had done with Tubb's mare; he hesitated - then said he had taken her straight to Mr. M'Lean's, in Lincoln's Inn-fields, when he left Tubbs, as he had shewn her before to M'Lean. I asked what he got for her - he said nothing - that he had a mare<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270005"></xptr>from M'Lean, and M'Lean had Tubbs' mare - that M'Lean was gone to Scotland, and he had not been able to see him to settle; this was on the 23d of September. I asked how he came to take her away against Tubb's direction; he said Tubbs owed him an account, and he had promised to give the servant three or five guineas, which Tubbs said was too much, and he thought half a guinea enough, and if Tubbs would be shabby with the servant he would be so with him, and he was determined to pay himself; he said he could not see how they could make a felony of it. I asked where he lodged; he told me - I went there; he was denied, but it afterwards turned out that he did lodge there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say what the 3 l. was for? A. As a present to the General's servant.</p>

            . I keep a horse establishment in Windmill-street, Haymarket, and have known the prisoner twenty years; he is in the same business as myself, at Barlow-mews; he came to me on a Sunday in May, to get the order cashed; he kept the stables in Barlow-mews for three months after that - I have been, and seen his servant there. I always have 5 per cent. commission for selling horses.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you know there was an indictment against him? A. No. I have been to his stables in Bruton-mews with him myself, after May. I will swear I saw him there a month afterwards.</p>

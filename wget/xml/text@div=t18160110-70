               <p>WILLIAM THOMAS. I am clerk to Mr. Hatchett, at the White Horse cellar, Piccadilly. On Tuesday,the 9th of January, the prisoner came in the passenger's room, at about half past one, and walked up to one of the tables, where the silver spoon lay. He walked away again, came back; looked at the spoon and turned it over; went away again; returned the fourth time, and was walking away with it, concealed in his hand when I stopped him with it, and took it from him. I did not know him before, but he was perfectly well known at Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have served my country thirty years, and was four times severely wounded. Want and old age have forced me to this; I am upwards of seventy years old; and throw myself totally on the mercy of the Court.</p>

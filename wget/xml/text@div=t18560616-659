                  </hi>. I am captain of the <hi rend="italic">Petrel</hi> steamboat. On Saturday, 10th May, we were coming from Sheerness to London, and called at North Woolwich, that is on the north side of the river, coming up—the vessel is not allowed to carry passengers from North Woolwich to Blackwall—that was the first day we started on that passage; we stopped there to land pas<lb></lb>sengers, and the prisoners made an attempt to come in at the fore gangway—I told them they were coming on board the wrong boat, and said, "If you were to come here you would have to pay 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece"—I thought they were passengers for the penny boat going over the water—the pier man told them, in my hearing, that I was not allowed to take them—they then made another attempt at the after gangway—I got off the paddle box as they got on the gangway, and met King half way along it, and said, "Now we want no nonsense; you must go out"—I got him on to the pier, and another man, Morrisson, pinned me by the arms—I stepped down, jumped on to the paddle box, and said, "Go ahead;" and as we were going, King threw a tin can at me, which struck me on the lip, and cut it—it bled a great deal, and was so bad that I called the mate to take charge of the boat—I went to Charing-cross Hospital, and had it sewn up—I was an out patient four or five days.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Morriss.</hi> You never touched me; I walked in, and flat down; you walked <hi rend="italic">abaft</hi> the funnel, and I saw that you were handling this man more like a dog. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not handle you at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the mate on board this steamboat. The prisoners tried to get on board to go to Blackwall; the captain told them that they were not allowed to do so—when the boat was going off King made use of a bad expression, and threw the can at the captain—it struck him on the mouth, and went overboard—his mouth bled, and I took charge of the vessel—he was on board next day.</p>

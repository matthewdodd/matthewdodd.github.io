            . The prisoner came to take a lodging at my house for himself and his wife; he took a two pair of stairs room at 2 s. 6 d. per week; his wife and he lived there two or three months; I missed a brass candlestick out of the room; I never saw it any more; I desired to see the room, but they would not let me; at last I got into the room and missed the things mentioned in the indictment; when he was taken up, I searched the room but found none of the things; when he was before the Justice he confessed he took them. I myself wash the linen, so that it could not be sent out to a washerwoman; they always locked the door that none of the other lodgers could get into their room.</p>

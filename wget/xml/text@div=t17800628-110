             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the city-martial. On the 5th of June I was almost all the day at Mrs. Crook's door. Mr. Kirby and I had an order to attend there; the mob were pulling down the two houses before the mass-house; one of which was Mrs. Crook's.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner there? - Yes. Mr. Kirby and I turned him out of the house several times; he was pulling up a board of the floor. Mr. Kirby said the soldiers were coming, and bid them get away; he did not mind that but pulled up the board and was coming out by me with it. Mr. Kirby gave him a push, upon which he dropped the board off his shoulder and said, D - n my eyes, there shall be no Popery in the country. I made an observation that his eyes were almost blasted already, they were remarkably small, and what with that and the dust he could hardly see out of them; he threw the board on the fire; he was remarkably impudent; he came before the sheriff's face and damned his eyes, and said, there should be no Popery; when I understood that the military had taken up a number of persons I went to the Compter and pitched on the prisoner immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At what time time do you swear I was there? - When he was pulling up this board it was a little before eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Kirby and you turned him out several times? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you seen him before you saw him pulling up the board? - I dare say I saw him two hours before and remarked him.</p>
               <p>What distance of time might there be between the times you put him out? - Sometimes ten minutes, sometimes more.</p>

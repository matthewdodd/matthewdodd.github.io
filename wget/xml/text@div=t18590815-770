                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Kennedy, a painter, of 6, Pye-street, Westminster—it is a lodging-house—the prisoner lived there with a woman—on Sunday evening, 24th July, a quarrel took place between the prisoner and my husband—I took it up, and he said he would do my husband a private injury; he would make him stiff—next morning, about eleven or half-past, I was frying some beef, bacon, and onions—the salt, which was proper salt for every one's use, which was usually laid on the table, was put away—the prisoner took something out of his pocket about the size of a walnut, and put it on the table—I took it for salt, and used it;</p>

               <p>the prisoner and his wife had had breakfast in the same room—I broke some off the lump and put it on the meat and in the gravy—I used very nearly a quarter of it—I and my husband and children all partook of this meat, but the two youngest children did not get so much of it—I then felt very ill, and a burning pain at my chest, and was sick—my eldest child, who is near twelve years old, was very sick; he went to the hospital; and my husband was sick also—I took the remainder of the stuff to Mr. Hatton, and he said it was rank poison—I gave information.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Pye-street, Westminster—on Sunday, 24th July, a quarrel arose between the prisoner and my wife and me—a great deal of bad language was used, and the prisoner threatened very much—I heard him say that he would try and do us a private injury; meaning my family—he said he would not spare man, woman, or child—I was at home when my wife was getting dinner on Monday—she was cooking some beef, bacon, and onions in the pan—she wanted some salt—the salt that we generally use in a plate or dish on the table was put away—I saw the prisoner take something and put it on the table—my wife took it, and used it as salt—as soon as the meat was cooked it was put on the table, and the gravy in a saucer—I was the first that tasted it—I took some bacon, and put it in ray mouth—I threw it out, and said, "What have you been buying; you have bought bad meat"—my wife said, "The man that I bought it of said it was good"—it had an acid taste—we all partook of it—they all felt very ill and sick—I did not know what it was; but my eldest boy said, "It is the salt"—as soon as this salt was given to me by my boy, I said, "This cannot be salt; it must be sugar of lead"—my wife took it, and ran to a chemist—it was then between 1 and 2 o'clock—I was very sick, and all of us were more or less affected—I took my boy to the hospital.</p>

               <p>she would not know where she had put the sugar of lead—I believe my wife has been in prison, but that has nothing to do with this case.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GENT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is sugar of lead used to polish spectacles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know; I never use it—I have not had such a thing in the house for a long period—I never bought any, only to make white paint.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and live in Margaret-street—on 25th July Mrs. Kennedy brought me a small lump of white stuff—I said it tasted like sugar of lead—I used the ordinary test to try what it was, and have not the least doubt it was sugar of lead—if taken in large quantities it might cause illness—I can't say that it would cause death—I have heard of large quantities causing death, and I have heard that some persons have taken large quantities, and it has not caused death—the symptoms pro<lb></lb>duced by a small quantity would be sickness and costiveness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist—Kennedy brought his boy to the hospital on Wednesday, 27th July; he was complaining of pain in the abdomen—I asked if he had taken anything that had disagreed with him—he said that he was not aware that he had, and his father said the same—there was nausea and pain in the abdomen—there was no looseness of the bowels—sugar of lead when taken in small doses would produce con<lb></lb>stipation, but in large quantities it would produce diarrhoea.</p>

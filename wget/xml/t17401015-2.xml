On the 27th of September the Prisoner came into my House, and said, we need not thank her for her Custom, for the Rain had sent her there; she went into the Kitchen, and called for a Pint of Beer, and afterwards asked if we could dress her a Pigeon, which we did; soon after she went away. She had not been gone three Minutes but I miss'd a Quart Silver Tankard, which stood on a Table Bedstead in the Place where she was sitting. She had laid her Cloak and Stick down by it, and I am positive that I saw it while she was there. The Prisoner had enquired the Way to Charing-Cross, and my Wife directed her to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150003"></xptr> through the Temple; so I pursued her up Glass-house-Alley, but could not overtake her: I then advertis'd it, and on the Monday Night following, Mr Gosling came and told me had bought it of such a Person as I had described. The next Morning after this, a Man that was in my Fore-Room, and saw the Prisoner come through the Kitchen with my Wife, stopped her and brought her to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a Man in the Kitchen that sells Stockings about the Streets, and several other People, and they might take it as well as I.</p>
               <p>Gladman. I saw it there after he was gone, and there was nobody else in the Room, but a young Woman, who is a Lodger, and was called down to the Prisoner, because she said she wanted a Servant.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at East Ham, in Essex, and deal in pigs, which 1 take about in a cart. On Monday, the 6th of April, I met the pri<lb></lb>soner at the Duke's Head public-house, Walthamstow, about half-past twelve o'clock—he was generally about that house—I had three pigs in my cart, which had a pony to it, with harness on—I had to show some pigs to a lady, but I was taken very ill, and the prisoner said he would mind the cart, if I gave him a pint of beer—I asked him to take the horse and cart, and show the pigs to the lady—he was to have returned in a quarter of an hour, but I saw no more of him till he was in custody at Barnet—I never told him to sell the pigs, but to show them to the lady—the policeman afterwards showed me two of my pigs.</p>

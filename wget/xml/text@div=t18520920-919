                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 20, Wylde-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields. On Tuesday, 21st Aug., about a quarter to 8 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, I was passing the end of Nottingham-court, Castle-street, Long-acre—I beard a noise, and on turning my head to look down the court, I observed three men standing; one a little distance from the wall, and the two others facing him—one of the men, the farthest from me as I stood at the court, I have since learned is named Neasby—the prisoner is one of the others, and the deceased, Lucas—I saw Neasby strike Lucas with his hand or fist; I am not certain which, and after that I saw the prisoner strike Lucas in the mouth with his fist, and he fell, and the back of his head came on the flag stones—I saw the prisoner, apparently in a great passion, taking off his coat in a hurried manner; that was after Lucas had fallen—he made towards Lucas to strike him on the ground, but he did not strike him—there were no other persons there at that time, some persons came round afterwards—when Lucas was struck by Neasby he slightly staggered—it appeared to me as if he received the blow like a man that was not sober—it was in consequence of the prisoner's blow that he fell on the back of his head—very little time lapsed between Neasby's blow and the prisoner's—I passed through the court, and went for a policeman—Lucas laid on the ground some minutes—when I returned he was taken away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Winspur, a boot and shoe maker, in Nottingham-court. On Tuesday morning, 31st Aug., a little before 8 o'clock, I was looking out of my window, and saw Lucas—I only knew him as a neighbour, by seeing him—he was standing by his door smoking his pipe—he lived at Neasby's house—I saw a quarrel between Neasby and one of his lodgers—Neasby hit Lucas on the side of the face, and in the room of Lucas turning round to hit Neasby again he struck Mullins; when Neasby struck Lucas, the prisoner went in at Lucas right and left; he caught him in the mouth, and knocked him flat on his back, and his head fell against the stones—the prisoner then pulled off his coat and hat and threw it against the wall, and was going to hit him again, but the mob hallooed at him—that was when Lucas was lying on the ground insensible—he laid there between three and four minutes, then they took him up and rested him against the wall, and his head dropped on his left breast—I did not hear him speak after that—Lucas was in liquor—the prisoner was perfectly sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dairyman, and live in King-street, Long-acre. On the morning of 31st Aug. I was passing by Nottingham-court, about 8 o'clock—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> between Neasby, the prisoner, and the deceased—I stopped to see what the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was about—I saw Neasby standing at the step of the door strike out, whether it was with his flat hand or closed fist I could not say, at the deceased, who was standing facing the prisoner—he struck at the prisoner, who returned it to him, and a scuffle took place—the deceased's hat fell off his head—the prisoner struck him a blow on the mouth, and he fell—after he was down the prisoner stripped his coat off to strike him again, but the man never rose afterwards—he fell on his back, but with his head on the flag stones—Lucas appeared the worse for liquor—the prisoner appeared perfectly sober—the blow that Neasby gave did not appear to injure the man at all, for the man never staggered with the blow.</p>

               <p>result of a recent blow—I examined the head—I found considerable conges<lb></lb>tion of the vessels of the scalp—on removing the skull cap, I found on the left part of the head, and beneath that part which answers to the upper part of the temple, on the left side lying on the brain, and beneath the membranes, about two ounces of clotted blood; I could trace that blood to the inner part of the brain, where I found about three ounces more of clotted blood—I have no doubt that the extravasation of blood was the cause of death—if he had received a blow, and fallen in consequence on the back of his head, that would account for the appearances—the whole of the left hemisphere of the brain was in an unhealthy condition, there was a chronic softening, that would make him more susceptible to an injury—the whole condition of the brain and liver indicated habits of intemperance—I think the immediate cause of death was a rupture of the vessel consequent upon a concussion of the brain.</p>

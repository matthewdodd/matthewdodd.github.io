            ; I knew her before - she always pawned in that name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She sent me with a silver spoon and a plated one, to pawn, and she received 2s. 6d. of the money.</p>

            . I did not - I was out at my daughter's; she came and demanded the key of my street door, and took the plated one and this silver one; I never allowed her to take my spoons - I never received any thing from her; her husband paid the rent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I admit pledging the spoon for 5s., but I did it with the consent of the prosecutrix, who gave me two spoons to pledge - one was silver. which I pledged for 5s., the other one being only metal the pawnbroker would not take it in; I, therefore, returned it to the prosecutrix, and also gave her 2s. 6d. of the money I procured for the silver one, in part of payment, and I was to redeem the spoon the first opportunity. I conceive it to be nothing but a vindictiveness on her part towards me, because she is aware that I am fully acquainted with her character. She admitted, before the Magistrate, that she broke my box open, and stole therefrom a cap, a steel buckle, and a coral necklace.</p>
               <p>MARY CULF re-examined. Q. Did you ever receive 2s. 6d., or the duplicate, from her? A. I never did - the two spoons laid in the cupboard together, and she took them both; there were no other spoons there, only some linen; this is all the silver I have - the Policeman unlocked the door with a key the prisoner had in her pocket; she got drunk five times the first week - she beat me, and broke all my things.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Where did you get the metal spoon? A. After she had pawned the other, she took that up stairs, and put it behind a tea-board.</p>

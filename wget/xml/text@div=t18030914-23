             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Gillman: On Tuesday the 26th of July, about seven or eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop; there were two other shopmen, who are not here; she asked for a piece of print for a frock, and was desired to walk to the further end of the shop, as we were busy; the article I wanted, lay just by on the shelf where she stood; as I went by I looked at her; she seemed confused; I went down the shop again; she had a little boy fitting in the middle of the shop; she took him up to the top; I thought I saw her stoop, and that she had taken something, but could not be sure; she fixed on the first or second print that was shewn her by one of the shopmen; as she was going out I stepped round the counter, and told her I wished to speak to her; I led her into the private passage, and from under her cloaths she dropped the two pieces of printed cotton, about twenty-four or twenty-five yards; I would give two guineas for them.</p>

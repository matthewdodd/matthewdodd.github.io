               <p>ISAAC EDWARDS. I live with Mr. Humber, who keeps a coffee-house. On the night of the 21st of October the prisoner slept there - my trousers were in a cupboard in my room, on the second floor, and my watch in the table-drawer on the first floor; I missed them in the morning, and have not found them; I went down from my room to breakfast, and left the prisoner in his room - I missed my property after that. I saw the prisoner the same day, in Rosemary-lane - he saw me following him, and ran through some alleys: he was secured, and taken to the watch-house - I had not charged him with any thing. There was not another lodger in the house - nobody went up stairs while I was at breakfast.</p>

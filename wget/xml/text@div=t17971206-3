               <p>Q. In consequence of all the information you received, did you at last come up with him? - A. Yes, at Trowbury-gate, there he had pitched his tent; Mr. Homewood, who was with me, asked him what he had done with his grey horse, and he said, he had parted with him; I then got off my horse, and took him by the collar, and told him, he must go with me; he asked me for what? upon very strong suspicion of horse-stealing, says I.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him from whom? - A. No, I did not; he asked me where my warrant was, I told him I had none; he rather scrupled going, and I told him he should go; I went to the public-house, and got some ropes to tie his hands; I went with him to one Mrs. Burt's, and sat up with him all night; I heard him talking to himself, he said, Goddard, Goddard, he appeared to be dreaming, that he had sold horses for Goddard about forty years ago.</p>

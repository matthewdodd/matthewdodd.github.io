            . I am going on for eleven years of age, I took care of Mr. Minns' chaise about a fortnight ago, in Earl-street, Lisson-grove; he went into the Champion. - The prisoner and another person came up to the gig, and the prisoner said to me, "I will give you 1d. for your chance;" I said No - (I suppose he meant to hold the horse); he then said he would give me 11/4d.; I said No; he said, "I held it once, and they only gave me a drink of beer;" he then said, "What will you take?" I said 2d., which he gave me, and I went to Salisbury-street, to buy some buttons; I saw the prisoner in custody about a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you think will become of boys who play at buttons? A. I do not know; I never sold my chance before. I did not see the other man again.</p>

            . I am a grocer, and live in Earl-street, Lisson-grove. I saw the horse and gig at the Champion between four and five o'clock - I saw the prisoner and three other young men coming down the street; I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050065"></xptr>known two of them before, but not the prisoner - I saw him and one of his companions go to this lad, and stand talking with him some minutes - they offered him money, and then went into the Champion; they then came out, and gave him something; the prisoner then held the horse's head, and his companion took the coat, and went away with it. The prisoner went into the Champion as soon as he saw me go after the man; he said, "Your coat is stolen;" my wife said, "Yes it is, and you are the man who held the horse's head."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far do you live from the public-house? A. Opposite, about twenty yards off. The prisoner went into the public-house, and gave the alarm; hardly a minute had elapsed. I pursued the man who took the coat, and the prisoner gave the alarm as soon as he could.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said at one time that he went in as soon as he saw you go after the man? A. Yes, so he did - I sent my wife to tell Mr. Minns, and I was crossing the road to follow the man; the prisoner went in at the same time as my wife did, at another door.</p>

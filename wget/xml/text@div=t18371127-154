                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Fair-street, Manchester-square. The prisoner was in my employ about eight months—I employed him to take out bread, and receive the money, and account to me—I had a customer of the name of Nesbit, in Wigmore-street—I have sent weekly bills to him since July last—I have not received any money from the pri<lb></lb>soner for him since then—I have applied to the prisoner to know if he had received money—I delivered him a bill of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was all that was owing from Nesbit from July—I inquired of Mr. Nesbit if the bills had been paid—I asked the prisoner if he had received the money—he said he bad from day to day—there was no proposition made at that time—he did before the Magistrate speak of instalments—he admitted he had received the money.</p>

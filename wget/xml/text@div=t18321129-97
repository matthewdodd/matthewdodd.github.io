             lodged with us, and left us three years ago on the 6th of last March; he left a quantity of wearing-apparel and other articles at our house; I put the linen articles into a trunk, which was locked, and I kept the key - it stood on the attic landing: the prisoner came in June last to lodge at our house - he lodged the first three weeks in the front attic, and afterwards in the back: on the 17th of November, in consequence of information from Emma Watts, she and I went into the prisoner's bed-room- Watts took a bundle from behind the curtains, which contained net night-caps, and sundry articles of apparel, which I knew belonged to Captain Cochrane - I went to the chest immediately, and found the hasp loose, and the flap which went over it forced up; I opened it without the key in a moment - it had been broken open; it was empty, except two towels and some little articles - the prisoner came home at three o'clock in the morning, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know the name of the gentleman? A. By letters which I have received; his letters were generally directed "A. C. Cochrane;" I never knew what the second name was- my husband's name is Cleopas only.</p>

             (Police-constable C 39.) I was called to the prosecutor's house on the Sunday morning; I found the prisoner in bed - I asked him for his keys, and I found two or three in his coat pocket; we asked where his boxes were, and he told us - we opened his boxes with the keys, and found these articles; I also found this chisel on his bed, which I applied to the marks on the chest, and it fitted them exactly.</p>
               <p>MRS. ROPER. These are Captain Cochrane's property, and were in the chest - this is my husband's chisel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe the prisoner was in distress? A. He was out of a situation; I know his father is a clergyman, and has a large family; he had not a farthing about him when he was taken.</p>

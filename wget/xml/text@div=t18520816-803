               <p>night, 12th July, I went to bed between 11 and 12 o'clock—I fastened up the house—I fastened the front door by bolting it at the bottom—I had some copper money in my house that night in a cupboard in the shop parlour—there might have been five or six or seven shillingsworth, in a measure in the cupboard—I was awoke by the policeman about half past 2 in the morning—I went to the cupboard and found it was open and the money was missing—the cupboard had been locked the night before—I went straight down to the door and found it was open—I cannot say in what way any one got into the house—there is a fanlight over the door, which was let down the night before, but not fastened—it is big enough for a man of the prisoner's size to get through—I had glasses, decanters, and other things in the house on the night before, in the front room up stairs.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 306). I know Smith's-place, Skinner-street, St. Pancras. I was standing at the corner of it on the morning of 13th July, about half past 3 o'clock—I heard a sound as of a door opened—I turned my head and saw the prisoner coming out of No. 29—there was one shop between that house and where I was standing—I stepped forward towards the prisoner—he immediately ran away—I got within one or two yards of him, and followed him till he went into a house, 10, Wilstead-street—I did not lose sight of him till he got into the house—I followed him up stairs—he ran up to the second floor; I went up after him—I heard a sound as of money—I found the prisoner on the landing—I took him into custody—when I brought him down I saw another officer—it was dark on the staircase but light in the street—I told the officer that I suspected the prisoner had thrown something away up stairs, and he had better go and look for it—he went into the house.</p>

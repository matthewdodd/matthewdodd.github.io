I missed this property from a chest about four o'clock in the morning of the 10th of May; the prisoner had gone to bed the evening before, but she was then gone out of the house. I went out, and at length found her at No. 19, Long-alley, about two o'clock, with a gown and handkerchief. I asked her to let me have my wife's gown, my boy's handkerchief, and the duplicates of the other things, and go about her business. I wanted to take her, but she got away, and was taken by her brother-in-law. I found my other property in pawn; I had not given her permission to take any of them but I understand my wife has; I did not know that till last Saturday.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. When my husband got up on this morning he missed the property - I had given her leave to take it. I told the lodger to let her have these things to pawn to get herself a little market-money to go out with.</p>

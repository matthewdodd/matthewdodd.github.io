            . I am foreman to Edmund Pontifex and others. On the 19th of May Mr. Pontifex came from Mr. Betts', and I sent for Corby, who came - the prisoners were employed at our manufactory, repairing a drain; they left at six o'clock, and I observed that Rudd had something under his jacket - I was in conversation with him a long time, and when he was gone I told the gate-keeper, who followed him; I saw Rudd join Mullins, who had gone away while I was talking to Rudd - they joined company on Holborn-bridge; I and Corby followed them to the corner of Smithfield together, and there Rudd stopped; Mullins went on towards an old house, next door but one to Mr. Betts', at Smithfield-bars, but I did not see him go in - I continued to watch Rudd - I passed him while he stood at the corner of Smithfield; he then turned round, and went towards the old house - I crossed over to the other side, and lost sight of him while he passed a waggon - I afterwards saw him standing at the corner of the old house; I think he must have seen me, for he appeared confused, and almost immediately Mr. Betts brought Mullins out by the collar - Mullins had a bag in his hand; I then went up to Rudd, and told him he had something about him which he had not honestly come by - he said he was very much astonished I should suspect him; I told him we suspected him of taking property out of our manufactory, but if he would go into Betts' distillery he might be searched, which would not expose him so much - I do not think he made any reply; Corby then took him into the distillery - I saw nine pieces of copper, and I think four pieces of brass found under his jacket, on the left side, except a small piece or two, which was in his coat pocket; I saw five pieces of copper found in Mullins' bag; it was different sorts of copper - it is impossible to say what that found on Rudd was formed of; I cannot say whether I had seen it on our premises, we have so much of the same sort; I can identify one or two pieces, and some which were taken from Rudd - I asked Rudd what he had done it for; he said he knew he had done a bad job for himself - I asked where he got it; he said he had dug part of it out of the old drain, and he hoped Mr. Pontifex would consider his wife and family - the copper found on Rudd weighed 6 lbs. 12 ozs. and the brass 2 lbs. 14ozs. - on Mullins we found 12 lbs. 6 ozs. of copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he say where the old drain was? A. No - I did not examine the old house to see if there was a drain there; I cannot say whether I stated at Guildhall that he said it was a bad job - I said I could identify some of the copper, and pointed out a pattern which it was cast from: I identified some, and said there was more found on Mullins, which very likely I might fit to the place it was cut from - the officer took it home with me; I did not see Mullins with a bag before he went into the old house - he had a pole on his shoulder, I had instructions to see where he went, as we suspected he took metal to this old house; I was in hopes of detecting the receiver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the trouble to see if there was any body in the old house? A. No; there were persons on the watch - I was not near enough to Mullins to see if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300041"></xptr>was bulky; the copper is not a common pattern - these are for making screws for pumps; we have made hundreds from it, but never sold any of them - they are constantly being used, and re-cast: this will be a screw when finished.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Were the prisoners at all concerned in the copper manufactory? A. No, they are bricklayers - we sell by retail, but not this sort of material.</p>

            . My father is a distiller, and lives at Smithfield-bars - he has an old house near his premises, going under a repair. On the 19th of May I discovered something in that house, and sent for Mr. Pontifex - I watched the old house that day, from about six o'clock, and saw two persons come into the house - there was a boy standing before me, so that I could not see where they both went, but I saw Mullins come out of the cellar with a bag in his hand - I seized him when he got near the door; he trembled, and said "Pray let me go, I will never do so again;" I said, "You are done" - I took him into the distillery; I emptied his bag, which had copper in it - I had seen that copper in a cupboard in the old house, between nine and eleven o'clock that morning, and in consequence of that sent to Mr. Pontifex.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. For what you know, somebody might have put it there, and told this man to go and get it? A. It might be so - I never saw him take copper in there; we keep a French brandy distillery.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. Were the prisoners at all employed at the old house? A.They had been at work there some time.</p>

            . I went with Sharpe, and followed the prisoners - I received Rudd into custody, took him to the manufactory, searched him, and found this metal on him -I saw the bag, which was found on Mullins; Rudd said he had dug part of the copper out of the drain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the distance from the prosecutors' to the old house? A. I could walk there in three or four minutes - I followed them from Holbornbridge to the house.</p>

            . I live in Brewer's-yard, near the Bell, Smithfield, and am in Mr. Betts' employ. On the 18th of May I went into the old house, and found the copper in one corner of the cellar - I told the painter of it; I heard a noise in the cellar on the night of the 18th - I went down, and Mullins came out of the cellar door with his arms out, pretending to frighten me; he went away, and bid me good night - both of them did: Rudd was there, but not in the cellar - I went up stairs, and in five or ten minutes I heard a noise again; I came down, and Mullins came out of the cellar door again - I and the painter went into the cellar next day, brought the copper out, and locked it in a closet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How could they get it then? A. My young master took it out of the closet, and put it in the same place again in the cellar - I saw no copper nor bag about Mullins; the copper was not covered in the cellar, it could be seen with a light - I had no candle when I saw him; he saw me, and spoke to me - the painter worked there after the bricklayers had done; I saw Mullins bring the copper out of the cellar in a bag on the 19th - the prisoners had been working there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Was the bricklayers' work done before the 18th? A. Yes - neither of them had any business there on the 19th that I am aware of; other bricklayers were also at work there about a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Rudd's Defence. There were several workmen at Betts' besides me, two bricklayers, a carpenter, and two painters; we took some scaffolding from Pontifex's to Betts', as Mr. Betts had given me leave to put it there - I went there for nothing but to take the scaffolding.</p>
               <p>MR. BETTS. I had not given leave for scaffolding to be put there; I do not know whether my father had.</p>
               <p>The prisoners received a good character.</p>

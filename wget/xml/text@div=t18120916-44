            . I am a midwife. I reside at Hackney.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160025"></xptr> Q. Did the prisoner live at Hackney - A. Yes, at the house of Mrs. Wildsmith. On the 29th of August last, about half after eight in the morning, Mrs. Guthrie, who lives in the one pair of stairs, in Mrs. Wildsmith's house, came for me to attend the prisoner. I went immediately. I found her in the garret, sitting up in the bed; I desired her to lay down. Mrs. Wildsmith was in the room. She said, Mrs. Bailey, the child is here.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect, and tell me whether before she said there was the child, you perceived any thing - A. No. I searched for the child, and found it as she was sitting up, rather below her knees.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child separated from the mother - A. No, it was not, it was alive. I separated the child. I took it out, and laid it on the bed; then I observed to her, that she had been using the child ill. I said you good-for-nothing creature, you have been using this child ill. I said, what is this you have done. I observed that the child was bruised very much; it was black and blue all over the chest, the lips were swelled very much, and a kind of bladder on the top lip, and it bled violently at the nose and mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been a midwife, how long - A. Twenty-five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that the bruises that you saw were occasioned by impression at the time of its birth - A. I never saw such marks before in my life. I examined the inside of the mouth; I was not satisfied. I went to Dr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Q. What appearances were there on it - A. I could not tell any thing The blood came; so it was a full time child. A very fine child indeed; a female child.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any child that had been delivered without assistance - A. Many, without any person being present at the time of its birth.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the birth to be difficult, can you say whether the marks were such as the child might have by the mother attempting to deliver herself - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>CORNWALL REYNOLDS. I am a surgeon; I reside at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined before the coroner - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being called upon by Mrs. Bailey, on the 29th of August - A. Mrs. Bailey brought an infant to my house on the Saturday morning. I looked at the child. I perceived the child very much bruised upon the chest, and a lacerated wound under the tongue; blood issuing copiously from that wound as well as from the nostrils. The general conformation of the child seemed to be healthy and vigorous; a female child. It appeared to me to have attained its full maturity; but from its appearance, I could perceive ample ground for the cause of the child's death.</p>
               <p>Q. To what do you attribute the child's death - A. I believe it to be from the injury it had received, and which I have already stated.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of these injuries - A. That under the tongue mostly contributed to its death.</p>
               <p>Court. It occasioned the death - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you apprehend it to be caused by the laceration under the tongue, or from the consequence of that wound - A. By the effusion of blood. The wound under the tongue was sufficient to effect the child's life.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been much used in cases of this sort to attend upon women - A. If you mean in cases of midwifery, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other appearance about the child that could have occasioned the child's death except that - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Court. But the laceration - A. My lord, I conceive the laceration contributed to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You should have thought that there was nothing that could occasion the child's death but the laceration - A. Yes, from he laceration.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have heard that this woman was delivered when she was alone - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I now ask you, whether from the delivery of the child under the present unfortunate circumstances, those appearances, the laceration, and the issuing of blood therefrom; whether that could be attributable to natural causes, supposing a woman to be delivering herself. And from the appearances that you describe could it have proceeded from violence - A. To answer that question particularly, I should like to go into a detail, if I may be suffered; - there is a term in midwifery called face-presentation, in which case the mouth of the child might have presented itself. And if the woman from pain and anxiety to draw the child, might have put her fingers into the mouth of the child, she might have produced in haste such a laceration. I mention the case as a possibility.</p>
               <p>Q. In such a possible case, how would the child be with respect to its face - A. The face would present itself first.</p>
               <p>Court. And then in the anxiety, from pain to deliver herself, it is sometimes done - A. It is sometimes done.</p>
               <p>DOCTOR FORD. If I am allowed to speak, I have seen three cases similar.</p>
               <p>Court. When you are called upon, then is your time.</p>

            . Q. Did you go into the prisoner's room - A. I did. I was the first person that went to her. I came instantly down, and went to the landlady of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the landlady went up stairs before you went for the midwife - A. I went up with her. The landlady accused her of the child being born.</p>
               <p>Court. That is Mrs. Wildsmith - A. Yes, the prisoner said, no I immediately went for the midwife, that was all that past at that time. I left the landlady in the room with her when I went for the midwife.</p>
               <p>MRS. WILDSMITH. Q. You are a married woman - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the landlady of the house in which the prisoner lodged - A. Yes. On Saturday, the 29th of August, Mrs. Guthrie called me up stairs. I went up to the prisoner; I said Sally your child is born. She said it is not. I said, Sally, how can you do so. The child cried, when I answered the second time. I said nothing else to her. I stopped in the room the whole of the time until the midwife came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any blood any where - A. Yes, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160026"></xptr> did not see the child until the midwife came. When the midwife came, she parted the child from the mother. The blood came out of its mouth and nose. I saw the prisoner no more that day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you administer any thing to the child - A. Yes, I tried it with a little gruel; it swallowed about a tea-spoon full. The child was in a feeble state; the extremities were cold, and every appearance of death fast approaching.</p>

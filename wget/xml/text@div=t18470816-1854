                  </hi> I am in the 2nd battalion of the fusiller-guards. On Saturday afternoon, the 14th of Aug., I was in Bridcage-walk, at a quarter to two o'clock, coming from Storey's-gate towards Buckinggham Palace, I observed a carriage and pair of horses, with a coachman and a woman sitting on the box—no one was inside—when it was coming by the Wellington Barracks cha<lb></lb>pel I was about twenty or thirty paces on this side of Queen-square gate—I was close to it when the accident happened—I did not see it came through Buckingham-gate—it is a straight line, but I did not notice it—when I got this side of Queen-square gate I saw it coming up at a full gallop—I was about 130 yards from it when I first saw it—I saw the child in the road before the carriage came up to it, she was crossing the road in the park towards Queen-square gate, coming out of the park into the square—at the time the child came out into the road, the horses were about ten yards from the place of crossing—the child came out running—it was knocked down by the horses, and I saw the wheel pass over the side of its head—I called out to the coachman, "Stop, coachman, stop!"—he must have heard me—he did not seem to take any notice, but still went on—if he had had his eye on his horses he must have seen the child knocked down—he was not doing any<lb></lb>thing with his horses at the time they went over the child—I saw him whip<lb></lb>ping them before he came up to the chapel—that was about 100 yards off—they were in a gallop then, he seemed to have the reins right, and his whip was across the reins—I went and took the child up—its eyes were closed, and the blood was pouring out of each ear—I took it to a doctor in Queen-square—the coachman did not in my presence make any effort to pull up the horses—I saw the child in front of the horses before it was struck—I did not see the line of the horses altered, or the least effort made by the coachman to stop them—I did not see him stopped, but I afterwards saw him at the station—he then appeared as if he had been drinking, but he appeared to know what he was about.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The child never was before me in the road; I never saw it in the road; I was not going at full gallop; he never saw me whip the horses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am sure the horses were in a gallop when I first saw them, and I saw him whipping them when they were coming by Wellington Barracks—I took the child to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi> I was in Bridcage-walk on the 14th of Aug., coming from Store's-gate to Queen-square gate—I saw the carriage and horses galloping up the road—I saw them first just before you come to the Barrack-gate—they were galloping—the prisoner was the driver—I did not notice him doing anything—I saw a child coming out of the interior of the park, and crossing the road towards Queen-square—I should say the child</p>

               <p>was about three yards before the horses when she came out into the road—I was about 100 yards in front of the horses—the child came walking out looking over its shoulder, as if looking for some one else—the near horse knocked her down, and the near wheel front caught the head—if the driver had had his eyes on his horses' heads, he must have seen the child, and if he had had his reins in his hand, he could have turned out of the line, so as to have let the child escape—the carriage was nearer the park side than the middle of the road—there was plenty of room to turn out of the road—a very little turn wound have saved it.</p>

                  </hi> I am shoe-manufacture, and live in Queen's-row. On Saturday afternoon, at two o'clock, I was in the neighbourhood of Queen's-row, opposite the end of Arabella-row, Pimlico—I saw a carriage and horses driven by the prisoner, in Birdcage-walk—it is perhaps 150 or 200 yards from Buckingham-gate into Birdcage-walk—I was in a shop, serving—the lashing of the whip caused me to run to the door, and I saw the prisoner's carriage strike my cart, which was standing at the door, knock my pony round, strike my boy, who was in the cart, knock my seat and box out of the cart, and the top, which I carry to keep my goods dry—the horses were gallop<lb></lb>ing when they passed my cart—I hallooed to him—he did not stop—the boy of the shop ran after him, and caught hold of the reins of his horses—he did pull up before he got to Buckingham-gate—the boy asked him to come back—he did not come back—I put my seat in my cart and drove after him—I drove full trot till I got into the park, and then I whipped my pony and galloped after him as fast as I could make my pony gallop—I think I gained on the carriage, but could not overtake it—before I got to Storey's-gate the accident occurred—I pulled up the little, but I still drove through Storey's-gate, and as I was going along George-street, he was turning and coming back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> His cart was on the wrong side of the road; I could not pass, I caught the other rein and turned it round; there was a wagon on the side, and the cart on the other, and I could not pass them both; I tried to pull up, and could not. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I swear I heard the sound of his whip—that attracted my attention—I heard three or four lashings of the whip.</p>

                  </hi> I am house-surgeon, at Westminster Hospital. On the 14th of Aug. the child was brought to me—she was in a state of insensibility, bleeding from the ears, and had a coutusion on the left side of the head, such as would be likely to be occasioned by the passage of a carriage-wheel over it—re-action never came on, and the child died from concussion—I have not the slightest doubt that it died from the bruise on the head.</p>

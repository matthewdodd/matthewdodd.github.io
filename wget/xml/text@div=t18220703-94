            . I am an officer. On the 7th of June, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's apartments, and heard him sawing up one of the sashes - I knocked at the door - he put it away before he let me in; it was an old sash, with the glass in it; and in his work bench I found the skeleton keys. I found the wood-work of some more sashes there. I took him to the Office - could find no owner, and he was discharged. I afterwards compared the sash to one of Mr. Tanner's houses - it fitted exactly, and two holes in it corresponded with the fellow sash which was left in. On the 19th of June I took him again; he had then removed to Broad-yard, Golden-lane; he at first said he got the sash from his master, in Shoreditch.</p>

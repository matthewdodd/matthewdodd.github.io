This bill (looking at it) was left for acceptance at our house on the 16th of January - and, in consequnce of an observation which I made on it, I spoke to the other clerks about it; on the following day the prisoner came, and said he had called for a bill of 300l. left for acceptance; he did not say who had left it; I looked into the box, and found no such bill there - I then recollected the circumstance of the bill that we had looked at the night before, and that it was in the hands of a clerk behind me; I turned round to that clerk, and the prisoner was then taken into the parlour. The bill remained with Mr. Drake; I did not give it to the prisoner - he could not hear what I said to Drake.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a partner in the house of Messrs. Jones, Lloyd, and Co - Mr. Lew is Lloyd is one of the partners. On the 17th of January the prisoner came to the banking-house, and was shown in to me, by my desire. I asked him his name - he said John Jenkins - I showed him this bill, and asked where he got it; he said it was given to him by a friend of his, Mr. Williams, a man of fortune, in Wales, who occasionally came to town - that Mr. Williams desired him to leave it for acceptance, to call for it again, and deliver it to him back at 12 o'clock that day - he said he had had it the previous day from Mr. Williams, to leave for acceptance - that Mr. Williams lived at No. 342, Strand, while in town - I took a memorandum of what he said his name was, and the name of the person whom he said he had the bill from; he said he himself lived at No. 42, Aldersgate-street, and I think he said he had lived with a Mr. Levett, a shop-keeper, in the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, do you know whose hand-writing it is? A. No - it is not mine; I do not know whether it was written in my presence - I wrote his address down as No. 42, Aldersgate-street. I know David Jones, of Llandovery, in Wales - he is a banker, and carries on business as David Jones and Co.; he does business with us - he had many thousands of pounds in our hands at that time; the hand-writing on the bill is not his; I know no writing that resembles it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you ever been to Llandovery? A. No. I have seen David Jones write; I cannot say whether any other David Jones and Co. carry on business there; the bill is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150022"></xptr>very clumsily drawn; persons must be very little acquainted with bills to draw one in this manner.</p>

            . I am a solicitor. On the 17th of January I was sent for to Messrs. Jones and Lloyd's, in Lothbury - I found the prisoner there. I procured and officer; when I entered the banking-house, Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Tabor, and the prisoner were there; Mr. Tabor stated this was a bill of exchange which the prisoner I told him it was a very serious case, and he was not obliged to answer any question I put to him unless he chose; he said he had only done what Mr. Williams had desired him, and he should have no objection to state the facts; I then asked him where Williams lived - he said at No. 342, Strand, that he was a gentleman of property, residing in Wales, and came to town three or four times a year, for amusement; I asked him to accompany me to Mr. Williams, which he expressed his willingness to do; I took the bill, and showed it to the prisoner, and asked him if he was quite certain that was the bill Mr. Williams had given him - he said it was, and that in pursuance of Williams' direction he himself had left that bill for acceptance, at Jones, Lloyd, and Co.'s, on the previous day, and had just called for it, as he had promised to take it to Williams at twelve o'clock; it was then about eleven. I sent for an officer, and accompanied him and the prisoner in a coach, to the Strand; I requested the prisoner, on the way, if he should meet Williams in the street, to point him out, which he said he would do; I desired him to tell us where 342, Strand, was, that we might direct the coach; on arriving at the corner of Catherine-street, at a baker's-shop, he pointed to the house, and said that was the house - we got out - he went up to the door, and observing that he could find neither knocker nor bell, I said the door would not open - (it was a sham door;) I asked him if he was quite certain that was the house he had seen Williams at: he said it was, and that he had knocked at that door that very day - it was not a door, but a blank; we then went into the shop, and, on inquiring of the landlord, we found no communication had been had at that door for some time; in fact it was the side of a room - we inquired if Mr. Williams was known there, and was informed he was not. I said, as he had told us one falsehood, he need not give us any unnecessary trouble, and did he reside at No. 42, Aldersgate-street, as he had told us; he said he did, and we desired the coachman to drive there - on arriving within a few doors of No. 42, he said it was of no use to pull up there - he did not live there - that he lodged at No. 136, on the opposite side of the way; we went there, and found he lodged there; his boxes were opened - there was a copper-plate card, with "E. Jones" on it, and the name of a public-house on it, which he had just taken, and he said that was his name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. There was no number on the door of the house he took you to in the Strand? A. No, but there was on the shop door - he said he had gone through that door the day before. I am quite positive about what he said as to his leaving the bill for acceptance, because I asked him for a distinct object; I cautioned him not to say any thing unless he chose - he said Mr. Williams frequented the Angel, St. Clement's; we went there, but could hear nothing of him.</p>

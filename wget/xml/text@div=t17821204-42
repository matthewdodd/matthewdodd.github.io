               <p>How did you lose it? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner there? - No, I was in liquor and fell asleep, and it was taken out of my pocket; I laid myself along the bench in the tap-room, I looked at my watch before I fell asleep, for I was to stop till eight for a person; I went in there about six, when I wa my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Did you ever get it again? - The pawnbroker stopped it about an hour after the same night, his name is Dickson, he advertised it on the Wednesday, I know nothing about the prisoner myself, I never saw him to my knowledge, I did not see him in the house that night.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker, the prisoner at the bar offered to pawn this watch with me on the 4th of November, about half after eight in the evening, I live with Mr. Fleming, opposite the Play-house, in Drury-lane; I asked him if it was his own watch, he said yes; he said he had had it two years, and then two months; then he said it was given him that day, and I stopped him, and carried him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>(The watch produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How long have you had your watch? - Between eight and nine months, I am a journeyman baker, I know the man that made it, his name is Wilson, the number is 1,267.</p>
               <p>Did you know that before you lost it? - I always look at the number of my watch when I have it first, and commonly set it down; I have lost watches before now, and that makes me careful when I buy a watch to set down the number.</p>
               <p>Was there any paper in it? do you know any body in Saville-row? - No, the last man that cleaned it is a man up by the other side of Red-lion Square.</p>

             in Saville-row? - That is a piece of paper that was in the watch when I got it.</p>
               <p>Court to Dickson. Did this man describe his watch to you before you shewed it him? - No, my Lord, he did not.</p>
               <p>Did he tell the maker's name and the number at the Justice's before it was shewn him? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Calderhead. Did not you enquire of the mistress of the house who was near you? - I told her I had lost my watch.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I honestly bought the watch of a man at the Sun, in Drury-lane, of a stranger, it wanted about ten minutes of eight at night when I bought it.</p>

               <p>I am a broker, auctioneer, and appraiser, No. 36, Baldwin's-gardens, Leather-lane, I am a housekeeper; I never knew the prisoner any further than once, I was at Hounslow, and he brought me home in a returned chaise, he was a post-boy; I was coming along by the Sun, between seven and eight, I went in, as a person went in whom I thought I knew, I believe it was of a Monday evening, when I went in I found it was not the man I thought, I might stay there a few minutes, I leaned over the settle, and just spoke to the prisoner, he nodded his head, I saw the man that was with him deliver him a watch; I saw him deliver the watch with a bit of chain or link; I have nothing more to say, than that I saw a man deliver to the prisoner at the bar a watch; I</p>

               <p>Court. How did the prisoner find you out? - The prisoner only knew me by bringing me from Hounslow; he did not know my business, or where I lived, or whether I was a master or servant; I was a servant to a nobleman at the time that he brought me from Hounslow, but a woman enquired at the Queen's Head, in Gray's-inn-lane, and they found me out, and I went to Newgate.</p>
               <p>How long is it since the prisoner was a post-boy? - I have not seen him these twelve months before, it was two years ago, or better, that he drove me; my Lord, I give you a just account, I hope you would not dispute any thing that I say; upon my affidavit I came to Newgate to see whether it was the man I had seen in the box or no dealing for the watch, and I am sure it is.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three other witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.</p>

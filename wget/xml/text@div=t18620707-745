                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Keating, a chemist, of St. Paul's-churchyard—the prisoner was a customer of his, and I knew her as such—on Thursday, 22d May, she came there between 11 and 12 o'clock, and asked to be shown some perfumes—I showed her some, and she selected some extract of spring flowers—before leaving the shop she said that her house was much infested with rats and mice; that they had destroyed the shop ceiling, which had cost them 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to repair; that they also came into the bedroom and they could not sleep at night for them; that they even came up the bed curtains, and she was obliged to put out her hand and shake them off, and she heard them fall on the floor—she said, "Do you know, I am so afraid of them getting at my baby," and asked if she could have some prussic add or something to destroy them with—I told her we did not supply prussic acid for such a purpose, and recommended her Barber's poisoned wheat as the safest remeay—she said that they had tried that and found it of no use, and asked what other things we had for the purpose—I told her we had Butler's and Battle's vermin killer—she asked me which I could re<lb></lb>commend—I told her I had heard Battle's very well spoken of, and she said that she would have a shilling packet of it—we had not one in stock, so she took two threepenny ones and one sixpenny one—I told her it was a dangerous poison, and she must be careful how she used it—I said, "I suppose the children are in the country?"—she said, "No, they are with me in town"—the officer has since shown me some pieces of paper—the threepenny packets were wrapped up in yellow, and the other one in blue—these papers (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) are portions of the wrappers—we get these powders wholesale from Edwards', in St. Paul's-charchyard, or Barclay's.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mr. and Mrs. Vyse as housemaid—on 22d May I saw Mrs. Vyse with her bonnet on—I had seen the children that morning at 9 o'clock, the breakfast hour—they were in good health at that time—I took up the dinner about 2 o'clock in the dining-room, from the first-floor—the second-floor front is the dining-room—there are two dining-rooms—Mrs. Vyse was carving the dinner—there was cold roast beef for dinner, and rice pudding—the dining-room to which I took the dinner is on the first floor—some of the young ladies dined there, and Mrs. Vyse, who carved and helped, and she carved and helped the dinner that was for the children, and I took it up to the three children, who were on the second floor—the boy was there; his name is Charles Vyse; he is about ten years old, but I cannot state the age of any of the children—they had two girls and a boy; those were the three that were up stairs—Alice was one</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186207070027"></xptr>
               <p>of them; the other girl was Annie—they were both younger than the boy—I took them up some cold beef and rice padding—they had milk and water to drink with it—Master Charles, the boy, ate the rice pudding at well as his sisters—I took away the things after dinner; they had a table-cloth and everything laid for them there—I also took away the things from down below—Master Charles generally goes to school after dinner, and I think he went out—the two girls were in the dining-room when I took away the dinner things; that was half an hour or twenty minutes after I had brought the things into the room—Mrs. Vyse did not go up stain at all during the time the children were at dinner; she remained down at the other dinner table—the children dined in their own bedroom, and I saw them there about half an hour or twenty minutes after I had taken the things away from dinner—I saw the two girls playing about there; that was between 3 and 4 o'clock—shortly before 4 o'clock I saw Mrs. Vyse in her bedroom, which is on the same floor as the children's bedroom—it is divided from hers by a wall—there is no door in the wall so that you can go from the one to the other; you have to go out on the landing—Mrs. Vyse had not her bonnet on when I saw her in her bedroom—I went up stairs, and on my coming down ten minutes afterwards, she was coming up stairs with her bonnet and shawl on into her own bedroom—she went into her bedroom and said, "Elisa, go to Mr. Keating's for a packet of the same powders which I had in the morning; make haste, and look sharp"—I went to Keating's, that is a very short dis<lb></lb>tance from the house, which is at the upper end of Ludgate-hill—I had to go through St. Paul's-churchyard—I had to wait a short time before I got the powder from Mr. Keating's, and having got it I returned to the house and went upstairs to Mrs. Vyse's bedroom—the door was shut; I knocked, but could get no answer—I knocked again, and the answer I got was, "Can't come in"—I then went up stairs—the cook was upstairs—I then went down by my<lb></lb>self and knocked at Mrs. Vyse's door again—she said, "Who is there?"—I said, "Eliza"—she spoke in a low manner to me, and said a second time, "You can't come in"—I then went down stairs to the shop to Miss Saunders, her sister, who was there, and who went up stairs with me—Miss Saunders knocked at the door and called her by her Christian name, but she made no answer—I think Miss Saunders knocked twice, and after that she and I forced the door open, and I saw Mrs. Vyse standing over the marble wash hand-stand with a razor in her right hand—when the door was first opened she held her hand down in this way, and Miss Saunders said, "Pray God," or "Pray, what are you doing?" I cannot say which; "Let me die with you, dear; but the razor I cannot take in my hand"—I then said, "I shall go for a doctor"—Mrs. Vyse put her hand into her pocket and took a letter out—she said that she was mad and wished to die, and that her children were in heaven—I think she took out the letter after saying that she was mad and wished to die, and that her ohildren were in heaven; but I was so confused I cannot remember whether it was before or after when she took the letter out of her pocket—she said to Miss Saunders, "Take this"—that is all the said—Miss Saunders took it—before I left the room Mrs. Vyse asked me for the powder more than once, but I refused to give it to her—I afterwards went into the children's bedroom, and found the two little girls in bed with the clothes over them—they were dressed, but their shoes were off; they seemed to me as if they were asleep—I did not touch them or speak to them, but I put my hand on Alice's face, and it was warm—I did not know they were dead; I thought they were asleep—I then went to Mr. Keating's—there was a gentleman there—I have seen Dr. Payne since—I gave the powder which</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, and reside at 34, Artillery-place—on the afternoon of 22d May I was at Mr. Keating's, St Paul's-churchyard, and in consequence of being called upon, I went to Mr. Vyse's, on Ludgate-hill, and found Mrs. Vyse in her bedroom, dressed, and standing up, leaning over the wash hand-stand—I examined her throat before Mr. Savory came, and found some blood which was interfering with her breathing, and removed it—after about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes Mr. Savory, a surgeon, of St. Bartholomew's-hospital, and myself, dressed the wound in her neck—it was an incised wound with a sharp instrument on the right side of the neck principally, but reaching to the middle—I saw the razor—it could have been inflicted with that, but it was not deep enough, nor in the right place to prove a fatal wound—it was on the right side, and through what we term the thyroid cartilage; the hard part here—there was blood on the razor, and in the basin, but I did not particularly notice the quantity—I did not go in and see the children before I spoke to her about them—I heard something about them, and asked Mrs. Vyse what it was that the children had had—she replied, with a good deal of difficulty, "Battle's vermin killer"—Mr. Savory had come then, but I do not know whether he was in the room at the time—the difficulty appeared to me to arise from the wound—Mr. Savory and myself attended her conjointly for three days—we deemed it desirable and safe that she should remain in her own house—Mrs. Harrison, the female searcher, was placed there by the direction of the police, but she was removed by my directions, as Mrs. Vyse seemed agitated about knowing that a person from the police-station was in the room, and we thought it necessary, in order to favour her cure, that her mind should be at test; that was our only reason, and we had an ordinary nurse from the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Charterhouse-square, and am one of the assistant surgeons at St. Bartholomew's hospital—on 22d May Dr. Payne fetched me to Mrs. Vyse about 5 o'clock, and I suppose we got there a little after 5—I saw the two children, but only looked at their bodies externally at that time—they were little girls, and were lying on the bed both dead, one on her side and the other on her back—the elder was the one lying on her side; her body was quite warm, but mottled over, of a dark blue colour, livid, and the muscles of the tipper part of the body generally, especially those about the jaws, were rigid, so that those parts were stiff—the legs were drawn up towards the body, and the fingers slightly bent in to the palms—there was rigidity about the younger child, but more generally—there were similar marks on the surface, and similar symptoms, but the rigidity was more general—I made a post-mortem examination next day, and, on removing the skull-cap, the vessels of the brain were very full of blood; congested we call it—it was congested through its substance—I took out the stomach, and Mr. Hatfield had the contents to analyse—I observed the symptoms that would arise from death by strychnine—the quantity of strychnine which would cause death in a young person like this would depend upon whether it was in solution or in a solid form—I should think that in a child of the age of these a quarter of a grain would be sufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Which would be the most rapidly effectual? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The solution, by far—about a quarter of a grain in solid would kill such a child as either of these, speaking generally, and something less than that in solution, I should think—I believe that a quarter of a grain in solution, would certainly kill; it would be more certain in solution.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after strychnine is administered does it product its deadly effects? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That depends on how it is given; two grains of it solid made up into a pill would take effect in from a quarter to half an hour; it would vary; it might begin in a quarter of an hour, and it might not begin for an hour, if given in the form of a pill; but if in solution, the effect may begin in three or four minutes, and would kill in a few minutes more if a full dose—it would kill in ten minutes or less—a grain or a couple of grains is a full dose, which would take effect in from four or five minutes to eighteen or twenty; of course I am speaking generally; but such a dose might kill in a few minutes if in solution—I did</p>

               <p>not analyse any of the contents, but I made some experiments with a portion of the contents of the stomach—I took about a sixth part of the contents of the stomach of the eldest child, boiled it with distilled water acidulated with a few drops of acid to make it soluble, filtered the solution thus obtained, evaporated it to concentrate it, and gave it to a cat, and that cat had spasms—spasmodic attacks usually attend the administration of strychnine.</p>

I am Demonstrator of Practical Chemistry at St. Thomas' Hospital—on 28th May I received from Mr. Savory the contents of the stomachs of two children—they were labelled, by which I knew to which child each referred—I analyzed the stomach of the eldest child, and found strychnine in it—I cannot tell you in what quantity, being the residue after some had been absorbed into the system; that which had been absorbed destroyed life—I also found strychnine in the liter—I also found strychnine in the stomach of the youngest child—I have received a packet of Battle's vermin killer from Mr. Savory, and I have purchased some of Messrs. Edwards and Co.—I analyzed the packet Mr. Savory gave me—it was a shilling packet—it is composed of starch, sugar, Prussian blue, and strychnine—the percentage of strychnine to the whole quantity of powder is 10 per cent.—there were fifty-three grains of powder in the packet when I received it—I found twenty-five grains of powder in the sixpenny packet, and the same proportion of strychnine; 10 per cent.—the third packet weighed fifteen grains, and there was the same proportion of strychnine—the quantity of strychnine in the sixpenny and the two threepenny packets would, I should say, from what I have heard from Mr. Savory, be sufficient to destroy life in two children.</p>

I am a draper, of St. Paul's-churchyard—I have known the prisoner and her husband for several years—I have been in the habit of doing business with them, and going in there from time to time—on 22d May, between 1 and 2 in the afternoon, I accompanied my wife to Mrs. Vyse's to get a bonnet—it was on the day in question—Mrs. Vyse had always been in the habit of attending to my wife personally—she was upstairs—I sent for her, and one of the assistants said that I and Mrs. Spence were down<lb></lb>stairs waiting to see her, and she came down—I discovered that she was in a peculiar state—she endeavoured to put off the business—she did not seem willing to attend to business—my wife first of all wanted some children's bonnets, but Mrs. Vyse seemed to say she had not got them—that struck my attention; and seeing the state she was in, I said, "Never mind, I will leave it with you, and see you again about it;" and I said to Mrs. Spence, "While you are in town, if you think of going up to the Exhibition, perhaps you had better get a bonnet for yourself"—Mrs. Vyse brought out a bonnet in a very abrupt manner, and showed it to Mrs. Spence, who made some observation about the bonnet, when the prisoner snatched it from her hand, tore out the flowers, and threw it on the ground—Mrs. Spence had made some remark about a flower on the inside, and she tore out that in the same way—all this was done in a way to attract my attention very much—her appearance dif<lb></lb>fered from her ordinary appearance—I looked at her a second and a third time, and tried to discover the meaning of it—she used to have a youthful, fresh appearance, but she appeared then to have a smouldering fire within, ready to burst out—she had a very staring look—I said immediately on passing out that I was very much astonished at her manner and style, so</p>

I have been servant with Mrs. Vyse three years—I used to live at Surbiton—I remember the death of the daughter Florence—it was on 27th November, 1860—she was taken ill on Tuesday, and the mother was not informed of it till the Saturday—she came down as usual on the Saturday, and then I informed her that the child was ill—she knew nothing of it till she came in at the door—she remained with it night and day, till the Tuesday, when it died—it was ten days ill—she was a most affectionate mother to all her children—after the child's death I noticed that her manner and demeanour changed very much—I recollect her coming down one day in February last, while I was preparing tea—she did not appear in good spirits, she was very excited—she put the baby on the floor—she had him in her arms when she came in—she was absent for a few minutes—she came down, and without any cause that I could make out, she cleared the tea-tray fall of things and threw them into the fire-place, cups and saucers, and egg cups—she seemed very excited, but next morning she seemed quite sorry and surprised, and could not believe that she had done so—she did not remember that she had done so—she seemed to have no idea that she had done such a thing—I think she weaned the child last February—I am not quite sure if it was weaned in London after this occurrence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine and examining surgeon to the Council of India—I was surgeon to the Indian invalid troops—soon after the death of Mrs. Vyse's child, I was called to attend the other children and to attend her—I became their regular medical attendant—the death of the child seemed to prey upon Mrs. Vyse, she was the subject of a morbid melancholy on the subject, and of an idea that if she had been present she might have saved the life of the child—in addition to morbid melancholy I have also seen her subject to sudden irrational impulses; but except at those times her demeanour was quiet and ladylike, very much so—she was not remarkably quiet, she was animated and very ladylike—she was very particular about her dress and person, she always exhibited great taste—she has manifested to me almost an undue anxiety, great solicitude, about her children's and her husband's health—she was nursing her child when I was consulted on the last occasion about her—that was at the beginning of this year; she was so much deteriorated in health and strength that I recommended her to wean the child, and to partially relieve herself from the duties of her business—I considered at that time that she was the subject of so much melancholy that she ought to go out of town but I was</p>

               <p>afraid that the melancholy would be increased by the want of occupation, and so I recommended that she should partially follow her business—I entertain an opinion that she is from two to three months pregnant now, there are all the usual signs—I cannot attribute the event that has occurred to anything else than the signs I have mentioned before—I believe she was in a state of mania at the time.</p>

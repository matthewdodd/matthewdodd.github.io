            , Constable. The Prisoner's Landlord, Mr. Cotterel, at the Crown in Prince's-Street, told me, she came home drunk, and had a Gold-Watch, and a Guinea, and said she had Bank-Bills. I went, and found the Watch, and Guinea upon her. The Guinea was in a Paper, directed to a Gentlewoman in Newgate-Street. I carry'd her before a Justice. She was sent to the Round-house, and next Day I went to Goldsmith's-Hall, and found an Advertisement (on the File) with a Reward of seven Guineas, with a Direction to go to Mr. Stables, in Fountain-Court, in Cheapside. Mr. Stables told me, 'twas one Troughton, a Waterman at Chelsea, who had lost it - The Prisoner, at first, said, it was her own Watch, and given her by her Friends; but before the Justice, she said, the found it in an old Pocket, in Covent-Garden. She told me too, she had got some Bank-Bills, and wanted to go into the City to receive the Money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. We went with a View to stay all Night. He paid for one Pint, and I for another; but having no Money to pay for the third, he gave me the Watch to pledge, and I carry'd it to my Landlord, who said, I should leave it with him, but I refus'd, and so the Constable came and took it from me, but I don't know what Authority he had to rob me, for it was downright Robbery, and he ought to be indicted for it.</p>
               <p>Maccoon, again. When I went up with the last Pint, he said, she had a Shilling of him, and therefore she should pay for it, for he would not.</p>
               <p>Court. Troughton, are you sure you took the Watch or Guinea out of your ket, while you were in her Company</p>
               <p>Troughton. I did take the Watch out, and laid it on the Table, but not the Guinea for I had three other Guineas in my Pocket, and a pretty deal of Silver; so as I had no need to take out the Guinea, and indeed I don't know what occasion I had to take out the Watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, he took out the Watch severel times.</p>

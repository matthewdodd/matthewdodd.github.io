               <p>How came you not to stop them? - He was an officer at Justice Reid's when I knew him first, and I could not tell whether it was a robbery or no, till I came back and alarmed the landlord.</p>

               <p>I live in the same court with Appleby, about a quarter after nine I saw two men in the court, one of them went into Appleby's, the prisoner stood at the door, and the other came out with a box, and gave it to the prisoner; he carried it with the tail of his coat; Green was with me.</p>

               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he was the man? - Yes, I am quite certain of it, I passed him quite close by him.</p>
               <p>Why did not you stop him at that time? - I did not think of it then; I followed him to the end of the court, and saw him throw it upon his shoulder; Green went back to alarm Appleby, and left me to watch; I could not stop him.</p>
               <p>The constable who apprehended the prisoner deposed, that when they told him what he was taken for, he wanted to turn evidence.</p>

               <p>I think it is very hard I should be charged with a thing that I know nothing of; I expected a friend from Uxbridge this morning, that I spent the evening with the night the robbery was committed; but he is not yet come.</p>

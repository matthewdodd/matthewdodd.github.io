                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Sargent, of No. 11, Edward-street, Limehouse-fields. I have known the prisoner for some time—on Saturday night, 9th July, I met him in Carr-street, accidentally—he spoke to me, and asked if I would go and have some beer; and we went and had a pint at the White Horse—we then went and had a pint of ale at another beer shop, I do not know the name of it—I did not go into the houses, we had it at the door—we had it between us—after having the ale, we still con<lb></lb>tinued in company—he took me by the hand and led me across the road, and led me up a place where there are some new buildings, I do not know the name of it—it was just across the road from the last beer shop we were at—he then began to pull me about indecently, and to talk to me—he asked me whether he could have connexion with me at such time as he thought proper—I said, No, I would not; I would tell my husband—he said he did not care a d——about my husband, and that my husband went along with other women, and why could not I do the same?—he then took me by my hand across the road to the corner of a field, pulled me about indecently, and wished to know whether I would let him be with me, and such like—there is no thoroughfare through the field—the prisoner said there was—I refused to go—he said there was a thoroughfare for other people, and so there was for us—we then got into the field—he made me go; he had hold of my wrist, and pulled me, and I had a very bruised wrist—we went a very little distance into the field—he then pulled me down, took hold of my throat, and held me while he took out</p>

               <p>a knife and cut it—he held me by my throat till he had cut it—I believe he took the knife from his coat pocket, but I could not positively say—I am quite sure I saw a knife in his hand, and I saw him shut it after he had done it—after he had done it I said, "What have you done?" and he said, "You are a dead woman"—I am quite sure he made use of that expression—he then left me—I hallooed out" Murder!" three times—I put my apron to my throat, and went into a chandler's shop at the corner; a surgeon was sent for—a gentleman whom I knew happened to come in, and he took me to his house, sent for a horse and cart, and took me to the hospital—I remained there three weeks and two days.</p>

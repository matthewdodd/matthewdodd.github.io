                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop at Wolverhampton. On the 25th of June I was in London—I was a stranger, and had never been in Lon<lb></lb>don before—I had been in town about four days—it was about half-past ten or eleven o'clock at night—I was somewhere about Whitechapel, inquiring my way to Whitechapel-church—I had had two or three glasses of porter with a friend at Holloway, but knew very well what I was doing—three men came up to me—they were strangers to me—I asked them to have the kindness to show me the way—they took me about ten yards down a street not many yards off, and then knocked me down—they tore my watch from my pocket, and broke the guard, part of which was left round my neck—it was a silver watch, worth 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had some money in my pocket—I did not lose that—I cannot tell whether they felt in my pocket—I was struck at the back of my head with a man's fist—I do not know who knocked me down—the prisoner is the man who was over me, while I lay on my back, and was taking my watch out—he had got a furry cap on—I had never seen him before—I saw him not many minutes after I was knocked down—he was on</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor—on Thursday evening, the 25th of June, about eleven o'clock, I saw the prosecutor come out of the Angel and Crown public-house, opposite Whitechapel church—he was very tipsy, and without his hat—a female outside the house said to the prisoner, "Bring back the man's hat"—the prisoner brought his hat, put it on his head, and said it was only a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—the prosecutor said nothing that I heard—I did not notice then directly afterwards, but in a minute or two I saw the prosecutor fall down—I do not know by what means—I walked fast up to them, and saw three persons round him—I said, "Fair play gentlemen"—the prisoner said, "It is all right, sir"—I took hold of the prosecutor and lifted him up—he walked about twelve yards, and then said, "They have got my watch"—I had not observed what the three men were doing—when I took the prosecutor up the prisoner went away—the prisoner was leaning over towards the prosecutor—the prosecutor pulled out his guard and said, "They have taken my watch"—I did not particularly examine the guard—I said to the prisoner, "He has lost his watch"—the prisoner said, "I know nothing about it, sir"—they had gone away but the prisoner had come back—I said, "You are one of the three persons that were standing over him"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I let him go then—I informed the first policeman—I accompanied Sugg to the Angel and Crown, and pointed out the prisoner—this was about twenty yards from where it happened.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable.</hi>) On the 25th of June, about half-pass seven o'clock, Jones took me to the Angel and Crown, Whitechapel, and pointed the prisoner out—I left the prosecutor, who was very drunk, in the charge of another officer in the street—I laid hold of the prisoner's arm—he turned round—Jones said, "That is the man"—the prisoner said, "Oh, yes, I have picked the old man up"—I took the prisoner out of the house—the prosecutor did not seem to know him—I took both to the station—he made no reply at all when Jones made the charge at the station.</p>

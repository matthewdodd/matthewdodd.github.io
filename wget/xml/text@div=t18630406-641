I am a watch and clockmaker, and keep a shop in Blackheath-road, in partnership with my brother—on the afternoon of 4th April, I was in my parlour which adjoins the shop—I heard the noise of breaking a window, and went into my shop—the window was smashed, and I saw the prisoner running away—I ran after him a little way—a policeman caught him—I then returned to my shop, and missed these eight gold Albert chains (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were safe just before, and within reach of the window that was broken.</p>

               <p>—on Saturday, 4th April, I was bringing some work home next door to the prosecutor's—I saw the prisoner distinctly come across the road, pull his right hand out of his coat pocket, and smash the window—he then put his hand through the window, took the chains together, and pulled them out—he then ran away—I cried, "Stop thief!"—he was pursued—I did not see him caught—I am sure it was him—I have known him for years.</p>

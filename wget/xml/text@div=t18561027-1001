                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Bayham-place, Camden-town. The prisoner is my nephew—I was present at his marriage to Rachael Liffey, on 20th June, 1852, at St. Mary's, Islington—my name was entered in the register book, and I put my mark, not being able to write—his wife is still living, and is here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sudbury, near Harrow. On 24th May I was married, by licence, to the prisoner, at St John's Church, Wenley, near Harrow—he is my cousin, and I had known him for a great many years—he was married in the name of Frederick Charles Holmes—I did not know that he had been married before.</p>

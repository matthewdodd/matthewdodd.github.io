I took the prisoner into custody, on the 22nd of November, and asked him what he had done with the money - I did not say it would be better or worse for him to tell me - I asked him what he had done with the eight sovereigns of Mr. Taylor's, his master - he said, 1l. 16s. was found on him - I asked what he had done with the rest; he said, he bought a new hat, and a pair of shoes - I mentioned the name of Taylor to him - I don't know whether I told the magistrate that I mentioned Taylor's name - he did not account for any more money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When master took me at Brighton, he brought me up in a caravan, and Mr. Taylor said if I would come back quietly, he would take me into his service and that he was going to make it up with my friends, and then he gave me in charge.</p>

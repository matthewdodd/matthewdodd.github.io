On 26th November the prisoner came to me—my daughter lived as servant in the Hackney-road, and the mistress sent the prisoner to me, saying she had engaged her as a nurse, and would I allow her to sleep at my place one night—she slept there three nights—after she was gone I missed a pair of boats—I had seen them on the Friday night in the prisoner's hand, as she was going out—I saw them at the pawnbroker's three or four days afterwards—I had not given the prisoner leave to lake them.</p>

I am the prosecutrix's daughter—on Friday night, 28th November, the prisoner told my mother she was going out for an hour, might I go with her—just before that she had these boots in her hand—my mother asked her to put them under the drawers—she did not—about five minutes afterwards we went out—she asked me where there was a pawn-broker's—I showed her Mr. Telfer's—she said, "I am going to buy a piece of stuff, you stay outside"—I had bought some for my mother, and the prisoner said she would have that for herself, and buy my mother another piece—she went into the pawnbroker's, and when she came out she said, the gentleman had shown her about thirty pieces, but they wanted too much money—she went into a small linendraper's, and the money she had in her hand was a half-crown, a fourpenny piece, a penny, and a halfpenny—I saw it in her hand—she bought a bonnet front—we then went back to my mother's—she was taken into custody at my mother's on the Monday night.</p>

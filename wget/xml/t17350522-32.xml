About ten at Night, as I went into the Parlor to fetch a Candlestick, I heard a little Noise, and looking, I saw the Prisoner lying on his Face on the Parlor Stairs, his Feet were four Steps from the bottom. He turned his face towards me, but as I had only a Candle and Candlestick in my Hand, and knowing the Street Door was fast, I seemed to take no notice of him, but went down into the Kitchen to fetch a Poker, and to call my Fellow Servants; but when we came up, the Man was gone. The Door being still locked and chain'd, we went into the Dining Room up one pair of Stairs fronting the Street: The Sashes of this Room were then all three drawn up. But there was but one up, and the other two were shut down two or three Hours before I saw the Prisoner. We concluded he was got out that way, and so we called Thieves! and some body said, Here's a Man at the Door, come and see if this is he. I went down, and found it was the same Person.</p>

            . I was standing at my Master's Door (next to the Prosecutors) and saw the Prisoner jump from the Lamp to the Ground - The Lamp was half a Yard or three Quarters from the Dining Room Window. I believe he hurt himself with the Fall, for he lay there till a Man took hold of him. He was in a Green Waistcoat, a Dark Coat, and a Black Wig.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. By what Light did you see me?</p>
               <p>E. Cresswell. I could not preserve (observe) him by Day Light, but there was a Light at my Master's Door - And I saw him next Morning in the Compter in the same dress.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 25, Mile End Road—on 30th May, about 2.40, I was called to 80, Sidney Street—I saw a cart at the door, backed up to the kerb, and a woman's body in it—I had it removed imme<lb></lb>diately into the house, in hopes of doing something to resuscitate it—it was pulseless; I could see no marks of wounds then—she was dead—I got her clothes off and examined her body—I found a gun-shot wound by the left side a little behind the arm, and another about 2 in. above the right nipple going upwards from left to right, going in on the left below, and coming out on the right above—I saw the place where the bullet was found in the wall—I described the place to look for it when I found it had left the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Taking the direction of the bullet through the body, and where the ball was found, can you tell us where the woman was standing when she was shot? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Standing at the bend of the staircase descending the stairs—she had just turned the bend of the staircase, I should imagine—the cause of death was laceration of the heart by the gun-shot wound—it must have been instantaneous—I could not get into the prisoner's room, as it was on fire—I looked in and was obliged to close the door—I am surgeon to the 7th Tower Hamlets Volunteers—I know the prisoner's face among the men.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say that the bullet entered the back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and fractured the tenth rib—I believe she was coming down the stairs, and if she had got a little further down it would have entered in front—I think she had scarcely turned the angle of the stairs; she had not fully turned the angle at the time the bullet entered—the rifle would, in my judgment, have been in the hands of somebody at the door of the back room.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187007110052"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If fired intentionally by anybody at the door, the trigger must have been pulled before she was in sight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot judge—it must hare been levelled, at all events, before; if the rifle had been fired before she came in sight, it would certainly have missed her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Or if it had gone off by accident, either one or the other, the hammer must have come down on the nipple before she was in sight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say that it must be so; I think that simultaneously with her coming in sight she was shot—I think she had scarcely turned the angle when the ball entered; not fully turned, or else it must have struck her further round—there would be an interval of time, however short, between the hammer falling and the ball entering the object, but it is a matter of doubt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am orderly sergeant to the 7th Tower Hamlets Volun<lb></lb>teers—the prisoner had been a member of the corps five months up to that time—this is the rifle served out to him—these are the Government ball cartridges, similar to those served out by me for practice—they fit the rifle—they are made on purpose for the Enfield rifle—these are the regular cap—the bullet taken from the wall is shapeless—the prisoner had been out practising twice—instruction is always given in the use of the rifle before practice—a man is never allowed to go down to the butts until he has been thoroughly instructed in the use of the rifle—the prisoner had been so instructed, and had gone down to the butts twice—the last occasion of his going down was on Saturday, 28th May—we served him out twenty rounds, for the purpose of passing his second class—he fired every round, and after-wards he was served out with ten more for practice—he fired eight of those ten, and returned the other two cartridges to me—every man before he leaves the ground passes his ramrod down the barrel, and we know from the ring at the bottom that the rifle is discharged—that test was applied to his rifle, and it was not loaded—we left the ground on 28th May at 4.10, and he came up in the train with me—the range is at Woodford—he parted with me at Sutton Street, Commercial Road, and was going home to get his tea, to assemble again at Head Quarters, at Ham Park, and to put his uniform on—I had not the slightest idea that he was possessed of any ball cartridge—he would not require any for the inspection—he was very regular at his drill from his first joining the corps, and he was always exceedingly quiet and well behaved, and gave great satisfaction to the sergeant who in<lb></lb>structed him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On this Saturday, the 28th, was he shooting for some particular prize? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was shooting to pass his second class—if he had passed that, in addition to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per annum, it would have been a mark of distinction, because he would have been able to have fired for his badge in the first class—he did fire on the Saturday with that object, but was unfortunately four or five points short—he seemed rather low-spirited, and we tried to cheer him up—the sergeant and corporal down there asked him what made him so sad—I am quite sure I examined his rifle before he left, and I also saw him clean it out—we were not in a hurry to get to the train, we had twenty minutes to spare when we got to it—I examined the rifles of all the men, and collected all the ball cartridge—we go as far as we can in demanding ball cartridge from the men, and I have never heard of their having ball cartridge at their lodgings, but I have known the men to purchase ball cartridge to go down to other butts to practice—he came to Head Quarters at 6 o'clock, in uniform, and had his rifle with him—he joined the ranks, and marched off—he was not expected</p>

               <p>then to say, or asked the question, whether he had any cartridges—I remember a young man coming up to me and asking me for some ammuni-tion—I then went up to the prisoner, and asked him if he had any—I took two cartridges from him, and left him with one, and his rifle was also loaded—I collected some from other men as well—I went to them all.</p>

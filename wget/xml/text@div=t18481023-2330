                  </hi>. I live in Charlotte-street, Whitechapel. On Tuesday evening, 12th Sept., I was in Whitechapel,—between six and seven o'clock, and saw Susan Cooiidge on the kerb on the right side opposite the Church, in the act of crossing—I was close behind her—when she got about the centre a cart came along very furiously; the prisener was driving it, another man was in it—Susan Coolidge was knocked down very quickly—the wheel went over her shoulder—she cried out, "Oh!" when the wheel touched her—the cart went on about thirty yards—I believe it was stopped by the by-standers—I saw Susan Coolidge at the doctor's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farrier, of Saracen's Head-yard, Aldgate. On 12th Sept., about twenty minutes past six o'clock, I saw the horse and cart coming along at a very fast rate, seven or eight miles an hour—the pri<lb></lb>soner was driving it—I saw him strike the horse previous to coming up to the place—he had got a pipe in his mouth—the young woman came out of a shop, passed me, and crossed the road—the near wheel struck her on the side, which <hi rend="italic">slewed</hi> her round, and the wheel went across her shoulder—she had a plate in her hand, and was going to get some butter—she did not cry out—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184810230100"></xptr>
               <p>I do not believe the men in the cart saw her no more than she saw them—the road was quite clear—the cart went on about sixty yards—I went across the road to assist in picking the young woman up, and taking her to Mr. Cook's, the chemist—he sent me' to get the name on the cart—it was a wine-merchant's cart—if the men had seen it, there was plenty of time for them to stop—the prisoner was talking to the other man in the cart—the horse was galloping, as they had struck it just before—they were pulling its head at the time, whether to check its speed or make it go faster I do not know.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. What sort of horse was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A brown, stiff horse—seven or eight miles an hour was galloping for it—its tendons might have been so contracted that it could not trot—I never saw the woman before; I saw one of the men whip the horse when she was about the length of this Court from the cart—the road was perfectly clear.</p>

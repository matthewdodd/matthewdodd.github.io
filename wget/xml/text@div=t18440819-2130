                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, and live at Wright's Hotel, in the Strand. The prisoner was formerly my wine-cooper—he left my service last September, not of his own accord—I have a cellar in Hungerford-market—I had thirty-five pipes of wine there in Dec, but there were four pipes of port which had come in a day or two previously—they were placed close by the door—I saw them safe on the 18th of December, and missed one on the 23rd, which was placed close to the door—I had a person in my employ named Hubbard—I had the key of the vault in my possession—it was part of Hub<lb></lb>bard's duty to go there—when I missed the pipe of wine, on the 23rd of Dec., the door was mutilated, as if with a crow-bar, or something of that kind—the door-posts and door were a good deal jagged—the lock was not taken off, but forced back—I first discovered it about twelve o'clock in the day—the value</p>

               <p>of the pipe was 80 1/2.—the duty was all paid—I advertised for it—I have a crane there with which I raise my pipes of wine—it was my own wine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Baldwin's-place, and was clerk to Mr. Wright in Dec. last. I had the care of the cellar in Hungerford-market-—there were four pipes of wine there belonging to him, one lying nearly across the door—I saw them safe between four and five o'clock in the afternoon of the 20th of Dec.—when I left that day I secured the door—I went next on the 23rd with Mr. Wright and Mr. Tattersall, and found the cellar-door broken open—the lock had not been injured—I met the prisoner at the latter end of May, or the beginning of June, at the Hope Inn, Blackwall-street—I had never seen him before—I asked him how he was, and then if he had heard about the pipe of wine being stolen from the cellar—he laughed, and said it had never done him any good—I did not make any observation on it—I did not think that he had stolen it.</p>

I live in Crown-court In Dec. last I was carman to Mr. Holmes—I had seen the prisoner a day or two before I went with him and Mr. Holmes's cart—I think it was in the week before Christmas—I cannot tell the day—I went some time in the evening—I think it was after five o'clock—we went to Hungerford-street, to those vaults which have been since pointed out to me by Mr. Wright—I have worked there one day since—I went with the prisoner to Hungerford-market—he told me to wait a bit, and he went away—I do not know where—he was absent about a quarter of an hour—he then came and told me to back the cart against the crane at this vault—there was nothing under the crane then—the prisoner then left me again—I did not see where he went—I did not look after him—when he came back a cask came out of the door against the crane, and two men craned it up into the cart—I had not seen those men with the prisoner, and I do not know what he was doing when they craned up the wine into the cart—the prisoner told me to go with it to the Dog and Duck yard—neither of us got into the cart—we walked—he was sometimes before the cart, and sometimes</p>

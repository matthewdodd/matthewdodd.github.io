On the Sunday-evening before Christmas-day, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner was at the Barleymow, and two or three more, particularly one Johnson, the deceased Unwin, and one Gardiner. There was a quarrel between Gardiner and Westley, and there were blows between them. After the quarrel Mr. Unwin was going out of the box with a pint of beer in his hand. Westley was in a passion, and struck first one blow; then Mr. Unwin said he would fight him fairly. I said he should not fight, it being Sabbath-day. Then Westley struck Unwin again, and Unwin fell under the grate a-cross the sender, and there was blood came from his mouth and nose. I gave him some spiritous liquors to wash his mouth with; he went away, and came again in the evening with two or three other people, and made a great riot. Unwin came again next morning; he did not give any account of whom he received his blows. Unwin was a <rs id="t17720219-58-viclabel282" type="occupation">recruiting serjeant</rs>

            . I am brother-in-law to the deceased. I saw him on Christmas-day in the evening; he seemed insensible; he said he had lost blood; he said a horse had kicked him, he was almost stone-blind. He lingered eight or nine days at different lodgings. He said once, Oh, this Westley has killed me! The wound afterwards appeared more favourable. He went to the hospital on the Wednesday, and died on the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any particular conversation respecting Westley?</p>

            . I am a journeyman apothecary. I attended the deceased the day after Christmas-day; he complained of being very ill, and said it was occasioned by the kick of a horse. He said he had been in the country. I understood him to speak of a transaction on Sunday. I opened his face; there were two wounds; his nose and eyes were black, they were closed up with a swelling; and there was a contusion on his forehead. There were no symptoms of a fracture. There was bleeding at the ears and nose, and occasionary delirium, and an inclination to vomit, which we consider as a symptom of a fracture or concussion of the brain. I could find no fracture or fissure; but I concluded from these symptoms, that there must be a concussion of the brain in consequence of an injury he had received. I attended him ten days; three or four of those days he was delirious; at the time I dressed him he was delirious. The first time, when he talked of a kick of a horse, he was sensible by degrees as the swelling went off; and he had complaints of another nature, he seemed asthmatic, and something dropsical. At the end of these ten days I was taken ill myself; in consequence of which another person attended him. When I got better I carried in my bill for my attendance upon him. I found then the visible external injuries were all got well; the confusion and the swellings were gone, and the wounds upon his nose had a scab on them, so that all appearances of danger were over, but he complained of shortness of breath, and was in danger of suffocation. He was sent to the hospital, and I saw no more of him till he was dead. I understand that at the hospital he was treated by Dr. Pitcairn as for a dropsy.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for a concussion of the brain to take that turn?</p>
               <p>Clows. I can't say I know that; but I have known these asthmatic complaints to follow upon such a dropsy.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence said, that the deceased first began the fray, by taking him by the nose, and threatening him; that he called him a kidnapper, because he raised recruits for the india company; that upon that Unwin came forward, and asked him how the prisoner knew him to be a kidnapper; that then he said something which enraged Unwin, and Unwin struck him a second blow; that as he was going to strike him a third time, that then he struck him, and he fell upon the hearth. He called several witnesses, who corroborated his defence, and others that deposed, that he was a peaceable man, but if injured would stand upon his defence.</p>

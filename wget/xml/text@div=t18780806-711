                  </hi>. I live at 46, Gayhurst Road, Dalston—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 30th June, about 4.30, I was disturbed by a noise in the house—I got up, put on my trousers and waistcoat, and went down to-the back<lb></lb>parlour door, where I met Lovell—I seized him by the collar and said "Oh, you are the sort of fellow that do these things, are yon? come along"—he made a struggle, as though he was going to strike me—I said "Oh, that is it, is it," and I threw him down in the passage and held him there securely till my son brought the clothes-line, and I bound him with it and sent for a policeman—I told my son to stand over him while I looked over the house to see. if there was another fellow about—I did not find one—Lovell had on one of my son's coats under his own, and in his pocket he had two table-napkins and a pair of nut-crackers of mine—I afterwards examined the house and missed a gravy-spoon, a sauce-ladle, and another pair of nut-crackers, which were afterwards found in London Fields by some children, about 400 yards from my house—when I went to bed the previous night the front parlour window was shut and fastened by the catch, and the Venetian blind was down and the door was fastened—the value of the articles taken is-about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>

On the morning of 30th June, about 20 minutes to 5, I was on duty in Melbourne Road, Dalston, which runs into Gayhurst Road, and saw the two prisoners—they asked me the way to the Cat and Mutton—I directed them to the Richmond Road—they went the other way, down Gayhurst Road—I then went round my beat—about 10 minutes to 5 I was called by the prosecutor's son to 45, Gayhurst Road, where I found Lovell bound hand and foot with a clothes-line; I had to untie him before taking him into custody—he was charged at the station-house—he said he had made a mistake—I afterwards returned to the house, and in the Gayhurst Road I saw Coffee standing, about 30 yards from the house—as soon as he saw me coming towards him he made off as hard as he could walk—I followed him, overtook him, and told him I should take him into custody for being concerned with Lovell in the burglary at 45, Gay<lb></lb>hurst Road—he said he would give me his name and address, and I could find him at any time—I took him to the station and charged him.</p>

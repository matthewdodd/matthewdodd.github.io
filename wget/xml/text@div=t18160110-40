I was at home on Wednesday, the 2nd of January; I came home at noon to dinner; I came home in a perspiration, and my shirt, my waistcoat, and the lining of my jacket were wet. I took those articles off, and put on a dry shirt; I took my pocket-book containing the notes out of the pocket of the jacket that I took off, and put it into the jacket I put on; there were twelve single notes in my pocket-book. I staid at home an hour and a half, which is longer than I ought to have done, and finding that the jacket I had taken off was dry, I put it on again; in my hurry, I forgot to take my pocket-book out. I then went to work, and returned between four and five o'clock; I cannot tell whether the jacket was there then. I did not miss it until the Thursday morning, when I got up: I should not have missed it then, only that my daughter told me something; I missed all the things between eight and nine. The next time I saw the jacket was on the prisoner's back, at Shadwell, between twelve and one, on Monday last; it was very promiscuously that I happened to hear of it, because he had had two hearings. I then went to look at the prisoner and the jacket, and knew it to be mine.</p>

On Thursday the 4th of January, I was at home;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100019"></xptr>there had been some washing done in the house, my daughter assisted me. The things were hung up to dry, all over the kitchen. I went to bed at about eleven o'clock, but I can't say exactly; my daughter went to bed at the same time, and my husband; the doors of the house were all fast; the door and the windows fast. There was wood work at the side of the windows, bars of wood. The window was fastened slightly on the inside by a small slight nail. This was on the Wednesday evening. I got up between seven and eight on the Thursday morning; my daughter was up first in the house; I sent her down. The things were not there that were put there the preceeding evening: I had seen my husband's jacket the night before; I had seen it an hour before I went to bed. When I went down on the Thursday morning, all was gone, and all was open; the bars were lifted slightly off, and put on again; the nails were forced out, and the window was right open. I saw this property at Shadwell office on the Monday.</p>

            . I am a patrole of Ratchiffe. I know the prisoner at the bar. I stopped him at half past five on Thursday morning; I mean the Thursday morning on which these things were missed. I had suspicion he had something in his bag, I stopped him with the bag, and took him to the watchhouse. This was about half a mile from the prosecutor's house; he had on this jacket. (producing it.) I took him to the watchhouse, and made him open the bag there. At first when I met him in the street, he said he had only a little flour. After he said that I opened the bag to look in it. The first thing he pulled out, was two white stockings wet. I told him to put them into the bag, and I should convey him to the watch-house; I delivered him to the officer of the night, he is here. I then went to my duty again. I left the bag also in the custody of the officer of the night. I left it and its contents, as I found it on the prisoner.</p>

            . In January last I drove a team for Mr. Frost, of Finchley. On a Friday morning my master found something out; on the morning before we went to Northall with two teams, Dutton and I - each took two trusses of hay; the first house we stopped at was the <placeName id="t18210411-4-crimeloc18">White Horse, Potters End</placeName>

Dutton left a truss of hay with Knight, and I left one - Knight gave me 1 s. for it. We had no orders to leave any hay there. The price was about 2 s. 6 d. a truss. Knight knew whose service we were in. I had known him from the Monday morning, had called at his house every morning for four days, and had spoken to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. No money was given to Dutton - A. Not to my knowledge. I saw Knight take the hay out of the cart and put it in the stable. We were going further. It was not loose hay, it was a regular truss.</p>

In consequence of something which I discovered, I took them up - Dutton absconded, and I did not catch him until the 16th of March. I took up Knight on the 23d of January, and told him what he was charged with; he was examined before the magistrate. On the 26th of January he called on me - he was hostler at the house - his master asked me, in his presence, to settle the business without going before the magistrate - I declined. I allowed the man half a truss of hay for the horses.</p>

               <p>DUTTON'S Defence. I called my fellow-servant up to go to Northall, and put a truss and about 6 lbs. of hay in the cart, for the horses; when I got to the watering-house I took one truss out to bait the horses, took as much as I thought necessary, and left the rest with the hostler till I returned; he gave my fellow-servant a shilling to get some ale. Next morning we were going for another load, he said he had no food for his horses, and I gave him some chaff for them. My master asked what I had in my cart, I said there was a little for my fellow-servant; on searching his cart two trusses were found. I declare I know nothing of it - they made him drunk to get him to say bad things against me.</p>
               <p>KNIGHT'S Defence. I never received the man's hay.</p>

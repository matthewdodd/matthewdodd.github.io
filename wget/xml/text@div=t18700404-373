                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 3rd March I went with another officer to 11, Vine Street, Yord Road, Lambeth, and found the prisoner there—I asked her if the name of Chandler was there—she said "Yes, but he is not at home—I said "But you are Mrs. Chandler?"—she said "No, I am not"—I said "Yes, you are," and she ran up to a room on the first floor—I followed, and saw her take something from a table and make towards the fire—I caught hold of her hand and asked what she had there—she said "Only this box"—I took it out of her hand, opened it, and found it contained ten counterfeit shillings, wrapped up separately in paper—I asked her how she accounted for the possession of them—she said that they were left by a party for her to take possession of—she did not say who—I said that I should take her in custody for having them in her possession.</p>

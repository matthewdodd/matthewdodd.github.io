On Friday the 29th of May I was in my back parlour, a gentleman told me there was a woman gone out of my shop; I immediately ran to the door; seeing no woman whatever right or left, I turned myself round and missed a shawl from off the horse, that stood about three yards from the door, within the shop; when I missed the shawl I ran into a pawnbroker's shop that was three doors from me; I saw the prisoner there, having previously seen this woman about the door, not suspecting at the time she was stealing any thing; I asked the pawnbroker if a shawl had been brought to pawn; she went out of the shop; I communicated my suspicions to the pawnbroker, he sent his man out and brought the woman back; I saw him take the shawl out of her pocket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought two shawls on Thursday the 28th of May; my husband is a sailor, I did not know one shop from another, having been in London only two days; I pawned one of them for eighteen pence, as my husband has gone to sea and left me; and I pawned some silver spoons, I lost the ticket. On the next day I was coming past this gentleman's shop, I went in to see if I had pawned them there; he took that shawl out of my pocket; I never was in his shop.</p>

               <p>Isabella Jordan. About three weeks ago the Prisoner stole three gowns, a pair of shoes, and a cap out of my lodgings in <placeName id="t17410828-67-crimeloc322">Goswel street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. I gave her a shilling in part of payment at Mr. Hubbard's room, and another shilling she took out of my mouth by force. She took me to three Justices, but none of them being in the way, she discharg'd me, and we drank together like friends, and the next morning because I did not come to work she took me up again.</p>
               <p>Hubbard. Mrs. Jordan could not light of a Justice that day, and as for satisfaction, there was none made that I know of.</p>

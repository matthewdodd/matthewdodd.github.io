                  </hi>. I live at Camberwell—the prisoner has been in my service as cook about eighteen months. On the 29th of April, in cones<lb></lb>quence of information from Ryan, I looked into my wine-cellar, and missed nearly three dozen of port wine—the wine-cellar was kept locked—nobody ought to have had access to it but myself and my wife, who kept the key—I have since seen the key of my garden-gate, and find it opens the cellar—I was not aware of it before—on the 27th of April I called the prisoner up into my room, charged her with having robbed me of my wine, and said if she would confess what she had done, she might go that night—she denied having robbed me at all, and denied having anything of mine—I called in a police<lb></lb>man and she gave him the keys of her boxes—he searched them, and found a table-cloth, towel, and inkstand, three shell, and other articles, which are my property—no wine was found—she was present when the things were found, and said two or three of them were hers—I identify these towels as my property—they have no mark on them, but I know them—I have been in the habit of seeing them for eighteen months or two years, and consider they are mine—here is one marked "M"—I can swear to that as well as to the others—I do not know that particular mark, but I know it is my towel—I recollect seeing this mark on it before—it is just such a mark as mine had—it is just such an "M" as other persons would have whose names began with "M "—the towels were marked with red—this table-cloth is marked "G. R. M."—that is my brother's mark—I know it was in my possession—this inkstand has no particular mark, but I can swear to it—it was kept in the kitchen—this plate is mine, and this cream-jug—these stocking are my wife's—here is a name on them which I wrote myself—the prisoner's box was locked.</p>

                  </hi>. I went into Mr. Miller's service on the 23rd of March—about that day I was in my own room, adjoining the wine-cellar—I heard the wine-cellar door unlocked—I thought it was Mr. Miller—I looked and saw it was the prisoner—I heard her hang the key up in the kitchen—I no<lb></lb>ticed wine in the cupboard some time before that—I dare say there were twenty bottles in a cupboard under the stairs—I mean twenty bottles toge<lb></lb>ther, one following the other—they were sometimes full, and used to be taken away when they were empty—I have seen the empty bottles taken away, and have known them to be the same that I have seen there, by the addition to the number of empty bottles in the garden—they were in rows—I saw bottles in the cupboard when I heard the prisoner come from the cellar—I saw a bottle in the cupboard, there had been about one-third taken out of it—I noticed it again afterwards, and there was about half a pint in it—I did not see it again.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever see her write in her room up stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I brought these stockings down to her—I put them in the back kitchen, and never saw them again till the policemen found them—the prisoner had there boxes, the box in which the stocking were found was not the prisoner's—she used it for her own purposes—it was an old millinery box—the other things which were found besides those produced were hers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When were the stockings found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the morning after she was taken into custody—the box was in a spare room adjoining the kitchen—that was not where we used to throw the things for the wash—the box belonged to Mr. Miller—I found the prisoner's bonnet, and some caps, and a lot of rags, in it—it was not locked—there was no lid to it—I came from Yorkshire to the service of Mr. Fletcher, of Camberwell—it did not suit me, and I gave her warning—I was there a month—after that I went as housekeeper to Mr. Elliott, of grove-lane—he is single, and a man of the highest respectability—I was there two months—I was too young for the situation, and did not like to live with him alone—I was not exactly cook enough for him—Mr. Rockwell, whom I lived with three years and a half, brought me from Yorkshire—I have been in no situations in London but what I have named—the cook who came to Mr. Miller's after the prisoner, has gone away—Mr. Miller did not keep the key of the cupboard under the stairs—there was no key to it—I sometimes had occasion to go to it—I never tasted the wine—I am quite sure it was wine—I held it up to the light, and took the cork out to smell it—I am certain I did not taste it—there is a pretty good deal of wine drank in the house—the bottles go into the garden when done with—there is a heap there in rows—I used to count the bottles after my suspicions arose—this was the first time I saw where the prisoner got the wine from—I heard her speak of opening other apartments with keys of her own, and I tried the key to the cellar—I did not try any other apartment—I saw a fresh bottle on Saturday, and one on Sunday—there was only one at a time—I know it was a different bottle each time—my mistress superintends the house—I took up the linen for the wash—the dirty linen is always kept down stairs, in a large bin—it is not taken up to Mr. Miller, and counted out regularly—Mr. Miller never sends a servant to the wine-cellar—I never saw the prisoner drink a glass of wine—I was not much with her—I was very frequently up stairs, or out with the children.</p>

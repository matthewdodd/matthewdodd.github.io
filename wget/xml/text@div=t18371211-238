                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in Bishopsgate-street On the evening of the 5th of December, about half-past eight o'clock, the prisoners came to my shop and asked to see some diamond rings—I took a tray out consisting of diamond and other rings—(my shop forms part of my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Ethelburga. in the City of London)—they did not purchase any rings, but they purchased a gilt key of my young man, who was standing some distance from me at the time—on their going out of the shop I missed two rings, one of which I had shown to them, and the other was in the same tray—no one but myself and the prisoners had been near the tray from the time I showed it to them till I missed the rings—I have since seen one of them—the value of that one is about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is it—the prisoners were both looking at the rings—I think only one took the rings in his hand—that was Allen, and I have reason to think he put them down again.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are these? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Rose diamonds—they are real diamonds—they are the same as other diamonds, only differently cut—the difference is in the cutting only, not in the stone—a thin diamond would make a good rose, but would not make a brilliant—there is a mark on this—I think it is 27, but I see it is a good deal robbed—my eyes are not good enough to see it, but I have looked with a glass, and I find there is a mark, but it is so worn that I could not swear to it, even with a glass—I swear to it by its general character—it is rather an uncommon shape—I should not now make such a ring—I never saw one like it—rose diamonds are very common, but I do not think any jeweller in London would make such a ring as this now—I made it myself for a particular person, who did not have it—I have the number of it in my book, but there is no number on this ring.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you known the persons you call the prisoners before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had not—I had never seen them before, to my knowledge—it was from eight to half-past eight o'clock in the evening—the gas was lighted—it is not very usual for me to be in the shop all the evening, but I was on that occasion—I do not think I can be mistaken in them—I had a boy and a shopman in the shop—they no doubt had the opportunity of seeing the persons—they were looking at them at the time—one of them sold a key to one of the persons.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He would therefore have the opportunity, if he could, of confirming you as to the identity of the prisoners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most assuredly—neither of them are here—I did not think it necessary.</p>

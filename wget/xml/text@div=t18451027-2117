                  </hi>. I am in the service of Edward Tanner, of Lamb's Conduit-street. About five o'clock in the afternoon, on the 1st of Oct., the prisoner came to the shop and asked if I had a pair of shoes I could sell him which would do for waiting—I said I had, and I gave him a chair—while I was getting the shoes I heard a noise of some women's shoes which hung behind where he sat—I took no notice, but found some shoes to fit him—I then went on the stairs, and observed him take a pair of shoes from a rail behind where he sat, and put them under his jacket—I found a pair of shoes to fit him, and asked 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—he offered me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I refused—he went out—I followed him, and, not finding an officer, I persuaded him to come back, to see if we could not come to some terms—I then offered him the shoes for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said they were not the same shoes—he went to the same chair where he had been sitting, and, fell down, and these shoes dropped from him—I swear they dropped from him.</p>

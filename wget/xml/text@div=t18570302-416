                  </hi>. I live at No. 32, North-street, Mile End road. I am a job buyer of artificial flowers. On the morning of Tuesday, 24th Feb., the prisoner, William Henry, came to me; he brought me a bunch of flowers—he asked me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I bought it; he said he had got some more, if I would buy them—I said I was a buyer, if they suited me—both the prisoners returned to me again about half past 12 o'clock the same day, and brought one box of flowers, Thomas Henry carried them—these are the flowers—I bought them; there were three dozen and one bunches—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a bunch for them, 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I paid it to William Henry—Thomas Henry was present, and took the empty box away—I saw William Henry again the same evening; he came to my stall for the remainder of the money—I had not paid him all—I had not got the money; he said he wanted some, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the moment I got the flowers I put them out on my stall, and when William Henry came in the evening he said, "I would not put them out for a day or two"—he did not state any reason for that—he went away with the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had known the prisoners for four years—I have bought things of them; they are both dealers in this sort of goods.</p>

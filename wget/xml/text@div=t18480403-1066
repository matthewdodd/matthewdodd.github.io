                  </hi> I am a stationer, in King-street, St. Luke's. On Satur<lb></lb>day evening, 1st April, about eight, or half-past eight o'clock, I saw the prisoners in company in Henry-street, St. Luke's—I knew them before, and watched them—they went down Henry-street, and were in conversation together—they passed Mr. Cole's oil-shop, and William Chick, the father, looked into the shop—they then talked together, and I saw William give something to Francis—I could not see what—they them separated, and Francis returned to Mr. Coles'—William was then about twenty yards off, and just turned a corner, out of sight of the shop—I followed Francis into Mr. Cole's, and heard him call for a quarter of a pound of soap—he put down a shilling—I said Morgan, the shopman, "Look at that shilling"—he looked, and found it was bad—he told the boy so—he said his father gave it him, and he would go an fetch another one—I took him out, and was going home with him—he gave his address, in Anchor-yard—I got half-way up the yard with him, when I thought I had better take him to the station, which I did—I gave the shilling to Brannan—Morgan had returned it to the boy, and I took it out of his hand—I went with Brannan, and another officer, and pointed out William Chick, standing in Old-street, about 200 yards from the shop—I said, "That is the man that was with the boy before"—he said, "What is the matter?"—I saw him draw his hand out of his trowsers' pocket, and put it behind him—the officer seized it, and took a box out of it—he said he had found it.</p>

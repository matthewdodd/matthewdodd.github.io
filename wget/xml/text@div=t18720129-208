I am a launderer, of 37, Church Street—the prisoner was stopping at my house—on the eve of Christmas-day my coat was lying on a table, with this post letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the pocket—I missed it from my pocket—the prisoner left my house that night, without telling me he was going—he returned eight days afterwards—he is a countryman of mine, who had no work, and I boarded and lodged him, and treated him like a brother—we were all <hi rend="italic">lance</hi> on Christmas-eve—he worked very well all the time he was in the house.</p>

I live at 7, Princes Street, Leicester Square—on Christmas-night the prisoner came to me, and asked me if I would do him a favour by cashing this order—the name of the payee was not on it then, but he wrote the name of Willow on it, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took it to the post-office next day, and found that it was stopped—I kept it a week, and then somebody brought me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I returned it to Mr. Willow.</p>

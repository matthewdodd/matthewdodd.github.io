I am in partnership with my brother, the last witness, and assisted him—on 10th December, 1866, I had a conversation with Mr. Pappa in relation to some of these shares—I made a memorandum of that conversation on 11th December, 1866—this is the original memorandum, signed by me at the time—I believe it correctly represents the conversation that occurred—this is the part that refers to the 20,000 shares (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I made some inquiries as to the allotment of shares to the Oriental and Com<lb></lb>mercial Bank Shareholders upon the formation of that company, by the amal<lb></lb>gamation of the Oriental Commercial Company, and the National Financial, and as to why sundry shares were placed in Mr. D. Kusthatiade's name, he having paid nothing for them; he, that is Pappa, informed me, that on the amalgamation 20,000 shares were set apart for the Oriental Commercial Shareholders by the Oriental Commercial Bank; but that some of those shares not being applied for he obtained the verbal consent of D. Eusthatiade to place the balance of shares in his name till an opportunity offered of disposing of them to genuine shareholders. He said the directors were aware that some of the shares were not applied for, and that they had been placed in a nominee's name, but did not think they knew in whose name they were placed. I had been previously given to understand that the shares in Eusthatiade's name belonged to the bank")—That was the memorandum I made at the time—(<hi rend="italic">At the request of</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">the re<lb></lb>mainder of the memorandum was subsequently read as follows:</hi> "Mr. Pappa then referred to the books and asked if there was not some little cause of un<lb></lb>easiness, and expressed his willingness and anxiety to give me any information as to anything which might not appear quite regular. He specially alluded to the commission taken by the Daily Finance Committee, which he said was not regular, and that he had protested when it was taken, stating the profits were not made, but that he was told he was only a manager, and to 'mind his own business' and attend to his directors' instructions. He wished me to bear in mind that he had previously mentioned this subject He also said he believed some of the committee knew they would have to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187005020043"></xptr>
               <p>refund. He then said if there was anything in any of the accounts, or in his own account, which he was sure was quite straightforward, that wanted explanation, he should be most happy to give it. I told him we were looking into several matters, and if we found anything we did not think proper, we should certainly require an explanation from whomever it was, and give an opportunity for such explanation, which, if not satisfactory, the matter would then be taken up by the solicitors. He wished particularly to be in<lb></lb>formed if we had any reason to complain of his not giving information, and I informed him I had always found him willing to do so. He said be thought there was some little feeling against him, that he was sometimes hasty in his expressions, and feared he might have given Mr. Johnson offence at some time by remarks about the Chancery proceedings, but expressed himself anxious to give every facility to any enquiry by giving all the in<lb></lb>formation he could.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the solicitors for the prosecution—I produce a statement which I took down while Mr. Pappa was speaking—it was taken in a hurry, and the original is very difficult to read now—I have bad it fair copied and can say it is correct—in the month of December, 1866, I was requested by Messrs. Upton and Johnson, the solicitors of liquidation, to peruse certain papers which they handed to me, and I then suggested that Mr. Pappa should be called upon to give explanation upon the matters contained in those papers—I first saw Mr. Pappa at the office of the liqui<lb></lb>dator, on the 14th January, 1867—he had no solicitor, and I recommended he should have one—at that time he said he would prefer to be with<lb></lb>out, and certain matters were gone into at that meeting not relating to the matters now in question—the next meeting was held on 21st January, and then Mr. Pappa was attended by a solicitor, Mr. Lewis, and all that took place then took place in the presence of Mr. Lewis, as well as myself—sometimes Mr. Pappa spoke, and sometimes Mr. Lewis—Mr. Lewis frequently said what I have taken down as Mr. Pappa's state<lb></lb>ment, but Mr. Pappa assented to its being taken as his statement—I think I can read it—the heading of it is "800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Fraser—other matters were re<lb></lb>ferred to, but this relates only to Mr. Eraser's. "This money was remitted to myself by the above gentleman, who had no connection with the bank, but was recommended to me by a Mr. Langford. The sum in question was at his request invested in shares, bought by me for him; but, as upon the day of the settlement I could not see Mr. Fraser, I gave my name for the shares, so that the shares passed to my name, and afterwards I gave in<lb></lb>structions to the registrar to take 160 shares from my own name and pass them to that of Mr. Fraser. The funds and accounts of the bank hate no concern with this matter. As far as I recollect, I signed a letter to Mr. Fraser, acknowledging the receipt of the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I presume that the regis<lb></lb>trar followed my instructions, but please give me the books; share and transfer registrar produced, folio 292, account of Mr. Fraser"—That book is here—this is the entry that was read: "Debtor, William Fraser, Weston-Super-Mare, gentleman, 1866, March 20th, to accounts due on re-allotment of 160 shares at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per share, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—There was another entry made subse<lb></lb>quently—there is no entry on the other side crediting the account with the receipt of the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—that is the only entry in that page—there is no credit—after reading the entry Mr. Pappa said: "I must here state that I was not the registrar, neither the book-keeper, so that I am not responsible for any mistake or omission in the book; I make this statement after seeing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187005020044"></xptr>
               <p>the entry from which is omitted the transfer of 160 shares from my name to his, which transfer I had given directions to the registrar to make, and to him I refer you in confirmation of my statement The date of this entry is the 20th March, 1866; I presume the date of this entry to be a mistake, as I received the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 23rd May, 1865." Then the share and transfer register, vol. 2, account of D. Pappa, 421 was produced—(<hi rend="italic">The book was produced</hi>)—I don't know that any particular item of this account was men<lb></lb>tioned—it was laid open before him, and he went on to speak, but I have no note at present that any particular entry upon this page was read—"In May, 1865, I had more than 3000 shares of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each"—I think the object of that was to see how many shares he had at that time, but nothing more took place—then the register of shareholders was produced, the book that you have had some discussion about—he very likely said "I ask for the register of shareholders, which is now produced"—I have only got "Regis<lb></lb>ter of shareholders produced" in the original, and then "I request to be shown by the clerk of the liquidator Mr. Eraser's name as a shareholder allotted shares of the bank"—substantially Mr. Pappa sometimes said "I ask for this or that"—the 20,000 shares was the portion of the register re<lb></lb>ferred to—it was open at that part where the allotment of the shares is to Eusthatiade—18,000 shares appear to be allotted to different persons—then the book being opened Mr. Pappa said "I request to be shown by the clerk of the liquidator Mr. Eraser's name as a shareholder allotted shares of the bank. Mr. Cooper says he does not find Mr. Eraser's name;" Mr. Pappa said "I also do not find the name in the book, and I say that if the 180 shares given to Mr. Eraser were the property of the bank, there will be an entry in the minute-book, allotting 160 shares to Mr. Eraser; I ask for the minute-book, and beg Mr. Cooper to find such an entry. Mr. Cooper says he does not see any minutes of any allotment by the bank to Mr. Eraser." Then Mr. Pappa goes on: "This fact of non-allotment by the bank shows that Mr. Eraser never had any allotment of shares made to him by the bank, and that some error has arisen in not having entered in the transfer ledger the transfer of 160 shares from my name unto that of Mr. Eraser; that error is not of my making, and I received the money from Mr. Eraser, believing that the transfer had been made as ordered by me, and I say that the money belonged to me and not to the bank; and I am willing to contest that question in any court of law, and deposit the money for that purpose"—the words "I say that the money belonged to me, and not to the Bank," I have marked here that Mr. Pappa did not say every word of that, but Mr. Lewis—Mr. Lewis said, "I am willing to contest the question"—Mr. Pappa said afterwards, I don't know whether it was at that meeting or not, "I adopt every word that Mr. Lewis has said, "or some<lb></lb>thing to that effect—"Mr. Cooper now produces another register of share-holders; I see an entry of the name of Eraser"—This is Mr. Eraser's account—"I see an entry of the name of Eraser as holder of 160 shares, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid, 18859 to 19018, dated 20th March. I say that if these numbers be not the numbers of my shares, it is the mistake of the registrar; the whole mistake being that he has not given certificates of my shares to Mr. Eraser as I directed him. The bank is answerable for his mistake, and I hold the bank responsible for the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if by law I am compelled to pay over that amount by reason of the error of the registrar of the bank. I now ask for the dividend warrant book, and I ask Mr. Cooper if there be any divi<lb></lb>dent warrant made out by the bank in favour of Mr. Eraser. He produces</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187005020045"></xptr>
               <p>a cheque on the Agra and Masterman's bank, dated 20th March, 1866, for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in favour of William Eraser, Esq., or order, signed by Mr. Clench and Mr. McKenna, two directors, and countersigned by me as managing director. The counterfoil is as follows: 'William Fraser, of Weaton-Super-Mare, for dividend from 28th May to 31st December, 1865, at 10 per cent, 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.' I say that the cheque so given to Mr. Fraser is-correctly paid to him as the holder of 160 shares, but owing to the error of the clerk, should have been paid in respect of 160 shares ordered by me to be transferred from my name to Mr. Fraser's. The apparent irregularity of this transaction arises solely from that error, and having thus been made the rest follows in the course of business, and was not discovered by me as I did not keep the books. If, therefore, my dividend was that amount in excess, I am responsible to pay it to the liquidator, as I told him some time since when this question was first mooted. I am now prepared to answer any questions which you, Mr. Mullens, wish to put on this item. Mr. Mullens replied that he does not wish to put any question now"—I did not do any business from August till the end of October, 1869—I was not out of town all that time.</p>

The 19th May, 1866, would be about the date that Pappa directed this to be written off as a bad debt, I cannot tell you from memory—I did not enter it on the same date—to the best of my recollection that was arranged between myself and Mr. Pappa a few days before the date I put—I gave them to the clerk to make the entry—no explanation was given of why this particular entry was to be written off as a bad debt—it was certainly not said that the shares which the broker had to deliver, representing that sum, were not worth the paper upon which they were written, or were worthless—no explanation was given of why it was to be written off, but I knew they were to be written off as a matter of course, became they should not stand against the person's account; they should be written off to profit and loss, and cleared off to eliminate the account.</p>

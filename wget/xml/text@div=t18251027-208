            . I am clerk in the offices of the King's Bench prison. The defendant Hughes was in our custody in January, 1823, and discharged under the Insolvent Act, on the 22d of January. Samuel Hay came in as prisoner, on the 25th of April last - he was never in our prison to my knowledge before, but is now in custody; he came in on the 26th of February last - I have an entry, on the 8th of November, 1819, of John Colyer coming in - he was discharged under the Insolvent Act on the 8th of June.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. You do not know how much Hay paid in the pound? A. No, I remember his person. Hughes came into custody on the 27th of January last, and was part of the time within the walls - he is in custody now for an attachment for payment of costs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Whether the Colyer you mention is the defendant you do not know? A. No.</p>

            , of No. 8, Bridge-place, Harrow-road - I am a milk-woman. About the end of 1822 Hay and his wife lodged with me - I understood from them that they came from Lisson Street - my husband was employed by Hay to cart some goods and was never paid - the debt was about 30 l. - they were not in good circumstances - they had two rooms in my house; his child died while they were in my house, and I believe was buried by the parish. Mrs. Hay then washed for gentlemen's families, and employed women to wash for her. I believe she had a very good house and furniture in Lisson-street - she had a very good bed when she came to my house; she told me she had lost her goods in Lisson-street, and laid on shavings - they were certainly in distressed circumstances.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You understood she had a good house in Lisson-street? A. I understood, that by her husband becoming a bankrupt, she had lost her goods. I believe she only slept on shavings a few nights as a neighbour took her in - I know they asked for the parish ground to bury the child - they would not let her have it unless she had a parish coffin - the fees are high in Paddington parish. I know that Hay was building some houses in Park-place.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Was it while he was building that he became a bankrupt? A. He began building before his bankruptcy, and went on afterwards with assistance.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is your debt still unpaid? A. We received a dividend three years ago - I do not know how much it was. He has honourably paid me a milk bill of 6 l. incurred since the bankruptcy; it had been running when they were in distress, for six or seven months or more.</p>

            . I know Hughes - our acquaintance commenced in 1822 or 1823, in the King'-bench prison. I had been a prisoner, and was a messenger there, and at times waited upon him - I attended him the same year when he was in Whitecross-street prison, and wrote occasionally for him. I remember his living in Exmouth-street, Clerkenwell - he professed to be an auctioneer, but I never knew him do business as such - he was arrested there, and came into Whitecross-street prison - Hay frequently visited him there. After Hughes was discharged from Whitecross-street, he occupied Mrs. Bruce's cottage at Highgate, which was furnished - he was acquainted with one Bullen and his wife - Bullen and Hughes told me they could always have whatever they ordered there, just what they wanted he could have by sending for, for their firm was good. Bullen told me there was a table lamp sent there directed for - Bullen, Esq. which Hay took to his own house - I gave Mrs. Bruce possession of the cottage myself afterwards, as she came in, and said, she would not leave till she had possession. I gave her the keys, the furniture was pawned, but we got them back from the different pawnbrokers; they inhabited the cottage above half a year - Hughes went with me to get the goods out of pawn, and sent me to the cottage with them; he then lodged at Mr. Bowers', Clarendon-street, Somer's-town - Hays introduced him there, Charlotte Watts lived with him there as Mrs. Hughes; he got possession of a house in Speldhurst-street the latter end of November last - Bullen and his wife were there at first - Collyer and his wife came afterwards - it was repaired and opened for business - there was no furniture, only goods, except a few chairs, a deal table, and two French bedsteads. I was porter there - Hughes agreed to give me 18 s. a week - I was not paid - he at times gave me 5 s. on a Saturday night, to take home to a wife and six children, and sometimes 10 s. - he knew what family I had. When he opened the shop he wrote to me to come; I was there the first morning it was opened, and the first thing I did was to pawn a piece of silk by his direction - he said he meant to act with honour and pay me what he owed, which was then above 22 l. About a fortnight or three weeks after this he explained how the business was to be conducted - he said he thought he should be able to make a good thing of it, if he could only run about six months - he thought he should do very well - he should get plenty of goods as he had a good backer in Mr. Hay; he knew, with the backers he had got, nobody could get over him - that he hoped I would stick true to him, and not deceive him - that I would go to none of his creditors and expose him - he said, "I expect money from the country, and shall be able to recover myself - you are to take goods to different pawnbrokers and pawn them." I took out goods to the sale shops, and took some to Mr. Bullock's, in Holborn, three or four times. On a Saturday night I took some flannels and blankets in a truck there - he said he wanted money, as he had made an appointment with a warehouseman in the City to pay some money at six o'clock that evening, and should not wish to disappoint him, or he should not keep him sweet, and told me to take them to Mr. Bullock, who was to advance money on them. I took them and brought a cheque, for I think 10 l. - he abused me for bringing a cheque, saying, "I know if I take this into the City I shall be spoiled at once, they will know it is from a saleroom, and the name of Bullock will spoil me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was to be done at the end of six months? - A. He said he meant to get all he possibly could, and then turn bankrupt - that he should never take the benefit of the act again; he said Mr. Hay would strike the docket, and they would work the commission, and then all might go to the devil.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you to have for being so useful? A. Why, he arrested me after I was summoned before the Commissioners, and gave me eight months in Whitecross-street prison for it; he had promised to send me a quantity of broad-cloth, drugget and Irish linens, lawn, ribbons, &amp;c. I used to pawn goods for 5 l., 8 l., 6 l., - and sometimes only 4 s. or 5 s. I pawned most of them with Hall, of Mary-le-bone-street; the cloths were taken in rolls as they came, the other things were all torn off into dress lengths. He said he was short, and wanted to pawn to raise himself a bit - and when he had some cambrick, he tore off a piece and said, "If this will do, I think I can make it answer. I can get a good many of these" but they would not advance much on them.</p>
               <p>Q. When pawning did not answer, what was the next plan? A. He said "Now we will try the auction-rooms, and see what they will do." We sent a lot of flannels into Bullock's to see what they would fetch - there were a good many goods sent there - I attended the sale, and put down what they fetched. When I returned I said, I did not think they had sold well. He said, "O yes, they have - this will do very well." He said he should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270092"></xptr>be able to get more, and it was better to send to the sale rooms than to the pawnbrokers. Mrs. Bullen went to pick out the goods which she thought would suit for pawning, and she pawned a good many herself, and told me the best shops to go to, to get the most for them. Hughes was present in the shop when she said the best pawnbrokers were at Islington - Hughes said, "That will do - Mrs. Bullen knows the pawnbroker's better than you do." Hughes was arrested in January last. Charlotte Watts came out of the room and said Mr. Hughes was arrested, and told me to get down a piece of superfine woollen cloth, and raise some money for him. I did so - and took it to him, at Mr. Hughes' lock-up-house, in Cursitor-street - it was 4 l. or 5 l. He said, "I shall soon be out of this, and we shall make the thing right." - Charlotte Watts attended the shop as mistress, and went by the name of Mrs. Hughes - she managed the shop when he was absent, and while he was in custody she began to move the goods from the shop. I saw Hay at the lock-up-house, he told Hughes it was a bad job, and they must make the best of it. Hughes said, he should make it all right again. Hay seemed to be doubtful of it - but said "Never mind, we will push it all on as far as we can." I saw Brewer at the lock-up-house, he was employed to get Hughes out of this mess - he called Hughes Tom, and said what they wanted he could do, but did not care what it was, so long as he could have money. Hughes said,</p>
               <p>"I know you are the man who can do it, if any body can;" he said he was afraid the creditors would come and take all the goods. Brewer said he would go and stop that - he would go to the house to Charlotte Watts, and make all things right - he was a prisoner in Whitecross-street when Hughes was there. Bullen, who occupied a room with Hughes there, is the person who is indicted. I have seen Brewer and Hughes together frequently in Speldhurst-street, he was particularly acquainted with Hughes, and did a good deal of writing in the back parlour. I know Colyer accepted bills for Hughes, for I took a lot to his house once, and brought them back accepted. Colyer said, "I am afraid we shall all be done together - but we may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb - and so here goes," and then wrote his name - this was at his own house at Paddington. The bills were drawn by Hughes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he meant by being all done together? A. He said he had an execution then hanging over his head; it was on the very day Hughes was arrested that he accepted these bills, early in January - Mr. and Mrs. Bullen and Charlotte Watts have pawned goods. Mrs. Bullen attended daily at Speldhurst-street; Henry Hughes and Co. was over the door - his real name is Thomas; I know no Henry Hughes, nor any company except the persons indicted; very few goods were sold in the shop - a great many bales and parcels of different sorts came in; they were chiefly pawned or sold at sale-rooms. I found a good many goods on the premises when I went, and they continued to come in. The chief part were pawned, or sold at sales - the shop was kept open about ten weeks - a good many goods came in while Hughes was in the lock-up-house; they had been ordered by him; particularly one lot of hosiery, from Mr. Brown's, of Goldsmith-street, Wood-street. I took a letter from Hughes at the lock-up-house, to Brown, to order them - they were brought afterwards to the lock-up-house - there were a great many in parcels of twelve pairs each; I should think more than fifty dozen: I left them in Hughes' possession. I have taken flannels to Bullock's two or three times. When he was arrested the goods remaining in the shop were taken to No. 17, Draper's-place, Burton-crescent, to a lodging which Mrs. Bullen took; she and her daughter assisted me in moving them - there was a great quantity. I have seen her take coach loads of goods from Draper's-place; she said her motive for taking them to her lodging was, that we might take them away in coach loads at a time, so that the neighbours should not notice what was being moved. What became of them I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever a brick-maker? A. Never - either as master or servant. I never lived at Kilburn, or at No. 22, Oxford-street, or kept any account there. A man named Cash or Case lived there, but I did not know him. I know Hughes' hand-writing; he writes two or three different hands. I know Colyer's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand-writing is this bill? (looking at it) A. This is Hughes'; the acceptance is mine: it is for 14 l. 6 s. - here is a 20 l. bill: it is drawn by Hughes; the acceptance is Colyer's: here is another 20 l. bill - the same drawer and acceptor. Here is a letter addressed to me, dated, the 19th of November, but without the year, but it was 1824, for it was then I accepted the bill; it is Hughes' writing; here is another letter, dated the 7th of December, 1824, and another, the 3d of January, both in Hughes' writing: here is another of Hughes' writing, addressed to Messrs. Gilman and Co., Newgate-street. My acceptance is dated the 6th of November, 1824; I lived in Kent-street, Borough, at that time, and kept a marine-store shop, and had lived there three years - he persuaded me to accept the bill; he said he should do good for me, by sending me goods; I became his porter after I accepted the bill; he told me he would take a house for me in Somer's-town, and send me in goods to cover me. (Looking at a bill for 28 l. 11 s.) - this is drawn by Hughes, at three months - I will not swear to the acceptance; it is dated the 23d of December, 1824. (Looking at another bill) - this is accepted, "Hughes and Co." I firmly believe the acceptance to be Charlotte Watts' writing - it is drawn by Brown, and dated the 4th of January, 1825; here is a letter attached to it, which is Watts' hand-writing I believe, but will not speak positively to it - I have often seen her write in the shop books. Here is a bill for 29 l. 10 s., dated the 1st of January, 1825 - it is drawn by Hughes, in his writing, and accepted by Colyer; here is another bill, for 35 l. 13 s., drawn by Messrs. Jones and Williams - the acceptance is Hughes' writing. This letter, dated December, 1824, is Hughes' writing; here is a bill for 95 l. 7 s., drawn by Griffin and Co., by procuration of Rose; the acceptance is "H. Hughes and Co.," in Hughes' writing. This bill, for 18 l. 18 s. is drawn "Hughes and Co.," in Hughes' writing - the acceptance is mine; I was his porter at that time; it is addressed to me, as a haberdasher, at No. 27, Union-street, Somer's-town; I lived there then, but kept no haberdasher's shop - one had been taken there for me, but I never had any goods, but 6 l. worth, and never opened. I gave the goods up to the assignees.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270093"></xptr>I told him I would accept no more bills, as I had not value; he said if I did not accept this he would arrest me for the one I had accepted, which Messrs. Gilman and Lucas had. I accepted three bills in all, and never had value for any of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You do not know yourself of goods being moved from the house at Highgate? A. I took them out of pawn, and Hughes told me he had brought them up, and pawned them himself; he went with me to redeem them. I was not present when the house in Speldhurst-street was taken; I had been on the premises several times before the shop was opened. I do not know when it was taken; I lived at Somer's-town when I was his porter.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave no information about this business till Hughes brought an action against you? A. I was summoned before the Commissioners, and he arrested me next day. I gave information to the attorney before I was arrested; it was after Hughes' arrest. I never said I would ruin him. I know Samuel Wood - I do not know Wilson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say to either of them that you would swear any thing to hang Hughes, or Hay, if you were transported for it? A. I never used that expression - I do not recollect what passed - I know Wood came to me as a spy - I cannot say what passed, but I never said I would ruin Hughes, or hang him, nor any thing like it - I said nothing about transportation. I took the benefit of the Insolvent Act in 1822. I accepted no bills for any other persons - I do not know the amount of the bills - he said he would take them up and send me goods to cover me. I did not think him responsible, but expected the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought goods were goods, come from where they might? A. I said, why if they came to that shop and found it empty, what would they say - he said "Oh. they won't come to inquire after you; they will take my word. I knew the goods were not paid for; I would not have accepted the bills if he had not said he would pay them. I certainly expected he would pay for the goods he bought; I believed, at the time, he would act with honour to all his creditors.</p>
               <p>Q. You really believed he was going to pay them? A. I thought he might recover himself, but soon found out, by his conversation, that he meant to pay nobody. I accepted the last bill through fear. I at first thought he wished to establish a trade.</p>
               <p>Q. The circumstances at Highgate did not raise your suspicion? A. I did not like the Highgate concern, but he said he would get into a concern, and pay every one - I thought he might reform - he left Highgate three or four weeks before he set up in Speldhurst-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that in Whitecross-street you wrote for him? A. Never; I never could write - I wrote my name. I gave up my business in Kent-street, as he promised to start me with about 50 l. worth of goods - I knew he had no money, but I thought his guarantee might do - he always gammoned me about paying me my money but arrested me instead.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, at times, you met with a windfall out of the shop yourself? A. No, by G - d, they took care of that - they always had the duplicates and money. He was declared a bankrupt on the 4th, and arrested me on the 5th; I was two or three weeks in his service before I went to Bullock's - he said I was his servant, and must do as he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this bill - is it not one of their shop bills? A. Yes, it says</p>
               <p>"Bought of Hughes and Co." but over the door is "Henry Hughes and Co.;" Hay bailed Hughes out of prison - I have seen him in Whitecross-street several times, with Hughes - he might be there a dozen of times and I not notice him - I have seen him there more than once, in No. 8 Ward, but cannot say how often - I will swear I have seen him twice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. How long have you known Colyer. A. Not long, I first saw him in November or December, I think - I have seen him at his own house and in Speldhurst-street - he accepted the bills on the 3d of January - I saw him accept them at his own house in a back room - I cannot speak to these bills being the same as I took (looking at one); this is accepted</p>
               <p>"John Colyer;" I will not swear to the hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you know his hand-writing? A. I know the bills I had before to be his hand-writing; but whether he can write two or three hands, as Hughes does, I cannot say. I took the bills to him in a letter - Hay did not go with me - I recollect the circumstance very well, for Hughes sent me for the stamps, and when I brought the change he said "Well, they have done themselves - they have given you sixpence too much," and I thought he might have given me that sixpence. I did not represent to Colyer that Hughes was a respectable man - he knew him as well as I did - I never bailed Hughes.</p>

            . I am a solicitor. The defendant Hughes is the person against whom a commission of bankruptcy was issued, which I produce - It is dated the 4th of February, 1825 - the last examination of the bankrupt states, that he had once been a bankrupt before, and twice taken the benefit of the Insolvent Act - it is signed by the bankrupt and the Commissioners; the whole valuation of goods is 99 l. 8 s. 6 d. - the amount of debts due by him to his creditors is 1031 l. 18 s. 1 d. - he was present at the meeting of the creditors.</p>

            . I am a partner in the firm of Welch, Gregory and Cubit, No. 3, Skinner-street, City. The defendant came into our warehouse, and introduced himself about the 4th of last November; there were occasional servants in the warehouse, and he was referred to me; he stated himself to be Henry Hughes, a surveyor and auctioneer; that his wife was on the point of opening a shop in Speldhurst-street, Burton-crescent, in the haberdashery line - I observed that it was necessary a confidence should be established between us previous to our entrusting him, - he then gave me a reference to George William Case, No. 22, Oxford-street; this is his writing in my memorandum book - I then made a memorandum myself of another person to whom he referred, a Mr. Stock, No. 15 Cannon-street, St. George's in the east, but we did not apply to him. The prisoner said he should want Leghorn hats, flowers, feathers, and other things connected with the millinery business; he came again, alone, I think, two days afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270094"></xptr>I stated to him that the reference was not satisfactory, and as a tradesman I could not open an account with him; he then stated he had a friend, Mr. Hay, a builder, and a man of property, who felt particularly interested in his wellfare; and he had no doubt, upon application, he would give us security to the amount of 50 l or 60 l. The following day he came with Mr. Hay, (the defendant, I think) and Charlotte Watts, who represented herself as Mrs. Hughes; Hay, myself, and Hughes, went into the counting-house together, and Watts remained in the shop; when we were in the counting-house Hay gave us a guarantee to the amount of 50 l.; this is the paper: -(Read.) -</p>
               <p>Messrs. WELCH, GREGORY, ANE CUBIT -</p>
               <p>In consequence of your giving credit, in the way of your trade, to Mr. Henry Hughes, of Speldhurst-street, I hereby guarantee to you the payment of the remaining balance of his accounts, from time to time, not exceeding 50 l.</p>
               <p>In consequence of this we gave Hughes credit; and the person calling herself Mrs. Hughes looked out goods to the amount of 52 l., or 53 l.; which were sent the same evening; we had further dealing with Hughes in consequence of a letter which we received three or four days afterwards, containing an order for more goods, and a bill of exchange for 28 l. 11 s., dated the 23d of December 1824; drawn by Hughes, and Co., at three months after date, and accepted, "John Colyer, Builder, No. 2, North Wharf-road, Paddington." Our clerk took means to find the acceptor; but it was never paid. The whole amount of the goods the defendant had, was 65 l. 7 s. 3 d.; for which we have never received a single farthing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did not Mr. Hay give you the guarantee at once? A. Yes; we have not sued upon it - our account would have become due, by an acceptance at two months, at Lady-day last - we have made no demand for payment on Mr. Hay.</p>

            . I live in Skinner-street, Snow-hill. In November last the defendant applied at my house, and stated that he was about to commence business in the milinery and haberdashery line, and he should want some goods of me; I said I should require references, and if all was right, I should have no objection; he said he could give undeniable references; he could bring a person of property, who was a builder, and had several houses, who would give me a guarantee to the amount of 100 l. I said I should like to see him, and make inquiries respecting him; the next day he brought this person with him to the counting-house, who represented himself as Mr. Hay. I asked him a few questions, and he signed this guarantee. I mentioned the circumstance to my head clerk, Mr. Rowe, and in about an hour we let the defendant have some goods. Watts, who represented herself as Mrs. Hughes, went with them up to the silk warehouse, and took goods to the amount of 95 l.; we drew a bill for it, but not one farthing of it has ever been paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did Hay say any thing? A. No, he only signed this paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hay give you any reference as it respected himself? A. Yes, to a banker somewhere near Charing-Cross; our goods should have been paid for in three months; I do not know on what day he called - it was in November; I have never called on Mr. Hay in consequence of this guarantee - I never saw him after he was in my warehouse.</p>

            , of Newgate-street. We are lace-dealers; I know the defendant; Hughes. In the month of November last, I think from the 17th to the 19th, he applied to me personally, and said he wished to open an account with us, for some particular description of goods, stating, at the same time, that he had bought some silk goods at the house of Griffin - and a person of the name of Hay had given a guarantee to that house, to the amount of 100 l., and that he intended to give us a guarantee to the same amount. He represented himself as a surveyor, and said he did not know anything at all about the business himself, but his wife would call and look out the goods the next day. I asked how it was that this gentleman had come forward in so liberal a way, to give so many guarantees. He explained that he himself was a surveyor, and Hay was a builder. I informed him, that if he opened an account with us, independent of the guarantee, I should expect part of the account to be paid in cash. He then said, being a surveyor, he was in the habit of drawing upon different builders, and, if I had no objection, he would give me these bills instead of my drawing upon him - I agreed. He paid 10 l. in cash, and remarked, at the same time, that he had a bill of about 14 l., if I had no objection to take it - it was sent to us in a letter. We sent goods to Mr. Hughes at that time, and afterwards to the amount of 170 l. I do not recollect how many went at first. This is the bill I received by the post -(read.)</p>
               <p>This was Moody's acceptance, at two months, for 14 l. 6 s. I never received any part of the money for this Bill. He called again, and ordered more goods - I should think within a few weeks. I do not recollect what took place upon that second call, but I remember his once desiring a particular description of goods, on which he wished to have an extension of credit; I believe there were two bills received, but I cannot be positive. I think we have been paid on his account about 50 l., and the balance now due is about 130 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Then he paid you various sums? A. Yes, I should think till within two months of his bankruptcy - I do not know when his commission took place. I was in the country in February and March. I cannot tell whether we received anything in January. I think the 50 l. was received in small sums, of about 10 l. each.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it required that money should be paid on the sending out of goods? A. A certain amount was to be paid the first, and second times; there was not in any case an agreement that any part of the money should be paid before the goods were delivered. I saw Mr. Hay, when he brought the guarantee, and I think the defendant is that gentleman - I have not seen him for twelve months, but, to the best of my belief, this is the same person. We afterwards endeavoured to find out Mr. Hay, but I did not go myself; I believe I have not seen him since the time of the guarantee, except on a trial at Westminster - he was pointed out to me then.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270095"></xptr>HUGHES. Q. Are you not assignee to the estate? A. My partner is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not I bring an action against you for suing out a fictitious commission? A. He did; this indictment was preferred by my partner; but I think I can venture to say it never was thought of till the prisoner brought his action - I cannot any how long it was before the bill was preferred - I cannot say whether he paid me 30 l. in cash after the last goods were sent in - he paid something, but I do not know the amount - I think the bills of parcels and receipts were made out in the name of Henry Hughes and Co. - I never knew them by any other name - I knew nothing respecting a Thomas Hughes. When they applied to us, on the 21st of June last, I have heard the defendant had offered a warrant of attorney, but I was out of town at the time - when he brought his action the verdict was in our favour - I was not present, at the trial - I think I have heard my partner say 50 l. has been received from their estate, the produce of the property on the premises - our house is very largely out of pocket by this transaction - there was a petition before the Lord Chancellor - instructions were given to our solicitor to prefer this indictment, and the Society for the Protection of Trade afterwards took it up.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Gillman, Lucas, and Co. - some dealings took place between Hughes and them - I was sent about a guarantee - I did not see Hughes at that time; he was not at home - I left the guarantee with his wife, with a particular charge that it should be signed and sent to the warehouse by the two penny post, if there were no other conveyance - I saw it, bearing the name of Hay - it was produced in the Common Pleas, but not by me - I have not seen Mr. Hay since to converse with him - I have seen this bill, drawn on Moody - it came due on a Sunday, and I made inquiries about it on Monday, the 10th of January, at No. 22, Oxford-street - I think it was a fancy jewellers - he was a new comer, and referred me to a person named Cave, who had occupied the house previously - I found him in Hand-court, Soho - he is a manufacturer of fringes and bed lace - he professed to know nothing of the parties; I went several times to Kilburn, but could find no such person known there; I inquired at every shop and public-house in the village, and among the brickmakers; I went to Speldhurst-street, and saw Miss Watts; supposing her to be Mrs. Hughes, I informed her of what I had been about, and that I could find no such parties; I directed her to inform Mr. Hughes of it; she said Mr. Hughes was at Chichester upon auctioneering business, or it might have been Colchester or Winchester; she said she supposed we were aware that he was concerned in that business, or words to that effect; I asked whether he had taken any part of his own stock with him; she said No; I said this from the appearance of the stock; I had been there repeatedly on application for money, and used to see Mrs. Hughes, as she was called, or sometimes Mr. Hughes; I have seen another person there, but I cannot say who; I asked Miss Watts where I might find Mr. Moody; she said she knew no more of him than the address upon the bill; she appeared rather confused, and expressed her surprise that the bill had not been taken up, and said she would send immediately for Mr. Hay, Mr. Hughes' friend, and he would take it up; I was present when Colyer came to our house; I have spoken to him repeatedly in the King's Bench; I cannot say when, but it was some time after the warrant; I conversed with him about the transaction, and he wished my employers to withdraw, or something of that, to give him liberty to support his family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you see Mr. Hay in this business? A. Yes, repeatedly, at his house; but I did not see him at the commencement of the business.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Had you, at any time, any conversation with Hay? A. Yes, I was in the counting-house when Hay and another person, who might be Colyer, were there, but I cannot say what passed; the account of Hughes and Co. was then open in the ledger; I never saw him write.</p>

            , who is a quaker. The defendant Hughes bought goods of him to the amount of 114 l. - flannels, baize, and other things - our warehouse is in Mumford-court, Milk-street - I was on a journey at the time, but when I returned, I applied at Speldhurst-street for the money several times but could never see him - it was about the 6th of January, I saw Watts, whom I understood to be Mrs. Hughes, and always got promises, sometimes she said he was at Highgate, sometimes at Hackney - I said I would wait upon him at any time, night or day, if he would appoint a time, but never could get an appointment. I called forty or fifty times, he was always gone somewhere. I said it was very strange - she said his business was of that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270096"></xptr>nature he was continually out - my master has not received a farthing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HUGHES. Q. Is this your bill of parcels? A. Yes, our regular credit is three months, two and a half per cent. off - the month they are bought in and the month they are due makes five.</p>
               <p>Q. You called for money not due? A. I understood you were going to pay some on account, and went for it, the credit would expire on the 30th of April. I recollect once seeing Hughes at the warehouse with Colyer and Hay.</p>

We received some bills from Hughes - I think we had one on Colyer. A person once came with Hay and Hughes; I think it was Colyer, but am not certain - the amount of the debt is about 150 l. - 10 l. in cash was paid a few days after - he had the goods and a bill on Colyer which is not paid; I and Hays, guarantee.</p>

            . I am in the woollen trade, in partnership with Mr. Williams. On the 8th of December, I was in Mr. Stack's warehouse in Cheapside, and saw Hughes there - I was introduced to him, and solicited him to buy goods of me - our warehouse is in Wood-street; he said he did not want any thing in my way as he bought every thing he wanted of Mr. Fossick. I went home, and he came into my warehouse in two or three hours and bought a few flannels amounting to 8 l. 9 s. - he did not pay for them. On the 14th he gave me another order, amounting to 15 l. 15 s. 6 d., and bought another parcel which came to 11 l. 8 s. 8 d. On the 17th he gave me a guarantee for the amount. I drew a bill on him for 35 l. 13 s., dated the 1st of January, sent it for acceptance, and received it back accepted, as it is now, this is it (looking at it.) About the end of January, or beginning of February, I saw Hay and spoke to him about the guarantee; he said he would take it up in the course of a week or so; it has never been paid. Hughes bought goods very easily, which roused my suspicion - I advanced ten or fifteen per cent. the second time and he made no objection.</p>
               <p>A guarantee from Hay to the witness for 100 l. was here read.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. The last time you saw Hay was when this conversation took place about the guarantee? A. I saw him at no other time - I shewed him the guarantee - he said the signature was his writing. I saw him afterwards at the King's-bench; he said he expected to receive some hundreds of pounds in a week or two, and then he would take it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HUGHES. Q. Did you not write to me, stating that you should like to be placed on the same footing as Mr. Fossick? A. I wrote for a guarantee - I drew at three months for my goods - the bill would be due on the 4th of April. I remember calling on the 4th of February and asking for money, none was due, and I asked for goods but was not aware that a docket was struck against him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Look at this bill and two letters, did you receive them from Hughes? A. I did, I had reasons for not crediting them further. (Read).</p>
               <p>The first, letter stated, that the guarantee of Mr. Hay was enclosed - the second enclosed the bill of 35 l., and stated that they should send a guarantee for 35 l. and withdraw the one for 100 l. - also wishing to know why the goods ordered were not sent.</p>

            . I am a flannel-draper, and live in May's-buildings, St. Martin's-lane. On the 25th of January one Evans called, and left an order with my wife, in consequence of which I sent to Mr. Hughes, in Speldhurst-street, some flannel, by Jones my porter, and next day I took some myself. I went with the goods the first day, and saw Hughes - he asked the price which I named; he said they were rather too high. I asked if he meant to pay money, or credit; he said it was no object to him so that the price was low in proportion - they came to about 25 l., he paid 5 l., and wished to see some of a finer quality. I took some, he was not at home - I asked Watts what time he would be in; she said probably I could not see him that night, but in the morning I might. I called in the evening, and left a fine piece of flannel - called again in the morning, saw Hughes, and agreed for it. He said they came to more than he had got, but he had a good bill, which he paid me - this is the same date and amount, (a bill on Colyer for 29 l. 10 s.); he said where Colyer lived, and lent me the bill, or a copy of it to make inquiry; he said he was a timber merchant, and builder, at Paddington. I went to inquire, leaving the flannel to abide the event of my inquiry. I was not satisfied, they told me not to trust Colyer. I returned the same evening, and saw Mrs. Watts; she said the flannels were gone to a master tailor, who was likely to keep one or more of them, and I if would take the bill (my account was 43 l. 10 s.) I should have the balance money next day. I took the balance, which was 13 l., there was a bad sovereign among it. I was induced to give her a receipt for the 13 l., and to make a memorandum of the bill I had received. I came out and met Mr. Miller, and in consequence of what he said, I went next morning to Bullock's auction-room, Holborn, and saw my flannels there; they were put up to auction on Saturday, and I bought them in for 30 l. odd, which was 13 l. less than what I sold them for. I went on Friday evening before the sale, and saw Mrs. Watts at Speldhurst-street, and asked her for the money for the bill and bad sovereign; she said I had been exposing her, and if I did not get out of the house, she would send for an officer; she said Mr. Hughes was out. I looked through the glass-door, and saw him in the parlour, and said so; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270097"></xptr>then threatened me with an officer - I then offered to take 10 l. for the 29 l. bill; they would give me nothing, but told me to wait until it became due. As I came out of the auction-room I saw Hughes, and told him I had bought my own flannels back again; he said that could not be, it was my mistake. I said, I had marks on them; he went in and said, "You have not bought them under what I gave for them." I said, I had. He said - "Well Mr. Bullock must abide by it, if he has sold them for less." I then offered him the 29 l. 10 s. bill for them; he would not take it, but flew off. I paid Mr. Bullock for them: I sold the bill for 5 l. to Messrs. Gilman and Co.: this is it, (looking at it) reads.</p>

            . I keep auction-rooms in Holborn, In January last, I remember some flannels coming to my room, in the name of Hughes, in Spelderhurst-street; they were sold to Morris; there was a reserved price on them; they were sold rather under it; I do not remember what the reserved price was; I made an advance on them before the sale; the balance (which was very trifling) was paid to Hughes' order; they came in two days before the sale.</p>
               <p>MR. SPENCER re-examined. I have now the book, by which I find that Bullen was committed on the 1st of August 1823, and was discharged on the 26th of August. He was in the room No. 8, with Hughes; Brewer was in No. 7; he came in after Hughes was discharged the first time - but the second time Hughes came, they were together, and Brewer was in No. 7.</p>

            . I lodged in the house in Speldhurst-street; my wife lodged there before we married. I had an opportunity in many instances of observing their conduct. I observed goods brought into the house in the day time and moved the same night; I suppose two-thirds of them went off in that way. I remember seeing the invoice of one parcel, which amounted to 95 l.; Mrs. Bullen was represented to me as the forewoman - Hughes was absent fourteen or twenty days in January; Watts managed the business then; she was called Mrs. Hughes, and told me he was gone to Chichester on business, (not to Chichester-rents), I followed some goods which were taken out to the house of Hurst, a sheriff's-officer, in Tooke's-court, Cursitor-street, and saw them taken in there. I have seen Brewer at Speldhurst-street, three or four times, and early on a Sunday morning; he has remained there during the day. I merely saw him come down stairs, and cannot say what he did there; I saw Morris there, and made a communication to put him on his guard.</p>
               <p>HUGHES. Q. How could you ascertain that the same goods which came in in the morning, went out at night? A. They were left in my wife's apartment - she received them, as nobody else was in the house, and in the evening some of them were removed out; this was before the shop was opened; I did not sleep in the house then; it was before my marriage. I cannot say that the goods were not brought back after the shop was opened - I do not believe they were. I visited there daily, and was married shortly after.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not frequently threatened to ruin me off the face of the face of the earth? A. Never; I never used an angry word to him, except once, when I found how business was conducted - I said I considered it my duty to inform his creditors: I supplied him with goods amounting to 20 l. - there were some bottle stands among them - you said they were highly approved of - I bought goods of him to the amount of 19 l. or 20 l. I did not go to the landlord to get him to distrain for rent. I was served with a notice of action for defamation of character, used by my wife, in January, but have heard no more of it.</p>

            . I am Mr. Miller's wife. Before we married I lodged in Hughes' house, in Speldhurst-street, before November last, before the shop was opened, and continued there till the end of January. Before the shop was opened, feathers, flowers, Leghorn hats, silks, and ribbons, were brought in - I called them over to the invoices myself, being alone in the house, I wished to see if they were correct before I received them - I think they came from Messrs. Gregory and Co.'s, Snow-hill, and from Mr. Griffith. When Hughes came to reside in the house, he told me he was an auctioneer, and had been married to Watts about six months - that he took the shop expressly for her, and if the produce was 500 l. a year, it was entirely for her use; goods were continually coming in, and were carried out by different persons, which I thought very strange - they were large packages, in boxes and paper parcels; some were carried out in the same way as they came in. I have seen Moody, and a man named Bullen, take them away - I used to receive written orders from Watts, before they resided there, to deliver goods to Smith, the servant - this continued after the shop opened - I have seen hackney coaches take large parcels away, and one evening saw a cart taking goods away. I think there was very little custom to the shop, but I had not much opportunity of observing. I did not notice as a spy - it was merely what came under my observation. Mrs. Bullen was employed in the shop very constantly - I have seen Mrs. Colyer several times there - I have seen Mrs. Hay at tea with Hughes, once or twice, and I believe the house was shewn to her. - Brewer was up and down in the house and breakfasted there once or twice. I may have seen him there three times.</p>
               <p>HUGHES. Q. Did I not say I took the goods to have them trimmed? A. Some were sent for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Two days before the shop was opened were not a number of boxes brought from my house? A. A number of boxes came in, but came from the City, for I received them - the servant certainly brought in, perhaps, a dozen bonnets trimmed.</p>
               <p>WATTS. Q. Have you not frequently told me you thought I had not a will of my own? A. I have no recollection of it; I may have said so.</p>

I lived in Hughes' service, at No. 43, Carrington-street, Somer's-town, before he went to Speldhurst-street - he occupied the front parlour, furnished;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270098"></xptr>Watts, who passed as Mrs. Hughes, lived with him; about a month before we went to Speldhurst-street he said, in my presence, that he had taken a house in Speldhurst-street, for his wife - that he was an auctioneer, and his wife was to be a haberdasher. Mr. Hay and Mr. Bullen visited him in Speldhurst-street, and sometimes their wives came with them. I have seen Colyer there, but not Brewer. I have seen Mr. Hay there, but not his wife; I went to the house in Speldhurst-street daily, before the shop opened; I heard that Hay and Colyer were both builders; they were talked to as builders. Hughes took the shop three weeks or a month before he went to live in it; Mrs. Miller lodged there when he took it; parcels used to come from the City, and I used to take them in; there were bonnets, hats, cloaks, and several parcels, which I did not open. I took two or three hats myself to Mr. Hunt, in Tooke's-court afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Hughes came into the house did all the goods remain there? A. I do not know. Mr. Hay, Mr. and Mrs. Colyer, Bullen, and Brewer visited them in Speldhurst-street; Brewer first came the beginning of January - I only saw Mrs. Hay there twice; Mrs. Bullen was frequently there, and while Hughes was in the spunging-house she lived there continually. A parcel of hosiery came in while he was in the spunging-house; and some flannel came from Morris'; some goods went away in coaches of a night. Jackson, an oilman, who lived at Paddington, used to take them away - Mr. and Mrs. Hughes used to give them to him - that happened once, and once some things went in a coach to the spunging-house; old Mrs. Hurst and Mrs. Hughes took them. I know the flannel went to the auction-room. Mrs. Bullen took a parcel of shawls to a pawnbroker's, in Skinner-street, Somer's-town - I was going out, and watched her; the parcel was large enough to contain six; I used to brush Hughes' clothes sometimes, and duplicates used to fall out of his pockets; I suppose one hundred fell out one morning after he left the spunging-house (he was there from the 3d to the 20th of January;) I saw Mr. Hay and Colyer visiting him at the spunging-house - Mr. Dimsdale came in, and asked Watts for Mr. Hughes, when he was at the spunging-house - she said he was gone to Chichester. A person once came to inquire the character of Mr. Bullen; Mrs. Hughes said he was a very respectable man down at Brighton, and his wife was a milliner there - Mrs. Bullen was present, and heard all this, and when the man was gone said she was very much obliged to Mrs. Hughes for giving Mr. Bullen that character. Mr. Brewer was at Speldhurst-street while Hughes was at the spunging-house, and after he came out Bullen was frequently there, writing, up stairs. Hughes was at home a week, and surrendered to prison on the 27th; Hay and Brewer were at the house during that week - no goods came in that week, but some were taken away by a Mr. Olive, a tailor, who lived in Old Cavendish-street; he took away a large quantity of cloth, and Hughes' brother took a small parcel; the goods looked much less in quantity than before I missed them, but did not know how they were gone; there was not much custom to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the 27th of January, when Hughes surrendered, and the 4th of February, when the messenger under the commission came, were any goods taken away? A. I took some myself to a coach with Mrs. Hughes; they were shop goods, as many as we could carry - there was broad-cloth among it; Brewer was not there when goods were being moved that I know of; I took a new ladies, cloak to Mrs. Colyer in that week, and Mrs. Bullen had some goods. Watts slept at the spunging-house, but came home every morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You never saw Mrs. Hay in Carrington-street? A. No, I saw her twice in Speldhurst-street. Mr. Hay was at Carrington-street two or three times a day - he was a carpenter and builder, and repaired the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. You took the cloak from the shop before the messenger came in? A. I took it in the morning, as he came at night. Mrs. Colyer told me to mind it was not for her - she did not say who it was for; I was told to take it to her from Mrs. Hughes. Watts had a sister living in North-street, Manchester-square, I believe. Colyer lived at a shabby house in Wharf-row, Paddington.</p>
               <p>HUGHES. Q. Did not you in the first three weeks in November take several large quantities of goods from Speldhurst-street to Clarendon-street? A. Yes, the bonnets were trimmed by Watts - I do not know what the others were taken for. I took the bonnets back, but nothing else. The landlord of the house in Clarendon-street kept a servant, named Maria - she assisted in moving a basket of childrens's bonnets and gentlemans's hats - the hats did not come from Spelder-street; a number of cloaks were moved - Maria helped me but once. I am positive Watts made up two or three caps in Clarendon-street. I took several band-boxes to Speldhurst-street - I do not know whether they contained bonnets or caps. I was told to deliver the cloak to Mrs. Colyer - nothing was said about Mrs. Young - I do not know her. I know nothing of Watts and Mrs. Miller quarreling; Mr. Hughes quarrelled with Mr. Miller.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard him say he would swear anything for 5 s.? A. Never; I never said I would injure you all I could, for not leaving me sufficient money, while the messenger was in possession. On the Sunday after the messenger came, I came to you at Agnes-place, St. George's-fields, but said nothing of the kind - I went to say I was going to a situation next day. Mrs. Hughes once sent me to Moody's for a blanket and pair of sheets - I did not get them then, but Mrs. Moody gave them to me on the following day - Moody was not at home the first time.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Hay continue his visits two or times a-day when the repairs were all over? A. Yes; I received such a character from Mrs. Hughes, as enabled me to get another place.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Hay call two or three times a-day in Clarendon-street or Speldhurst-street? A. In Clarendon-street; and he often called in Speldhurst-street - two or three times a week.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST addressed the Court on behalf of the defendant Hay, contending that, although he was now a prisoner in the King's Bench, and in difficulties, yet he was a man of property, and eventually he would be able to meet the guarantees which he had given, believing the business would be conducted honourably.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL addressed the Court on behalf of Colyer, whom he represented as having innocently accepted the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270099"></xptr>bills, and being altogether unconnected with the nature of the transactions at Speldhurst-street.</p>
               <p>HUGHES' Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury - Though placed in this degraded situation, you will find I have been more sinned against than I have sinned. Up to 1820 I was a man of very respectable connexions, at Cheltenham; but from loss in trade, and an illness of two years, I was never able to recover myself; and I was compelled to seek the benefit of the Insolvent Act in 1823, when I gave up property amounting to 15 s. in the pound. During the time I was in the King's Bench prison, my wife became acquainted with a man of the name of Chartris, a prisoner in that place; and in two months afterwards I was arrested by Chartris, on a pretended debt of 200 l., and thrown into Whitecross-street prison; and during that time he eloped with my wife and child, whom I have never seen since, and left me without a change of linen. I remained in prison till 1824, when I was released by the Insolvent Debtor's Act. In consequence of having obtained damages from Chartris. I had a conversation with some friends, and among the rest with Mr. Hay; who offered to advance the sum of 500 l., as soon as he could dispose of his houses in Park-place, Paddington. I then took the house in Speldhurst-street, Hay fitted it up for 100 l., which he agreed should remain for one or two years on my paying him the interest. I was promised several sums of money, in March and April, from my brother, who keeps an Hotel at Cheltenham. I paid for the fixtures of my house, and other sums of money; when I had not much left, and felt myself in dilemma. I called on Mr. Hay, who lent me cash at different times to the amount of 100 l. He put up several houses for sale, by Mr. Robins, and made up his mind to advance me the 500 l. I applied to several houses to purchase goods on the usual mercantile terms, and among the rest of the houses which have been mentioned. The credit was short; I was therefore compelled to make sacrifices to pay their money. I spoke to Mr. Lucas, who said he did not like to do more, till some more money was paid, and asked for a reference, which I gave to Mr. Case - this was about the 9th of November; I called the next day, and saw them, when they said they should require the guarantee. I applied to Mr. Hay, and after a great deal of trouble I did prevail on him to become a guarantee; I called on Messrs. Gillman and Co., and told them I had got a guarantee - they said they drew their own guarantees, and they would send it to him. On the 12th or 13th of November they did furnish a guarantee; I went there on the 15th of November, and Hay signed it, in the presence of Lucas, who said, "As you are a stranger, you will give us a reference," when he gave them a referrence to Messrs. Cox and Co., bankers, Charing-cross. I called again, and they said they did not like the reference of a banker, and they wished some other. I called on Mr. Hay, and he referred to a Mr. Rowley. They sent in the goods on the 19th of November; on the 18th I called on Messrs. Gillman and Co., who said they would send the goods, and wished to know when I would look them out - I called on the following morning, and Lucas said that as their credit was short, it would be better for me to pay in what money I could from time to time, and then I should make a good market. He asked if I could not give them some money then - I told them all the money I had was 10 l., which I paid them. On the 19th I told Watts to go and select some goods at their warehouse, which she did, and received memoranda like these; Hughes and Co. paid Gilman and Co. such a sum. One was in the shape of a note: "We have received 10 l. by bearer, for which we return you our thanks." I sent them five ten pounds between the 19th of November and the 30th of December. On the 3d of January, wishing to make my account as low as I could, knowing that Gilman and Co.'s account would be due on the 4th of February, I applied to John Colyer, a friend of Watts, to accommodate me with the loan of a few bills at two and three months, but I never had any connexion with him till the second week in December, and did not even know him personally for some time. In consequence of his knowing Watts he lent the bills; and I sent two of them, one at two months, and one at three months, to Gilman and Co., to place to my account. I was arrested by one Plaister for a sum of nearly 200 l., but I was discharged on Judge Littledale's order, that debt having been in my schedule; this was on the 3d of January; I was put into a lock-up-house, and my creditors all brought around me, in consequence of the wrong information which had been circulated. I remained there till the 21st. During the time I was there, they contrived to get two persons, of the name of Courtney and Kirk, to lodge a detainer against me for 14 l., which sum I was compelled to raise by sending goods to the auctioneer, and to raise the rent and taxes, to remove them from my dwelling-house. I continued in business till the 27th, when I was arrested on a writ of contempt from the Court of King's Bench. I was compelled to raise the money by sending the flannel to Bullock, and getting 25 l. upon it; I sent for the party, who refused to take it, unless I would pay an enormous sum of costs, which I would not. I was sent that night to the King's Bench prison; I got out by day rules, and exerted myself to pay the bill of Gilman and Co. on the 4th of February. On the 3d of February they struck a docket against me, and, on the following day, took possession of my goods. The assignees got a quantity of goods of other people, and placed them with mine, that I should not know which were mine and which theirs, which the catalogue will confirm. I felt happy that I never committed an act of bankruptcy. About three days after the commission had been opened, they handed an account in to Mr. Hay, wherein they state that I had received goods, and they leave a balance of 91 l. 0 s. 10 d.; and what did they do but withdraw the two bills, which they received on the 3d of January, and which had been paid into their banker's hands, and then say the balance is 91 l. 0 s. 10 d., and the bills 40 l.; but not satisfied with this, they suffered the bills to become due, and sent the following notice: "That the bills on J. Colyer have been presented, and returned unpaid." I never had any transaction with Colyer until the beginning of 1825; Hay never knew I was in insolvent circumstances; and as for Watts, she acted as my housekeeper, and passed as my wife. Morris was recommended to me, about the 24th of January, by a person named Evans; he came to my house several times, and did not find me; he was very anxious to sell goods; and at last I saw him, and purchased goods of him to the amount of 26 l., and paid him with a bill, and 13 l. in cash;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270100"></xptr>he wrote on the invoice - "Received of Mr. Hughes, deposit for goods, 5 l.; 26th January." On the 27th, in the morning, he called on me, and received the balance, and gave me the following receipt: "Received, January 27th, 1825, 13 l. 11 s., and a bill of 29 l. 10 s., due the 4th of March." He returned and said that he had heard that Colyer's house was mortgaged, but he would take the bill on my recommendation. You have had it in evidence that I had not much business, and I was forced to send goods to the sale-rooms to establish my credit, and to get on till spring; these sacrifices were made for no other purpose. They have stated that my stock was sold for 90 l., but it cost me more than 200 l., and the stock and fixtures amounted to nearly 400 l.; my debts, and the surplus of my estate, will more than cover every penny I owe in the world. Moody has stated that he would swear any thing to hang me; he has offered himself as bail, and been rejected; he has stated that his name was John M'Cleland, and passed by that name. I can prove that what Miller and his wife have stated is wholly untrue.</p>
               <p>WATTS'S Defence (written). The prisoner was up to the month of July, 1824, a dress-maker of respectability, and of character unimpeachable; at that time she became acquainted and became housekeeper of defendant Hughes, and acted, on all occasions, as she was directed by Hughes. In the month of November, when Hughes took his house in Speldhurst-street, she was instructed by him to pass as his wife, and continued to do so under the promise of his making her his wife, so soon as Hughes could obtain a divorce against his present wife, (who has been living in a state of adultery for six years.) Watts managed the dress-making department, and, in Hughes absence, always attended in his shop to serve customers; she was directed by Hughes, on the 19th of November last, to go with him to the house of Gilman and Co., and select out some goods as she understood the lace trade better than him. The goods were selected out and approved by Hughes and sent to the house that day on the 24th of November; Watts went again by directions of Hughes, and purchased for him more goods, which were sent accordingly; on the 29th, Watt's again went to the house of Gillman and Co., by Hughes directions, and purchased more goods which were part sent.</p>

            . I am a boot-maker, and live in New-street, Covent-garden. I have known Hay three years; his character has been a very good one; I have done business for him; he has paid me well; there has been some money transactions between him and me, for about ten pairs of boots and shoes. I have visited him in the way of business, and saw him building three or four houses at Paddington; he resided in one of them, and shewed me the others; they are second or third rate houses; there were a great many men at work, and he had the control over them; that was in the course of the summer of 1824; I know he had the direction of them in October; I called on him in the summer of the present year, and he was then living in one of them; I know he had the control of them when I was there the last time, because he was speaking about the work people; it was on a Sunday evening; I was necessitated for a little money; and he gave me a cheque for 20 l., which was paid at his banker's at Charing-cross; this was in the early part of January, 1824, according to the best of my recollection, but I cannot be certain what month; it was in last year; I repaid him in about three months, in two five pound notes and a ten pound note; I have been distressed since, as tradesmen are; I will not swear it was not as late as July in last year.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. What month do you believe it was? A. In January.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it for a particular time? A. Yes, for three months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in business there? A. Nine years.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say you have known this gentleman three years? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you serve him with boots on your first becoming acquainted with him? A. No; I believe I began to serve him in a very few months afterwards. I first became acquainted with him in the summer time, about three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live in 1822, when you first became acquainted with him? A. In a place nearly opposite where he built the houses.</p>
               <p>Q. At the house of a Mrs. Hooper, the milk woman? A. I believe it was, but I never went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that at that time he was in a state of most distressing poverty, and lying on a bed of shavings? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you become acquainted with his great opulence? A. I think it was in 1824, when I saw him inhabiting a house. I did not know of his being in Whitecross-street prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you have, within these two months, seen him at his home? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear to four or six months that you have seen him on a Sunday evening at his own house? A. It must have been light in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear to May, June, July, and August, that you saw him there on a Sunday evening? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that at any time this year you have seen him there? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that he had a bed to lie on or bread to eat, or that he had not a child that died and was buried by the parish? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet will you swear that you have seen him at his house at Paddington? A. Yes; I think very lately.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I will tell you, man, to your utter confusion, that he has been in prison ever since April - have you ever been bailed at Westminster? A. I have been arrested on common process, and been bailed once, within the last twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. How often within the six months before that? A. Never.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You say you have seen this person at this house this summer? A. Yes; I cannot swear at any particular time, but it was in the summer; if he was committed in April I must have been mistaken.</p>

            . I am a clerk to Mr. M'Dowall - he is a timber-merchant, of Cleveland-street, Fitzroy-square. He has been in Court, but went home ill. I know the defendant Hay - I have known him about two years and a half, since I have been with Mr. M'Dowall - I went there on the 1st of March, 1823. Mr. M'Dowall knew Hay, and we have had connexions with him in business - we have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270101"></xptr>intrusted him with goods - I should think he has had 700 l. worth of goods - we have had various payments from him - money has been received of him - I think between 300 l. and 400 l. - he is a builder - I do not know whether he has been lately engaged in any particular business - the last job was the house in Park-place. In November last we were supplying him with goods, which were sent up to certain buildings at Paddington - I do not know of my own knowledge what houses he has been building there - there were six or eight or ten - I cannot tell how many, and besides them some stables - they were eight roomed houses - I have seen them myself, and seen Hay engaged on them, but not within the last six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in November, December, January, and February? A. I think almost every week in these months he has been engaged in these buildings - I have understood they were for him - I know he purchased these houses after his bankruptcy from the assignees, because Mr. M'Dowall was one of them. The bankruptcy was before I went to Mr. M'Dowall.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know any thing about this man's circumstances? A. Except about his buildings, these houses I did not. Mr. M'Dowall began to trust him about July, 1823 - we had no hold on these houses; Mr. M'Dowall trusted him, and we did not limit him; there was a mortgage on them. Mr. Hay has told me that there was a mortgage. I have never seen any title deeds of these houses in his possession; whether it was his own speculation, or any other persons, I cannot tell; the remainder of the 700 l. is still due; I think the last he paid us was 100 l. in August, 1824. I knew of his being in the King's-bench prison, and he has had goods since; we are not in expectation of having money from any other person, if he does not pay us we shall not have it.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Are you still intrusting him with timber? A. Yes, to the best of my knowledge and belief; we have nobody to look to but himself; I have heard from him that some person is the mortgagee. I have not heard to what value, that depends on the situation, but I believe that to be a good situation. Some of them have been sold, I do not know how long since; many of them are still unsold, I think about six, some of them are not finished; and it might, perhaps, cost 100 l. to finish them. I cannot tell what they may be worth, perhaps from 500 l. to 600 l. a piece.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were they sold before or after August, 1824? A. I think before - I do not know the ground rent or terms - I have not thought of it. They were put up for sale this spring, but not sold.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Cox, Cox, and Biddulph, bankers, Charing-cross. Hay kept an account at our house, which commenced in February, 1823, and closed the 9th of June, 1825; here is the pass book of his account - the first entry is the 13th of February, 1823. On the 10th of July, 1824, he paid in 700 l., and commenced drawing upon it immediately; from the 16th of August, to the 1st of January, 1825, there was a balance of 94 l. 19 s. which was drawn out in three small sums soon afterwards, during the year 1823; the sum which passed through our hands was 2447 l. 9 s. 6 d., and in 1824, 2380 l. 10 s. 3 d.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you find a cheque paid to a man of the name of Rowley for 20 l.? A. Yes, it was the 25th of February, 1825.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these the bills by which his account was drawn out of your house? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Two bills were read, one for 21 l. 11 s. drawn by Hughes and Co. on Hay, at two months date from the 11th of December, 1824, endorsed Kipling and Taylor - another for 40 l. drawn by J. Colyer, at two months date on Hay, from January 6th 1825.</p>

            , solicitor, No. 34, Whitecross-street. I know Moody, we had a cause, and a notice of justification was brought against Hughes, and we defended it. Our action against Hughes was about the middle of November, 1824; it was brought by

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Mr. Norton the attorney for Hughes? A. Yes; he was at this time in Whitecross-street; it was then I became acquainted with Hughes; Moody came to see him, and from that acquaintance I would not believe him on his oath.</p>
               <p>HUGHES. Q. Are you aware at whose suit I was first committed to Whitecross-street? A. At the suit of Charteris, I think.</p>

            . I am one of the turnkeys of the King's-bench prison. I recollect, in the beginning of February, that a man of the name of Moody called there and laid an information that the defendant Hughes was out of the rules at his dwelling-house, in Speldhurst-street - this was about the middle of the day; I went with him directly by the direction of the marshal, and I met Mr. Ward, another turnkey, who accompanied us. Moody told Mr. Easton, in my hearing, that he had just come from Speldhurst-street; that Hughes was there then, and that if I would go with him he would go to the door of the house - I do not recollect that he stated at what time Hughes had left the rules, but he said he had seen him in Speldhurst-street, and he slept there every night. When I got to Speldhurst-street I found Miss Watts, and a man and woman I did not know. I did not find Hughes then - I heard Moody use some threats, and a great many very heavy words - in his information at our office, Hughes, he said, was going to France - he used a great many words, and Miss Watt's sent a servant maid, as I took it, for an officer, but none came.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270102"></xptr>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you look for Hughes in the prison before you went? A. No.</p>
               <p>HUGHES. Q. Did you not see me come to the office the next morning early for my day-rule? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you did not find Mr. Hughes at Speldhurst-street? A. I should think we got to Speldburst-street in three-quarters of an hour - we did not search the house, nor look into the rooms up stairs - we did not let them know what our business was - I will not swear that he was not there.</p>
               <p>ROBERT WARD. I am a turnkey of the King's Bench. I went with the last witness and Moody to Speldhurst-street - I saw Watts there - the house is situated at the bottom of the street, and one door one way, and the other the other, so that I did not hear what passed between them - I do not know whether Hughes was there - we went into the shop and the back-parlour, but did not attempt to look whether he was in any other part of the house - it would take Moody perhaps an hour and a half to go from there to the King's Bench and back again.</p>

            . I recollect Moody coming to our lockup house in custody - I do not recollect the day, but it was in Hillary Term. I recollect Mr. Gilman, or Lucas, or Copling, coming to bail him - I do not know for what sum he was in - it was at the suit of Hughes; I do not know who paid his expenses - nor whether Gilman, Lucas, or Copling, gave him any money to pay them; I do not remember Moody stating they would bail him to the extent of 1000 l. - he said they would bail him, but I do not know to what amount. I did not hear him say Gilman or Copling must bail him, as they could do nothing against Hughes without him.</p>

            . I was assistant-collector of taxes to Skinner's estate. I now live at No. 16, Wellington-square, near the Foundling. I am a broker; I distrained for rent in January last, on Mr. Hughes. I know Mr. Miller and his wife - it was on account of some information given by them that I distrained; I distrained on the goods of Mrs. Miller, in the name of Turner, at No. 3, Speldhurst-street, at the suit of Mrs. Hughes. I have heard Mrs. Miller say, in consequence of his distraining on them, she would not leave the house, but stay, and do him all the injury she could - she stated she had been to several of his creditors, and she would go to them all as fast as she could find them out, and state he was deceiving them, and did not mean to pay for the goods he had of them - she caused the tax-collector to be informed, that unless he distrained for taxes, he could not get them - he is now dead. I cannot state any of her particular words, but there were many others to the same effect, that she would do him what injury she could.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you ceased to be tax-collector? A. I was only deputy while the collector was ill, about six months ago, for the paving rate on Skinner's estate; I distrained on this woman for, I believe, seven or eight weeks - I believe it was 3 l. or 4 l.; she was not at all out of humour with me - she was out of humour with Mr. Hughes a little; I think she was rather offended, and when I told her she had better leave the house, she said she would stay, and do him what injury she could, and go to the creditors, and give them some information; according to the receipt, this seems to have been on the 24th of January; she produced a receipt for a quarter's rent at the time, and said she was very ill used in being taken for weekly rent before the quarter came round.</p>

            . I live in the Commercial-road, Lambeth. I have known Colyer sixteen or seventeen months. In April last I bought some carcases of houses of him - the roofs were on two of them, but not the slates; I paid him 215 l., by bills at different dates; I have paid him 75 l. of it; I think he had them about September or October, 1824, I saw them carcased; I know they were his in the month of November, when they were in the same state.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where were they? A. In North Wharf-road - Mr. Colyer lived within one or two houses of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many bills were there? A. There was one for 15 l.; two for 50 l.; and one for 10 l.; the whole money was not to go to Colyer; there was a ground landlord, and a Mrs. Garratt had a lien on them; Colyer was to have about 15 l., which was the first bill and I have paid it - it was a bill at two months from the 26th of April, and I have paid it.</p>
               <p>AMBROSE PARISH re-examined. Q. Was John Colyer in your custody? A. Yes, in January.</p>
               <p>COLYER to MR. BACON. Q. Do you recollect my building a large public-house in the North-road? A. I recollect the house, but I do not know that you built it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect my having two houses adjoining that house which you bought of me? A. I know nothing about them, they were built before I left the place.</p>

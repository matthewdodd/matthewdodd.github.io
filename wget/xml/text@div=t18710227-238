On 31st January, about 6.30 in the evening, I was with constable Westwood, in Trinity Square, Tower Hill—I saw the two prisoners there, by the railings, leaning over something—we passed them, and I heard some pieces of wood being broken up—we went on about thirty yards, and then turned back, and I saw Bradley throw this chest over the railings—it was empty then—the two then ran away—we followed and caught them, and took them back to the place, where I found a sack, containing tea, and the empty case inside the railings—I took Bradley to the station, and Westwood took Sunshine—the place where I saw them is about 200 yards from the Great Western Railway Goods Depot.</p>

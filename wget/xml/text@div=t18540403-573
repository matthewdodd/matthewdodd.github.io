                  </hi>. On 25th Feb., about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the female prisoner and another woman came to my shop—Rogers asked if Mr. Rowbotham was in—I said, "Yes"—she said, "Can I see him?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "Is your name Rowbotham?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "Mr. Nash has sent me here to see if you will buy some tea"—they said they had been dealing with Mr. Nash for two years, and he had sent them, and had written my name on a piece of paper, which she showed me, and I recognised Mr. Nash's writing—she then showed me some samples of green and black tea, and said that their husbands worked in the docks, and this was their perquisite—Rogers was the one who had the samples—they both spoke—the other woman said that they lived in Friar-street—they said the tea was sweepings—I said I had never bought such things before, and I did not know why Mr. Nash had sent them to me—they said there were two half chests of it—they did not give it any of the trade names—I asked them if it was in chests or parcels; they said it was in parcels—after some conversation, I said they might bring it down about 6 o'clock, and I would look at it—about 6 o'clock the three prisoners and the other woman came—Rogers brought one half chest in—Holding had the truck, and I believe he brought in the other—they were nailed down, and covered over with sugar bagging—I asked them what they wanted for it—Margaret Rogers said 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I thought that there was a large quantity for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I should like to see it—the two men were not in the shop at that time, they were outside—I asked if it was tea—Margaret Rogers said, "What else do you think it is?" and she moved about an inch and a half off one of the chests, and a small quantity of tea could be seen—I said, "I have not sufficient money to pay for it, and I should not like to pay it all down; I should like to have it examined first"—the other woman said, "We will see what we can do; we will go outside, and see the men; I could trust you 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. myself but the men want the money to-night; they have got some particular use for it"—the two females said they had known Mr. Nash a length of time, and had dealt with him originally—I said, "You had better go up to him, and ask him if he can give you the balance," and that I should not like to pay them any money until I saw the contents of the chest—they went out again for a few minutes, and came back again with John Rogers—Margaret Rogers then said, in his presence, that if I would give them the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they would wait till Monday morning for the rest—I gave Margaret Rogers 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which she handed over to John Rogers in my presence—I paid that as a deposit on the two half chests,' on the faith of the representation that they contained tea sweepings—they were to come again on the Monday morning—they went out, came back again, and said it was not sufficient, and they would not leave them unless they had the whole amount of the money—they said, it was Holding that was dissatisfied, and that he was drunk—they did not mention his name, but John Rogers said their mate was dissatisfied—Holding made a blustering noise, and said, "I am not satisfied"—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030146"></xptr>
               <p>said, "Well, bring the truck, and take them away"—he brought the truck to the door—I said, "Give me the money, and you can take them with pleasure; I am only sorry that you have got hold of my money; why Mr. Nash should have sent them to me I am at a loss to conjecture"—I said to Holding, "I have half a crown, and if you like to take that, and go about your business, I will give it to you"—that was in addition to the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they said they would take the half crown, and come back again on Monday morning—they then went away—I paid the half crown on the same account (they said they did not bring the tea in a bag, because it would, be more convenient to bring it in chests)—about half an hour after they left I opened the chests—one contained about three quarters of a pound of tea leaves, which had been used and dried, and was filled up with brickbats and sawdust; the second half chest contained about the same quantity of Canton green tea, which had been used; it had a mixture of pebbles with it, and was filled up with brickbats and sawdust—the chests were worth 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the sawdust 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the chests appeared quite new, as if they had just come out of the docks; a channel was made with lead, the tea was put there, and then a piece of board was hammered over very tightly, so that if you put your finger in you found tea; but it was only about half an inch deep; that was the case with both chests.</p>

On Wednesday, 1st March, from information I received, I stopped the two male prisoners in Harnett-street, Lower Marsh, Lambeth—Holding was wheeling a barrow—I asked him what he had got there—he said, "It is a right"—Rogers directly came up, and said it was all right that the barrow belonged to him—I was in uniform—I said, "I must know what there is there"—I took a skewer out, unfastened the sacking, and found a chest of tea on the barrow—I asked Rogers what he had got there—he said "Ornaments"—he then broke open the top of the chest, and I saw that it contained tea—I took them to the station—Holding said he knew nothing about it, he was merely employed by Rogers—I told them I took them for having the tea without being able to give a satisfactory account of it—I opened the chest at the station; it contained a little tea in front, where it was broken open, on a small ledge, about two inches deep; the rest was bricks and sawdust—the prisoners were present, and I think Rogers broke it open himself; he assisted; he was very anxious to break it up, and show what it was—he assisted in breaking up that part which contained brickbats and sawdust; he put his hand to it, and helped to lift the other part up, and show what it contained—he did say, "Do not break, them up," and that he got his living by them, and if people bought them it was only the biter got <hi rend="italic">bit</hi>—on the following morning I found the female prisoner in custody, for being drunk and creating a disturbance, at the station.</p>

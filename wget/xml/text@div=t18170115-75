On the 2d of December, about a quarter past one o'clock in the day, there was thirty or forty persons round our shop, they broke it open, and then got in. I had shut up the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150034"></xptr>shop before that time; there were fire arms of different descriptions taken away, amounting to about 750l.; there was also powder and shot taken away.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, on the 2d of December, in Church-lane, Whitechapel; between two and three o'clock in the afternoon; it is about a quarter of a mile from the Minories; he had a gun with him, the outside of it was quite clean, it appeared to have been recently discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When you took him, he had it dragging after him - A. He carried it. It was not on the ground. I know Back Church-lane; if the prisoner had been going from Brander's, to Back Chuch-lane, the place where I met him, would not be the nearest way, it was in the way from Newgate-street; I produce the gun it was not fired while in my possession; nobody could get at it.</p>
               <p>MR. POTTS. The gun is mine, and was taken out of my counting-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It had not been fired while it was in my possession, after it was proved; I have no doubt but that it has been fired since it was taken from my shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I picked it up.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. When I took it, it did not appear to have been on the ground.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JONES. I live in Old-street; the prisoner, is my son, he is a wood-cutter. On the 2d of December, I sent him out with the cart; Robins went with him. I sent him to St. Giles's, in the Fields; he worked for Mr. Jameson, as well as me.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ROBINS. I am the prisoner's brother-in-law. I went with him to sell the wood, we returned at a quarter to twelve, we went up Field-lane, Fleet-market, and to Temple-Bar, we then turned back, and went down Fleet-street into Fleet-lane; when we got to Newgate, the prisoner left me, it was about two o'clock; he went towards Whitechapel; his brother, Thomas Jones, accompanied us with the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Plumstead-road, Woolwich—on Saturday, 12th November, about 12 o'clock, I was in a public-house in High-street, Woolwich, with two friends—we had been there from half-past 8—one of my friends wished us good night, and went home; and about 12 o'clock I looked for my other friend, and met a woman, who said she would take me to him at her house—I took a pot of beer in my hand, and paid for it, and when I got inside the house the woman put the candle on the table, and the prisoners came in—Needham came in and held my arms, Burley put his hands over my mouth, and Smith to my throat, and stopped my breath—Burley then took off my handkerchief and my flannel shirt—one had hold of me and the other came with his head down, took me by the throat, and choked me; and then he let go of my throat, and drew off my handkerchief and flannel shirt—I told Burley that I knew him, having seen him three hours before, and I little thought he would serve me like that—he said that he would knock my brains out unless I went out quietly—I went out, and was glad to get out—Needham and Smith then came up to me—Needham said, "Let him have it," and held his fist up—Smith said, "Hold on" three times over, and they put their knuckles into the back of my neck, nipping me till I got to the gas-lamp, and then they ran away, and I gave informa<lb></lb>tion to the police—I afterwards saw Needham at the station-house, and picked him out—I had had about three pints to drink—I was sober—I can swear that these are the men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you sober or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had had about two pints, from two to three—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my handkerchief—the shirt has not been found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Smith. Q.</hi> Did you say when I was taken to the police-station that the first place you saw me was outside the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I told the policeman that you were the man who prevented me from being killed, but I did not any that I did not want you to be locked up—the policeman did not advise me to go home to my wife and five children—you ran away before I met the policeman—I said that I would treat you with a pot of beer—that was to get out of that street into the main street.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Burley. Q.</hi> At the station you said that you treated us to brandy and water? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 145). I received information of the robbery about half-pant 12 o'clock on the morning of the 2d, and went to 9, Hooper's yard, Woolwich, the house the prosecutor entered with the woman—I saw Needham in the passage with the woman, who had gone home with the pro<lb></lb>secutor</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240137"></xptr>
               <p>—I told him he was charged with stealing a handkerchief and a flannel-shirt—he said, "All right, matter, I will go on with you, but you have got the wrong party this time—going to the station we met the pro<lb></lb>secutor, who identified him—I went to No. 10, in the same street, about three-quarters of an hour afterwards, and found Smith standing behind the water closet door—I told him the charge—he said, "All right, I will go with you"—I took him to the station—they were searched, but nothing was found on them—Smith was identified by the prosecutor afterwards went with Wickham to the second floor of No. 9, and Wickham drew Burley out from under the bedstead with his clothes on, and this pocket handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found on his neck—he made some statement at the station about it, but not at the time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Burley.</hi> You charged me with stealing a handkerchief; I said I had not stolen any handkerchief. I had a handkerchief on my neck, which I had found on the landing; I thought it belonged to somebody in the house. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He made no statement about the handkerchief till he was brought up on remand before the Magistrate, and then he said that he found it on the stairs—you could just discover that the prosecutor had been drinking.</p>

I took Burley, and found this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on his neek—I drew him from under the bed, and said that I wanted him for stealing a handkerchief and a flannel-shirt from a man—I said, "Where is the handkerchief?"—he said, "You see here it is"—I took it from under his neck and said, "Is Smith in this job?" he said, "Yes"—I said, "Where is he?"—he said, "Downstairs in the next yard; is <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> locked up?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I am a fool for getting collared for this job; I deserve all I shall get"—he said nothing about the handkerchief till he was brought up on remand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Burley.</hi> He first said that I made no statement at all.

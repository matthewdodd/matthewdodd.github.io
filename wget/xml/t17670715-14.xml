            . My uncle the prosecutor, and another gentleman, were walking together; I was just behind them; I saw the prisoner take my uncle's handkerchief out of his pocket; I took hold of him by the collar; there was another fellow with him behind, he went away directly; the prisoner put his hand behind him when I collared him, and immediately I saw the handkerchief on the ground, but did not see it fall; then I spoke to my uncle; we were taking the prisoner up the hill, he got away and ran, and I after him, and took him again before I lost sight of him; then we took him to St. Sepulchre's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you did not say at the watch-house you saw a man run away?</p>
               <p>Turner. Yes, I did, but that was three or four yards behind the prisoner; he crossed the way, and ran as fast as he could; but I having got the man that took the handkerchief out, I did not look after him; (the handkerchief produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I live in Jacob's-court; my master and I had a few words on the Saturday night, and I went away as far as Tower-street, and going along, this happened. I am a painter.</p>

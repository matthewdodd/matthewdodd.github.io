             sworn. - I am a soldier; and was on guard down at Limehouse-hole: At nine o'clock. I saw the prisoner coming out of the fourth story of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140052"></xptr>warehouse, down the ladder; when he got down, I examined him, and found twenty pounds weight of nails; I took them and him to the guard-room; going along, he said, he had a wife and family, and hoped I would let him go; he said, somebody had put the nails in his basket, he did not know how they came there. (The nails produced.)</p>
               <p>- REED sworn. - These are a sors of nails we use at the New Docks, and they belong to Mr. Wharton, the carpenter; the prisoner had worked there about twelve months, and was a steady man; our regular time is till seven o'clock, but we were in a hurry, and allowed the men to work as long as they could see.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, as follows:</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I have only to say, I am entirely innocent of the crime; how the nails came into my basket, or by whom they were put there, I cannot tell, unless the soldiers in the building put them in, and then gave notice to below, to extort money. The soldier called to me, saying, you have got nails in your basket; and if I had been guilty, I might have gone up the ladder again, and put them out; but being certain of my innocence, I gave the basket to be examined, and to my great surprise, saw the nails; the soldier was drunk at the time, therefore what credit will you give to him, particularly, as since my confinement, he had made an attempt to seduce my wife, and threatened he would break open her room-door; but promising, if she would grant him a certain favour, he would save her husband: to prove which, I can call respectable witnesses.</p>

            Were you sober, or not? -

            Sober, or I should not have been placed on the sentry. The nails were covered with chips; I did not call to him till he came to the bottom.</p>

             sworn. - I was at my cutting board, and saw the prisoner's wife come up in a fright, and the soldier behind her; she said to her son, you dog, you have lost the key; that was merely an excuse to get rid of the soldier; he said, I can open the door, and wanted to get into her room.</p>

            (To Grimmel.) Is any part of this true? - A. No; the whole is this; I and several comrades passed the door, and I said, this is the house where the prisoner's wife lives, and went away directly.</p>
               <p>RICHARD SOTCHER sworn. - The woman came in a great fright, and said, I expect the soldier down here every minute, he is just behind; in about five minutes, somebody knocked; I said, who do you want; says he, I want the woman, who is just come in; she sat in the shop; and he said, he could not come in, he was so bashful; my uncle heard him; and our apprentice heard him say, he could break the door open.</p>

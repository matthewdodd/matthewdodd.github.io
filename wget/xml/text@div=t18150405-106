            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 4th of March, I met the prisoner, he was driving a she ass; I asked him whose ass it was; he said, his own, he had bought it at the fair. Afterwards I had information the ass was stolen; I went in search of it, and found it locked up in a stable in George-street, Spitalfields; I found the stable belonged to a blind man, of the name of Miller. I was obliged to go to Winchester Assizes. One of my fellow officers took the prisoner the next day. I took the ass from Miller's possession; the same ass was delivered to Collier for his master at the office, by the order of the magistrate.</p>

            . I bought the ass of the prisoner, on the 4th of March, it was a she ass; I gave fifteen shillings for it; it was in my stable in George-street, I put it there. I heard the prisoner's voice at the office, I am sure he is the same man that I bought the ass of, by his voice; he was charged with stealing the ass.</p>
               <p>John Collier. I went to Miller's stable, and saw the ass there; I am sure it was my master's ass, it is worth two pounds.</p>

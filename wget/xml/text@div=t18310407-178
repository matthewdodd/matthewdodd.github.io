On the 25th of November I was in my shop, and saw Pennycad at the corner - he seemed to be watching me; I saw him coming and going for five minutes - he was in my view for an hour; I had a party taking some refreshment in my back parlour, and after they were gone I went into my back parlour - while I was there I heard's footstep; I turned round, and missed part of a ham from my shop - there were about 9 lbs. of it.</p>

            . I have been confined in the House of Correction - I ran away from my mother, and was in Queen-square with another boy; the beadle took me, and said I was begging - I was committed: I work for my father, who is a plumber. I was in Chapel-street in November last - I saw Pennycad, whom I knew, and another boy named James Butcher; Butcher had a ham carrying in his apron - he told me he had a ham, which he had got in Euston-street; I said it was a wonder he was not taken - he said he did not care for that; Pennycad was near him at the time - it was about 9 lbs. of ham.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been in the House of Correction? A. I was there fourteen days - I do not know that I ever made free with another person's property; I did work at Mr. Reeves', an attorney, in Ely-place - I was accused by he Policeman there; he came to ask me whether I knew any thing about Mr. Reeves' pistols - I was not charged with taking them; I told all about them, and they were found on my information - I did not know Mr. Reeves had lost his pistols; they were found in Pennycad's house - I knew where they were; Pennycad took them to his house, but I did not know he took them till I got to Hatton-garden - I went with a person to pawn one of them; I was taken by a Po<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070089"></xptr>liceman in Regent's-park three days after - I did know before that they were pawned, and that they were Mr. Reeves'; I had not told Mr. Reeves, for I was put out of the way - I told the Policeman after I got out of the House of Correction; the pawnbroker's shop was in the New-road - I did not know any thing about them till we were in Hatton-garden, and then Pennycad pulled one of the pistols out of his pocket; the pawnbroker's name was Joyce - I did go into the shop and put the pistol on the counter; I asked him 1s. for it - I did not take it out; it was Mr. Reeves pistol - I was working in his house at that time, as a painter.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know Mr. Jones shop? A. Yes, my mother used to deal there - I might see that shop on the 25th of November; I was not waiting outside.</p>
               <p>Pennycad. He never saw me in Chapel-street - Jem Butcher and I were not there; the truth is he knows more about it than we do.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Rivett—we live in West-place, City-road. About three weeks before I went before the Magistrate, the pri<lb></lb>soner came to our shop, and bought a quarter of a pound of cheese—it cane to 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she threw down a bad shilling—I gave her change—directly the left the shop I discovered the shilling was bad—I laid it between the scales and the butter-board—a person came in and bent it, and I put it on the mantel-piece—I at last put it into the fire, and it ran down like a bit of lead—it melted down at once—I am quite positive it was bad—on Friday, the 5th of Dec, the prisoner came again, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, for two ounces of cheese, which came to 1 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a shil<lb></lb>ling, and I gave her the full change, with the cheese—I marked the shilling and put it on the shelf—it looked so new and so good I could not tell but it was good—I knew the prisoner was the same person—the first shilling wai an old one, and looked very dark, which I thought all bad shillings did—I thought the second shilling was good till I weighed it—I kept it, and after<lb></lb>wards gave it to the policeman—on Friday, the 12th of Dec, the prisoner came again, between nine and ten o'clock at night—she wanted a quarter of a pound of cheese and a penny candle—she threw down a half-crown, which I found was bad—I sent my sister to Mr. Briggs, the publican—she came back with him—while she went I kept the half-crown in my hand—I showed it to Mr. Briggs, and told him to detain the prisoner—I went for a police<lb></lb>man, and brought him—I gave him the half-crown, and the shilling.</p>

These are both bad—this metal is very easily fusible—it is electrotyped, which would not prevent its melting—with this plating of silver over them, they are very likely to impose on people—they have to a great extent all the sharpness of silver coin—the weight is much less than silver.</p>

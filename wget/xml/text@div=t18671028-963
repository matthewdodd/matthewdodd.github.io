                  </hi> I am an inmate of St. James's Workhouse—on Saturday evening, 5th October, the prisoner, who was an inmate, un<lb></lb>dressed himself about half-past ten o'clock, came to my bedside, and took away my chamber-pot, and then he went to another man's bedside and took away his chamber<lb></lb>pot, and then he came back to me again with'a chamberpot in his hand, and struck me on the head—he then dropped it on the floor, sad said, "You b----old s----I will smash you up, "struck me in the face with his fist, and gave me a black eye—I said if he was not quiet I would fetch the officer—he said, "Do nothing of the sort; I will settle it with you in the morning"—he then went to bed, and after he was in bed he wore that he would injure me—Lewis said, "You blackguard, you shall not do so; you shall not hit the old man any more"—the prisoner then threatened Lewis, and swore he would smash him up in a minute, and he went and struck him in the face as he lay in bed—Lewis jumped up, and they got fighting—I ran to fetch the officer, and met him on the stain he went up with me, and told the prisoner what he would do if he was not quiet, and we all went to bed—after we had been in bed a good bit the prisoner got up and said, "Iam b----if I will stop here to be murdered, and I will put on my boots and settle it with you early in the morning"—I got up and dressed, and Lewis did the same, upon which the prisoner jumped into bed with his clothes on, and there he lay for a considerable time, and after our chapel clock had struck twelve he jumped up and said, "I am b----if I do not do it now"—(I was lying on the edge of the bed)—he ran across the room and struck Lewis, who struck him again, and he fell between two beds—I ran and called the officer; I then ran up, had the first man I met was Lewis, who said, "Oh, he has stabbed me! "—he was bleeding very much, and holding a shirt to his tide—the officer came and took him to the sick ward, and then took the prisoner, who was sitting on the side of his bed</p>

                  </hi> I am porter at St. James's Workhouse—abort 10.20 on this night Halford complained to me—I went up and saw the prisoner in his shirt, in a very excited state, quarrelling with Halford—I desired them to go to bed, which they did, and I went to bed, but was called up again a little after twelve, and met Lewis on the stairs, bleeding; he said that he was stabbed—I sent for the doctor and the police, and gave the prisoner into custody—I asked him if he had a knife—he said, "No"—I pulled this knife out of his trousers pocket, with wet blood on it; the blade was freshly broken.</p>

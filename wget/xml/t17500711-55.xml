It was moon light. They told me they'd blow my brains out, but I saw no fire arms. The prisoner was the first that laid hold of me. They said nothing at all to me before they threw me down, and laid hold of my legs. I called out to the watch, they got off me and ran away. I got up and took hold of this and another, the other got away. I catched them about 12 yards from where they attacked me, the watchman came to me on the top of the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here?</p>
               <p>Prior. No, my lord, I have not seen him since, nor do I know his name, he did not come till the other was got from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the others bigger than this lad?</p>
               <p>Prior. They were all about the same size.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober? It seems strange that five such boys as these should attempt to rob a man of your size.</p>

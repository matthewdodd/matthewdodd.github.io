I am a grocer, of 49, Bryanston Street—on 5th April I was in Mr. Rogers's public-house when Jones came in—there was a partition between Hun and me—Lever brought a florin to me and said "Look at this"—I found it was bad, and in consequence of what she said I followed the prisoner; he went through Old Quebec Street and Oxford Street to the Gloucester public-house at the corner of Park Street—he went in at one door and out at the other into Park Street, where Clarke joined him—I did not see where Clarke came from—they walked down Park Street together—I followed them about 200 yards and met Watts, I then got into his van and followed them to the end of Park Street—they were about to stop at a public-house, but looked round and recognised me—they passed the Pitt's Head and stopped—Jones then came back and went in, and Clarke went on—Watts went in before me—I went in, saw Jones there, and spoke to the landlord in Jones's hear<lb></lb>ing, who then tried to get away—I stopped him and asked the landlord to test the florin he had taken, which he did—I asked Jones how many more he had got, as this was the second I had seen him utter—he resisted violently, but I detained him till a constable arrived—I afterwards found Clark in the Marquis of Granby, Brook Street, and gave him in custody—I told him I had followed him from the Coachmakers' Arms, and I had seen him tender a bad florin, and that Jones was in custody—he said that he knew nothing about it.</p>

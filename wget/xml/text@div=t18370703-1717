                  </hi>. I live in Little St. Martin-street, Leicester-square, About half-past seven o'clock in the evening of the 17th of June, I met with the male prisoner. who I know before, and went with him to a public-house and drank—we then went to theatre in Little St. James's-street, and proceeded from there towards the Haymarket—we had a pot of beer before we went on, and called in at another public-house, but not to sit down—he asked me to go to his apartment, and I went—the two prisoners live to<lb></lb>gether as man and wife—I do not know whether they are so—I was not drunk—I sat down, and went to sleep on a chair—I had a watch, chain, and seal when I went into their apartment—I awoke about three o'clock next morning, and missed the watch—the prisoners were both in the room on the bed, and dressed—I charged the female with robbing me—she said she never—the male prisoner did not awake—this is my watch—it was about ten o'clock when I went into the house, as never as I can tell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker. On Monday, the 29th of June, a person named Lloyd came to me, I went with him to the Cock and Magpie, Drury-lane, and saw the two prisoners—the male prisoner said he had the ticket of a watch to sell, it was a good deal of money to give for the ticket 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the ticket—I seen—he said, "It is a very good one, and is worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said I should have no hesitation in giving the money, provided it was the watch he described—I asked if he had the ticket with him, and the female produced it in her hand—I went and told Carle, the policeman, and he went and found it upon her.</p>

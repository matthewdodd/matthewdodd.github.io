                  </hi>. I am foreman to Stephen Wastel Hooper, a grocer of Fleet-street—the prisoner was in his employ about two months as porter—on 19th October, in consequence of something which occurred, I went to Fleet street station with the officer Gaylor and we marked between us 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—there were two florins, some half-crowns, two shillings, and six six<lb></lb>pences—I handed the two florins to Mr. Hooper, and the other marked money I put in a bag and took it to the shop next day; and just before the prisoner returned from dinner I cleared the till and put in 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then left the shop for a few minutes leaving the prisoner in charge of it—I returned in five minutes, sent the prisoner upstairs on some excuse, then examined the till and found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a shilling of which was marked—the prisoner returned within three minutes and I asked him what customers he had had during my absence and what they had purchased?—he made no answer—I told him that a customer had been in and paid two florins and there was only one in the till, and asked him what he had done with the other—after some little hesitation, he said, "It is in my pocket, Sir,"—he took it out, handed it to Mr. Hooper who was present with the officer, and I left them.</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday, the 18th of November, the prisoner made an application on the subject of some supposed shawl that had been lost—I went in her absence, to her bed-room—I broke open the door, and found on the table of her bed-room nine or ten duplicates—we could not find the key of the room there—it was found on her person at the police-station—her box was opened in the officer's presence—it was not locked at all—there was a handkerchief, and napkins, and smelling-bottle found in her presence.</p>

               <p>Eastern Railway, at London-bridge—I know the prisoner—he has been shopman to Mr. Alderman Carter for some time, in Tooley-street—I took a gold Geneva hunting watch to the prisoner to be repaired, at the latter end of August—the cylinder was broken—the prisoner told me it would cost from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told me it required a new cylinder—I called for it on several occasions—I called in about a fortnight or three weeks—the prisoner stated on one occasion that it was not done—on a subsequent occa<lb></lb>sion he showed me the watch, and said he thought it would not go to satisfaction, it required further seeing to, and it would be done in a short time—he said it was to go to Cornhill—he told me he had spoken to Alder<lb></lb>man Carter respecting the expense, and that Alderman Carter would see and settle the expense—I have never received the watch.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am an Alderman of London, and carry on business as a chronometer maker—I have one house in Cornhill and another in Tooley-street—the prisoner was in my employ—he had the management of the shop in Tooley-street—it was his duty to keep a job book of the repairs done in Tooley-street—this is that book—here is an entry under the date of 23rd Aug. in the writing of the prisoner: "Mr. Woodcock, gold Geneva hunter, horizontal, No. 3356"—I have searched my stock in Tooley-street and at Cornhill for a watch corresponding with this entry—I cannot find any—the prisoner did not speak to me in Sept. about Mr. Woodcock calling on me and settling with me about the expense—I never heard the thing mentioned.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you do very little work yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I supervise the work—I have a superintendent at Cornhill, but nothing would be done without my authority—no watch would be brought from Tooley-street to Cornhill without its being first placed in my hand—watches are very seldom brought to Cornhill—if a watch were received in Tooley-street it would not in general be sent to Cornhill—if any extra repairs, or any<lb></lb>thing particular was wanted, it would be represented to me on my visit to Tooley-street, and I should direct what should be done—I can't say how often I called at Tooley-street in August—I have been once a fortnight or three weeks—I have been as much as a month away, but never since this man has been in my employ—there was only one man employed at Tooley-street, and an assistant to shut up—there was only one man in charge, which was the prisoner—there was a porter who might have access to the shop, but only one who had access to the property in his charge, that was the prisoner—the man's wife might have access to the premises, but they have no access to the property—they have a right to go in the shop—the goods for repair are kept under the control of the prisoner—there is a house, and the porter and his wife live there—people must pass through the shop to get to the upper rooms, and their friends must do the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Alderman Carter, as clock winder, on the South Western Railway. On 18th Sept. I received a silver watch from Mr. Hunt, at Robert's-bridge, to get it repaired at Mr. Alderman Carter's, in Tooley-street—there was in the watch the name of Waddle, of Burwash, which is somewhere near Hastings—I gave that watch to the prisoner, at Mr. Carter's shop—I believe I gave it him twice—after I gave it him the second time I never got it back again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 1, St. James's Court, West-minter—on 24th November, about 1.30 a.m., I went home and found the prisoner in my room—we had a quarrel, and he fastened the door, pushed me backwards on the bed, and slit my nose—it must have been done with a knife—I was taken to the hospital and it was sewn up—I was there for a week—he was sober; he never drinks, but I aggravated him greatly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it a clasp knife?. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, an ordinary table knife—when I first knew him I lived with him for a couple of months, but he was rather inclined to be jealous of me—I had left him for some little time—these were my lodgings—when I got in I found him waiting for me and we were on friendly terms for a very few minutes—I told him that I did not want him, and he said that if I would give him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he would go—I said "Here is 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and then he struck me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Westminster Hospital—I examined the prosecutrix there—she was suffering from an incised wound about an inch and a quarter long from "her forehead down to the bridge of her nose, and a quarter of an inch deep—a knife like this would cause it—she was weak from loss of blood—I sewed up the wound—it was a dangerous wound and I strongly advised her to come into the hospital; she would not, but she was brought back the same morning and stopped there nearly a week, having an attack of erysipelas which was the result of the wound, and which placed her life in peril—the wound could not have been done with a nail, it was a clean incised wound.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 84.) I was directed to watch the pre<lb></lb>mises of Mr. Slater, a butcher, at Kensington; and last Tuesday evening, while I was watching, I saw Hemmings come from the stable with a sack on his back—he put the sack against my feet, within a yard of where I was standing—he did not see me—he went away, and returned in company with Dubbins, in a direction from out of Mr. Slater's yard—when they came to the sack, Hemmings said to Dobbins, "Here it is, it is all right"—I heard the chink of silver—Hemmings left Dobbins, and went into the stable—Dobbins took the sack, and went off the premises to the road—I went and stopped him—he said, "Stop a minute, let me get the sack down home"—I said, "No, that is what I want"—he went down with me to the station—about five minutes previously to the sack being brought out of the stable, I had seen Prior come out of the New-road into Mr. Slater's premises, and go round into the stable; and about two minutes before Hemmings came out of the stable with the sack, I heard Prior's voice talking to tome one in the stable—the sack contained oats, beans, and clover chaff.</p>

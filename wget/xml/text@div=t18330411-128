I fell in with the prisoners in Holborn, between seven and eight o'clock on the 25th of March - I was not sober, but I remember meeting them; I was inquiring for a lodging, and they asked me to go home with them, to a cook-shop, in <placeName id="t18330411-128-crimeloc711">Gray's Inn-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cole. I was called in at a quarter before twelve o'clock; you said you were thirsty, and should like some beer - I said it was too late to get any, it was one o'clock - you said it was not much after twelve, and you looked for your watch and missed it; I had been in bed with you, and I got up to look for your watch. Witness. No, it was not you; it was Teasdale came in, and then I missed my watch.</p>
               <p>DANIEL HUMPHRIES. (Police-constable G 74). I was called to this cook-shop at half-past one o'clock - the landlord gave me information of a young man who was calling Police; I went and found the two prisoners and the prosecutor in the room - the prosecutor was holding the door to; he had sense enough to detail his loss to me - he said he had lost three sovereigns and a half, and 3s. 6d. in silver - he afterwards said he had lost his purse and his watch; he took the purse and watch out of Teasdale's hand - I searched the grate and found two sovereigns and a half, a sixpence with a hole in it, and a gilt farthing - the third sovereign was found in the purse by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BROWN (Police-constable G 178). I was with the other officer; what he says is true.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHEELER. This is my watch and purse.</p>
               <p>Cole. I was with him at the beginning of the evening, but left him, and did not return till near twelve o'clock, when I was called into the room - he then wanted beer, and missed his watch; he got up and pulled the clothes off, he then found it - he then locked the door, and said he had missed three sovereigns and a half - I was dressing, and asked him to let me go out; he said No - he struck me, and said he was robbed - the two officers were fetched, and the money found, but I do not know who put it there.</p>

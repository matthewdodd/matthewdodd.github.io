I am the son of Mr. Hawkins, a publican of West End, Northolt—he keeps a cow—I milked her on Sunday, October 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, between 5 and 6 o'clock—I left her in the field, which is inclosed all round, and the fences are very good—I fastened the gate with a chain and staple—there were no gaps in the fence then—I was called up between 12 and 1 o'clock, and saw the cow in Mr. Gurney's yard—she was worth from 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer of Northolt, and know the prisoner very well—on Sunday night, 3rd October, between 6 and 7 o'clock, I was with the prisoner at Mr. Hawkins' public-house—I left him there between 7 and 8, and when I got home I saw the cow in the field—I live adjoining the field.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, T</hi> 227). On Sunday night, 3rd October, about 12 o'clock, I was on duty on the high road to Uxbridge, in the parish of Hayes, and from information I received, I went on the road and overtook the prisoner with a cow—I knew him well, and asked him where he was going to take the cow to—he said, "To Mr. Joseph Gurney of West End"—I asked him where he had it from—he said, "Out of a field at Pole-hill, in the parish of Hillingdon;"—he told me that Mr. Gurney bought the cow at Chertsey-fair, and had offered a reward for it, and he found it in a field at Pole-hill—I went on with him to Mr. Gurney's, and asked Mr. Gurney in his presence if he had lost a cow, or offered 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. reward for one: he said, "No," and that the cow was not his—the prisoner then said that the cow belonged to Mr. Hawkins, which is three or four minutes walk from there—it was two miles from Mr. Gurney's that I first saw the prisoner—he was then coming towards London from Uxbridge, but he turned off the London-road to West End, towards where the cow was stolen from, coming in a direction to London—I went on to Mr. Hawkins, called him and his son up, and they both identified the cow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>prisoner driving a cow towards London—I turned my light on, looked at the cow, and seeing that there was no mark on it, I said to the prisoner, "Bob, where are you going with that cow?" he said, "Mr. Gurney sent me after it to Pole-hill, and is going to give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—there is such a place as Pole-hill—I am sure he said, "Mr. Gurney sent me, Mr. Joseph Gurney"—I went next morning to the field where the cow was, and found the inner field all right—there was a good fence all round, but in the outer field there was a fresh gap, where I tracked the cow as having gone through—the stakes were fresh pulled up, the cow could not have done that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

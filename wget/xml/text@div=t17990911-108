             sworn. - I am chambermaid at the Talbot Inn. I always make it a rule to look at the rooms after company, before they go away; when the prisoner came down, about nine in the morning, I asked her which room she came out of; she told me the door faced me: I asked her to wait while I locked the room; she would not, but ran away from me. I went up stairs and missed the pillow-cases; I pursued and took her myself, facing the New Church, in the Strand: I brought her back, and a constable was sent for; I then went up stairs, and missed the sheet; when I came down, she was in the care of the constable.</p>
               <p>JAMES TALBOYS sworn. - I am an officer.(Produces a sheet, and two pillow-cases.) I was sent for, and found the prisoner in the gateway of the Talbot Inn. I searched her; she had the pillow-cases in her hand, and I found the sheet wrapped round her as a petticoat, under her petticoat. I have had them ever since.(The property was deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

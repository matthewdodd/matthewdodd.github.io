She first deposed, that about seven Years ago she was preverted from the Protestant to the Roman Catholick Religion by the Prisoner and her Grandmother, and said that he brought her to be Confirmed by the Bishop in great Queens-street, who Confirmed her. She farther said, that on the 9th of June last she came to the Prisoner to his Chamber at one Mr. Northovers, a great Box-maker in great Wild-street, up two pair of Stairs, about 6 or 7 a Clock in the Morning, and told him that she was come to Confession, and he askt her whether she was ready, and she reply'd yes, then he took her into a Closlet, and she kneeled down upon a Cushion by him, and made her Confession to him, and he gave her Absolution, and enjoyned her for a Pennance five Ave Mary's, and five Pater Nosters to be said in the Jesus Psalter. She farther said, that she had heard him say Mass about two Years also, and that he said it in Latin with a low Voice, and said that she was bound to believe what he said, by reason she knew no better.

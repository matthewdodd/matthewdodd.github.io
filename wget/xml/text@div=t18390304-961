                  </hi>. I live at Gravesend. On the 2nd of March, about seven or eight o'clock, I was at Hadley, in Middlesex, and coming from my brother's house there with Mr. Stewport—three boys overtook me—they kept abreast of me some little time, and I observed what I thought was my pocket handkerchief pass towards the one on my right hand—I immediately turned round to Mr. Stewport and said, "I believe that fellow has had the impertinence to take my handkerchief,"—I immediately caught hold of him, and was in the act of searching him, when he slipped out of my hands, and made his escape—I was going after him, when Mr. Stewport called out, "I have got the fellow who has got your handkerchief," and I went back—this is my handkerchief—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I was in company with Mr. Wim<lb></lb>bolt on this evening, and observed the three men pass—Mr. Wimbolt said he believed one of them had his handkerchief—I saw it in the hands of the man nearest to me—he passed it to the furthest of the three—Mr. Wim<lb></lb>bolt laid hold of the man who had taken the handkerchief—the others ran on some distance—I followed, and took the prisoner, who had got the handkerchief in his possession—he took it from his bosom, and laid it on some rails—I took it up.</p>

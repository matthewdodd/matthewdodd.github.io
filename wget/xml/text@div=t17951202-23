            And the 11th of October was the first time you gave information? - A. I gave Mr. Colquhoun information two months before that; I was a long time before I could find it out; they would not sell any before me; as soon as I could come at the bottom of it, to purchase any, I always acquainted the magistrate with it every week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever act as a porter at an auction? - A. No; I lived as clerk, fifteen years ago, with Mr. Williams, the second door in Pall Mall; he sometimes had auctions, and I perhaps used to clerk down for him, or the like of that, and received the money for him.</p>
               <p>Q. You never lived at any auction room? - A. Yes; I had one of my own, at No. 179, High Holborn.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. - Q. He had half-a guinea, two half-crowns, and a shilling, good? - A. Yes.</p>

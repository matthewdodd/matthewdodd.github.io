                  </hi>. I am a haberdasher, and live in Little Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fielcls. On Saturday, 14th Feb., Wharton came to my shop, about half-past 8 o'clock in the evening—he asked for two dozen shirt buttons—they came to threepence—he tendered a shilling to my sister—she handed it to me, and I tried it in the detector—I found it bad, I returned it to Wharton, and asked him where he got it—he said from his mother—I asked him where she lived—he said in Parker-street—I told him to take it to her, and tell her it was bad—he went out, I followed him—he went towards Parker-street, but he stood in a doorway, and waited a few minutes; he saw the coast was clear, he then joined Collier—they conversed together, and walked down Holborn to Mr. Stokes's—they both looked in the shop;</p>

               <p>Wharton then went in, and Collier moved a few paces off, and waited—I then went into Mr. Stokes's shop, and asked what money Wharton had givenhim—he said a sixpence—I told Mr. Stokes to secure him, and I went out and took Collier—I brought him into the shop—Wharton said he did not know him—an officer was sent for, and they were given into custody—some bad money was found in the waistband of Collier's trowsers.</p>

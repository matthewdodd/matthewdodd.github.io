                  </hi>, I am the wife of Thomas Gray, a tailor, in Windmill-street. On Saturday night, 28th Dec, about half-past nine o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Wardour-street, looking at some persons quarrelling—I had a half-crown, a sixpence, and four shillings in a hand<lb></lb>kerchief in my pocket—it was what I had earned myself—my husband is ill—as I was going home I missed my money and handkerchief.</p>

               <p>o'clock—there was a crowd there, some man and woman were fighting; I stood to look—they were coming out of the public-house—I saw Mrs. Gray coming from the public-house across the road—she stood before me—I saw the prisoner talking to her for four or five minutes or more, and I saw him put his hand into her pocket, and draw out the handkerchief all in a lump—he walked on the other side of the road—it was a white hand<lb></lb>kerchief—I saw him open it and count the money, a half-crown, four shillings, and a sixpence—I followed him across the road—Mrs. Gray had stopped there—I looked round for a policeman, but could not find any; and when I got to the corner of the street, the prisoner was gone—I went to Mrs. Gray and told her what I had seen—she walked away, and I went for my tea and sugar—a fortnight afterwards I went out, and saw Mrs. Gray—I had some conversation with her relative to this affair—I did not see the prisoner for some time afterwards—he was taken into custody, and we were sent for—I do not know how long that was after the second con<lb></lb>versation with Gray—I told the policeman what I had seen, on the night of the 28th Feb.—I spoke to the policeman in the street—he is not here—he was No. 100, C—I described the young man to him, and he made a note of my description in his pocket-book—I saw the policeman near where I live—I did not hear anything further till I was sent for to Marl<lb></lb>borough-street—I do not know when that was—when I saw the prisoner do this, there was light enough to discern his features—I have no doubt he is the same person.</p>

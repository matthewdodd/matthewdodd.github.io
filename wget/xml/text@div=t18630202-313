                  </hi>. I live at 2, Fleet-lane, and am a carman—on Friday night, 9th January, about twenty minutes to 8 o'clock, I was passing down Bride-lane, and I thought I saw some persons get over the churchyard rail<lb></lb>ings—I walked through Bride-passage out into Salisbury-court, lit my pipe, and walked round Salisbury-square and back again; and, as the clock was striking 8, I saw the prisoners come over the railings—I stopped M'Cave, who came over second, but Cook called him in the other direction, and they ran away—M'Cave turned to the left towards Ludgate-hill—I followed him into a court, where I took him—I saw his face distinctly; he is the man.</p>

I am fire-engine keeper at St. Bride's, and live at 5, Parsons-court, Bride-lane—about half-past 8 o'clock that evening I examined the vaults and the churchyard, and found nothing amiss—I made a second examination, and found that the lead had been taken away from the roof of the entrance to a vault on the south side—Lucking and I afterwards went to the churchyard and found the lead, some in a bag and some out—it was laid down again by a plumber next day, and fitted perfectly.</p>

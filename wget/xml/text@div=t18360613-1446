                  </hi>. I am assistant warden at the Chapel in Broad Court, Bow Street. On the evening of the 3rd of June, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner at the chapel, and directed him to he shewn into a pew—at that time I saw a Bible, Prayer-book, and Hymn-book in the pew—when the service was over, I saw him leave the pew—I looked for the Bible, and missed it—I followed him out of the chapel into the court, and asked him if he had not got a book, or books which did not belong to him—he took off his has to show me he had got nothing, and said he had got nothing—I brought him into the vestry, and sat him down by the vestry door—he took the Bible out of his small-clothes and put it under the seat—I saw him do that—he stooped down to avoid being seen—he was given in charge, and I gave the Bible to the officer.</p>

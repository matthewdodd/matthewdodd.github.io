                  </hi>. I live at Vauxhall-terrace, Kennington-lane, and am bar<lb></lb>man at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern—last Wednesday week, 10th August, about 4 in the afternoon, I was passing along King-street, Soho, and saw the prisoner Seymour, the young one, going into a doorway with a can in her hand—she said, "Will you walk in;" and I walked into the front parlour on the ground floor—it was a decently-furnished room, but was rather in disorder—there were folding-doors leading into a room behind—Seymour said, "You will excuse the room being in disorder"—that was all that passed; and then the prisoner Beeho came in directly, and asked what business I had there with his wife—I told him that I was not aware she was his wife, or I should not have come in—he did not say anything to that, but directly after Dempsey came in, and said to Beeho, "What is this dis<lb></lb>turbance in my house? you had better leave; pay me my rent, which is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and go"—he then asked me if I would pay the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Beeho—I said I could not—he directly said, "You can; now, sir, I shall be desperate with you," and he seized me by the throat and held me very tight—I said to him," Don't hurt me, and I will give you what money I can"—I took my green purse from my pocket, and he snatched it out of my hand, and took out the contents, which were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a few shillings—he then said, "You have got some more money about you," and he began to rifle me about—he felt something in my waistcoat pocket, and he took out a little tobacco-box, which contained nineteen sovereigns—he went to the window and counted them, and then gave me the empty box back again—Beeho then said, "Now I am not satisfied with you; I shall make you draw up a paper and sign for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—they sent out for a sheet of paper—I told them I could not write it myself, I was in such a trembling state—Beeho</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186408150068"></xptr>
               <p>then wrote on a paper, and it was given to me to sign, but I could not hold the pen—all the prisoners were then in the room—Broughton came in soon after Dempsey—they asked me for an address, and I gave a false one; at Hampstead—afterwards, when I found it was assuming a terrible affair, I gave the right address of my employer, Mr. Garrard—Beeho then drew up another paper, a similar paper, placed it in an envelope, and made me direct it in the best way I could—it was done in such a manner that my employer could not understand it—I have not seen either of those papers since—I did not sign this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); I only directed the envelope—this paper is what Beeho drew up for me to sign—I think this was the first—after I had given the correct address the male prisoners went out, after locking me in, with the two women—they said they should not be gone above ten minutes—they returned in about an hour—the women sat still all that time—I don't believe I spoke to them all the time—I was equally in fear with them, as with the men—I don't think I asked them to let me out—I do not recollect doing so—I should think it was near 6 when the men came in again—Dempsey said, "You have told us the truth this time; but you are the landlord, and not that gentleman with the beard"—he then said, "Now, sir, you have got some more money about you;" and they began to rifle about my pockets again—Dempsey felt my watch and chain, which I had slipped down into my fob-pocket, and took it—Beeho was standing over me at the same time, and the women were in the same room—they were all four together—I then said, "Will you now let me go? you have got everything I have got"—they took a newspaper, and some spectacles, and an umbrella, which I had hung up on a shelf, and which was afterwards found in the bed—Dempsey then bundled Beeho and Seymour out into the street, and said, "Get out of my house"—I went too, and Dempsey, and Beeho, and, I think, Seymour, followed me—when we got out they got pushing me along, and asked me if I would have anything to drink—my mouth was so parched up I did not know what to do—they asked if I would have a bottle of lemonade, and I did—I went into a public-house with Dempsey—he had something at the same time; I don't know what—we came out, and Seymour, Dempsey, and Beeho walked with me—Dempsey and Beeho then said, "You had better get on home"—I said, "I will," and I bade them" Good-night," and got away—I should think it must have been near 11 then—I went directly to Vine-street station, and made a complaint there—I gave a description of the house, and I then went there with a policeman—I had no difficulty in finding the place—the policeman knocked at the door—some one tried not to let him in, but be put his toe between the door and went in—I went in after him, and saw Dempsey, Broughton, and Seymour—Beeho was not there—I said, "Those are the three prisoners that I give into custody"—I assisted the policeman in making a search—there was nothing found then of mine, except my umbrella, which was found tucked in the foot of the bed in the front room—there was an area in front of that room, between that and the pavement, and some iron railings—this umbrella, this watch and chain, this newspaper, tobacco-box, purse, and two pairs of spectacles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my property—I know nothing of this pocket-book—I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and a few shillings, in my purse—that is all I have recovered.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186408150069"></xptr>
               <p>the landlady did not—I saw a person distinctly come to the window, previous to the door being opened, and that was Dempsey—that was before Bronghton or Dempsey came in—it was a very small house, I should say—it is not a crowded street—the blinds were up when I went in—I don't know who drew them down, they were drawn down by some one—the front parlour is a bed-room—the window is not two feet from the street—I did not hear persons going up and down the stairs while I was there—I saw some brass plates outside on the door—I did not ask the women to let me go, because I was equally afraid of them as I was of the men—I was afraid of my life—I did not send out for any brandy—I did not give half a crown, or any money to send for some—I think Seymour brought me some pale brandy to drink while I was there—I think it was two half-pints—no, it was only one half-pint—I did not give the money to buy it—I did not take any of the brandy, or brandy and water, I was afraid—I took some of the porter out of the can which Seymour had in her hand when I first came into the house—the other prisoners were not present then—I have a quarterly salary—I do not usually carry such a large sum of money about with me—I had some idea of putting it in the Post-office Saving's bank—I did not do so; I don't know why—I left home about half-past 10 in the morning—I had the money all day—I was out for my holiday—I first walked to Fulham, to a friend of mine, and had two glasses of porter there—I then walked to Mont<lb></lb>pelier-place, and had a pint of cooper, I dare say—I had nothing more than I took any other day—I was not three minutes in the room with Seymour before Beeho came in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMPSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came Beeho to draw up that writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell you—I had been in the room-perhaps half-an-hour before they drew up that—I took the pen in my hand to sign it, but I could not hold it—there were two windows in the room—I was sitting against one of them—it was not open—I would not swear it was not, but I do not think it was—I had my coat on—I had no object in going into King-street that I know of—I almost forget where I was going to—I had no decisive object in view—I was walking about—King-street leads from Newport-market, and from Princes street and Coventry-street—I did not go there as a likely place to find enjoyment—I gave a false address at first, intentionally; I did not wish the case to be known—I knew perfectly well what I was about.</p>

                  </hi> Where did you mean to go when you left home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Out for my holiday—I did think of going to Croydon—I had not made up my mind where to go—I get a holiday once a month—I walked just where I felt disposed—I sometimes put all my money in my pocket when I go out for a holiday—I am not in the habit of following all the young girls I see taking beer into house—I did not go into the Haymarket at all on this day—I am from Fulham—I got out of the omnibus at the top of the Haymarket—it was about half-past 3 then—I then went round Liecester-street, merely for amusement, nothing else—I then turned up a street and came round by Newport-market, and then turned back again and came down King-street, because I had some idea of taking the omnibus to Hampstead—I don't know why I did not—I am quite undecided, when I am out, where I go—I looked at Seymour when I got to the door where she was, and she said, "Will you walk in?"—I did not want pressing, and I went in—I was not in the room three minutes with her before any one came in—I will swear I was not there ten minutes—I did not look at my watch—I would not swear I was not there five, it</p>

               <p>might have been five minutes—she did not say anything during that time; she only apologised for the place being in such disorder—I drank the beer without saying a word—nothing was said about it—nothing passed in that room but what I have told you—I never touched her, or she me—I never spoke to her—I swear I did not pay for a pint of brandy—I swear I did not send the girl for some brandy—I did not say anything to Broughton when she came in—I know now that this house is occupied by several families besides the prisoners—I did not know it then—I did not attempt to cry out the slightest in the world—I stood as quiet as a lamb—I don't think either of the women left the room when I was alone with them—they did not, I will swear that—it was either Dempsey or Beeho pulled the blinds down—that was after they had taken my money—I will swear that I did not pull one of the blinds down myself, I did not touch them—the men must have left between 5 and 6—I don't know what time they returned—they were only gone an hour—I did not look at my watch—I did not wish them to see I had got one—the men left me with the two women about an hour and a half after I first entered the house, I should think—they were not gone much above an hour—they must have been back before 9—I should think they were back by 8—they were not back by 7—they were away between an hour and an hour and a half—I sat still in a chair during that time—I don't recollect whether I spoke to either of the women—I asked one of the male prisoners before they went if I could go into a back room, and I did so, and came back again.</p>

               <p>it was very dark in the passage—I said to the prosecutor, "Do you know anything of this female here," meaning Seymour—he said, "Yes; I think that is the female who took me in,"—I then took her into the parlour, where there was a light, and Broughton and Dempsey were there—the prosecutor said, "Those are the three persons who were in the room, and another man besides"—I then said to Broughton, "What is all this about?" and neither of them made any reply—the prosecutor pointed to Dempsey, and said, "That is the man who took me by the neck and robbed me"—I then sent the prosecutor out for assistance, and told them that they must consider themselves prisoners—I saw Dempsey stand up, put his hand into his breast<lb></lb>pocket, take this watch from it, and pass it to Broughton—he then walked round Seymour and passed something to her—I could not swear what it was—Dempsey then wanted to leave the room, and I said, "You must not leave this room at present, you must consider yourselves as prisoners," then Broughton wanted to go out, and I said, "No; neither of you must leave this room"—during that time I saw Dempsey take this pair of spec<lb></lb>tacles from his trouser's pocket and pass them to Broughton—they fell on the floor through the folds of her dress, and I picked them up—Broughton then took the watch from her dress and passed it back to Dempsey again, and he concealed it under the bed-clothes—I put my hand to take it, and he said, "I have the watch here, I will give it to you, it was left here for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." and I took the watch from his hand—Seymour went into the back room after Dempsey passed something to her—I could not keep them all three together all the time—when two other policeman came I made a search on the table—I found that paper, and in the bed, under the clothes, I found this umbrella concealed—the prosecutor returned with the other policeman and identified the umbrella—I then searched Dempsey and found a purse containing nineteen duplicates, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 41/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. some studs, and a ring for the handkerchief—this is the purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we took them to Vine-street station—the two females were searched by the female searcher—from certain information I received, at 4 o'clock that morning, I went to a coffee-shop in Castle-street, Leicester-square, where I found Beeho in bed, fast asleep, with a female—I woke him up and told him I wanted him on a charge of being concerned, with Dempsey and others in custody, in robbing a Mr. Smith, at 30, King-street, Soho, of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a watch and chain—he said he knew nothing of the robbery, he had sold a dog last night—I searched a coat that was there—the same he has on now, I believe, and found these spec<lb></lb>tacles and this newspaper, and on the table I found a purse containing nineteen duplicates—I took him to the station, made a further search, but found nothing more—at the police-court twelve sovereigns were produced by Sergeant Cole, and two by the female searcher—this small purse and tobacco box were given to me by the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, Vauxhall—Smith, the prosecutor, was and is my barman—on Wednesday, 10th August, he left my house for a holiday—on the evening of that day, about 8 or half-past, I saw the two male prisoners at my house—they brought me a letter—I had great difficulty in reading it—I had not the slightest idea whose writing it was—it was very badly written—I know Smith's handwriting—it was very different from his usual writing—the prisoners said that they had brought it from a man named Smith, and described him, so that I thought it was my barman—Beeho said it was about a bill of exchange for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I knew nothing at all about it—the letter</p>

About 12 o'clock, on Thursday, the 11th, I had charge of Broughton in the prisoners' waiting-room at the Mary<lb></lb>lebone Police-court—I noticed that she had something in her left hand, which appeared to be a dirty white pocket-handkerchief wrapped up very closely—I saw her put her hand towards her mouth—I said, "What have you got in your mouth? open it"—she did so, and I saw nothing in it—I then said, "Open your hand; what have you got there?"—she did, and I saw nothing in it—I kept her closely under observation, and followed her across the yard leading to the cells—when she got into the passage of the cells, Seymour was about being placed in one of the cells by the gaoler, and I saw Broughton put her left hand close to the right side of Seymour's dress, and I then heard something drop—on looking on the ground I saw this farthing—I then laid hold of her left hand, and said, "Hulloa, what's this?" and found the twelve sovereigns now produced, wrapped up in this old piece of rag—she said, "That is my money, sir; I received it of my lawyer about a week ago"—I had known Broughton many years before this—I know Seymour is not Dempsey's wife.</p>

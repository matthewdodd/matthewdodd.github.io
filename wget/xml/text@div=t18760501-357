                  </hi>. I live at 128, Drury Lane, and am a labourer, engaged, on the Law Courts—on the Thursday night previous to Easter, I had been paid—I Cannot say whether it was 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was my week's;</p>

            . I arrived the first of March at London from Paris; the prisoner came along with me. I lodged at the house of Mr. Lewis, a surgeon, in <placeName id="t17520625-7-crimeloc38">Jermyn-street St. James's</placeName>

The prisoner desired leave to lodge in the same house that my servants might be of use to him, he not understanding English; so he lodged in the garret. I had 70 guineas, a picture of my wife, and other trifles in a strong box in the dining room. The money was put in between the 2d of March and the 22d of May. I went out of town the 21st of May for Dorsetshire ; when I returned on the 24th I was told my box was gone, and it was found in the Park in a pond, and two letters in it directed to me, by which means it was brought to my lodgings. The prisoner was gone out to dress a dinner on the prince of Wales's birth-day. When he returned I had him taken up; the constable found 66 guineas in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175206250006"></xptr> purse in his pocket. He confessed in what manner he had taken the box out of my room; that on the Friday morning he carried it up into his own room, where he broke it open and took out the money, but nothing else; and in the evening he carried the box into the park and threw it into a pond.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you this without your making use of promises or threats ?</p>
               <p>Pitt. He did, my lord, he had little or no money of his own.</p>

            . Mr. Pitt lodged at my house, so did the prisoner. After the box was found the prisoner was searched in my house on Sunday the 24th of May in the afternoon; the constable found 66 guineas in his pocket. Mr. Pitt had been out of town about three or four days, and was returned that day. I heard the prisoner confess he went down from the garret to Mr. Pitt's room and took the box up into his own, then he went down for a hammer, with which he broke it open. I think he said he took the money out, but am not positive. Then he said he threw it into a pool in the Park.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess in French or English?</p>

I carried it home and advertised it. The prisoner had nothing to say.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 233). I was on duty, in High-street, Stratford, about 9 o'clock at night, on 29th April—I saw the prisoner coming towards Bow—when he passed me he turned a corner, and as he turned I saw he had something under his smock frock—he went down a street into the Marsh, and I concealed myself in a corner till he came up again, and went towards Bow; I followed him, and took him into custody—I said, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">Sam!</hi> what have you got here?—I looked into a basket which he had, and saw the tap and lead pipe in it—he said, "I found it"—I locked him up, on suspicion—the pipe had the appearance of having been cut or jammed off, and it appeared fresh done—I took the pipe to the station, and the next morning we made inquiries.</p>

I went to the Green Man, and made inquiries; and in consequence of what I heard there, I saw Mr. Pool—I had some conversation with him, and I took a piece of pipe which I received from South, and compared it with some on his premises—I found some lead pipe had been taken from there—I compared this piece with what was left—it fits exactly with this other—it was broken off quite into the ground.</p>

I keep the Green Man, I missed a brass tap and some leaden pipe from the supply pipe from the water butt in the yard—I became aware of it on Sunday morning—I should think six or seven feet was missing—the pipe came out of the ground, and was wrenched off close by the ground—Benton brought this pipe to me—this part of the pipe (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) came round the wall, and it burst with the frost—I cut it off, and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I picked it up in the road, and intended to take it to the police station—I had not been out of my own door ten minutes before I found it.</p>

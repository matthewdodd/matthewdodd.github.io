            . I am a decorative painter - I live in Great Tichfield-street. I went to Rowney and Forster's, on the 17th of February; I purchased some articles of the prisoner, which came to 10s. 3d;. I paid for them, and took them away; he gave me this small memorandum, which I saw him write; it was in the middle of the afternoon, but I cannot say what time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were there any other young men in the shop? - A. I did not see any - I was not acquainted with him before; I was not long in the shop; there is no date to this bill of parcel; I know it was the 17th of February; I took particular notice of the day - Mr. Rowney passed through the shop at the time: I have no doubt the prisoner is the person.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Do you remember the 17th of February? - A. Yes, perfectly well. I was not at home when Mr. Newton came; I looked at the till about half-past two or three o'clock that day; I found some money in it; the till-book and the contents of the till agreed; I looked again in three-quarters of an hour or an hour, and found the money precisely as before, or within sixpeace, and still agreeing with the book: this paper is the prisoner's writing; the till-book is here, and it was his duty to enter in that till-book all he received: here is no amount of 10s. 3d. that day - the entries in the prisoner's hand-writing that day are only two - "Colour 1s., and L. B. d., which means London Board, 7d."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it usual for your shopmen to give a memorandum of this kind when no receipt is required? - A. If it is asked for. We have twelve men in our employ, but only two men regularly attend in the shop; Mr. Rowney and myself attend when we are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090018"></xptr>there; there was only a young man of the name of Phipps and the prisoner that attended in the shop at that time; the others do not know the prices of the articles; Mrs. Rowney balances the till, because I do not reside on the premises, and Mr. Rowney was at that time on a journey: letters, lamp oil, and a variety of other things are paid for out of the till; they should be put down in the book, and frequently they are. Mrs. Rowney balances the till every day when she is there in almost every instance; she has omitted it; the money is taken out of the till every Monday morning, and those little things are deducted. If there is no mistake; expenses may be paid out of the till without being put down - money has occasionally been borrowed from the till for the house, and a memorandum was then put into the till; such a thing as an omission may have been made - it has occurred that there has been more money in the till than was entered in the till-book; we sometimes take money in the shop, and do not put it down; I cannot account for more money being in the till than was put down, except from the confusion attending the establishment.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you pay the prisoner? A. We paid him 100l. a-year, quarterly - the till is balanced every morning, ninety-nine times out of a hundred; it was his duty to put down the money he took - we are not in a very large way of business.</p>

               <p>MRS. ROWNEY. It is my habit to compare the contents of the till with the till-book every morning - I did so on the morning after the 17th of February; I found it correct - if there had been 10s. 3d. more in the till than in the book I should have found it out, most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you do that every morning regularly? A. when I am in town; I never omit it except I am ill - Mr. Forster then does it; it has happened that there has been more money in the till than appeared in the book - perhaps once a month; I will swear it has not happened once a week - I do not think it has; money may have been taken for letters and other things, and not be entered in the book - it has not been customary to take money for household expences out of the till; it may have been done without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. PAYNE. Q. Are there any expences entered that day? A. Yes; it is the prisoner's duty to put all the money be received into the till.</p>

            . I was porter to the prosecutor at the time the prisoner lived there - he was in the habit of giving me goods to take out; he sent me on the 18th of February to Mr. Egles, in Newman-street - I delivered the goods, and received 14s. 6d., which I delivered to the prisoner; I cannot say what it was for - the parcel I carried was about the size of a portfolio.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you give a receipt? A. Yes; the prisoner gave me the receipt - this is the receipt and bill of parcel; I particularly remember the day - I took nothing home for the use of the shop that day, I am quite sure; I was sometimes in the habit of fetching oil for the shop, but that was in the morning, before I went to the City - I never had, or scarcely ever had, to lay out money; on that day I did not - when I have deposited my master's goods I have never paid for articles out of the money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you have gone out and received money, have you spent any part of that money for the benefit of the shop? A. No - when I was ordered to bring things home they used to give me the money to bring them: I never paid for them out of that money.</p>

               <p>MR. PAYNE. Q. Have you a distinct recollection of paying the 14s. 6d. to the prisoner? A. Yes; I have occasionally bought oil for the shop, and they have given me the money.</p>

             re-examined. Q. On the 18th of February do you find any entries of folios in the prisoner's hand-writing? A. Yes, "folios 11s. 6d."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is this the original book, or is there a waste-book? A. There is no waste-book previous to this, in which we enter money taken at the counter; if the porter goes out with goods, and returns with money, it is entered in this book, and very frequently no memorandum is taken of it - there is no book in which this entry ought to appear before it appears here; as the goods were sent out they ought to have been entered on a memorandum paper - the paper ought to lay on the counter; those entries on the 18th of February are some of them my writing, some the prisoners, and some another young man's, and the entries on the 17th are in three different hands - as this was a ready money transaction there is no other book in which it should be entered; we have a waste-book in which we enter things we do not expect to be paid for - the waste-book is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When there is credit given. you enter it in the waste-book? A. Yes, but it does not contain an account of all the sums received or credited, only credit accounts; except a party pays money, whom we do not expect to pay it, then it is entered in the waste-book.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the deficiency must have arisen by his having omitted to enter cash for articles paid for on the house account.</p>

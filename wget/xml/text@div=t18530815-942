                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, employed at Mr. Thompson's, in Cheapside. On Sunday, 31st July, at a quarter to 10 o'clock, I was at the Woolwich station of the Eastern Counties Railway—after I had passed the barrier where the crowd was my watch was safe, but as I was getting into a carriage I felt a hand at my watch; I caught the hand—it was the prisoner's—I held it till I gave him in charge—when the railway inspector came up, the prisoner held out his left hand, pointed to the platform, and said, "What is that lying there?" and I saw my watch on the platform, about three yards from me—the glass was broken, and the ring was missing—it was worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Brunswick-square, Commercial-road. On Saturday night, the 29th of January, about ten o'clock, Ann Witherfield came to my house with a gentleman—her real name was Ann, but as that was also my name she was called Charlotte—the prisoner and his wife lodged in the house—Mrs. Taylor sent me to the Red Lion public-house, to fetch the prisoner home—Ann Witherfield went with me—I did not find him there, but about half-past eleven he came in, and said, "I understand you have been to the b—y public-house for me?"—I said, "Yes"—he said he supposed I came after my rent—I said no, I looked to his wife for that, and not to him—he was intoxicated, I was perfectly sober—he said he bad plenty of money about him, about 22., but would not pay me a farthing—he used rather rough language—I said I did not want the rent, but he bad much better pay a trifle out of 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which his wife owed—he then struck me on the mouth, and made it bleed—his wife said, "Oh! William, don't strike Ann like that"—he immediately struck his wife—Ann Witherfield then said, "Oh, you wretch, to strike a woman like that! you ought to be ashamed of yourself"—he asked what business it was of hers, and struck her about the head, and on the right side of her cheek—she received a bruise on the right jaw, and another bruise—he struck her with his doubled fist—he had nothing in his hand—I immedi<lb></lb>ately called out for the police—three policemen came directly, and I gave him in charge for beating us all three—Witherfield was rather poorly before this happened—she mostly suffered from rheumatism—there was nothing the matter with her head or face before—the prisoner asked his wife to go with him, but she would not, saying he would ill-use her if she did—I said she need not go, but out of the house he should go—he left with the policemen—I went out afterwards to get some vegetables with Witherfield—we returned about a quarter or half-past one, and heard the prisoner</p>

               <p>up stairs—I went up, and said he should not stop there—he said he would—I took the bed-clothes off, and <hi rend="italic">shyed</hi> them down stairs—he was not on the bed—he said, "You mean that, do you?" and said he would kick me down if I did not go down—he attempted to strike me, and Witherfield ran up stairs, as I had called out—she said, "Ann is not capable of taking her own part, you shan't strike her"—she got between us—he immediately said, "Oh, you b—y wretch, if you do not go out of this room, I will kick you down!"—he immediately struck her violently with his fist, about the head and temple, from the ear to the lower part of the throat—she fell against the washhand-stand, and bled violently at the mouth—I ran down stairs, and before I could get the street-door open she came down—I thought it was the prisoner—I ran into the parlour, and it was her—she said, "Oh, Ann, I fear he has murdered me!"—I had no time to answer her before the prisoner came into the parlour—I said if he offered to strike either of us again, I would cut him down with a candlestick—I took it up, and do not know whether I struck him or not in my flurry—we had a scuffle for the candlestick, and he took it from me—he went to strike me over the head with it—Witherfield held up her right hand to prevent him, and received two cuts across the knuckles of her right hand, and a bruise on the back of that hand—we both went to bed together about a quarter to two—I looked over her head, but saw no cuts—I found a bruise on the left temple, and a swelling from the ear to the throat—she wanted vinegar, as she said she could scarcely turn her head—I said I had none, but would get some in the morning—there was no cut except in the mouth—she complained of her poor head all night, and continued to get worse till she died, which was about a quarter-past eight on Monday morning—she had been drinking that night with a gentleman, and bad a little too much, but not so as not to know what she was about—she was rather tipsy—I was sober—she had a bruise on the right side of her cheek, her right jaw, and on the left side of the temple—she had none of these appearances before he struck her.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184202280007"></xptr>
               <p>Sunday night—I found her complaining of violent pains in the face, head, and neck—I examined her head, and found many contusions about the forehead, temple, and face—I attended her again about six on Monday morning—I then found her in a state of stupor—I applied external appli<lb></lb>cations only on the first visit, not apprehending them so dangerous as they appeared afterwards—on the second occasion I used no applications—I found the patient sinking very fast—I did not see her when she died—I saw her after death, about nine in the morning—Mr. Guraey and myself made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—on opening the head, under the mem<lb></lb>brane of the brain I found a large quantity, about four ounces, of congratu<lb></lb>lated blood on the surface of the brain, on the right side—I separated the hemisphere of the brain, and in the ventricle of the brain J found a portion of serum—a larger portion than usual—my opinion is, that rupture of the vessels of the brain was the immediate cause of death—the contusions were chiefly on the right side of the head—there were some on the left side, but they were comparatively slight—judging from the external marks of con<lb></lb>tusion, and the internal state of the head and brain, I have no doubt what was the cause of death—there was quite sufficient to account for death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you a member of the College of Surgeons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it must have been a very severe blow to produce such appear<lb></lb>ances as I found—this was the result of rupture of the blood-vessels of the brain—it does not follow that she would die immediately upon that rup<lb></lb>ture—I have opened a body before—if she had been bled immediately after receiving the injury she probably might have done well, bat I cannot distinctly state that—I should say the neglect that followed in a great measure caused her death—if immediate remedies had been applied she would probably have recovered—there may be some doubt about that—it would be presumptuous to say so positively, but it might have been the case if four or five ounces of blood had been taken from her arm, or if leeches had been applied to the temples immediately—I am aware that the body will exhibit sympathetic injuries from blows inflicted on opposite sides—her cheek-bone was broken, and the jaw bruised, but that had no<lb></lb>thing to do with the cause of death—I had seen her occasionally before—she bad not been a patient of mine—she came to my shop for trifling things which she required—I have heard that she was subject to rheumatic pains in her head—indeed she had been in a delicate state of health for twelve months, to my knowledge—I could not judge from examining the body whether she had been subject to rheumatic pains of her head—she, an unfortunate girl, and I have heard, of a violent disposition, but I never saw her in any <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—great personal excitement would account for much of what I saw, and if she was drunk it would rather have contributed to it—I should say blows inflicted by a fist on the head was the cause of what I saw, no other violence being used—I think it probable that the congratu<lb></lb>lated blood was accumulating for twenty-four or twenty-five hours from the time the injury was received—if it had followed immediately, she would have lost all consciousness at once—if assistance had been rendered to her within three or four hours, I think the great probability is that she would have recovered.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184202280008"></xptr>
               <p>contusions on the integuments covering the lower jaw—the fingers of the right hand were lacerated, and there were bruises on the shins—on remov<lb></lb>ing the skull I found the external membrane of the brain in a very vascular state, of a deep colour; and immediately under that, on the right side, was a large quantity of coagulated blood, from three to four ounces—I consider the pressure of blood on the brain caused death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

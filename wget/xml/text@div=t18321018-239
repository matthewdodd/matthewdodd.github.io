            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 5th of October, at work at another shop - I asked where he kept his duplicates; he said he had but one, and that he gave to the prosecutor's wife - it was for the collar and mandle.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day he got my signature to the book, he got a stranger to witness it; after I signed it I brought home work, which he cannot deny; he said,"I have your signature, and you are paid;" I said, "I am not paid for these draw-knots;" he said I should be paid another time - I often had goods given me to pledge, to raise money to pay the men.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BRADICK. I never let him go without the whole of his money; if I was short, I let it go, perhaps, a week - I was in trouble about an action, and the person I left in charge of my business, took his signature; I never asked him for it myself - he did not turn sixteen dozen of draw-knots for me.</p>

            . I am a porter. I have been in Bradick's employ nine months; he authorized the prisoner to pawn the tools on account of the non-payment of his money, and he owes me money for labour - I have heard him tell the prisoner to pledge his tools, and offer him money afterwards to redeem them; he was taken to the Marshalsea-prison, and owes me 12s.; he sent the prisoner to pawn a top and box-rests, and things- I never heard him authorize the prisoner to pledge, but he knew it was done, and gave him money to redeem them.</p>
               <p> - FORD. I am a bedstead-maker. The prosecutor called at my shop between nine and ten months ago, and asked if I had seen Leary, as he had pawned some of his tools, and he wanted him to get them out again.</p>
               <p>JOHN HILL re-examined. I know the prosecutor has authorized the prisoner to pawn his own apparel, but I cannot speak about these articles - when he could not get his pay he has made a piece of work, and the prosecutor has offered him his apparel to pledge.</p>

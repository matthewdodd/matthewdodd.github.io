            . I am an officer. I was on duty in Piccadilly; I saw the prisoner and another follow the prosecutor and a lady: they went on, and sat down on a step- I walked down Hay-hill, and saw them again following the prosecutor; and near a gas-light, I saw the prisoner draw a handkerchief from the prosecutor, and put it under his coat; I ran over to cut him off from Lansdownpassage; he then turned round, and went round the inside of the square, near the rails - I ran and took him; the handkerchief had dropped a little before he came to the dark part of the square; I then went back to the place where I saw the handkerchief fall, but it was gone, and has not been seen since; I am quite sure the prisoner took it from the pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to get a drop of water from the pump; he came and said I had got the handkerchief. <rs id="t18280911-287-verdict1473" type="verdictDescription">

Then he turned to me, and said Damn you, your Money, or you are a dead Woman. I gave him half a Crown; he took it, and said, this is not all; Damn you, give me the rest, and with that he took from me 3 s. more, and a Key, and then ran away over a Field. I kept my Eye upon him all the while, till he dropt in a Ditch. Some Men coming along, we told them we had been robb'd, and they pursu'd the Prisoner and took him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Williams. My Cousin Gregory and I came from Hampstead together, and I being foremost was crossing a Bridge, when the Prisoner stept out, and as soon as I got over the Bridge, he damn'd my Blood, and demanded my Money. I told him I was a poor Woman, and had but three Farthings. He pray'd the Lord to damn the three Farthings and so went to my Cousin, who was then upon the Bridge, and damn'd her, and demanded her Money. I bid him have a care what he did, for we had Company behind, and so I called John! and Dick! The Prisoner pray'd God to Damn John and Dick, and swore he would have my Cousin's Money, or she was a dead Woman. And while he was robbing her, he dropt his Stick in the Water. I stoop'd and took it up, and was going to give him a Knock; but seeing 2 Men at a distance, I call'd to them, and dropt the Stick : The Prisoner took it up, and ran down the Turnpike Path. You Dog, says I, I'll have you still. The Men coming up, pursu'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173402270006"></xptr> him, and we follow'd them, and so they took him in the Ditch.</p>

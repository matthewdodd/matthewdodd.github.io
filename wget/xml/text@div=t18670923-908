                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at High Street, Deptford—the prisoner previous to this time has been a lodger in my house—on the 1st September, about a quarter to twelve, we had our supper; the prisoner sat down to the same table—my child Alice Coen was present—after the supper things were cleared away the prisoner put a question to me and I was not willing to consent to it—I believe he was sober at the time—when I told him I would not comply he said, "I will take your life before you leave the room"—I did not see at that time whether he had a knife in his hand—he put the question to me again, and when I said I would not he said, "I will murder you before you leave tht room"—he then went into the kitchen—I took advantage of his absence to leave the house—we got into the passage—my child was with me—when we got into the passage the prisoner called out, "Is that you, you b----s?"—I ran as fast as I could with the child, and the prisoner followed—when I got into the street I fell down with her—the prisoner stood over us—my child called out, "Murder!"—the prisoner left—after he had gone I observed blood flowing from my child's head—when I got indoors she was covered with blood—the police were sent for and she was taken to a doctor's—the prisoner was afterwards given into custody—it was dark when it occurred.</p>

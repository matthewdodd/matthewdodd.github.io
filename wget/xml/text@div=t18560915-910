                  </hi>. I am colour sergeant of the fifth company of the eleventh battalion of Royal Artillery. The prisoner was a gunner in that company—he was considered as a single man, up to 4th July—on the 4th or 5th, he presented himself to me as a married man, and wished to be taken before the captain—I took him before the captain, in consequence of that—he said he was married—upon that statement the captain gave him leave to reside out of the barracks, and to have the other privileges of a married man—that was upon condition of his producing his marriage certi<lb></lb>ficate—from that time he slept out of the barracks—a day or two after, I asked him for the certificate, and told him to give it to the pay sergeant, Dundas—he said he had lost them, meaning the <hi rend="italic">lines</hi>, bat that he would procure another copy from Greenwich.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the pay sergeant of the fifth company of Royal Artillery. About 7th July last, in consequence of what the last witness told me, I went to the prisoner's quarters—he was not there, but I after<lb></lb>wards met him in the street—I told him I required a copy of his marriage certificate—he said he would let me have it—he said they (<hi rend="italic">the lines</hi>) were lost, but he would procure them from Greenwich—he said he would bring them the following morning—I told him J should be forced to confine him</p>

               <p>if he did not produce them—several days after this I spoke to him again—in the interval he came to me for half a crown, to go to get the certificate—I told him I could not do it—he produced the certificate after I had confined him—that was after reporting to the captain that I had not received it—on 30th July I went to him where he was in confinement in consequence of a communication from a woman who called herself his wife—I told him I required the certificate of his marriage—he produced this certificate, just as it is, with the exception of what is written in red ink—I noticed that the names were written on erasures—I said to him at the time, "You are in a pretty mess now!"—after I had reported to the captain, inquiries were directed to be made, and he was taken to the station house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am parish clerk of the parish of Stepney. I produce the marriage register book for 1855—in page 242 there is an entry of the marriage of John Brown Williams and Eliza Wilkinson—I was a sub<lb></lb>scribing witness to it, this certificate was a true copy of that entry—I since I issued it, the name of John Brown Williams has been erased, and the prisoner's name substituted—the date has been altered <hi rend="italic">from</hi> 30th May, 1855, to 18th Oct., 1855—it bears the signature of Mr. Eastman, who was curate then, but in Oct. Mr. Eastman was not curate.</p>

"About twelve months ago, while on duty at Woolwich, I met with Maria Wilkinson, widow; about a month after, I was sent to the Crimea, and while away I supported her, by sending her half of my pay, and on my return it was my intention to have got married, as soon as I got the means; knowing my intentions, I obtained leave to live out of the barracks, as a married man, with this my intended wife; but the captain requesting me to show him my marriage certificate, and telling me unless I did he would confine me to the barracks, and not having time allowed to me by the captain to get married and produce my certifi<lb></lb>cate, I had recourse to the following means: my intended wife got permis<lb></lb>sion from a person whom she knew, to get their marriage certificate, and I then caused the man's name to be erased, and placed my own in the place of it; my intentions to my intended wife <hi rend="italic">was</hi> fair and honourable, and I had not the least idea that I was doing wrong when I permitted this to be done; I am an uneducated man, I never intended to injure any person by what I was doing.")</p>

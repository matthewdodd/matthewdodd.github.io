I fastened the door and went up stairs to go to bed again; I saw the prisoner get up into his cart again and drive off - there was another person in the cart, but I do not know who; I came down again in about an hour, and found the harness in the stable - it had been put in after I went up stairs; part of it was in a sack, and part had come out of the sack; Layton, who I did not know before came to my house some time afterwards; I was not at home, but came in while he was there - he said "I have come on an unpleasant business, about this harness;" he took it away and I went before the Magistrate; the prisoner and Dexter were committed; I had used the saddle of this harness for I had a resolute horse in my cart, which broke a part of my harness and the shaft of the cart, and the next morning I sent my boy to harness the horse, and he put the saddle of this harness upon him.</p>

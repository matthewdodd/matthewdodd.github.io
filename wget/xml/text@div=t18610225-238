                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Richard Simkin, the landlord of the Fountain public-house, King-street, Long-acre—on 21st February, about 10 o'clock in the day, the prisoners came into my father's house—Donovan came in first, before the soldier came in—he asked for a pot of ale—I gave it him and he paid me with good money—I cannot remember what it was he gave me—just before he asked for the ale Collins came in and whispered to him—they drank the beer together—during the course of the day they came in together frequently—Donovan came in again with two men, strangers to him, and asked for a pot of ale—he paid for it with a shilling—I put that shilling in the till-there was no other money in that till—Collins came through the other side of the bar, but went out again</p>

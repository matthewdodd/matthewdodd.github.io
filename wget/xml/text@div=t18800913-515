               <p>and in a second kitchen I found Harriss in a stooping position, with his hands all over blood—I took hold of him and led him to the door—he struck me a violent blow, which knocked me into a brown pan and loosened my teeth—he was taken in custody—I said "Here is your jacket," and handed it to him—he said "That is not my jacket"—I said "We will take care of it"—I found this wool in the pocket—I found two large knives in the kitchen—Harriss said "I have had enough of you, I will go quietly"—I gave him his boots, and he put them on.</p>

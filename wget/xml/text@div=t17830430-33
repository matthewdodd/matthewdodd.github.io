               <p>As I was going into the shop, the prisoner was behind the counter, and I asked her what she wanted, and she said, she wanted a halfpenny worth of packthread; I told her I did not believe they sold packthread there; I called out halloo, at last the maid came out, says I, do you sell packthread here, and I said, I believe the prisoner had something about her that was not her own, I will take her backwards and see what she has got, as I was taking her, she undid her apron and threw the brushes down upon the floor; I cannot tell the name of the brushes, there is some of all sorts.</p>

               <p>On Friday in the afternoon about five, I went into the shop for a halfpenny worth of packthread, I knew they sold it, I sell fruit and things in Covent-garden; the door was shut, I pushed the door, and it went back with force; I heard a noise, then I turned my head round, and I saw it was a whole heap of brushes, I was as far off them as I am to one of them candles, I should not have known what to have done with them if I had them; five weeks I have been in gaol. I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Leader. Where were the brushes laying? - They laid on a shelf behind the counter, I had just had a counter made the whole length of the shop, and in the middle of the counter a flap made to turn up with hinges, and a little door to shut and bolt, she opened the counter, unbolted the door, and took the brushes off the shelf and shot them down by the yard door.</p>

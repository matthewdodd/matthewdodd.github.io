I live at 3, Down's Place, Shacklewell—on 17th August, about six p.m., I was in my kitchen—I had a full view of the front door, and saw the prisoner Harper bring a sack of shavings, and put it against my door—the sack was set on fire, but I did not see either of the prisoners light it—it was lighted when she brought it—she brought it from the palings by my garden, about seven yards off—there were about 200 people in the street shouting—I did not see anybody bring it to the fence—I could not hear what Mrs. Harper said, but it was something very awful, and she put her fist up towards the window just by the door—I could not hear what she said, because I was inside the house—I Was at the window—I gave her in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a daughter of the last witness, and live with him—on the 17th August, about six o'clock, I was peeping out at the side of the kitchen window—I had drawn the blind down, as I was frightened, because Mrs. Harper came up about ten minutes to six, when I was mangling at the window, and put her first in, and said that she would smash all the b—windows, and put a piece of steel across my throat if I went out—I went into the back room, as I was frightened, and said, "Mother," she said, "Go and draw down the curtain if yen are frightened"—Mrs. Harper went away then, when she found nobody was there—there was only one there then—I did not see where she went to—when I went back to the front window I saw a sack of shavings brought round the corner by women, but I do not know who; but I saw Mrs. Harper holding it over our fence, and Anna Hitchcock struck a match and put it to the shaving in the middle of the bag, where there was a hole—Mrs. Harper then ran with it to our door in a blaze, and placed it on our doorstep.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> So that when the door was opened it fell in—it was placed upright—I screamed, and my sister, who was very close against the door, opened it directly, and she rolled it over—it fell in—it was not burning when it fell in, my sister rolled it over too quick—it was blazing when it fell in, but I think, it must have been damp—my sister rolled it over into the street back again—there Were many people about—I heard Mrs. Harper say that she would put a piece of steel across my throat if I went up the street, and she said, "I will burn them out."</p>

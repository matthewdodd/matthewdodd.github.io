                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Shepherd's Bush. I got into an omnibus there, on the 23rd of March, at twelve o'clock in the day—I had a reticule on my arm—it contained a purse, with a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—the conductor assisted me to get in and I think it was the prisoner—I believe my reticule dropped from my arm, for as soon as I got in I looked for it, and it was, gone—I believe the pri<lb></lb>soner was then getting on the top of the omnibus—I have never seen my reticule since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at a public-house at Shepherd's Bush. I remember the prosecutrix getting into the omnibus on Saturday, the 23rd of March—the prisoner was near the door—I saw her drop the reticule, and the prisoner picked it up—I saw him put it into his pocket—he then got on the omnibus again—he was not the conductor, he was a stranger—I am sure he is the man.</p>

I live with Mr. Wheatley, the market-gardener—I am fourteen years old—as far at I can tell, the prisoner is the man—I was taking care of a child at the time—I told my mistress of it the same day—I never saw him again till I went before the magistrate—I had never seen him before that day.</p>

I went to Venables' house, the night I took the prisoners, to inquire if he knew anything concerning their character, or if he was aware that she lived with him—he could give me no information, and I went away—he told me he knew him when he went into the country, and he had been out hopping—I have no recollection of telling him he could get 5<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>, a-day if he came against you—I think I said if we required him we should send from Queen-square for him as a witness, if the Magistrate required it; but as he could not prove they lived together, I thought it would be unnecessary, but I told him to be in. the way—I have no recollection of mentioning the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I have no recollection—I told him to be in the way, and if the Magistrate thought it necessary I would come for him—a good deal of discourse passed, as I wanted to know whe<lb></lb>ther he knew him, and whether they both lived together—I have no recol<lb></lb>lection of telling him he should have 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day if he came against the prisoner—I cannot exactly say I did not—I did not take him to a gin-shop, to drink, but he took me—he came out, and was inquiring about the case, and he said, "Will you have a glass of gin? " or ale, I think it was, and I went, and had a glass of gin or ale with him, but nothing passed that I am aware of—I was about four or five minutes with him in the gin-shop—it might be three minutes—our long conversation was in his house—I ascer<lb></lb>tained he would be of no use as a witness before I went into the gin-shop—I went with him because he asked me more than once or twice—I am not positive I did not tell him he would have 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day if he came as a witness against the prisoner—I would not undertake to say I did not, until I re<lb></lb>member a little more—(<hi rend="italic">pausing</hi>)—I have no recollection of it.</p>

I first saw the policeman in the pas<lb></lb>sage—I was going across the court to go into my mother's, and a man said, "Somebody wants you"—I said, "Who wants me? " and I poked my hand into a policeman's hands, who was not in a police dress—they both came up, and were in my place about ten minutes—they told me what they wanted—I came down stairs, and this man said to me, "It is a cold night; cannot you stand something to drink? "—I said, "I don't mind, " and I went, and stood a quarter of gin with him and the other policeman—we were in the public-house nearly half-an-hour while the other police<lb></lb>man was talking to another person—this man and me and my wife were talking together—on the next Monday evening this policeman came up again to my room, and was there about an hour and a half—it was just a week after the prisoner was taken—he eat there talking, and said, "If you can find out any thing respecting them it is better pay than for felony, it is 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>, I can't say which—I have three more witnesses who can prove it at home"—I said, "If I can do the prisoner any good I don't want money"—he said, "No, but it is your lose of time"—I said, "I don't mind that."</p>

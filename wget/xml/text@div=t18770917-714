I live at 16, Prospect Terrace, Gray's Inn Road—on Sunday morning 16th September, at 1.45 I went to a refreshment stall, at the corner of Seymour Street, Euston Square—I had 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. tied up in my pocket-handkerchief which I put in my breast—the prisoner was at the stall—I paid for my refreshment and walked away—the prisoner followed me and shoved against me—I said "I beg pardon, what are you doing that for?"—he said "Who are you talking to," knocked me down, kicked me on the mouth, knocking out a tooth, put his hand in my bosom, took the money and ran away—no one else was near me; a policeman brought him back two or three minutes afterwards and I identified him—there were other people at the refreshment stall, but I do not suppose they were with him.</p>

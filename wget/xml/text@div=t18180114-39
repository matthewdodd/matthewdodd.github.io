On Monday morning last, the 12th of January, a little after nine o'clock, I was in bed unwell, and heard the report of fire-arms so close together, that I apprehended some gentlemen were fighting a duel. I opened my window, and saw four gentlemen in the field opposite my house; two stood at stationary distances, and two together on the left of them; they were about twelve or thirteen yards apart. I dressed myself as fast as possible; they were fifty yards or more from my house; it was not a clear morning. Just as I got over the field-gate I heard the report of two other pistols, and saw one of the gentlemen make a kind of a turn, which induced me to suppose he had been hit; the other gentlemen immediately run to him, he took hold of two of their arms, and all four advanced towards me. My intention was to stop them if I had been in time. When I met them, the deceased had got his waistcoat and pantaloons unbuttoned; I have since learned his name is 
               <persName id="t18180114-39-person333">
                  Edward

            . I observed to them that it was an unfortunate affair; one of them said "Yes, it is; it was not our quarrel originally, we are all friends;" they all assented to what he said. They said they were to be seconds the preceding morning in another quarrel, which occasioned this; they anxiously enquired for a house where they could take the deceased - I offered mine, they took him there; they also anxiously enquired if a surgeon could be immediately obtained for the gentleman; I directly sent to Hampstead for Mr. Rodd. Mr. Bailey was taken into my parlour, and placed on a sofa. In about half an hour Mr. Rodd came; the deceased was still alive; Mr. Rodd extracted a ball from his left side. Before Mr. Rodd came, and soon after he was placed on the sofa, he called Mr. O'Callaghan to him; he appeared in great agony; he desired him to shake hands with him, stating that he freely forgave him, that every thing had been conducted most honourably, and asked him, if he had been in his place, would he have done so? Mr. O'Callaghan replied, "Yes, my dear fellow, I wish I had been wounded instead of you; I felt your first ball about my legs, I wish it had taken effect, for that would have put a stop to it - I wish I had been wounded." Mr.O'Callaghan exhibited his trowsers, which were both cut through at the legs, and one of his boots, apparently by a ball. After that Mr. O'Callaghan went to Hampstead, to procure a coach; he brought one, and afterwards went to Chalk Farm, with Mr. Newbold, to get Mr. Bailey a lodging. After Mr. Rodd had examined and found Mr. Bailey in a dangerous state, he advised him, if he had any thing to communicate, to see his friends; he named Mr. Phelan; we left him with him-about ten minutes after which, Mr. Phelan went to twon, to execute some commissions for him; after which I asked Mr. Phelan, and the other prisoners, if they meant to meet the thing? Mr. Bailey being under apprehension, and having declared in their presence, that he could not live, Mr. Rodd had also declared it in their presence-the prisoners were all fully aware of the dangerous situation of the deceased; I asked them if they meant to meet it? they all replied,"Most certainly," and wrote me their names and addresses themselves. I sent for an officer, two of them surrendered, and so did Mr. Phelan when he returned from town; they had said they meant to meet it before he went to town. About two hours after the first shaking hands between the deceased and Mr. O'Callaghan, he called Mr. O'C. to him again, desiring him to take his hand and rub it in a particular position, as he found ease from it; he did so for a considerable time, and then the other prisoners did the same; all of them shewed every possible attention to him, and appeared exceedingly affected; Mr. Newbold cried bitterly; the other two shed tears. Mr. Bailey lived three or four hours, and then died.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was not something else said by the deceased in the course of the morning - A. Yes; he said, "God bless you all, and I thank you for your attention." I did not see the hands that fired the two first shots; the second time that I heard the report, as I was getting over the gate, I saw smoke about two or three hundred yards up in the air-it came from the spot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any person actually fire any pistol - A. Before I left my room, I saw a pistol fired over the hedge, quite away from every body - I was not near enough to see who fired it.</p>
               <p>Q. After you saw the pistol fired over the hedge, did you see any thing else - A. When I saw the four persons I observed nothing particular till I got into the field myself.</p>
               <p>Q. At what period was it that you saw two persons at stationary distances, and two together on the left flank - A. Just as I got over the gate, not before; I then saw two retire, and two go to particular distances; this was before I heard the report of the two last pistols. I afterwards found two pistols lying on my table, with a powder-flask and bullet-mould.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. NOWLAND. Q. Did not they say none of them were to blame - A. They did, and the deceased said so several times. Mr. Bailey mentioned the persons who were to blame; he said the quarrol originated with those persons whom he named.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Hampstead. I was called upon to go to Mr. Adams's on the 12th of January; I got there soon after ten o'clock in the morning, and found Mr. Bailey on the sofa, with his right side bloody; he said he considered himself near death, and I told him so myself; shortly after I extracted a ball from his left side. After his death I opened him, and found the ball had penetrated the intestimes in three different places; in my judgment, the appearances were sufficient, and did undoubtedly cause his death. After I extracted the ball, I asked him if every thing had been fair between them? he said, "decidedly so." I then told him if he had any thing to communicate to any private friend, he had better do it; he selected Mr. Phelan - I left the room. Shortly after Mr. O'Callaghan was present, and cought hold of the deceased's hand, and held it up; the deceased requested him to hold it still higher, as it afforded him considerable ease. From the nature of the wound it would give him case-it relaxed the surface of the muscles. He said, "God bless you, I thank you all for your attention;" Mr. O'Callaghan then said, "I hope, my dear fellow, we shall be walking together again in three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140018"></xptr>weeks;" the deceased said,"No, I shall be in Heaven before then." I received all the assistance possible from the three prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Was their attention uniformly kind - A.Perfectly so; the greatest anxiety was shewn by them all to render every assistance.</p>

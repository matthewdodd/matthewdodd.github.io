                  </hi>. I am errand boy to Mrs. Jones, 4, Down Street, Picca<lb></lb>dilly—a little after 8 p.m. on April 29th I was in Windmill Street with a boy named Tidman, and the prisoner called me over to him and said, "Will you go into that little shop and get half an ounce of tobacco for me?"—he was standing by the public-house, and the tobacconist's is next door—he pro<lb></lb>duced a couple of halfpence, but kept them back and gave me a florin—I went and got the tobacco and tendered the florin to a little girl in the shop, who showed it to Mrs. Gardner in the parlour—she came into the</p>

Francis Tidman. I live at 15, Little Windmill Street—I was talking to Sullivan on the night of April 29th in Windmill Street—the prisoner came across to Sullivan and said something about tobacco—I think he said, "Will you go and get me half an ounce of tobacco"—I saw his face well—I waited outside the shop when Sullivan went in, and the prisoner walked up and down while I was looking into a paper shop—he came back—Sullivan pointed him out, and he went into the public-house—after he came out, Sullivan, Gardner, and I followed him till he was given in custody—I had only lost sight of him while he was in the heershop—he kept on walking up and down about the length of this Court, passing me while I was looking into the paper shop.</p>

Sophia Gardner. I am the wife of Charles Gardner, a tobacconist—on the evening of April 29th my little girl gave me a bad coin—Sullivan was there, and I asked him where he got it—the prisoner passed the door, and the boy pointed him out to me as. he came out of a public-house—I said to him, "This is a bad two-shilling piece"—he said, "I did not give the lad the two-shilling piece, and I have not seen the lad"—I sent for a constable, and did not lose sight of the prisoner from the time I first spoke to him till I gave him in custody—he told the constable he had never seen the boy before—I gave the florin to the policeman.</p>

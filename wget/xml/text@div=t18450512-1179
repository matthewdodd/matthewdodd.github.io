                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Mount-place, White<lb></lb>chapel-road. On Wednesday evening, the 23rd of April, I was called on to attend a person named Bates, at his own house, in Black Lion-yard—I found him in bed—I examined his leg, which I found had been dislocated at the ancle, also a fracture of the small-bone of the leg, between two and three inches below the knee, a contusion, another contusion behind the right ear, and another under the left eye—they appeared to have been recently done—I saw him again the following morning, and made a further examination—I found contusions about his chest—he continued in that state—there was a considerable change on Saturday evening—he became quite violent and delirious, <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—we could hardly keep him in bed—he died on the Monday morning—in my judgment, the primary cause of death was the accident he had received, from the injury which was done to the ancle-joint, and the constitutional consequences arising from it, the effect produced on the system—I think the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> was the consequence of the injuries he received—he died from the effect of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There was nothing in the contusions you have mentioned of a serious nature? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the small outer bone of the ancle was broken, and the foot turned right out, even the ligaments—dislocation of the ancle-joint is not, generally speaking, a mortal injury—the proximate cause of death was <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—that is a description of insanity generally produced in persons that drink freely—it is sometimes brought on by abstinence from liquor, by persons who have been accustomed to a profuse use of it—we are obliged to give such persons stimulating drinks, which we gradually reduce till we can safely leave them off—I knew nothing of the deceased's habits before fait death—I could judge, from the fact of his having <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, that he must have been given to drink—unless he had been brought to a particular state of health by drinking, I should say a wound of that kind would never have superinduced <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I gave him stimulants to avoid <hi rend="italic">deli<lb></lb>rium tremens</hi>—he first exhibited symptoms of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> on Saturday morning—he was allowed a small quantity of stimulant before that—with a wound of that kind, there is a liability to inflammation—we should be obliged to watch the local symptoms, and it would be a reason for not applying stimulants at all unguardedly—he bad quite sufficient stimulant to prevent the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—a wound would not produce <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, under any circumstances—it need not be produced by abstinence from liquor—even from the first instance there was a twitching, a spasmodic affection of the muscles, from the injury to the foot—he died from the exhaustion produced by the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—we could not produce sleep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you the least doubt that that <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> mighthave come on in the event of his having not had that wound, from abstinence from stimulants for five or six days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it might, but it would not have been fatal—I never lost a patient with <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> before—I have had several cases without accident, and never lost one, when taken immediately—the de<lb></lb>ceased, in his struggles, displaced the ancle-bone again—that would create considerable irritation—I do not consider it had a material tendency to<lb></lb>wards the fatal result—at that time it did not cause any bad effects—the involuntary spasmodic action of the muscles, actnally drew the joint out of its place again—and during the last day it required a person to keep his hand on the parts, to keep them in apposition—the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> was not the result of abstinence, nor comparatively so, because I allowed him what I thought was right—I can undertake to say that the wound was the proximate cause of the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, by producing irritation of the nervous system.</p>

Delirium tremens</hi> is the result of a derangement of the nervous system? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—drinking has a tendency to produce it—any injury would increase the excitement, and bring about that sort of crisis which resulted in <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—the injury was the immediately exciting cause.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Black Lion-yard, Whitechapel. On Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the 23rd of April, I was in the yard of the Rabbits, at Ilford—I saw the prisoner and the deceased there, sitting on a settle by the side of the window—the deceased was about forty years of age—they were chatting to each other—I did not hear what they were talking about—they had some words—the prisoner got up and threw the beer in the deceased's face, and as he was rising up, the prisoner hit him with his left hand first, and then with his right—Bates rose up again, and they flew at each other—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120170"></xptr>
               <p>they went on to the gravel together—I went to pick Bates up, and his leg was broken—there was a table between them, which was upset and broken before they flew at each other, and the glasses on it—I had seen no act of violence on Bates's part, before the prisoner threw the beer in his face—I do not know whether the table fell on the deceased—he rolled somewhere about the table.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Church-street, Mile-end New Town. I was at the Babbits on the 23rd of April—I did not see the prisoner come in—he and Bates were there when I got there—I called for a pint of beer, and sat down at the end of the table—the prisoner and the deceased sat along side of each other—something arose about Ireland—I heard Bates say, "Oh, I know you never were in Ireland in your life"—he said, "Yes, I have been, many a time"—Bates said, "I would not mind laying you a sovereign you never were in Ireland"—the prisoner pulled out two or three sovereigni, and threw them on the table—I said "Nonsense, what are you throwing your sovereigns about in that manner for? you will lose them"—I do not know that the prisoner was either sober or tipsy, he could walk about very well—I think he had been drinking—he had been riding—he put the sovereigns into his pocket—Sacker came and said to me,"Do you know that man?" (meaning Bates)—I said "Yes, I do, he rode down along with me, and he rode back along with me"—Sacker said, "I wish you would take him away, or lie will knock his head through the window"—before I could out with the words, the prisoner threw the beer in his face—Bates rose from his seat, and was rubbing his face—the prisoner hit him two tremendous blows, and sent him on to the table—a struggle then took place which broke the table—they both fell down right against the carts—Bates was undermost—they both got up together, and rushed at one another, and I could not see anything more, the people all surrounding them—I saw no blow struck by Bates, they were both struggling together over the table—I cannot say whether there was any blow or not—I saw no blow struck before the beer was thrown in his face.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 28th of April—I told him I had come to take him on a very serious charge, manslaughter—he said he should not go with me till he knew further about it—he then sent his son out after some party—he at last went with me—on our way to the station he said, when he sat down alongside of Mr. Bates he said something about his coat, and offered to lay him a sovereign that he was not an Irishman, that he took some beer and threw it in bis face, but he was aggravated to do what he had done—he said he had struck him.</p>

            . I am a gold-refiner, and live in Cox's-court, Little Britain. The prisoner came to my house, in company with another man, whose name I do not know - I knew the prisoner before, he is a watch-gilder; he tendered me a bill of exchange, stating he would take 6 ozs. of gold out of the amount of it, if I approved of it; it was drawn by Weston and Son, on Messrs. Herries the bankers, in favour of John Barton, and not being indorsed by Barton, I said, "Who is John Barton, who should have indorsed it?" the prisoner replied, "This person with me is Mr. Barton;" and perceiving him to be a working man, I said, it was extraordinary, a person like him should be in possession of a bill of that amount; the prisoner replied, that Barton was to receive a legacy which Weston and Son had to pay, and they had given him this bill upon the banker for it, to turn into cash - I said Barton could have nothing to do with gold; he said, he had arranged with Barton respecting it, and he should use the gold in his business - Barton said nothing to this. Considering the bill not regular, it being drawn by the town house, on a town banker, which is unusual, I told Hilliard, his story appeared to be correct, and if he gave me time to ascertain that it was so, I should have no objection to take it; they then talked together, and asked if I would ascertain in half-an-hour, I said I might in the course of two hours; they promised to call in two hours, and left me the bill - I sent my clerk with it to Herries, and in two hours Hilliard returned without Barton, and asked if it was approved of - I had determined to have nothing to do with it, but told him it would do, provided he brought his friend Barton to endorse it - I did not communicate my suspicions to him; he went to fetch Barton, and returned in two hours, and said he was surprized he had not met him, as he had appointed, at the Ram at Smithfield - I said the bill would not be negotiable till he had indorsed it, and be must continue to search for him; he went to look for him again, thinking he had missed him - I heard no more that night, but next morning the prisoner's nephew came and said, he had called from his uncle, to know if Barton had been respecting the bill, and in case he called, not to pay him the proceeds, as he was afraid something was wrong - I found the prisoner in custody about an hour afterwards - I did not exactly know where he lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did Mr. Weston go with the constable? A. Yes - I had ascertained the prisoner's address, and given it to him.</p>

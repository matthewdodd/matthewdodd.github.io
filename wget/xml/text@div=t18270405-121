            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 3d of March - I told him it was for stealing this piece of cambric - he denied it then, but before the Magistrate he acknowledged he had given it to his mother; he was remanded, and I found the mark on the cambric - he then said he had bought it of a boy in Tottenham-court-road for 5s., but he should not know him again.</p>
               <p>MR. CHITTENDEN. I cannot find the mark by this light - I saw it before the Magistrate, but it was very faint - it was done with a pencil, but it answers in quality and description with the piece I lost.</p>
               <p>G. AVIS re-examined. This is the piece of cambric I got at the pawnbroker's; Mr. Chittenden saw it, and there was a pencil mark on it, by which he could swear to it - I do not see it now.</p>

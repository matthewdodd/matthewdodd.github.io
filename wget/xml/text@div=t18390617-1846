                  </hi>. I am a navigator, and work at Blackfriars bridge. I received my wages there, and gave 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the prisoner's husband, told him to take 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for his trouble, and to take 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. home to my wife—in consequence of what I afterwards heard from my wife, I went on Sunday morning to where the prisoner and her husband lived—I found them there, and Bryant their lodger—I asked the husband why he did not return the money to my wife neighbourly—he said he returned all he received—I said he did not, and that I had had a better opinion of him—the prisoner said, "I know what you gave my husband, I know he has deli<lb></lb>vered it"—I said to her, "You had better mind your own affairs, and not trouble with us"—I said, "If this man had done his duty towards his own wife, who is in Ireland, or paid me the money in a week or fort<lb></lb>night's time, I would not have cared"—the prisoner took up a hatchet from the fire-place, came behind me, and hit me right in the poll of the head with it, and with the dint of the blows I went down on my face and hands—I got up, turned round, and laid hold of the prisoner, and she dropped the axe—I laid hold of her, and Bryant hit me right in the side of the head with the chopper, while I had hold of her, and I fell with the dint of the blows, and was senseless—when I came to myself I was on the stairs—my wife was the first that found me—I said, "I am <hi rend="italic">dead,</hi> wife"—a policeman came and took me to the hospital, where my wound was dressed—I came out of the hospital on the Sunday evening—I ran out from the effects of the blow, and staid out till Tuesday—I was obliged to go in again, and stopped there till that day week—I had not struck the prisoner at all before she struck me with the axe—I never spoke to her—I was speaking to her husband—I have not been able to find Bryant.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 108.) On Sunday morning, the 2nd of June, I found the prosecutor at the bottom of the staircase in the pas<lb></lb>sage with his hands up against his head—I observed three very large wounds, and blood all down to the floor—I went up stairs, and searched three or four rooms—I found the prisoner concealed in a room at the top of the house—she had bolted the door—I shook the door, the bolt went back, and she was standing up in a corner of the room—she seemed very much agitated—I took her into custody, and conveyed the prosecutor to the hospital—I saw no chopper or axe—I did not find Bryant, but the husband was sitting in the room smoking his pipe.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you searched very accurately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the prosecutor was sitting on the stairs—any body going down must have passed him—there was no woman in the room when I went up.</p>

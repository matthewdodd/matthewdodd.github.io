            . I am constable of Shoreditch. On the 15th of March, I was going down Shoreditch, with Walters, and saw the prisoners going in and out of different shops, they then saw us, and turned into the Fountain, a public-house, which is a thoroughfare. I followed them, Cox appeared to have something under her shawl; they got through the passage. At the back of the house I secured Cox, and asked her what she had got under her shawl; she said about eight yards of linen - Walters took Reading, I found the cloth was four yards and a quarter - she said she bought it in Shoreditch, then in Old-street. Reading immediately said,</p>
               <p>"No, you bought it of a man by Miles's Mad-house, Hoxton." They cried, and said if we would let them go we might have it. I went to different shops, and found it belonged to the prosecutor.</p>

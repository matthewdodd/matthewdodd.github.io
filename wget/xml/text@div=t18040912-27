               <p>Q. How long had he got to serve? - A. About a year and a half: On the 22d of July, when I arose, the prisoner was calling our niece to open the door to let him out; I came down myself; the prisoner asked me to let him out; I said he must go and fetch me a peck of flour; while he was gone for the flour, perceiving his bundle to be very large, I examined the outside of it, and found, through the hole of the wrapper, some patten ties; I immediately went to the Half Moon public-house, to ask the landlord to step in, but the landlord was not up. On my return, I found a neighbour standing before the house; I desired him not to go away, if I required him I should call him in; I went into my own house, and in a very short time the prisoner returned and rung at the bell; I opened the door, and took the flour; I said I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120034"></xptr>not detain him any longer, I would take the flour up; the prisoner said he must go up stairs, he had left his bundle in the kitchen; when he went up stairs, I beckoned the evidence to come in, and told him to stop till the prisoner came down; the evidence came in, and went into the shop, and I shut the door directly; I said to the prisoner the bundle was very large, he must dirty an uncommon quantity of linen in the course of a week, and before he took it any further, I must see what it contained; when I opened the bundle, there were five dozen of patten ties; I asked him where he got them from; he said, on the Thursday evening prior (I was out on Thursday), he had them from the ware-room; I had left the key in the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to induce him to say that? - A. No; the next parcel that was packed up, I had to cut the strings, and upon opening it, there were twelve pair of patten rings; I asked him where he got them from, and he said, from below, in the work-shop, where he worked in; I asked him what he was going to do with them, and he said he was going to try if he could sell them; I then said to him, as the bundle was so very productive, I would search his pockets; I searched his pockets, and found in his pockets the different articles mentioned in the indictment; I then sent for an officer, and after the officer came, he found another article, or two; he said he was going to give them away to several people.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been with you? - A. About five years.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he behave? - A. I liked the lad very well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. Till this happened, you had a good opinion of him? - A. Not till this time, I had suspected him some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partners? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you induce him to say this you have been telling us; did you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you send to his father? - A. I sent a friend to him, in order to find out who his accomplices were; I made no promise to him at any time.</p>

             sworn. - I am a coach wheelwright: Mr. Knight called me in, there was nobody but Mr. Knight and me present; when the prisoner came down stairs, he had a bundle under his arm; when Mr. Knight asked him what he had got there in the bundle, he said they were things he was going to take to the washerwoman to wash; Mr. Knight said he should like to see the contents of the bundle; Mr. Knight took the bundle from the prisoner, and untied it, and there he found some patten rings and some patten ties; and the other things mentioned in the indictment was found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did the prisoner give of the patten rings and ties? - A. I cannot say particularly; he said he had the rings from one place, and the ties from another.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing said by Mr. Knight, to induce the prisoner to say he had taken them from any part of the premises? - A. Not at all.</p>

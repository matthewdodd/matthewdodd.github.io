            . I am a Police-officer. On the night of the 14th of October I found the prisoner in a state of intoxication in the New-road - she had a child; I took her to the station-house - she said she had received 2s. from Marylebone workhouse that day; I searched her, and found 6d. in silver, and 5 1/2d. in copper, on her - I took that money, and gave it to the inspector on duty; late at night the prosecutrix was brought in - she took some silver and some halfpence from her pocket, and threw on the table; she took it up again, and went away - the presecutrix was brought in again, but I was not there at the time, but when I returned I found her in the lock-up-place - at a quarter to fire o'clock I heard a knock at the door; I went with a light, and opened the door of the room - the prosecutrix said the prisoner had robbed her of 4s. 6d.; the prisoner said she had out - I began to search her; the prosecutrix said, "If you find 4s. 6d. and some copper on her, it is my money;" I found in the tail of the prisoner's gown, in separate parts, 4s. 6d. in silver; and after that she took from her side-pocket a sort of purse, with copper in it, and she turned them out on the floor - the silver was between the lining and the outside of the gown; the prisoner had delivered her money up the night before, and said it was all she had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sewed money in my gown when I took any home, because a woman who slept with me used to make me spend it in drink, and the officer tore my gown to get it out. Witness. I pushed it out through the lining; I did not examine to see how it had been introduced- I did not observe any hole in it, but it was very easy to get the money out through the lining.</p>

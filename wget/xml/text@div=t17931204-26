               <p>Q. Had you been with her any time, or was it as soon as you came into the room? - As soon as I came into the room. I hallooed after her, and she went in again, and she shut the door on me, on trying to open the door to go after her, a man came out and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen this woman before? - Yes, I had been with her before.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you take her up after this? - Directly, a man went and fetched a constable and took her up.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the examined? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Has the half guinea ever been found? - Yes, after she was put in prison she sent to me to make it up with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knopp. Richard, the prisoner at the bar is an old friend of your's, it seems? - I have been with her three times before.</p>
               <p>Q. You paid her every time I take it for granted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All this money you put down on the table? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. She saw you empty it out?</p>
               <p>Q. What did you empty it out for, man? - To give her the eighteen-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. And left all the rest on the table? - No, she took it up before I could take hold of it, I emptied it on the table because my purse was so narrow and could not get the shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you got the half guinea again, did not you? - She gave me the half guinea again, but I carried it to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. You have given a receipt for it? - No, she gave me a receipt to get some more.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Stratford-upon-Avon. On Saturday, the 1st of September, I set out to come to town, and got to Uxbridge at nine o'clock at night—I was quite a stranger, and asked the policemen for a lodging—they recommended me to the Sun—I went there, and had some ale and supper—I had a box, with these needles, which I put on the end of the screen—the prisoner sat on the same bench—I had had my supper about a quarter of an hour, when I heard the door go—I turned, and missed the man and the box—I gave information to the policemen, and in about fifteen minutes they brought the prisoner to me in a different dress—I am sure no other individual could have taken it but him—he must have taken it behind my back—there was no one in the room but me and him—the box has not been found—it contained 4800 needles, and two dozen boxes, in a tin case.</p>

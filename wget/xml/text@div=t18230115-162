            . I am a labourer in Mr. Dempsey's service. The house was finished, and the windows glazed. I had been at work there that day, and about seven o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise like whispering, and something crack like glass. I called the watchman, who went up stairs - he called me up. I found the prisoner in his custody. We found the squares of glass in the same room against the wall; they had been taken out of the sashes; three out of eighteen were broken; they were all right at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You did not see him doing any thing to them - A. No, he gave no reason for being there, but begged to be let go.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Mile-end. Driscol called me in - he got over the wall to let me in. I found the prisoner up stairs; he opened the window, and got out on the leads. I told him, unless he returned, I would fire at him - he came back. I delivered him to Driscoll; he said there was one more with him, I searched, but found nobody. The lines of the sashes were cut, and the glass cut out. I heard glass break as Driscoll got over the wall.</p>

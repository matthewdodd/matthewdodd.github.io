                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 126). On 9th May I was on duty at Cathill, East Barnet, about 4.30 in the morning, with Sergeant Ayres—we were going along the road from East Barnet, and met the prisoner and another man, about 300 yards from Mr. Hanbury's house, coming from it—when we arrived opposite Mr. Hanbury's lodge, I went round, the grounds; it is my duty to do so; upon reaching the house I found the door leading to the billiard-room open, and I found the window also open—I called Sergeant Ayres, and we examined the window and found it had been forced open by some instrument—some of the servants were called up, and we found the door leading from the billiard-room into the house had been forced open; the woodwork round the lock had been cutaway—I then ran to the Barnet Railway Station, and saw the prisoner there in a third class railway carriage, and the other man in the act of getting in—I asked them where they had come from—the man who made his escape said, "From High Barnet"—I was in uniform—the other man then made his way across the carriage, and put his arm out of the window to open the carriage door on the opposite side—I rushed into the carriage and seized hold of both prisoners; we struggled, and all three rolled on the platform—the prisoner struck me four times on the head with this iron bar, which is commonly called a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—he got that from his pocket—after he struck me three times I felt I could not hold the other man—I let go of him and stuck to this one—the guard came to my assistance, and we secured the prisoner—I lost a good deal of blood—we took him into the booking-office, and I partially searched him there, and found two centre-bits, a brace, some twine and a chisel—I took him on the road to Southgate, and found Saddler, of the S division, and Sergeant Ayres—they took the prisoner to the station, and I went to the doctor—on my way home I called at Mr. Hanbury's house, and searched the grounds, and found some railway rugs and different things.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 9th May I was guard of the 4. 55 train from Barnet to Moorgate Street—a few minutes before the train started I saw Taylor, the prisoner, and another man struggling together on the plat<lb></lb>form—the prisoner had this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> in his hand, and hit the policeman three times on the head with it—I rushed up to his assistance—he was about to hit him again, and I seized the prisoner's arm behind and stopped him hitting the fourth blow—Taylor said "Take it away, take it away," twice, and by that time I had got it away from the prisoner—I said "You scoundrel, I have a good mind to hit you across the head with it; such scoundrels as you ought to be hung," and the prisoner said "Yes, I know I ought"—I gave the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> up to a porter till he saw a policeman—I had to go with the train—the other man ran away, the other guard ran after him, but he could not take him—I am quite sure the prisoner had the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, and was striking the constable.</p>

I am butler in the service of Mr. Charles Addington Hanbury, Belmont, Enfield—on the evening of 8th May the house was closed in the usual way, and on 9th May, about 4. 15 in the morning, I was called up by Serjeant Ayres—I found a window had been broken open, which had been fastened the night before, and also a door in the same room—I then went to the billiard-room and found that had been entered; the windows and doors were all locked on the previous night—I found a cup<lb></lb>board forced open, but nothing had been taken out—two rings had been taken from the cloak-room; one was dropped in the passage and the other was found in the shrubbery—the door leading from the billiard-room on to the lawn was open—I had fastened that the night before myself.</p>

                  </hi> I am porter to Mr. Henry Benjamin, a fish-salesman, in St. Mary-at-hill. The prisoner came there on Wednesday, the 6th of Oct., for Mr. Cadwallader's herrings—Mr. Cadwallader had been there and brought one pad, and the prisoner took away two—Mr. Cadwallader came afterwards, I said his pad was gone—he went and found the prisoner with one pad, and he brought him back with it—he asked the prisoner what he had done with the other pad—he said he took no other away—I said, "I know better, you took two"—I saw him take two.</p>

                  </hi> I am a fishmonger. In the afternoon of the 6th of Oct. I went to Mr. Benjamin's, and agreed for a pad of herrings—it was opened, and I tied it up with a string—I only agreed for one pad—I went away, bought another pad of herrings, and took them to Mr. Benjamin's shop, they told me something—I saw a porter, named Tiger, who gave me informa<lb></lb>tion—I saw the prisoner come from Darkhouse-lane with one pad of herrings—I followed him, and said, "Where are you going with them?"—he said, "To your place"—I examined the pad of herrings he had—they were not what I had bought.</p>

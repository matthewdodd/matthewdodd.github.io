The prisoner has worked on the farm for two or three summers. I was well acquainted with his person. I was at the Green Man, public-house, on the Uxbridge-road, near the seven mile stone, last Sunday week, the 9th of September, the prisoner was there. I came away about ten minutes after nine o'clock, he followed me. A young man came about a quarter of a mile with me, and then he went to the left, and the prisoner hesitated whether he should go with him or me, he said he should go with him. I got about one hundred yards to go to the stile, and before I could get to the stile he overtook me. I said George,</p>
               <p>"What are you going my way?" he said, Yes, I have altered my mind, I shall go to my old lodging. We went over this one field, we had eight to go over, and every field that we came to he asked if that was not the last. I kept telling him no. When we come to the last field but one he asked twice, and when we got near to the gate he asked me again. I said</p>
               <p>"As soon as we got through that field we shall be in the home field, if we brush along we shall get there before it rains again;" he then mended his pace and caught hold of my collar, and said d - n your eyes, old chap, you must heel up to me - I turned and looked in his face, and said</p>
               <p>"George what do you mean by that?" he said,</p>
               <p>"d - n your old eyes I'll let you know presently, I will do for you in a very little time." I said,</p>
               <p>"George, you ought to know better, I have used you like a master. and like a father, and my wife has been like a mother to you?" he said,</p>
               <p>"don't you tell me nothing of that, for I'll do for you in two minutes, in a very short time." I caught hold of his collar thinking that if I could get loose I could run home. I begged of him to loose me, and let me go, he held me so fast by the shirt collar and handkerchief, and stuck his knuckles into my neck, he almost winded me - I got weaker and weaker - I scuffled with him for some time, he got the better of me, and said if I did not deliver up what I had about me he had a pistol in his pocket and would blow my brains out; but before this he had draged me back two or three poles, under an oak tree, under some stubs. I begged of him as we lay in the hedge, not to injure me there; then he pulled me up into the footpath, I told him I only had two shillings and sixpence and an old watch. He kept feeling in his pocket, and said if I did not deliver it up he had a pistol in his pocket and would blow, my b - y brains out in one moment. I delivered it up expecting to lose my life every moment. I gave him the watch and half-crown. He then loosed me and went the same road as he came, and I went home. I am quite sure he is the man, I have seen my watch since.</p>

               <p>"It cannot be helped now, I should not care a b - dy b - gg - r if I was going to be hung up for it." I said the less he said of that sort the better.

            , sheweth, that your petitioner was at work for the prosecutor at a farm near Greenford; the cause of my being here arose from a quarrel I had, he agreed with me to cut corn at twelve shillings and sixpence an acre. I finished my work and had three shillings and three halfpence to receive. I fell in with him at the Green Man, and had a few words with him because he had not paid me, and as I returned home with him being intoxicated I did not know what I was about, he was in liquor as well as myself, I laid hold of him, and asked him for the three shillings and three halfpence, he said he would pay me no more than what he had, I laid hold of him again, and he gave me his watch and half-a-crown, saying that was all he had, and we parted; in coming home I was taken; when I came to my senses in the morning, I was quite astonished, as I knew no more of it than a child unborn.</p>

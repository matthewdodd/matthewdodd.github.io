            : the prisoner Druce slept at the house for five or six weeks, and Brethen slept there on Saturday and Sunday night, the 1st of November- they were in the tap-room some time on Saturday night, adn about half-past nine o'clock asked me for a light to go to bed - they both went up together; there is a door at the bottom of the staircase, which I unlocked, and locked after them; in half or three quarters of an hour I opened it to let an old man up to bed, in the same room; he slept there one night before - the key of the staircase door hung in the bar; they slept on the second floor, and I on the first - they would pass my door to go to bed; it was locked when I lit them up, and the key in my pocket- I did not notice the door in lighting the old man up, but just as I came down I lit another man up; he slept in the next room to me - I then observed the lock of my bed-room was broken off, and laying down near the door; there was no key in it - I ran down. told mistress, and sent for the watchman; I had given the prisoners a candle about an inch long, and when I went up I found nothing but a wick left - I should think it would burn about half an hour; I observed part of a screw in their candlestick - I searched in my bed-room, and found my box open; I had left the key in it - a pocket-book, containing a sovereign and a half, was gone; I had seen the book safe the night before - I always keep the key of the room in my possession; I had not opened the pocket-book since the Thursday week before, and put the money in then - the constable went to search the prisoners' bedroom; I took the screw out of the candlestick - it was broken; we found the other part of it left in the door - they corresponded; on coming down stairs we found the casement window on the staircase open - it was fastened in the evening, and the waiter in my presence found the pocket-book thrown out there into the horse-trough, which is under the window; the money was gone - we could find no money in the prisoners' room; there was nobody but the prisoners up stairs - they slept together.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILSON. I am a watchman. I was fetched to the house - I went to the prisoners' room, and found no money; I saw the screw fitted to the door - as I took the prisoners to the watch-house, Druce said, "Recollect, watchman, we had some carriers left the house this morning;" I said evening was not morning.</p>
               <p>PHILIP WEBSTER. I am an officer. I took the broken part of the screw out of the door, and matched it with that found in the candlestick - it tallied exactly in thickness and every part, and was quite fresh broken; the servant showed me the lock.</p>

               <p>Druce's Defence. I had been in bed a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes when he brought this man up, and on going down found the door broken open - we were going to sleep when the watchman and servants came up, but found no money; I have lived in several respectable families.</p>
               <p>Brethen's Defence. I wish to ask Harris if he recollects, on coming into the room, calling for another candle as it was burnt in the socket; he sent a woman down for a candle, which she brought up without a candlestick and it was put into the one on our dressing-table, which was handed over to the pot-boy - I did not see it afterwards.</p>

There was nobody up stairs but the prisoners, the old man and young one - the door at the foot of the stairs was locked all the time; I lighted the young man up just as I made the discovery - the old man had only gone up that instant; the stair-case window looks into a yard, not into the street - it is too high to be reached from the yard.</p>

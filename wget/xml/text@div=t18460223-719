                  </hi>. I am a plasterer. I live in Star-street, Edgware-road—about nine o'clock at night, on the 18th of Feb., I saw Steggle on the Baywater-road—I had been drinking, but was not intoxicated—I knew Perfectly well what I was doing—I went with her, and was to stop all night—I went to bed—I laid my clothes on the sideboard—I had a watch in my right hand waistcoat pocket—I had about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—some was in half<lb></lb>crowns, and some in shillings—I had two handkerchiefs—I tied my pocket-handkerchief round my head, and she asked me to give her my neckhandker<lb></lb>cheif to tie round her head, which I did—I went to sleep—I awoke and missed my trowsers, waistcoat, watch, and my money, and Steggle was gone—the handkerchief from my own head was gone—she had rolled up my trowsers in the bed quilt—I could not get them—these are my handkerchiefs—this</p>

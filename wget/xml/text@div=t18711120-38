                  </hi>. I am one of the relieving-officers of Isling<lb></lb>ton—on 18th September I received information in reference to a neglected child, at 2, Arundel Grove—I went there about 7 o'clock, p.m., and found the deceased child, Alice Butcher, in a cradle, in a corner of a room, in a very filthy condition, on some rags, and there was excrement up to its neck—I did not see the prisoner then—a child in the room gave me information—I found in the room an empty food bottle, very sour, a jug with the top part broken off, and a little flour and water in it—there was no other food in the room, and that appeared to be the food for the baby—I informed the medical officer, Dr. Duckett, who returned with me about 10 o'clock that night, or later, the child had then been washed, and the prisoner was there in a state of intoxication—I informed the mother on, I think, the second day—the child was taken to Mrs. Wells, and remained with her till its death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of St. Mary, New<lb></lb>ington on the evening of 18th September, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I accompanied Meecham to 2, Arundel Grove, and saw the deceased child and the prisoner, who was only partly clothed, and in a very excited state of mind—I could not form a judgment of what caused the excited state, perhaps it was her temperament—I have no distinct recollection of what she had on, but it was very little—we had to knock once or twice before we got in, and I inferred that she was going to bed—the child had a cotton nightgown on, and appeared very much emaciated, and in a state of very great debility—I listened to its lungs with my stethoscope, and looked at its tongue—I could discover no organic disease, and therefore I was led to infer that it had been badly nourished—it was removed from the prisoner's care, and I saw it some days later in the care of Mrs. Wells, where it was properly cared for and nourished—I saw it there twice—it died on 13th October—I made <hi rend="italic">a post mortem</hi> examination; there were no marks on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187111200040"></xptr>
               <p>body, but it was very much emaciated, and there were excoriations on the thighs and buttocks—on opening the body all the organs were healthy, except the left lung, which was in a state of inflammation, and the brain, which was slightly congested—the excoriations arose from the child wetting its clothes, and the acid nature of the foeces and urine—the immediate cause of death was the inflammation of the lungs, which I have no doubt was accelerated by bad treatment and bad nursing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When I had had the child three weeks she had an abscess formed on her right breast, and another on the bottom of her stomach, and breakings out on several parts of her body, and she had a gathering in her head, it ran from her ear; I sent for her mother, who came on the night the abscess broke. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was no mark on the right breast, or any external marks except the excoriations—if there had been such abscesses as the prisoner mentions they would have left marks, especially when they were so recent.</p>

I live with my husband at 1, Gardner's Cottages, close to Newington Green—the officer came to me on Monday evening, and I went to the prisoner's house on Tuesday morning, and I asked her what she intended to do, and told her to look what trouble she had got herself into, and what was I to do—she said, "Do what you like"—I immediately took the baby to the aunt, as I thought, but she appears to be the mother—it was up to its neck in its own dirt and wet—it was so stinking that I burnt the coloured clothing, and this blanket, as we call it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) has had to be washed half-a-dozen times and bleached—I took the child home, and, being a mother, treated it with a mother's care—its bones were through its skin, and it only weighed 5 1/2 lbs.—I only wish I could have <hi rend="italic">rose</hi> it—we knew that it was being starved four months ago, and I gave information to the aunt when I met her—I saw it sometimes four months ago—it was dreadfully dirty, and I went in and washed it and put it to bed—it was neglected at that time.</p>

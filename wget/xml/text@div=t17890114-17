She took me to her lodgings; I gave her some money to get it, and I fell asleep. I was awaked by her trying to get a ring off my finger; and she then said, here is the gin, do you chuse to drink? and I drank some, and asked her to shew me the way out to the street; and she ran across the road, and left me; then I missed my watch, and my leather bag, in which I had my money; there was half a guinea, and some silver; and after that I could not find her. I went to the watch-house, and gave information; and the watchman went out, and soon after brought in the two prisoners; my watch was brought back by the watchman. I was in liquor; I had been drinking from two o'clock that day, and it was then between nine and ten. I had not looked at my watch after I went into the woman's apartments; I saw it about half an hour before. The watch was in my fob, and the leather bag in my left-hand breeches pocket: if she took them, it must be when I was asleep.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor came to the watch-house, and said he had been robbed of his watch and money; he was a good deal in liquor. I went upon information to the prisoner Walters's lodgings, and I found the prisoner Dearman with her. I told him they must go to the watch-house, and then I heard something fall, and then I saw the watch lie at Dearman's feet. The woman said she had just picked up the young man in the street; and when the watchman came to the door, she gave him the watch to hold. I found in her pocket half a guinea, four shillings, and six sixpences; going back again, I found this leather case, which the prosecutor owned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Dearman. I know nothing of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Walters. The young man went home with me; and while he sat drinking by the closet door, I suppose the watch dropped from him.</p>

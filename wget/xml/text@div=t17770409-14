               <p>Do you recollect any thing that passed on the 15th or 16th of March? - On the Saturday he came into the room where I work and brought a boy with him; he sent him to pawn his cloaths for some money to pay some bills he owed his mistress; when the robbery was discovered I was desired to take care of him; I sat up with him all that night; in the morning he wanted to go to the barber's; I went with him; when he went in he slipped up stairs; I went to follow him and met him coming down; I don't know which room he went into.</p>

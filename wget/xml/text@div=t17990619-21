             sworn. - On the 25th of April last, I received a warrant from the Lord-Mayor, who ordered me, and Mr. Holdsworth, to proceed to Gravesend to execute it; we went down in the evening, and arrived at Gravesend about nine o'clock; I went to the Post-master, and shewed him the letter I had in my possession, addressed"Ketland Cotterill, to be left at the Post-office, Gravesend." I explained to him the business; in consequence of that, Mr. Holdsworth and I went there about eight o'clock the next morning, the time the bags were to be opened; we there waited in a room behind the Post-office, which had a window that looked into the Post-office, till near twelve o'clock; nobody having called, and thinking it would not be right to stay from London any longer, I sent Mr. Holdsworth to the Mayor, to get the warrant endorsed and made special; while he was gone, the prisoner at the bar came in, a few minutes before twelve; he asked the Post-master something, what he said I don't know; I apprehended him, and found this pocket-book, which contained a letter, I marked it; this is the letter; in that letter there was a bill for 400l. which is not in this indictment; I then asked him what he had done with the bill which that letter contained, and with the letter which this bill was contained in; he told me the letter this bill was contained in he had destroyed; but as to the bill that was contained in that letter, which I found in his pocket, for 307l. 5s. 6d. he shook his head, and said, "I have done very wrong, but my heart is not so bad." We took him into custody, and brought him to London, and lodged him in the Compter; I asked him how it came in his poffession; I said nothing to induce him to tell me; he said, it was entrusted to him, with several others, by some merchants at New-York, desiring him to put them into the Post-office as soon as he arrived in England; except that, he said, he had put some of them into the Post-office; he said nothing else respecting the bill to me.</p>
               <p>- HOLDSWORTH sworn. - At twelve o'clock I went to the Mayor at Gravesend, I was not present<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190031"></xptr>when the prisoner was apprehended; I saw him in custody, and the other Marshal said to me, keep him in custody, while I go on board a vessel at anchor off the town, where he has a chest on board, I will get it on shore; I did not say any thing to induce him to tell me, but when he was alone with me, he said, with the accent of a foreigner, "I have done wrong, I have wrote a name not my own, let me go, and I will leave England immediately, and never enter it again; if I stay, I know I shall hang," that is all he said; I heard nothing more, except in the course of our passage to town, he observed, he found the letter that the bill was inclosed in on the cabin floor of the vessel; I won't swear he said on the cabin floor, but that he found it in the cabin I will say he told me on my oath; I was present at the examination before the Lord-Mayor, which was taken in writing.(Letter read.)</p>

I did, from Gravesend; this bill was enclosed in it; when I opened the letter, and saw a bill, and did not know the persons, I was surprised, and to receive a letter from a name I did not know; the indorsement was so different, I determined to have nothing to do with it: I gave the letter and bill to my clerk to enquire whether it was a real name or not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you one of the firm of Ketland, Cotterill, and Son? - A. No, by no means, only brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive that letter from your clerk? - A. I did not, it lay upon my desk; the moment I came in, and this bill and letter were delivered to me, I discovered it to be a forgery, knowing the hand-writing of all the parties; I am in the habit of corresponding with them, and know their hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the hand-writing of Mr. Ketland, or Mr. Cotterill, or the son? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they accept bills in the way that is accepted, or endorse them in the way that is endorsed? - A. Never; I never knew an instance of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon discovery what did you do? - A. I went to Rowlett and Co. upon whom the bill is drawn; I went to Mr. Schneider afterwards; and then I went before the Lord-Mayor, and got a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. The indorsement is, "Pay to Ketland, Cotterill, and Son," - there is an erasure of "and Son" - The very first moment you saw it, did it appear as it is now? - A. Exactly as it is now.</p>
               <p>Q. It never appeared Ketland, Cotterill, and Son, at full, without erasure? - A. They were the correspondents; it immediately alarmed me, from knowing there is no such firm.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say there is no such man as Ketland Cotterill? - A. I never heard of one.</p>

               <p>- sworn. - I am clerk to Mr. Walsh, at Gravesend, who is inspector of the aliens. The prisoner arrived on the 23d of April; he came on the 23d, and I had some conversation with him; he asked me to be so kind as to write a letter for him; I asked him whether he could not do it for himself; he told me he could not write English; I asked him what he wanted to write; he told me he had a Bill of Exchange, which he wanted to be accepted and discounted; I asked him to whom; he would not send it; he told me he did not know yet; I asked how much it was; he told me, 307l. 5s. 6d. I wrote the letter for him, this is the letter I wrote, I did not write the direction; it is addressed to Mr. Schneider, I see; I don't know who signed it, that is all that passed.(Letter read).</p>
               <p>Gravesend, 24 April, 1799.</p>
               <p>Addressed to Messrs. Schneider and Co. London.</p>
               <p>Sir, I take the liberty to send you the inclosed bill of 307l. 5s. 6d. to get it accepted as soon as you please, and as I am in want of cash, I shall be obliged to you to get it discounted, and remit me the cash and your answer, directed to me at the Post-office. I am, Sir, your humble servant,</p>

               <p>THOMAS JOHNSTON sworn. - I act as Postmaster, at Gravesend; I once saw the prisoner at the bar before; he applied to me on the 25th of April to know if there was a letter addressed to Ketland Cotterill, to be left at the Post-office; I had one in my possession at that time, delivered to me by Mr. Hollier; I told him, if he would walk in, I would look; when he came in, I bolted the door, and made a signal we had agreed on before he came, and took him; I heard him say, after he had been searched, he was very much afraid that for the crime he had committed, he should hang up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing about the business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp contended, that the charge could not affect the prisoner, inasmuch as there was no evidence that the bill was not endorsed as it stands at present by the drawers at New-York, but the objection was over-ruled by the Court.</p>

               <p>LYON LEMAN, a German, sworn. - Examined by means of an Interpreter. Q.Whether he resides at Hamburgh? - A. I dwell in Hamburgh; I have known the prisoner and his father during the whole time I have lived in Hamburgh, twelve years; that young man had always an honest name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his having been afflicted with any disorder in his senses at any time? - A. I heard he was deranged in his mind; I heard he had been attended by physicians.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a young man of respectable connections?</p>
               <p>Mr. Schneider. I admit he is a young man of very respectable connections.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether he knows of his having had the misfortune to be disordered in his senses at any time? - A. I am perfectly convinced of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it? - A. Once, in a walk at Hamburgh, I saw a number of people collected, and I asked what was the matter; I went to the crowd, and saw this young man between them, and some people holding him fast, because he wanted to jump over into the water, called the Elster; he was about jumping into the river.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be a person deranged in his senses? - A. He did, and it was generally so known.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you know of his having been attended by physicians to cure him? - A. I believe he was, and if I recollect well, one of the physicians' name was Wolse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I have the certificate of Dr. Wolse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was it that he was in that situation? - A. I cannot determine; it is about three years ago that he was under the care of physicians; it is about two or three years since I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he was not sent to New-York for the benefit of the sea air? - A. His father and me being neighbours in the country, his father complained-</p>

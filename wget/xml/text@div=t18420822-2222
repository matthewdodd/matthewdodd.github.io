                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live In Jubilee-place, On the 29th of Jane I went with the prisoner to a house in Watney-passage—I had a watch and guard, two handkerchiefs, a purse, and a sovereign—she said she would take care of them, and took them out of my pocket—I did not wish her to do it, but she said she would take better care of them than I could—I have never received them since—I asked for them when I was leaving the house—she showed them to me out of her pocket, and then went away with them. I was all night searching for her, and found her the next night in a house in Watney-passage—she acknowledged having the watch and things in her possession—she did not give them to me—this is my handkerchief—I hemmed it myself.</p>

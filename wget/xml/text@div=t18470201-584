                  </hi>. I became acquainted with the prisoner in 1845—when I had been in her company about a month, she came to my house at half-past eleven o'clock one night, and told me her brother had turned her out of doors—I had a young man of the name of Edwards loading with me—the prisoner requested to remain there all night, and I consented—I and the young man went to bed at three o'clock, and left the prisoner to sit up—the next day she requested to remain with me—she remained a week as a lodger—I did not sleep with her that week—she persuaded me to get rid of the lodger, which I did, and she and I agreed to be married in nine week's time—we slept together during that nine weeks—we went to her sister's at the expiration of that time, and I gave her sister half-a-crown to have the banns published at Lambeth Church, but it was not dine—the money was spent between her and her sister—I knew nothing about it till we were to be married, when it came out that they had spent the money—I forgave her that—a few days afterwards we had a dispute, and she absconded, taking property, and pawning selling it—she returned, and I forgave her for that, and promised her we would be married—with that we lived on familiar terms during the space of a month, her brother, and some young girls she was acquainted with came there and feasted on my property while I was out at work—I did not give her any wages—I am a French polisher—I gave her from 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, my weekly earnings, and treated her just the same as if she were my wife—when I found that her brother, and several parties she was acquainted with, were bad characters, I forbade them to come to house—she persuaded me to remove from the place where we became acquainted together, as she had had a quarrel with the woman where we lived—we went away, and remained in a very comfortable manner—I then became acquainted with some things, and I asked for the key of my drawers, which she refused to give me—some words occurred, but of no angry nature—I went to my work at Stratford, and found on my return the prisoner had absconded, taking away property to the amount of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and my silver watch—she met me on my return from Stratford, and began crying for acting, as she had done, and asked me to forgive her—I did, and I had the banns published once more, at Bloomsbury</p>

               <p>church—I gave the money to the prisoner and my own cousin, and they went to have them published—soon after, the prisoner was taken ill with the rheumatic fever, and was laid on a bed unable to move—I paid for the doctor—she got worse—I got an order, and had her removed to the hospital—while she was there, I found she had parted with a number of my things—I then forbade her to come to my house again, and she sent for Mr. Edgar and told her to ask me to let her return—I did let her return, on condition that she would become more steady she returned—on 17th Dec., 1846, I went to my work at Epping-forest, and when I returned home, she was sitting by the fire-place—I asked her if she had got a shilling that I could get some polish (I had given her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Saturday night before—she said she had not, she had lent Mr. Gabbidge 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I desired her to go and ask him to let me have one shillings—she got up, put on her bonnet, and went down, as I thought, to get the shilling, but she did not return all night—I sat up till a quarter-past one o'clock—I arose again at five, and walked seven miles to go to my work—I returned the same evening, and found all the property taken away—while at the police-station, the prisoner swore, in presence of the inspector and the policeman, that she would do for me, that is meaning, in my humble opinion, some bodily harm towards me—my properly is all here now—the prisoner never brought one article out of my weekly earnings—it is the property I have had for several years before I knew the prisoner.</p>

I saw the prisoner coming out of the prosecutor's room on the morning of the 18th of Dec., with three chairs—I asked her if she was going away—she said yes, for her hus<lb></lb>band had ill-used her; she would not stop with him—I said I thought it was a pity she should break up her home, and I bid her good morning.</p>

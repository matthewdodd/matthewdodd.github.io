In Michaelmas term I attended the Accountant-General's office to receive 1000l., but, in consequence of the legacy-duty not having been paid, I could not receive it - I was obliged to pay it, it amounted to 8l. 18s. 8d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had the prisoner other payments to make? A. Various - but not at that particular time, as we had come to the end of Trinity term - but for three months previous he might have paid 200l. altogether; the day-book will tell what payments were made - I am not aware of his having any specific sum to pay that day.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If he had had more than 10l. to pay, and asked you for the money, would you have given it to him? A. The regular course was for the cashier to apply, he would give him what money he wanted: this cheque was given for the express purpose of paying the legacy-duty.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You gave it him on account of law cash? A. Yes; I did not know what the amount of the duty would be; I asked what he wanted it for, because we had previously found what we considered to be errors.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is there any entry in your books of his having paid that sum? A. No; they do not give vouchers for it; the receipt given is lodged in the Accountant-General's office.</p>

            . I am a clerk to the prosecutors, and have the books relating to the office disbursements in June, 1828; the book at that time was kept by me; it was the prisoner's duty to state to me what cash he had received and disbursed, that I might enter it in the book; he should have done that strictly every day; there is no entry on the 11th of June, nor about that time, either of this cheque being received, or of the legacy-duty having been paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he did not direct you to enter in the book that he had paid the duty? A. No; I had no knowledge of the transaction; he had to transact the usual business, which at times is heavy; there is not 2l. entered on that day; Mr. Bischoff usually gives me a cheque for the disbursements - I received no money from the prisoner that day; I never did; I used to pay to him; the items I enter by his order relate to Chancery business; the disbursements made by him that day amount to 24s. 2d.; I paid those sums to him.</p>
               <p>MR. BISCHOFF re-examined. The legacy duty in this case was 1 per cent. on the sterling money - the parties were father and daughter; I had more to pay in November than would have done in July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he not other disbursements to make that day? A. His own day-book will show that.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is this day-book kept in his own hand-writing. A. It is the clerk's day-book, in which each enters his own disbursements - his duty at that time was confined to the Equity business; here are entries of his on the 11th of June, amounting to 1l. 0s. 6d.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had he not disbursements to make every day? A. Here are several entries on the 12th - it is my rule to give money only to Sawkins, the cash clerk, if he is in the office; I take his signature on the back of the cheque - but I gave the prisoner the cheque on that occasion, Mr. Sawkins not being in the office, and he should account to Sawkins for that cheque; whatever payments are made the books will show - there are always payments to be made, but the cash clerk can best speak to what payments were made; the prisoner has not entered any sum as paid for legacy-duty.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He received 10l. for the express purpose of paying that duty? A. He did; we have never had any satisfaction for that sum.</p>

            . When the prisoner states he had made payments, I hand him the cash and enter the items; he never told me he had received this cheque of 10l. - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090073"></xptr>has not brought it to account either as having been received or paid.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS Q. Has the prisoner had advances made at any time? A. Yes, and perhaps it has gone three or four days before he accounts to me for it; he has given me an"I.O.U." for 5l., but it was always entered as so much in hand for law cash, and he has accounted for it by payments; I cannot say how soon after the 11th of June we had a settlement.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not have accounted to you for 8l. 19s. 6d.? A. I should think not - but the law cash is 10l. deficient; I paid him myself the items composing the 1l. 0s. 6d. out of cash I had in hand the next time we settled - there was always some money in hand.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Are you particular in making the entries on the day payments are made? A. They are entered in the day-book every night; I take them from the day-book to the cash-book, and hand the money over to the clerk making the payment; we do not settle every day, perhaps in three or four days; the prisoner should have entered this cheque as received, and charge the sum as paid for legacy-duty - but I never knew he had received it.</p>
               <p>MR. BISCHOFF. I never asked the prisoner what he had done with this cheque, as I was not aware of the fact till November, having been out of town in the long vacation; I asked him, when he was in custody on a civil suit, if this legacy-duty had been paid - he said it had; I had not at that time told him if he stated truly all the transactions he should not be prosecuted; he subsequently admitted that it was not paid; we were inclined to assist him as much as we could.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say he had applied it for your use, though not in that particular way? A. As far as my recollection goes, certainly nothing of the kind.</p>

            . Q. Look at this entry; is not the identical cheque, which I am now charged with stealing, entered to the 21st of June? A. Here is an entry on the "21st of June, ditto 11th of June 10l.;" that is the 10l. I had not an account of.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then this draft is entered? A. Yes; I took that entry from examining the cheque-book, which states that a cheque was drawn on that day; I entered it in order to have it accounted for, being accountable for cheques drawn to law cash; I did not enter it at any suggestion of the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. On the 21st of June did I not settle an account with you, and did you not then say to me, "You have received a cheque of 10l. from Mr. Bischoff, have not you?" A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not, on settling the account, give you a fresh"I.O.U." for the balance? A. That would be the usual course; I believe there was a conversation about a cheque at a subsequent period, about, August; I remember keeping a little blue book of advances made to you, but not of this date - it began the latter part of June or beginning of July - it might last till August; I do not know what has become of it - I have not destroyed it; it is merely a private memorandum; I commenced keeping it after some little inaccuracy - I before kept them on slips of paper, which got lost.</p>

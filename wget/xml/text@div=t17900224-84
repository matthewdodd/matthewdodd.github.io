               <p>I am in the service of the East India Company: I was going through the lobby of the play-house: the crowd was very great. I was asked by

            ; why I did not call on her? and my answer was, that I visited her sister: the play was near over: I was stopped by the crowd near the middle of the lobby: a gentleman, Mr. Williams, who is not here, stood on my right hand; and fronting me, close against me was the prisoner; I felt a pressure on my thigh; soon after that, I drew back, and found my breeches pocket unbuttoned, which I had buttoned just before: I immediately seized hold of the prisoner, and said, you have taken my purse? the prisoner said, who, I? I insisted it was him; upon which, the prisoner said he had not: about that time, I heard a purse drop on the ground; I stooped down and picked it up, and seized the prisoner; the prisoner avowed his innocence; I again seized the prisoner as the person who had taken my purse; he continued to assert his innocence;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240086"></xptr>but as I was convinced he was the person that had taken it, I called for a constable, and gave him in charge: there were three ten pound notes, and three guineas in the purse: I have the purse here; I am sure it is mine: upon his calling to a woman,

            , and saying did you see me take the purse? she said, I did see you take it: I know the woman; I have seen her in the lobby; she said, you never call on us; as I know her sister, I said, my acquaintance was with your sister; that was all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I take it for granted, there were a great many ladies of the same sort, in the lobby at that time? - There was: the prisoner was close up to me: the lady was standing near me.</p>
               <p>And I think you described before the magistrate, a sort of a tremulous motion that you felt on your thigh? - I did.</p>
               <p>Nothing of your's was found on the prisoner? - Nothing but his own property: I took Mrs. Green to Sir Samson's, at the prisoner's request.</p>
               <p>Upon the first representation of your story, if I understand you right, you went without Mrs. Green? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon that, the prisoner alledged that at the time he was charged, he asserted his innocence; and applied to a lady (that was Mrs. Green) by saying, Madam, did you see me? - Yes.</p>


               <p>Then Sir Sampson thought it necessary Mrs. Green should be sent for? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the production of this witness, who was out of town, and who has occasioned the prisoner to lay in gaol since last sessions, was occasioned by the prisoner himself? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>You for prudential family reasons, would chose to have kept her back? - I would.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in the lobby of Covent-garden Play-house, speaking to Mr. Beby; and I saw the prisoner put his hand in Mr. Beby's pocket, and take out his purse; I do not recollect the colour of his purse; I cannot positively tell; he let the purse fall instantly.</p>
               <p>Was his eye upon you at that time? - I do not know; I was too confused.</p>
               <p>Was you near the prosecutor at that time? - He was standing almost on one side of me; and that man came from one side to the other, and came between us both: I did not observe any friend with Mr. Beby.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you acquainted with Mr. Beby before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you make any out-cry about this? - I just nudged his shoulder.</p>
               <p>That would not have conveyed any important information? - I thought it would.</p>
               <p>Had you been in the same box with him? - I had been in different boxes, just as I pleased.</p>
               <p>We had not the pleasure of seeing you last sessions? - No, Sir, I was out of town.</p>
               <p>Was not you bound over to attend? - I do not know, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Did not you enter into a recognizance to attend? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Shall I take the liberty to ask where you was? - I was at Bath.</p>
               <p>It was suggested that the prisoner had procured you to abscond: had he so procured you? - No, upon my honour, not at all.</p>
               <p>Then your absence was merely matter of accident, and not design? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the prisoner asking you if you saw any thing of the kind? - Yes, he did; and I said, yes.</p>
               <p>Do you live now where you used to do when this happened? - Yes, I do; I always live in the same place when I am in town.</p>
               <p>God forbid I should restrict your liberty? - I should be sorry you should, or any body else.</p>
               <p>No, the public would be very much injured by it, to be sure? - You must judge about that.</p>
               <p>I have not the pleasure of going so often to the play-house as you do? - How do you know, pray, how often I go; I go to the play-house when I please, I dare say; I do not see why you need ask me about it.</p>
               <p>Do not be angry; it does not become you to be angry: if you knew how much<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240087"></xptr>pleasanter you look when you are in good humour, you would not. You did not attend at Bow-street the first time? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>No, not the first time? - I do not know; I went when I was asked to go by the gentleman.</p>
               <p>What was you talking to Mr. Beby about; was not you upbraiding him for not calling to see you? - No, I was not: I had no occasion to do that.</p>
               <p>You know the least chiding from you, one should consider as an upbraiding: had not you been hinting it to him? - You must excuse my telling you what I was asking him about.</p>
               <p>No, I cannot, nor the Jury will not? - Mr. Beby had been in Ireland, and I was asking him about friends in Ireland.</p>
               <p>You had some friends that he was acquainted with? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was no complaints on your part, that he did not call so often as you wished? - Good God! I never thought of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Of course, you did not say any thing of this kind: why we never see you now; you never call upon us now; why do not you call? - No, I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Was that the first time you saw him since he came over from Ireland? - No, it was not: I had no occasion to complain of his visits, for I was very glad to see him.</p>
               <p>And his visits were not unfrequent? - I declare I cannot tell any thing about that.</p>
               <p>But however, you felt that you had no reason to complain that he did not visit you so frequent as you wished? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Now, though I am a very unfashionable fellow, I should like to know how it was that your eye was fixed on Mr. Beby's breeches pocket: you are not one of the bashful sort, that do not look people in the face: how happened it in such a conversation, your eye should be fixed so much on the breeches pocket? - Why, Sir, his making such a squeeze, made me look down; when I saw his hand in his pocket, I looked down, because I saw the man make such an uncommon bustle.</p>
               <p>You have talked a little about this since it happened? - Talked a little.</p>
               <p>Have you never said now, that you expected Mr. Beby would be a better friend to you than before? - No, Sir, I have no friend in Mr. Beby; you are quite mistaken in that, I assure you.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you a sister? - I have.</p>
               <p>Does she live in the same house with you? - She does.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. A sister by the same father and mother? - We call relations now and then.</p>
               <p>Which was acquainted with Mr. Beby, you or your sister? - Why he was both our acquaintance; we were in company together.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I will speak if you please. May it please your lordship, and the gentlemen of the jury: in addition to the misfortune of standing here, accused of a crime I never committed, I have also the misfortune of being incapable of doing myself justice equal to the prosecutor, however deceived and mistaken he has been: and my lord, as this circumstance happened at the play-house, in a great crowd of people, where the first gentleman or tradesman might be laid hold of, it is not impossible that the prosecutor might be mistaken in what he has sworn: I trust, my lord, that my inability and ignorance to defend myself against such a charge, however false, will not be construed into guilt: I shall therefore rest my defence intirely on the justice and candour of this honourable Court. As to the evidence of

On Wednesday, 18th November, about 7 o'clock, I was on duty in South street, Greenwich, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner Seymour wheelings barrow—I followed him—he drew it round to the second marine store-dealer's shop—I went up to him, and asked where he had brought that from, pointing to the lead—he said a man had given it to him to wheel, I think he said from Greenwich Church—I asked him who the man was—he said he was a strange man; he had never seen him before—I said, "Is there any name on the barrow?"—he said, "Look"—I took him into custody, and I asked the marine store-dealer to place on the barrow again the piece of lead which had just been removed, which was done—on the way to the station, Seymour made a rush, and got away about ten yards—as I pursued him he took hold of a little boy, and threw him against me—I ran round the boy, and he fell—I then pursued the prisoner, and overtook him—I asked him at the station if he had any account to give of the lead—and he said, "None whatever"—I apprehended Standing on the night of 20th at his own house—I told him I had come to take him in charge for being concerned with another man in custody for having a quantity of lead—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "But you hired the truck of a man of the name of Swan the same evening"—he said, "Yes, I did, and if the truck had been lost I must have paid for it"—he also said, "You saw me the same night against the marine store-dealer's shop, and I spoke to you"—I said, "Yes, I saw you pass by when I was speaking to Seymour"—I then took him to the station, and he was charged with being concerned with Seymour, who was then in custody—I am quite sure that he is the man—I know them both—I have known Standing very well for years—I did see him pass by as I was speaking to Seymour, at 7 o'clock, when Seymour was setting on the string of the barrow by the marine store-dealer's shop—I did not see standing in possession of the barrow—I have seen the lead, and weighed it—the weight is one hundredweight and a quarter—I have compared it with the place where it is supposed to have come from, and it fits in length and width and every respect—to the best of my knowledge it is the piece that came off there—there was also on the lead, when I took it off the barrow, some fine coals which were wet at that time, but which have since dried and fallen off.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are the brother of the last witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 12th of July did you watch the proceedings at Doe's house? - A. Yes, I began to watch between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Clark, who was tried at the last Sessions, go into Doe's house with a bag in his hand? - A. Yes, a little before eight o'clock I saw him go into the house with an empty bag, he staid in the house about two or three minutes, and then came out with the bag full; I followed him to see where he carried it; I saw him carry it to a tobacconist's in Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the house of Cable, the prisoner? - A. Yes; he just went in and come out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bag when he came out? - A. I did not see the bag when he came out.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you stand to Cable's house when you saw him go in? - A. I might be about a dozen doors off; he came back and went to Doe's house again, and then I saw him with the bag in his hand when he got near Doe's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stop at Doe's house then? - A. He only just went up and came down directly, with a large parcel on his shoulder; I followed him, and in crossing Old-street-road, near to Golden-lane, Higgins accosted him and they both went on together; and when Clark came almost to the tobacconist's shop, Higgins crossed over the way while Clark went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Clark carry that parcel into Cable's house? - A. Yes; I then returned home again.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time I believe your mother had sent for Armstrong? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you returned from Cable's house did you see Armstrong? - A. Directly I went back; Higgins being taken, I guided Armstrong to Cable's house, and when we were in Cable's house Clark came in; I saw him taken. Armstrong then asked the prisoner, Seago, if any parcel had been brought there that morning; she said, no, none at all, there had been no parcel brought there that morning; Armstrong asked her if she belonged to the shop; she said, no; she mentioned some name of the prisoner, that he was some relation to her, and he would be in presently; I understood her to mean Cable; he came in in about a minute or two afterwards; then Armstrong asked him if there had been any parcel left there that morning; he said, no; when Seago came in he asked her, and said, if there has been any thing tell; then she said there was something left and it was under the counter; they then brought out a parcel which Clark had carried the second time; then I said there was another parcel: Seago said it was up stairs; one of the officers went up stairs with Cable and brought the other parcel down.</p>

About nine o'clock; when I got to Cable's house, I and the boy entered, I knocked, as I saw nobody for about a minute, and then Cable came down stairs; I asked him if he lived there, and if his name was Cable; he said, yes; I then said, has there not been two parcels left here this morning; he said, no, not to his knowledge, for he had been out, and he could prove it; he had been out to his tobacconists, I believe he said, in St. John's-street; I asked him if he had any body to mind his house; I believe his answer was, that he had a niece, and she would be in in a few minutes; before ever his niece came in, Clark came in, whom I knew, and he knew me, I said, secure him (he was tried last Sessions) Clark instantly said to us, I came in for a bit of tobacco. In a minute or two the prisoner Seago came in, without a bonnet or cloak, whom he described as his niece; I then put the question to her in the hearing of Cable, has there been any goods brought here this morning; she said, no; I said, if there has, you may as well tell me; Cable said, if there has, do tell; she then seemed a little surprised, and in a minute she said, there was a parcel left, which was under the counter; I went to the counter and produced all these goods which are in that bag; after I had pulled them out, I said to Mr. Cable, I must go up stairs; Cable said, no, but he made no resistance whatever; I went up stairs, and in the right-hand room on the one pair of stairs, I found this piece of Corduroy on the table, lying open.</p>

Mr. Armstrong asked where the goods were; she said, behind the other counter, not where she was; Mr. Armstrong went and

I cannot say that I noticed that; Armstrong and Cable both went up stairs out of the shop, but whether they went into the room I cannot say, I remained in the shop with Clark; I saw Mr. Armstrong bring down this printed linen and this corduroy; we put the goods, and Seago and Clark, into the coach, and left Cable to shut up the shop, and he came afterwards; he came to the Office afterwards, before the examination took place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Before Mr. Armstrong attempted to go up stairs, did not Mary Seago say there were more goods up stairs? - A. No; I am positive that after her master said to her, tell if there is any left, she then only said behind the counter.</p>

On the 12th of July last, I went out in the morning some little time after seven o'clock to Mr. Finch's, in Whitecross-street; I stopped there some time, as I usually served Mr. Finch with tobacco, and from there I went to Mr. Sculthorpe's, in St. John-street; I continued there till about half past eight. From there, returning home, in Charterhouse-square I met a young man named Jones, I used to serve his father with goods when he kept a public-house; after I parted with him I went home, and when I got home I sent my niece out for some rolls for breakfast; she had not been gone out the space of a minute before in come Mr. Armstrong and another gentleman with him; I was up stairs, at the time they came in, shifting my coat; Mr. Armstrong, and the other man that was with him, knocked on the counter as people do when they come in for a small article they want; I directly came down stairs, I had not time to get my coat on; Mr. Armstrong said to me, has there any small parcels been left here this morning; I said, no, not that I know of; I told them my niece would be in directly, and she could inform them. He had not been in long, before she came in, and he asked her whether there had been any goods left there; she first said, no; I said, if there has been any thing left, say so; she directly said there was some parcel left there by a man. After that, Mr. Armstrong looked behind the counter, which was at a different part of the shop to where I was, and took out a parcel; he then said there is another parcel; she said it was up stairs; I said, Mr. Armstrong, I will go up with you. Accordingly he and I went up together,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300072"></xptr>and the first room he went into he saw a parcel lie on a chest; we have no table in that room; coming out of that room he saw a bit of cotton lying on a chair; he said, does that belong to you; I said, not that I know of.

               <p>Q. How came you to learn it was the 12th of July? - A. Because, we having no tobacco in the house, I went up the street to his shop, and the shop was shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he stopped half an hour? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from his? - A. My house is at the bottom of Whitecross-street; I suppose it is about five minutes walk, or not so much.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have left this Ship public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep a public-house now? - A. No; I sold the lease of that house because my wife's illness would not let me carry it on.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity at a time did you usually supply yourself with of tobacco? - A. Sometimes two pounds, and other times three and four pounds; I sold three different sorts, returns, cut, and shag; I generally used to have a supply of a pound of each at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Mr. Cable to know that you were out of tobacco at that time, you had not let him know that you were out of tobacco? - A. I was out of that article, and most generally he called himself and generally early in the morning; my house opens about six o'clock, or a little before, and about from that time to eight he used to call to know.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you know that you were out of this sort of tobacco? - A. I knew it the night before at ten o'clock, when we shut up; this article, the returns, I keep in a jar, and we always have it on the settle of the bar to fill pipes; it was more generally visited than the other tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you learn that Mr. Cable was taken up? - A. On going up to his house to know why my order was not executed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear particularly to the time he was there? - A. I cannot to the time he came over or under half an hour; I cannot be positive to the exact moment; I did not know there was any necessity of minuting it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that he staid half an hour at your house? - A. It was somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live now? - A. I live in the City-gardens, City-road; I am looking out for another public-house where there is a little more air.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife better? - A. Much better.</p>
               <p>Q. Unto whom did you dispose of your house? - A. To a person of the name of Gillam, who keeps it now</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was this precise time? - A. By the arrangement of my business, it being about breakfast time, which is a little before eight; I asked the prisoner at the bar to have some breakfast; he preferred beer.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know this by any clock? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he enter into any conversation with you? - A. No further than what orders were wanting.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after he was taken up were you applied to to give evidence? - A. Cable sent to my father's house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular that morning - you did not know that he was going to be taken up in an hour afterwards - what particularly called your attention to it? - A. Because I was going to Holborn.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. It was a fortnight or three weeks after you met him, that you heard you were to be an evidence? - A. I cannot recollect exactly to a week.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. I dare say you looked at the church clocks that you passed? - A. No, not particularly; I might look at half a dozen or more for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at St. Andrew's clock? - A. I might.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you can give me the minute that you arrive at the person's house at Holborn-hill? - A. Perhaps it might be nine o'clock, or a little before, when I got there; I stopped there with Mr. Andrews, the public-house-keeper; it is a watering-house; about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. On particular business? - A. Not particular with him; I called on my way to Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us before you went to Holborn-hill on particular business? - A. It was particular business; Mr. Andrews had a bill on me; I went to him to get him to allow me a little time to pay it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then it was particular; what was the amount of the bill? - A. Seven pounds seventeen shillings, for poultry I had of Mr. Andrews, the publican, when I kept the sign of the Pewter Platter in Charles-street, Hatton-garden; the bill became due about the 15th or 16th of July; he said he would not mind giving me a week or ten days; I took it up about a fortnight afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You went from there where to? - A. To Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>Q. That was likewise particular business? - A. I went to the Admiralty, to a young man, one of the messengers there, that owed me twenty shillings; from there I went over Westminster-bridge to a Mr. - , who is the paviour of the Borough; I staid there an hour or more, I believe; I came in the city afterwards; I came over London-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where to; the city is a large place? - A. I believe I stopped and had a glass of ale at the Flower-pot, the corner of Threadneedle-street; I cannot exactly tell you where.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will ask you how lately you kept a public-house in Charles-street? - A. Until last May; I declined it.</p>
               <p>Court Q. Now mind, you say that is the reason you left it, you declined it; you may alter it if you please; you know that if a man declines a thing he willingly renounces it? - A. I was obligated to decline it; my affairs did not go on very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that to be the reason? - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Perhaps you may give me a little plainer answer than that; what do you mean by your affairs not going on well? - A. I became insolvent, and was obliged to leave it; from there I went to live in apartments in Banner-street, where I lived about six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were lodging in Banner-street at the time you have been speaking of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You became insolvent in May; from that time to this have you done any one thing to get a livelihood? - A. There are several of my debts I have collected in.</p>
               <p>Q. Debts you say you have collected in; an insolvent man always gives up his debts - have you lived upon them ever since? - A. Partly; my wife has an annuity.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in no way of getting a livelihood? - A. Not permanent.</p>
               <p>Q. Temporary or permanent, have you had one week's birth of any kind? - A. No more than gathering these small debts.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not getting a livelihood - to what amount has these small debts been? - A. About 28 l. the small debts in town.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live in Charles-street? - A. About nine months.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray where did you live before you went there? - A. In Bateman's-row, Shoreditch. There I lived in private previous to my going to Charles-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by living in private? - A. In the first place, I had a concern in the Southampton coach about seven months; I kept a house in in Bateman's-row about five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you clerk to a merchant? - A. Yes, I was clerk to

               <p>JOHN VICKERY sworn - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are a Police-officer of Worship-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember the circumstance of the wool being stolen from Mr. Dellatory? - A. Yes, I and Armstrong apprehended the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in search of the last witness, could you find him? - A. No, we went to his house in Bateman's-row two or three times, we could not find him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You say you have been at his house; by whose directions were you trying to find him out? - A. By the direction of the clerks.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long were you after him? - A. We were three times after him; there was a great deal of wool stole; I have seen him since that man was tried; then we could not get proof against him; I certainly knew him, and if I had seen him before I should have took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen him in this Court-yard, should not you have taken him up? - A. I will not say that I should, because when we are here we attend particularly to the Court; we do not attend to any thing out of doors.</p>

                  </hi> I am the niece of William Storer—he lives in St. George's-street. On the 27th of Nov. I was sitting in my parlour behind the shop—Bush beckoned me to the door and said, "Some one has stolen your umbrellas—I looked, and saw some had been taken from the window—I looked out, but could not see any one—I saw a pane of glass had been broken where the umbrellas had been—presently I saw these three brought back, and knew them—I had put them into the window about two hours previously, and the window was perfect a quarter of an hour before—these are my uncle's property.</p>

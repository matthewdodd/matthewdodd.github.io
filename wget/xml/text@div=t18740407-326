I keep the Britannia beerhouse in Clifton Street, Bethnal Green—on Thursday, the 12th March last, the prisoner brought this large bible to my house—he offered it me for sale—I declined to purchase—I went out for a little while and on my return I found this clock in a conspicuous place in the bar—in the evening prisoner came and asked me to purchase the clock and I declined—he stayed in my house till nearly twelve o'clock at night, and then he asked me "If I would allow the clock to remain until next day"—I said "Yes," and I allowed it to remain—on the following morning, Friday, a friend of mine came in, I spoke to him—he went out</p>

I want to dispose of it; I said, I should like it, but have no money; and I went to this Mr. Tovey, and asked him if he wanted to buy a spring saw; he said, yes; and I sold it to Mr. Tovey, on the 14th of August, that very week I was sick on my benefit club, and I received my ten shillings on the 17th of August; I had the saw full three weeks before I took it to him: whether it is the same saw, I cannot tell; it is a saw that has been in use at Mr. Tovey's ever since the 13th, and so knocked about, I think it impossible to swear to any particular mark.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

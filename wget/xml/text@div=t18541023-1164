                  </hi>. My father's name is William Stirling; he is a slate merchant, and lives at West Ham—the prisoner was my father's carman. On the evening of 28th Sept., about 8 o'clock, I saw a strange man outside our loft, on the flat which led into the loft—it was dark—I saw the man put a sack of oats down into Reed's yard, who is a beer shop keeper, next to my father's premises—the man laid down on his face on the flat, and after that he turned up, and jumped with his back towards me into Reed's yard—the prisoner came round to me, I cannot say from whence he came, and I asked him what was amiss—he said it was nothing but a sack of chaff he was going to sell to Reed for a pot of beer, to make a mattrass of—I walked up the road with him, and he said, "Don't tell the governor, or else you will ruin me for ever"—I had not said anything to him—I went to my cousin's, and then went into Reed's, and demanded to see the sack—it con<lb></lb>tained about four bushels of oats and half a bushel of beans—there were oats in my father's loft similar to those in the sack, and there were beans</p>

               <p>similar to those I found half a bushel of in this particular sack—beans and oats mixed are the usual sort of fodder—the value of the oats and beans in the sack was about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was there while my cousin and I examined the sack—I went for an officer—we examined the loft; we could tell that there was a quarter of oats missing in two days—I believe those beans and oats in the sack had formed a part of my father's stock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cousin of the last witness—I live at Stratford—I am a slater. About 8 o'clock in the evening of 28th Sept., I accompanied the last witness to Reed's beer shop—I saw a sack which contained oats and beans—while I was looking in the sack I saw the prisoner—he asked me what I was at—I told him I wanted to see what was in the sack—he said it was only chaff; I told him it was a strange kind of chaff, there were oats and beans—he then said, "For God's sake, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, don't tell the governor; it is the first time I have done it; you know, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, my father is just dead, my mother is dying, and my wife is very ill; I wanted to make a little money"—that was 'true; his father died about a week before of the cholera, and his mother was dying, and his wife was very ill—he said, "Let us put it up in the loft again," and we did—there has been nothing known against him before—he had a very good character.</p>

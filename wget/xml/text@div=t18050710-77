               <p>Q. Were you present? - A. Yes; I asked her how she came by that watch; she said it was not her's, it belonged to a girl at the door; the girl at the door was called in.</p>

            ; I asked her if the watch belonged to her, and she said it did; she told me she had had it for three weeks, and she had brought it with her from Chatham. A young man that was standing in company with us told her she had stole it in the course of the night, and had picked some young man's pocket of it; her answer to that was, were you in our place you would do the same; upon that I stopped the watch, and I immediately went to one of the officers belonging to Marlborough-street, and he told me to bring it to the Office by eleven o'clock in the morning. About eight o'clock on the Monday morning, the owner of the watch came with one of the girl's mother and one of the officers of Queen-square; he owned the watch, and the mother of the girl wanted to give me five shillings, and to take the property out of my hands; I told the officer, no, I would not give it up till I gave it up before the Magistrate.</p>

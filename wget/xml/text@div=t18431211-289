                  </hi>. I am occasional shopman to Henry Faith of High-street, Shadwell. On the night of the 7th Dec., about half-past nine o'clock, I missed a leg of salt pork from a rail outside the shop window—I had hung it there myself tome hours before—I believe this produced to be it, by the out and its having rather a thick rind.</p>

On the 7th of Dec., betwee nine and ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Shadwell-market, running towards New-street, between three and four hundred yards from the prosecutor's shop—I followed him to the water-side at the Dock-stairs—he was in the act of getting into a boat, when I came up to him—in his way, be threw something over some palings—I did not go to see what it was then, but ran after him—I asked</p>

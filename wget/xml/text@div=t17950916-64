               <p>Q. From where did you lose your watch? - From where I lodge. On the 8th of July, Wednesday, I believe. I will not be positive, (the prisoner had been often up to my place to see me, and never had the opportunity of seeing me) he came out of friendship to see my wife, and I was not at home. I am an out door business.</p>

            ? - Yes. I happened to meet Mr. Beetle about four months before this depradation was done, in the City-road, he told me that he knew me; I knew him, but would not make myself known to him; he said he was certain I knew him when he was an apprentice; he asked me where I lived? I told him I lived at <placeName id="t17950916-64-crimeloc370">No.40, Skinner-street</placeName>

He came to see me there; he see my little children coming from school, and he said, Mrs. Crowther, I shall bring my wife down to tea with me. He came several times, and he told me that his wife was very bad with a white swelling in her knee -</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us how you lost your watch? - Mr. Beetle came on the 8th of July, I think it was Wednesday, coming up stairs he said he had an acquaintance below; I said, undoubtedly ask your acquaintance up. I had nothing in the house to drink, and they seemed a little naturally in liquor; I fetched a pot of porter from the Weavers Arms, in Skinner-street, and when I came up with the pot of porter I see the stranger that was along with Mr. Beetle come out of the back room; I have two rooms where I have lived these ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him go into your room? - No; I was gone for the pot of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave these two men in your room while you went for the porter? - Yes; my eldest daughter was there. They staid and drank the beer; they went down stairs after drinking the beer, and went away. About half an hour after that I went to the back room, I went to go about my work, and I cast my eyes to a little mahogany case, and I missed the watch out of it. Mr. Beetle told me he would be back in twenty minutes, I waited patiently twenty minutes; finding Mr. Beetle did not come back, I was afraid that the rogue was played with me by his acquaintance. I was told where he lived, I went to his house, but I did not meet with any kind treatment there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find the prisoner? - The next day, coming out of his own door, about half after nine, as near as I can guess. I thought that he rather walk ed fast, and I told my husband that was the person that I suspected; he asked me, I told him I did not suspect nobody but the acquaintance of Mr. Beetle; my husband said, if I did not suspect him he would not cry out stop thief; I said, I suspected the acquaintance that was with him, and I did not know where to find him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160195"></xptr>Q. Did you stop the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, my husband stopped him; he abused my husband, which I compute to his liquor, for he was very much in liquor; he told my husband that I was a very bad woman, and he had lain with me.</p>
               <p>Q. But what did he say about the watch? - He did not say any thing. He was taken before the magistrate; Mr. Bare coming up said, shall I take him into custody? my husband said, yes; he took him in custody. He was taken before the magistrate, and he abused my husband before the magistrate, which exasperated my husband very much. The magistrate asked if he had been searched? Mr. Bare said, he had not; and there was a watch taken from him with no chain nor seals to it; I saw it in the clerk's hands, it was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the name or No.? - No. The chain was an old metal chain; I don't remember that there was any key to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The justice was very loath to commit him without the number or name being known? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. The stranger that you say came with the prisoner, you see come out of the back room? - Yes, the stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the stranger since? - I have taken two or three for him; I have heard that he is gone on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you swear to the watch if you was to see it? - No, I don't think I could.</p>
               <p>Q. It was the next morning you was at the prisoner's house, and you found him at home, where he was most likely to be? - Yes, coming out of his own house.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK SERGEANT</hi>. I am a clerk in the firm of Willoughby and Cox, attorneys. I have here the proceedings in an action of "Steadman V. Knight"—I produce the writ of summons, the issue, and the record—the verdict was for the plaintiff, damages 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in addition to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid into court—I remember the taxation of costs—I have a memorandum here on the final judgment paper, by which I can tell when the damages and costs were paid—it is" June 25, 1852; received 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that was the amount of the damages beyond the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not the dates of payment here, bat they were paid afterwards—time was given for payment of the costs—I have got the subpœnas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let me look at the subpœnas—(<hi rend="italic">the witness handed them</hi> in)—I suppose you attended the trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not; Mr. Cox did—I only know from representations made that Mr. Steadman was seriously injured on that occasion—I suppose I saw him about that time—I do not of my own knowledge know that he was attended by Mr. Digby, the surgeon, for the injuries he received—I believe Mr. Cox is not here—he did not intend to come; he has not been subpœnaed—he is at his office—the cause was in the paper for the 9th June, but I believe the verdict was given on the 10th—I received a memorandum of the witnesses that were subpœnaed by Shadrake—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I delivered the subpœnas either to Shadrake or Mr. Steadman, I could not say which—I delivered subpœnas to be taken into the country, as I understood—I do not know now whether the names were stated on that occasion—I cannot say positively whether I delivered the subpœnas in blank—I filled up the body</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280002"></xptr>
               <p>of them, but whether I left blanks for the names or not I cannot positively state—the names are now all filled in in my handwriting, but that was very probably done after the trial was over, when there was a statement handed to me by either Shadrake or Mr. Steadman of the names of the witnesses who attended; it is very likely that I then for the first time filled them up in the original subpœnas, but I cannot say now—I might have delivered the copy subpœnas with directions to fill them in—this subpœna (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) includes the names of William Sparks, Robert Miller, John Williams, all of Emscote, Warwickshire; and this other subpœna includes the names of Benjamin Dickerson and Alfred Carter—since the trial of this action I believe our firm has made a further application to Mr. Knight for further injury to Mr. Steadman since the issuing of the writ.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that of your own knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen the letter—I cannot say that I posted it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has Mr. Knight since the trial been called upon by any of your firm on the subject to your knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not to my knowledge—I received from Shadrake or Mr. Steadman, I will not say positively which, a memorandum of the witnesses that had been subpœnaed—this is the memorandum—I cannot speak positively to Shadrake's handwriting—I think I recollect an occasion upon which I have seen him write—I believe this memorandum is in his writing; it contains the names of Sparks, Miller, Williams, Dickenson, and Carter—Shadrake acted on the part of Mr. Steadman in the course of the proceedings before they came to trial—he was at our office on several occasions; he was foreman to Mr. Steadman, I believe—I attended the taxation of the costs—I can tell, by referring to the office copy of the bill of costs, what was allowed for the attendance of these five witnesses—nothing was allowed for William Sparks, or Miller, Williams, or Carter—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was allowed for Dickenson—Mr. Cox, the plaintiff's attorney, was in attendance at that time, and the defendant's attorney also—I believe Mr. Knight was not present at the taxation—after the taxation I believe Mr. Knight applied for time to pay, and it was given him as far as the costs were concerned—he paid by instalments.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look at those subpœnas: can you undertake to say when they were filled up, before or after action? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot undertake to say whether they were filled up, as regards the names, before or after the trial—I know nothing of my own knowledge of the service of these subpœnas—I gave them out, understanding that they were to be taken down to Emscote—the sums allowed at the original taxation of costs are marked here in black ink, and those at the review of the taxation in red ink—opposite the name of William Sparks there is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in red ink, and that is taken off in black ink; and the like with regard to Miller and Williams—17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. appears here as the amount taken off on the review—Dickenson was originally allowed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was taken off on the review—other items were also taken off, which constituted a portion of the tavern expenses (<hi rend="italic">reading the items</hi>)—I did not attend the review, nor was I in the Court of Exchequer when judgment was given—speaking from recollection, I believe some reduction was made on the review for the subpœnas of these four witnesses, which had been previously allowed—I have seen Mr. Steadman at our office on several occasions whilst the action was going on, not giving instructions, the instructions were generally given by Shadrake, his clerk—I did not see Mr. Steadman much till the latter part of the proceedings—I am not aware that the Judges of the Exchequer ordered this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There were sixteen witnesses, I believe, subpœnaed</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler of Emscote, in Warwickshire.

Knight—I was never subpœnaed on such a trial, and was not there—Steadman did not pay me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expenses as a witness—Shadrake and his clerk, and Mr. Steadman, had been boarding and lodging at my house, they occasionally doing work at the Asylum; and they might want me, but I never was subpœnaed and never was paid—I know William Carter; I cannot say whether I saw him on 9th and 10th June at Emscote, for I saw him most days—he is an iron founder, and his foundry is close to me—I do not think it probable that there was an interval of four days at that time without my seeing him—I cannot say whether I ever saw him for four days together, or two days together—I know William Sparks; he was down working there in June last, but could not swear whether I saw him on 9th and 10th June—I know Robert Miller and John Williams, but cannot swear whether I saw them on those two days; but they were at work, and came to my house two days afterwards to be paid their wages—I do not know of their leaving; they were backwards and forwards at my house every two or three days—the first time I heard that my name had been put down as a witness was a few days after the trial.</p>

                  </hi>.

I said, "Yes, it is no use stopping down there: you never sent us word where we were to get our money from for our wages, or anything else; I thought it was most time, then, to come up;" he said, "Oh, that is all right, I expect some money in a few days, and that will be all right; I will pay you when I get the money"—after that he asked me whether Mr. Bushel had called at my house (that is a party that used to work at Steadman's shop)—I said that he had: he said directly, "He is trying to do me all the injury he can"—this was about a fortnight or three weeks after I now know the trial to have taken place, but Mr. Steadman never said a word about the action—in consequence of what Mr. Steadman said to me, I went down to Warwickshire again to finish some particular work at the Asylum, but I only stayed there a few days—I then came up to town by myself, and Williams and Miller-came up two or three days afterwards—we did not all go to the shop together, I was the first that went; we were to meet there on that day—I had seen Mr. Steadman in London before, about eight or nine days before they came up; that would be about a month after 10th June—I went in first—I did not see Mr. Steadman when I first went in (I saw his man), he was upstairs; I afterwards saw him, and he said to me, "I intended to give Mr. Shadrake a subpœna to give you down at Warwick"—he said that because he had heard that Bushel had been at my house, and found I was not at the trial—he told me that he had charged for us at the trial, and said that if anybody should ask me if I was at the trial, I was to say yes; and to avoid my telling a falsehood in one way, he would send his man along with us to take us down to the Court, and show us the Court where the trial was at Westminster, so that if anybody asked us if we were at the Court, we could merely say we were at the Court; and with that he gave me a subpœna enclosed in an envelope, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this was a month after the trial—after that conversation Williams and Miller came in, and he spoke to them in a similar way: I heard him tell them they were to go down to the Court along with this man, who would show us the Court, and if anybody asked us if we had been at the Court we could say "yes"—he did not serve them with subpœnas himself; his man did, in the shop, but not in his presence—he was upstairs,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280005"></xptr>
               <p>and sent them down by the man—we then all four left together, me, Miller, Williams, and Yorston, and went from there down to Westminster, into the Court of Exchequer, I think it was: and Yorston said, "Here is where the case was tried; you will know if anybody asks you where it was"—there was some cause or other being tried there then, but we did not stop long enough to know what it was; we only stopped about a couple of minutes in Court—we came out and went into a public-house, and Yorston said, "This is the public-house where we stopped and had some refreshment, and you can say this was the public-house where you were when the trial was going on"—Yorston was sent by Steadman himself—we had some refreshment, a drop or two of beer and a bit of steak, and parted in the evening—Mr. Steadman never mentioned this matter afterwards—it is from three to four months ago since I was applied to to give evidence in this matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a working smith and engineer. I was at work at Emscote the whole of June, and of course on the 9th and 10th—I did not come up to the trial of Steadman <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Knight; I was not subpœnaed on that trial—I never received 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as my expenses on that trial; I did not hear of the trial till after it was over—about a month afterwards I was at Mr. Steadman's, with Sparks and Miller, and saw Mr. Steadman; he did not say anything about my being a witness on the action—Sparks was there before Miller and I arrived—I received this subpœna there that day from Yorston, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with it; we were then taken by Yorston to Westminster, and he showed us the Court, and then took us to a public-house; he had the expenses to pay for Mr. Steadman; I know that, because I saw Mr. Steadman put some money into his hands to pay our expenses before we started—Yorston paid for the whole of our refreshment.</p>

I was foreman to Mr. Steadman about four years, and was so at the time of the trial between Steadman and Knight—I have since left—before that trial, Mr. Steadman's health had been very bad for some time, and he was very ill then, from being thrown out of his chaise; he was not able to attend to business, and I attended to it for him—I remember receiving some subpœnas from Mr. Sergeant—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I received them two days before the trial—after I had received them, I received some money; it was either from Mr. Sergeant or Mr. Steadman—I think it was about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was to subpœna the different witnesses—I was to pay them when I served the subpœnas on them—I had more subpœnas than these—my directions were to subpœna those in town, and at Emscote, in Warwickshire, also—I did not go to Emscote; I had not time—I went to the railway station the day before the trial, but was too late for the first train, and the next train would not have taken me in time to get them up for the trial; I did not go—it was half-past 11 o'clock at night before I subpœnaed the last in town—I did not see Mr. Steadman afterwards till the morning of the trial—I did not say anything to him about not having subpœnaed these persons—I was a witness at the trial—the witnesses were not allowed to be in Court—Mr. Steadman came out, and asked whether the witnesses were all there; and I said, yes, they were all there—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the paper already put in</hi>) one side of this paper was written by me, the side containing the list of</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, carrying on business in the name of Willoughby and Cox; it is a firm of long standing. We were employed to bring an action against Mr. Knight, and in the ordinary course we learned what means he had of proof—there would likewise have been a question of the amount of damages he sustained; there was a count for special damages—for the purposes of proof it was necessary that certain witnesses should be subpœnaed from the place where his works went on—Sparks was one of those witnesses, Miller was another, Dickenson another, Williams another, and Carter another—it was not to prove special damages in the ordinary sense of the term—it was for the purpose of proving his absence through inability to attend, through illness—all those names were on the brief, excepting Carter, whose name was by accident omitted—I had his name in the instructions—I received those instructions from Mr. Steadman, and he gave me those names—on the trial I did not know what witnesses were present, but before the trial began I asked Steadman if all his witnesses were there—on that he left the Court for a minute or two—I do not know whether the witnesses had been turned out of Court, but Shadrake was out of Court—Steadman came back in a couple of minutes, and told me that all the witnesses were there, and upon that the trial proceeded—none of those witnesses were called, as they were subpœnaed for the purpose of proving his not attending to his business, and his illness had been so perfectly proved by the medical man that it was not necessary—my counsel were Mr. Crowder and Mr. Pitt Taylor—during the proceedings Mr. Steadman appeared to be suffering from what the medical men said was the effect of this accident—his head was tied up till shortly before the trial, and his arm was in a sling at the time of the trial—he appeared</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280009"></xptr>
               <p>to me to be suffering from ill health—I saw Shadrake several times in the course of the proceedings—I got the case up myself—my clerk Sergeant was not more directly in communication with him than me, till after the trial was over—Shadrake appeared to be taking an active part in the matters, as Mr. Steadman seemed very much excited, and his memory appeared to be affected in some manner—he had received an injury on his head—it was stated by counsel that we could not recover for damages after the writ issued; whatever moneys had been disbursed after the writ issued could not be recovered—in consequence of that, I after this action made a communication to Mr. Knight—we did not say anything about another action—I endeavoured to act as mediator, but did not succeed—I should not have brought another action; I was very sorry to go on with this—I had no difficulty in getting the costs—they were not paid all at once—an application was made to us by a client of ours, whose name I do not wish to mention, and we gave some little time—if we had said we would not give time, I believe they would have been paid—we gave our client time for his damages on an application of the then defendant—the affidavit in which I unfortunately joined was, I think, made on 17th June—the first taxation was on 19th. June, but Mr. Jay could not attend, and I believe it was about 22nd or 23rd June—something was struck off on that taxation, but merely for tavern bills and matters of that kind—nothing further was struck off on the review of the taxation—that was not after the long vacation—the meeting to review was held in Michaelmas Terms—it was quite unnecessary for me to have joined in the affidavit, except as to the materiality—I have no doubt, and had none, of the materiality of those five witnesses; if I had not known that they were there at she time the Jury were sworn, I should not have gone on with the case, without the advice of counsel, because counsel had advised them to be subpœnaed—I should say that on the morning after the trial Mr. Steadman called at the office, and I requested him to get the christian and surnames of the witnesses who were in actual attendance at the Court—he afterwards brought back the paper, with the names of the witnesses on it in Shadrake's writing, and then I said, "As my clerk will have to draw the affidavit of increase, hand that list to him?" and I see here is my clerk's writing the "eight miles" where "distance" is written, and I really had nothing more to do with it till the affidavit of increase was made—affidavits of increase are not in printed forms—there is a form in the practice from which our clerk draws the affidavit—I cannot say much about the state of Steadman's health on the day we made the affidavit jointly—he seemed quiet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not yourself prepare the affidavit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No: it was read over to Steadman either by me, or by my clerk in my presence—I consider, as a respectable practitioner, that making any affidavit is of the first importance—Steadman's attention was called at the time to the sums of money that he was prepared to say he paid to them—if we had known that that was not true, we should have kicked him out of the office; but Mr. Steadman himself gave me the amounts paid to those witnesses—on 15th June I. took down a statement that they had not all been paid, and I gave him a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go and pay the balance—he stated on the 15th all the sums that the parties had been paid, and said that Yorston had not been paid, and that there were some other sums to pay; the amount of the list he gave me two days before was 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had exhausted his funds, and I gave him the cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go and pay the rest; and on the morning of 16th or 17th he said that they had all been paid, and I gave him an affidavit to go to my clerk and till in the names.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If Mr. Steadman was in a state of mind not to understand the contents, should you have allowed him to swear the affidavit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was perfectly in a sound state of mind, there is no doubt about it—I do not recollect advancing any money to Steadman before the trial after the trial we did—I should say I saw Shadrake as long as a week before the trial; I will not swear it was not longer, I saw him off and on, because the case was in hand several months—I lost sight of him about a week before the trial: I should say here, that short notice of trial was given, from the 4th to the 9th, and there was very little time to subpœna the witnesses, who, being in Warwickshire, I desired my clerk to issue the four subpoenas, and to fill up the copies and give them all to Shadrake, and desire Steadman to be very particular, and see that they were all subpœnaed; and then Shadrake went down to subpoena them, as there was not time to send the subpoenas down to an agent—Shadrake never told me that he missed the train going down to Emscote, I never heard that before to-day—if I had I should not have gone on with the trial without speaking to counsel—these two copies, of subpoenas were issued from our office either on 5th or 6th June, and all the paper copies—I did not give any out, Mr. Sergeant gave them out, but the parchment subpoenas I do not believe ever left our office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Sergeant said he could not tell whether the subpoenas were filled in before or after the trial; what is the meaning of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You cannot fill in the witnesses names in full till you know them, and therefore the subpoena is always issued in blank, and when the name is put in the copy, of course it is in the original; but it ought not to be put in after the trial, if it was so it was not done with my knowledge: there is no doubt that the moment a trial is over the parchment subpoena should be left in the same state, and if this has been touched it is not with my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it that you first heard that these witnesses were not in attendance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the day we attended to tax the costs Mr. Jay said some of the witnesses were not present, and I replied with considerable warmth, and said they were there; I did not think he meant the imputation against me, but it came on me by surprise—at that time I had before me Steadman's affidavit—in what I have stated in my affidavit as regards the attendance, I have relied on the statements that Steadman made to me; and but for the experience I have had, I should not have hesitated in doing the same over again, in reference to any other client who I believed to be respectable; afterwards, when I found out the cause of this unfortunate matter, I paid their solicitor all the money that it had cost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came it that Shadrake's bill of costs was turned into 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We received the money and paid it to Mr. Shadrake; after the order to review, Mr. Jay said he was informed that some witnesses did not come from Warwickshire, and I said to them, "I have had enough of affidavits, make your statement to the Master;" and they did, and were treated as town witnesses, and the bill of costs was reduced from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that had been actually paid to Shadrake—we did not also pay him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Dickenson—Steadman never paid me back, he was in prison—I have no doubt Mr. Jay believed Dickenson had not come up to London on purpose, I am sure Mr. Jay would not make a statement unless he believed it was true—three sums of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. allowed on the original taxation for Sparks, Miller, and Williams, were disallowed because the Master said that we had too many witnesses to one fact; I drew the Master's attention the counsel's opinion, and he said, "Well, I sometimes differ with counsel, and I do here"—it was Master Walton—it was not on the ground of their not having been paid, but because they were not necessary; if they were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280011"></xptr>
               <p>necessary, the affidavit would have carried them—there would be no inquiry about them on the review, only they were put into the affidavit—there would be no question about them on the review as to the sums; for the purpose of getting anything back it was unnecessary, because nothing had been paid—that would also refer to Alfred Carter 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deducted, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. allowed to Benjamin Dickenson—we should have banded over every 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Mr. Steadman, we do not keep another person's money—we waited for the trial to come on at the Exchequer all day on the 9th, and the case came on about 12 o'clock on the 10th—Steadman was examined as a witness for about an hour or an hour and a half; he was obliged to sit down while he was being examined—he was not ordered out of Court with the other witnesses, it was arranged that the parties themselves should not go out, either before or after—he was in Court on the 9th and on the 10th—I saw him next morning at ay office, and on the 13th.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By arrangement he remained in Court, the other witnesses being out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was the case on both days—he remained in Court on the day the cause was tried—from the beginning to the end Stead man never told me that be had subpœnaed the witnesses himself; he never conveyed that to me—Shadrake was constantly assisting him; I had a great deal of trouble in getting the evidence together—since this case, Steadman has taken the benefit of the Insolvent Debtors' Act; he was only out of prison a few days before the last Sessions</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether be has been a bankrupt before this; and also, whether be has compounded with his creditors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know whether he has compounded with his creditors before; all I can say is, he has been a client of our office for fifteen years, and I always considered him a respectable man—he employed a good many men at one time, as many as forty—they had full notice that these parties had never been paid—I took the office copies to Steadman, and being considerably excited that we should hare been led to adopt the course we had, I read them to him and said, "Will you venture to make an affidavit that you knew they were there, or believed them to be there?" and he said, "No, I will not; but at the time I made my affidavit, I believed they were in attendance;" we felt bound to do it in showing cause against the rule, so as not to let him slip through, merely because he was in prison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your proposition to make an affidavit that they were there, or that he still believed they were there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said, "It is my duty to read to you these affidavits;" and having read them, I said, "Will you now venture to swear you knew they were there, or that you now believe they were there?" he said he would not, and said, "but at the time I made my affidavit I believed they were"—I did not understand from him that he had subpœnaed the parties himself, and I should not like to say that I understood from him that he had personally paid them, but he said they ware paid; I do not think my inquiries at the time went to that—what he told me did not necessarily imply that he had paid them himself—my memorandum is," Alfred Evans has received one guinea, "and the others in the same way" has received.

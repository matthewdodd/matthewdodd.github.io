               <p>What did he tell you? - He said he believed the giving way of the window was by the force that they thrust him against it, I believe it had a lead in it, but they threw him with such violent force against it that it gave way.</p>
               <p>Court. You believe, that is only your supposition, did your husband tell you so? - He said so.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did you see any man take hold of his leg to shove him out? - I was on the outside when he was thrown out, if he was thrown out; he fell very steep, not as if he had got out of his own accord, because he fell right on his shoulders.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did not the windows open in the manner these do? - No, Sir, they slid too, that part he got out of seemed to slide too, and another part of the window seemed to lift up; the window fell when he lay on the ground, when he was thrown out, the window came out after him, it did not seem to fall upon his leg, it seemed to be catched by some body.</p>
               <p>Did the window follow him as he fell into the street? - It fell just as he fell, it seemed to be a part of a window, it had got five or six squares.</p>
               <p>Was the paper read which the deceased produced? - No, Sir, they did not give him time.</p>
               <p>He put his hand in his pocket as if for a pistol? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What was the consequence of that? - The consequence was, that in about a fortnight after, there were symptoms of a locked jaw, and the third day after the symptoms appeared he died.</p>

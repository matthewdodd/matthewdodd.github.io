            . I am a watchman of St. Pancras. On the morning of the 3d of August, I was in Tottenham-court-road, about one o'clock; I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner entangled together - there were two persons standing not far off, who made off; I took the prisoner and prosecutor both to the watch-house, and the prosecutor charged him with robbing him of 1l. 15s. - he did not say it was a sovereign; he had been drinking, but he seemed sensible enough to know what he was about.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

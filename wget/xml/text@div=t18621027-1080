                  </hi>. I attend to my uncle's business at Coles' Upper-wharf, Horsleydown—my uncle and father are wharfingers—Kent and Symes were in our employ at the time this matter happened—Kent had been in our employ three or four years as a lighterman—on Thursday, 2d October, we had two barges of wheat, the <hi rend="italic">Exchange</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Scion</hi>, wh ch had loaded from two vessels in the Victoria-dock, and from there they come to our two wharves, one to Coles' Upper-wharf, and the other to a wharf higher up the river, where they were to discharge—my uncle gave the men the directions, in my presence; I partly directed them—the <hi rend="italic">Exchange</hi> had 284 quarters 6 bushels—I know that from the meter certificates—the barges ought each</p>

               <p>to have been at the wharves on Thursday evening, 2d October, about 9 o'clock in the evening—Symes, and Wright, one of the witnesses, had charge of the <hi rend="italic">Exchange</hi>—her cargo was 284 quarters 6 bushels of American spring wheat—it was the duty of one of them to stop with the barge until it came to the wharf, and the duty of the other to come home and say where it had got to—I was not there when it arrived—it arrived early in the morning—I first saw it on the Friday morning, between 7 and S o'clock, at the wharf—the men had left the craft; it is usual for them to go and get their meals if they have not had them—the cargo of the <hi rend="italic">Exchange</hi> was loaded into the warehouse at Coles' Upper-wharf—it was afterwards weighed by Kelly, by my instructions; I did not see it weighed—the cargo of the <hi rend="italic">Scion</hi> was American winter wheat—Kent and Gresham had charge of the <hi rend="italic">Scion</hi>, the cargo of which was landed with the bulk in the warehouse—that was measured—I have been shown samples of both parcels, and we have com<lb></lb>pared them with the bulk in the warehouse; we have compared these samples with each of the cargoes, and found them correspond in every par<lb></lb>ticular.</p>

               <p>quarter of wheat tilled in the outside barge, and then Kent rowed down in a skiff, and assisted us, and we got about five quarters of wheat out of each craft—the craft was locked down; Symes opened the outside barge before Kent came down; he took the hatches off—I cannot say who unlocked the other—there was a flour barge between the two barges from which we took the corn—after we had got the corn into our punt, Oliver and I covered it up, and then Symes and I dropped down with the tide to a coal collier, lying at King and Queen Granary, which is lower down than the Surrey Canal buoy, nut near Finnis's—Oliver stopped in the craft—after that, Kent came down is a skiff, and we went on shore to see if we could get any beer; the houses were closed, and then we rowed off again to Kent's craft and lay there till 3 o'clock in the morning—then they gave me a step into my punt and three of them rowed across to Shadwell after that—I got up to Finnish about 6 o'clock after having been to Ings and woke him up—Finnis lives at 27, Commercial-road-east—he opened the door to me himself—I saw his sister; she came to the window first, and I asked to see him—I did not tell her what I wanted; I asked her whether John Finnis was in, and then Finnis came—I told him we had got about ten quarters of wheat—he said, "Oh, did you?"—he asked me where I got it from—I told him the Surrey canal buoy, that I expected to have had to go to the East India Docks for it, but the craft came up to the Surrey Canal buoy—he said it was all right, and I told him to come and get it out of the craft—I waited for him—he walked down with me and went into Williams', and had some breakfast, and I went and shoved the punt ashore under his premises—he employed a chap named Wilson to heave on the crane, and about half an hour afterwards Ings came dowu—I and lugs were on the barge unloading it a little while afterwards, when another chap, named George Leggan, stepped on the punt, and asked if they wanted anybody to lend them a band—I left just before the boat was unloaded—that was, I should say, between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, but I will not be sure—I did not give any order to Finnis—I did not see or know of any order—I do not know a person of the name of Martin; I never heard of him—Kent and Symes came while we were un<lb></lb>loading, and saw what was going on—Symes stepped on the punt, and said, "You have got about two quarters more left"—they spoke to Finnis—I could not hear what was said—I saw them go away; the two walked first, and Finnis walked behind them—that was just before it was unloaded.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames Police-inspector</hi>). I received some information on Friday, 3d October, from Adams, a constable, in consequence of which, I went to Finnis's wharf between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, and saw Finnis—I said to him, "Have you received a quantity of wheat this morning"—he said, "Yes," pointing to some wheat on the jetty at the wharf—I said, "On whose order did you receive this wheat?”—he said, "I received an order from the boy Horn, for Mr. Martin"—I said, "Do you know Mr. Martin?"—he said, "Yes, I have had dealings with Mr. Martin once or twice before"—he said, "I received three quarters of wheat about a fortnight ago from him"—he then immediately said, "No, I received five quarters of wheat from him five weeks ago"—he said that as if correcting himself—he produced this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "Do you mean Mr. Martin or <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> Symes?"—he said, "No, I know <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> Symes well"—nothing further took place about the order—(<hi rend="italic">Order read:</hi> "2d October, 1862. Mr. Finnis, please receive the lot of wheat, about ten quarters, and land till farther orders. W. Martin, Neckinger-road")—I went to Mr. Martin's immediately, but have not been able to find any such person—I have known the road for years—I never knew any person of the name of Martin in it—there is a receipt given for any property which I may take away when I take a prisoner in custody—I desired the prisoner to write a receipt for the property received from me—I saw him write it—that is the only occasion that I have ever seen him write—I have examined this order, and believed it to be in his handwriting—I form that conclusion from what I saw him write.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames policeman</hi>, 30). On Friday, 3d October between 8 and 9 in the morning, I saw the barge <hi rend="italic">Elm</hi> lying at Finnis wharf—it had the name of Downing on it—there was a quantity of what lying in it, and some three or four sacks filled—Mr. Finnis was on the wharf in the barge—I saw Horn in the barge holding up the sacks, which were being filled by Ings—I saw Leggan standing on the cabin head, bearing the sacks off so that they might come off on to the wharf—Wilson was heaving at the crane—I am not in a position to say what quantity had been landed—I only saw a portion of it on the wharf afterwards—there was about ten quarters and a half altogether, including what I saw on the wharf and in the barge—I told Inspector Clark, and he went on to the wharf about had an hour afterwards—I afterwards saw the order that has been produced—I did not speak to Finnis then—I was not in a galley, but on shore; on the wharf—I did not speak to Finnis before Clark came—I was on the wharf at that time—I did not speak to any of them—I afterwards heard Finnis tell Clark that he received the order from the lad Horn at 7 o'clock that morning, and that he came down on account of that order—he said had dealings with Mr. Martin before; that he had landed some three quarters two weeks ago, and some five or six quarters five weeks ago.</p>

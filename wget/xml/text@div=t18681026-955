                  </hi>. I am a mason, and live at Freemason's Hotel, Ilford—on 24th August, about 8 o'clock in the evening, in Wellington Road, Forest Gate, I saw three men running after two others—one of the men</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186810260105"></xptr>
               <p>said, "We want you, and will have you"—one of the three men made a blow at Hurley, the deceased, with his fist, but missed him—Hurley was one of the two man who were running away—Stobie then went up to Hurley, took him by the shoulders, slew him round with his left hand, and hit him in the face with his right—I have no doubt whatever that the prisoner was the man—the deceased man fell on the ground from the force of the blow, and that cracked his skull—the prisoner struck him while he was on the ground in the face with his fist—I prevented the prisoner from hitting him again—he fell very heavily on the ground—my wife was with me—she prevented the prisoner from striking, and received a blow on her arm—the two men who were with the prisoner attacked the two men as well—the prisoner and his two com<lb></lb>panions went towards the Golden Horse public-house—the prisoner came back about five minutes after to where Hurley was lying in the road—he looked at him, and went away again—he came back the second time, and said, "I have given the b——something"—I said, "Yes, you have cracked his skull, perhaps you will lend me a hand to put him on the path"—he did not assist me—a man named Hall did—I then left, and the prisoner walked with me up the Wellington Road to my own house—he bid me "Good night" and went up the road—he did not speak about this Affair—all he said was, "If I were you I should not have anything to do with it"—and I said, "I sha'n't get into trouble if I do"—I think Hurley had been drinking—he was quite insensible—he never got his senses no more.</p>

Q.</hi> What time was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 8 o'clock—the prisoner had a black coat on—I thought he had light trousers, but I must have been mistaken—I did say he had light trousers, but I think now he had black—I did not see him again till I identified him at Guildford, ten or twelve days after—I was close to the prisoner when he struck the blow—the man fell against my feet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I was with him on 24th August, about 8 o'clock—I saw two men running along the Wellington Road, and two or three after them—the first one struck the deceased, and knocked him down, and when he was down he hit him again in the face—the prisoner is very much like the man, but I can't swear to him—I pre<lb></lb>vented him from striking the deceased again—I was struck myself on the arm—I was looking to the man on the ground, and did not notice the other one—I called the man a coward for hitting him when he was down—he spoke to me—I could not say that he was the man, but I think he was.</p>

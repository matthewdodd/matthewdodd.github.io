            , the officer. On Sunday, the 19th of March, I received of my cousin a three shilling bank token; by his direction, I went to buy some oranges of the prisoner, Cohen, I saw him in Watling-street, Levy was about ten yards off; I told Cohen I wanted two oranges, I gave him a three shilling token to pay for them; he said, he could not give me change; he put my three shilling token into his pocket, and gave me another; I then gave him threepennyworth of halfpence to pay for the two oranges.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the three shilling bank token that you received of the prisoner - A. I kept it in my hand, and gave it to my cousin; he was just by. The three shilling bank token that my cousin gave me, was marked with 3 upon it; the one Cohen gave me for it had no figure of 3 upon that.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MATTHEWS. I am a city constable; the last witness is my cousin, he is about fourteen or fifteen. I was in company with Johnson, on Sunday, the 19th of March, I saw the two prisoners together in Watling-street; in consequence of suspicion, I employed my cousin to buy two oranges of them; I put a notch upon a three shilling bank token, it had No. 3 upon it; I gave it to my cousin, and told him to buy two oranges of the prisoners; I saw the two prisoners together in Watling-street; I and Johnson kept out of their sight. I saw my cousin go towards them; my cousin came back to me, and brought me a three shilling piece, he did not bring back the same I gave to him, it was another, a bad one; I marked that at the bottom with the key of my handcuffs. I told Johnson it was all right, to go and apprehend them; we followed the prisoners into Newgate-street, they went from Watling-street in company together in Newgate-street; I catched hold of Cohen; I said to Johnson, catch the other; Levy threw his basket down, and ran away; I held fast of Cohen until Johnson brought Levy back; we then took them both into a public-house in Distaff-lane; I searched Cohen; I found on him the three shilling token I had given to my cousin in his left hand breeches pocket, and two bad three shilling tokens besides; in his coat pocket I found two bad shillings, and one bad shilling in a pocket at the back of his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two counterfeit tokens, and these three bad shillings, and tell me whether they are the whole that you found upon Cohen - A. These are the tokens, and these are the three shillings; I found one at the back of his breeches, and two in his coat pocket. I saw Johnson take something from Levy's sleeve, I did not see what it was.</p>

            . I am a city constable. I was with Matthews on the 19th of March; I saw the two prisoners together in Watling-street; I pursued Levy into Newgate-street; Matthews got hold of Cohen; Levy observed me, he chucked down his basket of oranges, and ran away; I pursued him, and caught hold of his sleeve; I perceived something in his sleeve; I kept hold of him until I got to the public-house; on searching him, I found one three shilling piece in each of his coat pockets, and one in his sleeve. This is the bad money I found upon him, Matthews delivered to me the bad money that he found upon Cohen; I delivered it all to Mr. Westwood.</p>

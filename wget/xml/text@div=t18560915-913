                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Roberts, and live at No. 31 Henry-street, Woolwich. On Thursday, 4th Sept., about half past 9 o'clock in the evening, I was sitting on the step of my door, with two lads, children of a neighbour, when the prisoner came up, deliberately pulled down his trowsers, and made water right in front of me, exposing himself—one of the lads went and made fun of him, and the prisoner deliberately came across the road, and struck me a violent blow on the side of the head with the thick part of a whip which he had in his hand—he then tore the front of my bonnet completely off my head, and then struck me again—he then turned round to a little boy, and struck him on the nose with the whip—my cries brought my neighbours to my assistance, and he then struck another female—I</p>

I was standing alongside Mrs. Roberts, and saw the prisoner do what she says, in the middle of the road—a little boy laughed at him, and he came over and struck Mrs. Roberts with the butt end of his whip—he struck her once with his fist, and when he left off striking her he camp and struck me across the nose—I had not said anything to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a soldier's wife. On 4th Sept., I was in my shop—I heard Mrs. Roberts scream, and went to my door—I saw the prisoner strike her over the head with the thick end of his whip very hard, and he had torn her bonnet right down over her face—he then came towards me—I went into the shop, and he rushed after me, pulled me out by the front of the frock, and struck me several times across the thigh with the thick end of the whip—I had said nothing to him at all—it seemed to me as if the whip was twisted round his hand—a man who was with him told him not to act the fool, that he would get himself into trouble—his trowsers were completely open—he did not appear to be tipsy—after striking me he went and struck a little boy about seven years of age, and knocked his two front teeth right out with the thick end of his whip—he then ran away up the road—I followed him, and kept close to him—he stopped under a lamppost and buttoned up his trowsers—he then went to go into the King's Arms, bat he could not get in for the crowd, and he went back among them, and struck an elderly man over the head and shoulders—some one went into the guard room of the marine barracks, and told them to send out the guard—he then ran into the barrack room, and was secured—he took the end of the whip in his fingers, and said, "There is not a b—soldier in the garrison that can handle a whip like me."</p>

               <p>SIMON PEARCE. I am in the employ of Charles Hibble and William Green; the prisoner was their carman. On the 22nd of December I was at Hungerford-wharf—the prisoner came there with my employer's van—I delivered to him forty-eight sacks of potatoes—he was to take twenty-four to Mr. Morritt, of Lombard-street, and twenty-four to James-street, Drury-lane-about twelve o'clock the same night I was sent for to his loding,</p>

               <p>in Duke's-court, and there saw my employer and the prisoner, with one sack, and a quantity of potatoes—the prisoner said the potatoes in the sack were given to him the night before by the foreman at the shop, and he took them home in that sack—they were not the same sort as I had delivered to him, they were better, and were worth about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sack—the others would be 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the sack is my master's.</p>

I gave—I paid it because I did not want to keep the van there, being Saturday evening—it was a little after four o'clock—there was no delivery note sent with the potatoes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to the prosecutors, who have a ware-house in Drury-lane. On Saturday, the 22nd of December, about half-past six o'clock, the prisoner brought only twenty-one sacks of potatoes—I counted them—I know this sack to be ours.</p>

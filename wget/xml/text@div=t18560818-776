                  </hi>. I am a monthly nurse. On 18th June I was in attend<lb></lb>ance on Mrs. Marshall, of No. 192, Oxford-street, and packed up some dirty linen in a bundle; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a list of it—there were three babies' frocks, one sheet, two pillow cases, one chemise, two ladies' night gowns, eleven napkins, three baby's gowns, two baby's flannels, one pair of drawers, and one baby's petticoat—these are they (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are Mr. Thomas Marshall's—one frock and one monthly gown are still missing—most of them have the name of Marshall on them now, or "T. M."—some of them have had the marks cut out—I gave them to Buckingham just inside the door, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Hendon, and sometimes drive a cart for my mother, who is a laundress. I called at Mr. Marshall's, in Oxford-street, for some dirty linen—a bundle was given to me by Mrs. M'Laren, and I put it into the cart, and went to Nassau-street, Soho, for some more linen—I went into the house, and when I came out the bundle was gone—there was no other bundle in the cart.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, F</hi> 17). On 24th July I searched the prisoner's house, No. 6, Charles-street, Drury-lane, and found these things in a box in the front bedroom, first floor, which did not appear to be used by lodgers—I pulled them out of the box, put them on the bed, locked the door, and took the prisoner, who was down stairs, to the station—he said, "I can account for the jewellery you have found, but I cannot account for the linen."</p>

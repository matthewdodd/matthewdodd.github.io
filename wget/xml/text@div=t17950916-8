            , the other prisoner, she seemed to want to push by me; I had no idea of what they were about as they were so genteelly well dressed. Presently, after a very genteel dressed man brushed opposite me, he had new boots and leather breeches on, dressed as if he had come off a ride or going out; brushed between me and the prisoner Hannah, and said, ma'am, that is the house that was attacked last night, meaning the crimping house, my servant that was walking behind me said, ma'am, have you lost any thing? I put my hand into my pocket and said, good God, James, I have lost my purse; on which he went after them, and took this woman, Mary, and brought her into Mr. Potter's, the haberdasher's shop, where I stood with her while he went in pursuit of the other woman and took her, and they were both taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a purse was it you missed? - It was one of the patent purses, a striped one, whether it was a silk or a mixture I don't know; I gave four shillings and sixpence for it, but I had had it some time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the purse? - Five guineas, and four sixpences of the new coin, and one shilling at the other end.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The commitment only said four guineas? - It must be a fault then, for I had five.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been walking about London that morning? - No, I had been no further than through the Park. What makes me so particular about the silver that was in my purse, I stopped at Mr. Green's, in Bond street, where I laid out two shillings out of the three that I had. As near as I can tell, then, it must be from twelve to one.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160029"></xptr>Q. When the street becomes a good deal crowded; so from Mrs. Green's till you had some conversation with your servant, you had no conversation to consult your purse? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to Charing Cross, I believe there was a great crowd there? - No, there were not, not above five or six people.</p>
               <p>Q. The house had been gutted, had it not? - I don't know any thing about it, but the man that passed said, Ma'am, that is the house that was attacked last night.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that one of the prisoners pushed against you, as if she wanted to pass you, as you wanted to pass her? - I was between these two women, the further woman interrupted my passing on, and the other seemed to want to pass me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a person came up to you in a blue coat, and caught your attention? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That happened before any charge was made against these two women? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the woman went readily with you, and desired to be searched? -She said we were welcome to search her, and she turned every thing out of her pockets, and she asked, ma'am, did you find my hand in your pocket? no, I said if I had, you should not have got it out so easily.</p>
               <p>Jury. Pray what time was it you were at Charing Cross? - Between three and and four; I believe it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor, belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Billow Queen</hi>, bound for Genoa. Last Thursday I was going along Whitechapel, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the day—Pedderson came up to me and asked me what ship J belonged to—I said I belonged to none—I had come home a fortnight ago from the Black Sea and was then going to see my steward—he said he was going as steward of a ship bound for Australia, which was shipping her hands, and if I went with him he would go on board and have a glass of ale with me—I said I would, and we went to a public house in Black Lion-yard, White-chapel-road, and sat down in the parlour—he called for two glasses of ale, and while we were drinking it, two men came in dressed as hawkers, in velvet coats, plaid shawls over their breasts, and oil-skin leggings—they said they belonged to Sheffield—the prisoner Jones then came in, and presented a memorandum-book for sale for me to Pedderson, who said it was not worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he would not give it to him—Jones then offered me a black leather purse for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not buy it, I said I was not in want of it—Jones had not hawker's box, he produced the things from his pocket; he took three cards from his pocket, and said if we had no objection to playing he would have a game with us for two sovereigns or three sovereigns, as we liked—the game, was, to put the money on the cards, and if you said "black," and it was on a black card, you got the money—Pedderson put some money on, and I put 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other men put 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put my finger <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the card so as they should not move it from me—there were several games, and I lost 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240009"></xptr>
               <p>I did not win any of the games—Pedderson saw me take half a crown from my pocket-book, and he put his hand in my pocket and took my pocket-book—I took him by the collar; he tripped my heels, flung me on my back, and made his escape—the other persons heard me say what I had lost; they were very sorry for it, and offered to go in search of him with me—they pretended to go to look for him, but when they got to the door one went in one direction tad one in another, and I never saw any more of him—when Jones got to the door, he said he would go up this street, as he was better acquainted with London than I was—I do not know what street that was—Jones was standing at the table with the cards when Pedderson took the pocket-book—Jones could see my book taken—he made no attempt to stop Pedderson when he went out with my pocket-book—next day, Friday, I saw all four of the men in White-chapel-road, standing talking together at the public house—I was going towards them—Pedderson cast his eyes on me, and ran away—I went for the police, and Jones walked down Cannon-street-road—I did not see them again that day, but on Saturday afternoon, at 8 o'clock, I was in Ratcliff-highway, and saw Pedderson standing at the Old Rose; 1 had Robert Williams, a ship mate, with me, and sent him for a constable—I went up to Pedderson, shook hands with him, and asked him if he knew me; he said, "Yes, I have seenyoubefore"—the police then came, and I gave him in charge, and said in hit presence that it was for stealing four sovereigns, a half sovereign, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, a written character which I had from my last ship, and a pocket-book—he said nothing—I have never seen the pocket-book, the money, or the character paper since;—when we were at the public house, Pedderson staked a sovereign on the cards—he won eight times, I believe—I saw him paid—Jones paid him—there was one sovereign left on the table; I looked at it, and saw that it was a medal and not a sovereign—that was when I got up from the floor, after Pedderson had taken my pocket-book—I saw the money lying on the card, it was yellow money—I did not take it in my hand—it had Britannia on it—I only saw one side—I have seen a medal produced by the constable, it was not a sovereign—I paid the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which I lost—Robert Williams is not here, he has sailed in the ship—Jones is in a different dress now, but Pedderson has the same clothes on.</p>

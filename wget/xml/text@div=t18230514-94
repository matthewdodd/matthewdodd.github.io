            . I missed a plane on the 14th of April. I had been at the building, where I saw it on the 12th. I put it into the prisoner's basket. Deason's tools were put into the same basket, and was put under the floor in the evening. They were found in the prisoner's basket on the 28th. I never gave him leave to take my plane. I have often offered to lend him tools. It is common to lend each other tools.</p>

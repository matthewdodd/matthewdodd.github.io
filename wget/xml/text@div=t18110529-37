               <p>Q. What day was the 17th of May, - A. A Friday, I had occasion to go out that evening about half past eight my husband went with me, I left the prisoner in the house and five young women some of them are my apprentices, before I went out I went down stairs and gave her directions. The things that I missed were up stairs all but the tea spoons those were below.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the silver tea spoons down below. - A. I had not seen them after tea time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return that evening. - A. About a quarter before eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you supped. - A. No, I rang the bell for the prisoner to bring the supper up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner before you went out. - A. Yes, I spoke to her the last thing. There is a second door that opens to the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. There is first an outer door than there is an inner door that leads into the passage. - A. Yes, I went in at the outer door to the inner door, I am not quite certain whether the outer door was shut or not, the inner door leads to the kitchen stairs and to the other stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. The inner door to the passage is parallel to the street door. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say you think one or the other of these doors were shut. - A. Yes, I believe it was the outer door, and the inner door shuts with a latch.</p>
               <p>Q. The outer door I suppose has a spring lock, - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you rung your bell for the prisoner to bring the supper. - A. Yes, she did not come, I then went and called her, she did not answer, I then asked the young people in the work room if they knew where she was, they told me they knew nothing of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the work room up stairs. - A. No, on the ground floor within the second door, I sent one of my young people to see if she was up stairs, I found she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your suspicion was raised and you looked about to see what you had lost, what did you lose. - A. I went into the kitchen first, I lost five silver tea spoons, her own clothes were taken out of the box and the box left, I then went up stairs into my own bed room, I missed two clothes bags full of dirty linnen, the bags contained shirts, gowns, petticoats, shifts, stockings, neck and pocket handkerchiefs and night caps, and various other things, the bags were gone as well as the articles, I missed several necklaces, ear rings and finger rings, beads and bracelets and a variety of little articles; these were in a little drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose generally during the hours of the day you keep the outer door open so as to admit your customers, you only keep the inner door shut. - A. Yes, we generally keep the outer door open untill the close of the day and then shut it.</p>
               <p>Q. At half past eight when you went out was it dark. - A. It was scarcely dark but very near.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoken to a great number of articles do you think a young woman like her is able to carry off that quantity. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner had any person to follow her. - A. She had not while with me, she had been only four days in the house. I had a very good character with her.</p>
               <p>Q. After discovering this loss when did you first hear of these things again. - A. On the following morning about eleven o'clock an officer from Bow-street came to me, his name is Salmon, he asked me if I had lost a servant and any property, I told him I had, he told me that he had her and the property in custody. An officer afterwards came from Marlborough-street and said she was taken there. I went to Marlborough-street and saw the prisoner and saw the articles and swore to them. I saw all that I lost as far as I know, they were in a bag, except the trinkets which were tied up in an apron or a handkerchief.</p>

            , I keep a lodging house at St. Giles's, near Great Russell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. I never saw her before that night, the prisoner now at the bar is the person, when she first came to my house I was two doors off, she had not been in my house above two or three minutes when the maid came to me and asked me if I would take a pair of stockings in for a bed for the prisoner, in consequence of that I went home and saw the prisoner there sitting down just inside of the door, she had three bundles with her, I asked her where she came from, she said she came from Hertfordshire, she had travelled up that day from Uxbridge and that she was very tired, I asked her if she had any friends in London, she said, no. I asked her what brought her to London, she said to look for a service; then my servant said to the prisoner I think I know you young woman, she said no; yes my servant replied about twelve or fourteen months ago you took a pair of stockings away from my master, Mr. Dillon, that I had to pay for, the prisoner denied it, then I said if you have been a thief I must see what you have got in these bundles. I then opened this bundle, she said they were her own. I turned out of a dark cotton clothes bag the contents, a great many dresses, shifts, shirts, and handkerchiefs, a great deal of dirty linen, and some clean white stockings and a little work bag besides; she said that her mother was dead, that they were left her and they were her own, I opened an apron where there were a great many rings and little boxes with trinkets, then I told her she was some servant, and that she had robbed the lady's dressing room. I went out for a watch-man and he took her St. Giles's watch-house, and I went to the watch-house with her. The watchman took the things with him his name is Timothy Lane.</p>

I am constable and watch-house keeper of St. Giles's, I attended at the examination at Marlborough-street, this bundle that I have in my hand was sealed up by the magistrate, I was present when the prisoner was brought into the watch-house, an inventory was made out and the things were delivered to Mrs. Cummings, these things have been in my custody ever since the second examination, Mrs. Cummings had them on the Saturday, there was a seal put on every individual thing; and they are so now. Mrs. Cummings insisted upon me having them and I did not want any dispute about them, on the second examination Mr. Reily insisted upon me having them and then these three bundles so sealed were put into a great bundle, and that was sealed. This is the bundle of trinkets.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix.

This is one of Mr. Reily's shirts, there were four missed they are worth 12 s. I know the bag is mine I sewed it myself, these five tea spoons are worth 10 s. the tablecloth is mine it is marked M. B. the initials of my name before I was married. These handkerchiefs are mine, they are worth two shillings.</p>

            . On Wednesday night, the 19th of April, about six o'clock, Mr. Green gave my master and mistress each a ticket to go to the play. Through persuasion my mistress went, but my master did not. My mistress sent me to a neighbour, to let his maid come to rock the child while they drank tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your master?</p>

I took a phial of stuff of the boy, and delivered it to Mr. Green; he took and looked at it, and said, I hope this will do my cold good. There was a woman in the house saw me give it him: as soon as he had it, he put it down and went out; then I said I would take the bottle up, and put it on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner live?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. He lodged at our house during the time the other clergyman was gone to Oxford. My master came home about a quarter before eight, and being very cross with me for keeping the young woman to rock the cradle, he sent her home. Mr. Green knocked at the door at a quarter past nine. I took the child up from the cradle, she being just awake, and I went and opened the door. Mr. Green came in, and said, Will you light me a candle? I did. He said, Was I alone? I said, Yes. Said he, Have you not a sweetheart with you? No, said I, I don't want one; then he put his arm round my neck and kissed me, and at the bottom of the stairs he put his candle down, and followed me into the parlour. He said, Will you lose your ma idenhead? No, said I. He then took my candle out of my hand, and said, I want to look at this room; and put his hand about my waist, took me to the room door, and flung the door open. I got from him. He came and fetched me and flung the door open again, and took and carried and flung me on the bed with the child in my arms. This was a back room upon a ground floor. As I fell, the child lay on my arm all the time. He pulled up my petticoats, with the other arm cross my breast, the child scrambling, and that and I kept making a noise. He bid me hold my noise, and he would give me a guinea. I said, No, Sir. He said, By G - d you shall. And he ravished me without my will or consent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any resistance?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. I did resist as well as I could, and called out as loud as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You must tell what he did to you.</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. He ravished me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100014"></xptr>Q. In what manner.</p>
               <p>No Answer.</p>
               <p>Q. You must tell in what manner he did it.</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. He lay with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to you?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. With his tool he did it.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by that?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. If you will tell me what to say in a proper manner, I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it something belonging to him?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. Yes. He pulled my petticoats up, and lay with me. There came wet from him, and blood from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell this story to the Justice?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in the house besides you and he?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. No, there was not. My master was gone to fetch my mistress from the play.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you together?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. He lay with me some time. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ravish you more than once?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After that was over, what did he do?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. I went out of the room immediately, and he followed me into the fore parlour; but whether he went up into the study or not, I cannot tell: he put the candle out at the bottom of the stairs, and went out I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Which came home first, your master or mistress?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. Master came home first. Mistress came through the tavern to order a pint of beer. I was crying when he came home, which was about a quarter before eleven, or a quarter past. Master lives near the Three Tuns tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner come home?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. He came home again between one and two.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you mention this to first?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. I first spoke of this to my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any body lives in the houses joining your's?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. The house that joins our house on one side was empty, the house on the other side was not, but they went round to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with your master?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. I have lived there about two months. The prisoner did not lodge there when I went first.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lodged there?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. I cannot tell whether he had been there a fortnight, or three weeks. When mistress came home, which was not a quarter of an hour after my master, she said, My dear, the child looks very poorly; has the child cried? I said, Yes. Said she, I hope you have not hurt her? I said, I cannot tell whether I have or not. Master said she had been kept up past her hour. What is the matter? said, she; are you afraid of staying alone? I said, The good parson has been here, and has been as rude as the devil. Mistress sent me down for the supper. I staying some time, mistress came down after me, and asked me, what I was crying for. (I was crying.) I told her the parson had used me very ill. Master called for the supper to be brought up, then no more was said, till I was warming the bed for my mistress; when she said, Has Mr. Green been in the parlour? I said, Yes, madam, and in this room too. Master came into the room, and there was no more said that night.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the reason you did not tell your master and mistress both?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. I did not want to tell my master, but I told my mistress all the next day. When the prisoner went out, I went to the door, and asked him what he thought of a lawyer's letter? He said, For what? I said, You know for what, and you shall be sure of it. He went out, and said no more.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you first see your mistress in the morning?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. It might be about half an hour before breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell her of it then?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. My master came by then breakfast was ready.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you introduce it after breakfast?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. Mistress hearing me tell him of the lawyer's letter, asked me what I would send him a lawyer's letter for. Then I told her all.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Jervis. On the Friday. It was before Sir

               <p>Jervis. Because we had company. I related the same before the Justice as here, but not quite so much: I did tell all the worst of it. The prisoner was asked what he had to say for himself, and he said he never was there. He said he was at the Three Tuns tavern, and seeing the apothecary's boy, he met him at the tavern<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100015"></xptr> door, but he was in the study at the time the boy came to our door.

            . I am the mistress to the girl. Mr. Green gave me a ticket to go to the play of The Fair Penitent, the 19th of April. My husband saw me there, and then returned, and came again to fetch me home. I stayed till the play was over. When we got home, it was about a quarter of an hour after eleven o'clock. I went through the tavern to order a pint of beer, so my husband was at home first. The first thing he said to me was, My dear, the child looks very pale. I said, It is for want of sleep, being kept up past her hour. The girl was walking about. I asked her, whether the child had been cross; she said it had cried for a quarter of an hour, and she wished the girl had stayed that I sent for. Her master said, Was you afraid to stay alone? the maid said, No. Said I, What has been the matter? she said, The good parson has been at home, and he has been as rude as the d - l. Said I, Have you hurt the child? she said she could not tell. Her master said, Has he been at home and been rude? has he hurt the child? I shall send him a lawyer's letter to make him ashamed of himself. The girl was sent down to get the supper ready. She staying some time, my husband took the child, and I went down after her. I found her crying, but had no suspicion of such a thing then. I was asking her something, and her master having occasion to get up early in the morning, he called; so nothing farther passed. When the girl was warming the bed, I said, Has the parson been in the parlour? she said, Yes, and in this room too. Her master coming in, I think she said no more that night. The next morning I got up between seven and eight o'clock, when the prisoner was going out, but the girl stepped after him (this was something before eight ) and asked her what he should think of a lawyer's letter; he said, For what? She said, You know for what, and you shall be sure to have one. He opened the door, and went away, and slapped the door too very hard. That is all I saw or heard between he and she. Soon after she went to fetch the child. Then my husband came home to breakfast, when she being sent down for something out of the kitchen, she stayed a great while. I said to my husband, I do not know what the parson has done to the girl, she does nothing but crawl about. I followed her down, and found her crying, and she cried best part of that day. After breakfast, she was in the kitchen, I think, washing some things; when I began asking her, thinking to have the whole affair out, what she seemed so uneasy about. I asked what Mr. Green had done to her, and what she meant by a lawyer's letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she hear your husband say he would send him a lawyer's letter, and make him ashamed of himself?</p>
               <p>M. Rodenburst. She did. I thought it might be only pulling and hawling her about, as young persons do. She told me he had flung her upon the bed. I said, I hope he has not laid with you! she said, Yes, but he has, and cried. I said, Sure he has not ! she said, Yes, but indeed he has, and she would have justice done her, if it cost her her life. I was so much shocked, I did not say much then. She then told me the manner how it was done. She told me, that about a quarter after nine that evening she had taken the child out of the cradle, at which time Mr. Green knocked at the door, and letting him in, she went to the bottom of the stairs and lighted his candle, which generally stands there for him: he followed her into the parlour, gave her a tap at the bottom of her stays, took the candle out of her hand, and said, Let's see this room. Then he went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100016"></xptr> my room, put the candle out, and took and dragged her into the room. She got out again, but he again took her up, with the child in her arms, carried her in, and threw her upon the bed. I asked her if she made any noise; she said she did, as much as she could, and the child cried and screamed prodigiously all the while, but he had his arm somewhere upon her breast.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a married woman, did she describe the manner of his laying with her?</p>
               <p>M. Rodenburst. She did, and in the same manner as she has now; as men have conversation with women, and said it was against her consent.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the next house to you?</p>
               <p>M. Rodenburst. The next on one side is empty, that on the other side is a china shop, you must go round to the door. There is a high brick wall between, higher than I can reach a great deal. That house and ours are both double brick houses; and ours is lined with wainscot. I was never in the other house. The girl told me the apothecary's boy gave her a phial for Mr. Green, and that there was another girl in the house at the same time, whom I sent for to rock the cradle.</p>
               <p>Q. What excuse did Mr. Green make for himself?</p>
               <p>Mr. Rodenburst. He said he knew nothing of it; he was never in the house from about eight till half an hour after one in the night. This he said on the Monday before Sir

               <p>On her cross examination she said, according to her judgment she believed Mr. Green did lie with the girl, and against the girl's will; that although there are children in the next house, she never hears any noise there from that parlour; that the mother, of the prisoner first applied to her to know the girl's character; that the mother was in a violent passion, and began to quarrel with her, and that she told her if she had sent in a peaceable manner, she would have directed her to her own father and mother, with whom the girl had lived eight or nine years; and that there was an officer that came with the mother, who dragged her about and used her very ill. Being asked what was the girl's character, she said, she had known her about fourteen years, and never knew any harm of her nor the girl's friends, and that she was a sober, honest, modest girl.</p>

            . Yes. The first time was on a Friday in the afternoon, about five o'clock, the next on the Friday evening, when Mr. Green was brought there; and on the Monday when she was bound over to prosecute. She never varied in any circumstance. Sir John particularly requested her to be cautious what she said, and told her what would be the consequence here and hereafter, if she should charge him wrongfully. On the first examination, Sir John did not inquire so particularly into it, but granted a warrant on suspicion, not knowing then how it would turn out, and so give Mr. Green an opportunity to defend himself. He committed him on suspicion; had he committed him absolutely for the fact, he then would have bound the prosecutrix over to prosecute. On the Monday, when Mr. Green was examined again, then the detainer was sent against him for the fact, and she was bound over. There were no material difference all the three times, the circumstances were the same she has said now.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>Lee. On the Friday night two persons came with him; they said they were ready to swear that he was not out of their company some hours that night, but afterwards they would not swear, for that they said he was some little time missing. The prisoner said he was never in the girl's master's house from eight o'clock; but on the Monday he said he had been in a mistake, for he received a bottle at the tavern door of an apothecary's boy and carried it home, and went back immediately.</p>

I then could not remember he quitted it a moment; but the day after I did remember that he was out about two minutes, which was between nine and ten o'clock, I suppose, (when he came in again, we were merry as usual.) I never stirred out of the room. He did not seem florried at all, but sat down and eat bread and cheese and raddishes with me. He could have been gone but a very few minutes.

            . I was in company with Mr. Green on the nineteenth of April, at the three Tun tavern. I went out at my own door, about two or three minutes after the clock struck eight, (I live in the same street ) and there I saw Mr. Green reading the paper in the coffee-room. He asked me how I did, and if I would drink a glass of wine. I said I was going to buy a lobster; he said he would go with me. We bought a lobster, and some salmon, and supped there together; just as we had done, and the things going to be taken away, Mr. Freemont came in; we had never parted company till he came in; then we had some new cheese and raddishes: after that we had a bottle of wine between us. When I was first called upon before the Justice, I could not recollect that Mr. Green had been out, but I since recollect he was out, though the time he was out was no more than while we drank one glass of wine each. I don't think he was out five minutes.</p>

               <p>Dr. Bromfeild. On a person of her age it is very difficult to say. I asked her how long the gentleman was with her; she said a quarter of an hour. She having spoke of a child being in her arms, said I, You laid the child down, I suppose. No, said she, the child was upon the bed, and I kept it on my arm. I said that is very extraordinary, for you might have laid the child down, and with that hand and the other you might have resisted the force offered you. I also said to her, How came you to keep it on your arm at such a time, and under such circumstances, without laying it on the bed? she said she must take care of the child, or to that effect.</p>

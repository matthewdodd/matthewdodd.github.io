If you please to hear me, Mrs. Fisher sent for me to speak to me, and I have got a complaint in my head that I cannot bear any liquors, and as soon as I went into her place she asked me to drink gin, and my head is not fit to contain any spirits, and my poor senses being gone, I unfortunately took the gown, and am very sorry for it; and more than that we had part of a pot of beer together.</p>
               <p>Fisher. We did not drink a drop together, we have five small children, and I cannot afford to spend my money in gin.</p>

               <p>What number of casks had you in the cart that morning? - Twenty-eight.</p>
               <p>When had you seen this cask? - I cannot say; the casks all answered my bills; I saw it two hours afterwards; all our two gallon casks are alike; they are all marked in the same manner; I had no other that was marked shrub but that; I took the cask under one arm and the prisoner under the other to Justice Wilmott's office, and left them there, and wrote my name upon the cask, and there is the mark of an E.</p>

               <p>I am a coach-maker; I saw this cart opposite my house on Tuesday; it stood against the shop, as it has done a good many years; I saw the prisoner in the shop where I work, he was talking about bringing some little wheels, I bargained with him for the wheels; I went out to see what was the matter, and I saw the prisoner walk with it under his arm; I did not see him take any thing out of the cart, I called halloo, and he began to run, and then I called stop thief, he ran down to the bottom of the street with the cag under his arm; it was thrown down; I did not see him throw it down.</p>
               <p>Was he out of your sight? - Never, from one end of the street to the other till it was thrown down, then he turned the corner, and was out of my sight for a few<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190106"></xptr> minutes; I went to the bottom of the street as quick as I could; I saw the prisoner coming along in custody to our shop.</p>
               <p>In whose hands did you see the cask? - It was an entire stranger to me that had it, and they gave it to me directly.</p>
               <p>Should you know the person again if you was to see him? - Yes, the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Do you believe the cask that is now produced in Court, was the cask that was under the prisoner's arm? - It was the same size; I believe it was the same; I gave the cask to Cheese the distillers man directly; Cheese marked it at the Justice's, and made a long stroke and a little one; here is the mark.</p>

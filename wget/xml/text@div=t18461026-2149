                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and have a manufactory in the Wool<lb></lb>wich road; the prisoner had been in my employ nearly three years, down to Saturday night, the 3rd of Oct. On the Tuesday following I went to his house with a policeman—I partially searched—I found an old pair of scisson, two boxes, and one or two trinkets—the scissors were mine—I went next day, and found a rocket-spindle and a chisel, which were decidedly mine—tbe prisoner had no business with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 11, Bartlett's-buildings, Holborn, as an importer and manufacturer of Bohemian glass. About 19th last July, a person named Samuel Turner called on me, and looked out goods to the amount of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., consisting of miscellaneous glass and fancy goods—he gave me references to Mr. John Stanley, of 37, Southwark-bridge-road, and Mr. John Barker, builder, of 1, William-street, Newington causeway—I went several times to 1, William-street, but not seeing Barker, he came to my house with Turner, between 19th and 25th July—Barker is the defendant, Murphy—Turner said, "This is Mr. Barker" (<hi rend="italic">pointing to him</hi>)—I have since seen him at 1, William-street, and have ascertained he lived there—he said that Turner was a highly respectable man, and he had known him for the last ten years; that he kept a horse and <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>, a one horse chaise, and that he supplied country shopkeepers with this sort of goods, meaning the glass and fancy ware; and that he would be answerable to the amount of 2502. for Turner—Turner had said that Barker was a builder, and Barker said he was building twelve or fourteen houses at Notting-hill, and some at Poplar and Deptford—after that I agreed to let Turner have the goods—that was the second order—Mr. John Stanley was the referee for the first order, which amounted to forty odd pounds—before I executed the first order I went to 37, Southward bridge road, which was the address Turner had given me, and there saw the prisoner Martin—there was no name on the door, but "House and Estate Agent" on a wire blind—I knocked at the door, it was opened by a woman, and I inquired for Mr. John Stanley—I was introduced into the parlour, and stayed there about a quarter of an hour, when the prisoner Martin came in—I said, "Good morning," and he said good morning—I told him I had come to inquire about Mr. Samuel Turner, and asked if he knew him—he said he had known him for the last ten years; he was a highly respectable man, and travelled town and country with miscellaneous goods, and kept a horse and <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>; that his wife had leasehold property, and that he (Martin) collected the rents for her; that he did not mind being answerable to the amount of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—nothing had been said about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before—after that the second order came, which amounted to 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I went to Barker's, and he said he would be answerable for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I began to execute the second order on 25th July—I think I sent 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.'s worth—there was a third order in Aug. of about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when Barker came to me, between 19th and 25th, he said I was to</p>

I prepared the brief for Honey man—the first time I heard of, or saw him, was 10th Dec, 1851—I did not take any Bohemian glass of him; some was sent to my place in my absence—I cannot say that it came from Honeyman, except that he called on me about the matter—I took it to deliver it up to the prosecutor; it was left at my house on 5th or 6th June, in two small hampers; and I went immediately to Mr. Brock, and told him it was at his service, and he refused to take it—it was glass of this description, perhaps twenty-five articles in the two hampers—there were no vases like these; there were two Bohemian soda<lb></lb>water glasses—I know Honeyman by his coming to me in company with a client of mine, Alexander Bell, with reference to an assignment of ground, of which Honeyman was the lessee; he had been once or twice with Mr. Bell; and he came on 5th June, and said he had seen by the papers that some glass which was in his possession had been taken before a Magistrate, and he felt very uncomfortable, and asked me what I thought he had better do—he told me a man named Turner was a tenant of his, for part of the ground on which I was concerned in drawing the deeds; and that Tamer was considerably in his debt for moneys advanced; and he produced his book with the entries of when he made those advances—he asked me what be should do—I told him to go to Mr. Brock, who lived close by my chambers, and give up the things to him—he said Mr. Turner had left the goods with his wife, for moneys he had advanced him in the building—Honeyman is a builder, to a large extent, at New-cross—I do not know whether he has any property at Notting-hill—he left my chambers for the purpose of going round to Mr. Brock's—the property, is now in my cellar, 12, Gray's-inn-square—Mr. Brock has been to see it, and he says I had better let it remain till the trial is over, it was safe enough there; and Mr. Lewis, the attorney, likewise told me to keep it—I was not retained to defend Honeyman till last Saturday night.</p>

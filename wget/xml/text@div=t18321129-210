            . On the 26th of November I left my barrow safe on the area-railing, in front of my door, about six o'clock in the evening - I went out; I returned at ten o'clock, and it was gone; I saw it about half-past ten o'clock that night at Mr. Brightman's, China-street, St. Pancras, and was quite positive of it.</p>

            . I keep a coffee-shop in China-street, St. Pancras. About a quarter-past eight o'clock the prisoner came to my shop - I knew him by sight before - he pleaded distress, saying he had come from Highgate with a barrow, and had brought a man with him to wheel it for him, with a box, and he asked me to lend him a few shillings - I said I could not afford it, but he pleaded distress, and a man was with him, who he said he had got to wheel it, as he was a cripple, and he wanted to pay him; I at last lent him 2s. on the barrow, and he promised to pay me next day at twelve o'clock - I saw Mr. Burton about ten, and he claimed it.</p>

            . I do porter's work. I was in the prosecutor's house - the prisoner came there about half-half-past six o'clock in the evening - the house was in Little Drummond-street, Somers'-town; he asked the price of 1 cwt. of potatoes - he came in and said he could get them in Chapel-street for 3s. 6d; the prosecutrix said her husband was out, and he had better come in the morning - he said, "Will you come and have a glass of gin?" but I refused, and about ten minutes after he was gone the barrow was missing; I afterwards saw it at the office, and knew it.</p>

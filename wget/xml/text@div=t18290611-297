            . I am a labourer - I live in Meard'scourt; the prosecutor lives at No. 1 Kemp's-court. On Monday the 25th of May, I saw two young men with this cart, in Berwick-street - I cannot say whether the prisoner was one - I went to Kemp's-court, saw Mrs. Smith standing at the door, and she asked me if I thought David had lent his chaise to any body - I went into the brewhouse, and saw the prosecutor's brother, John, who told me it was not lent; and I then went in pursuit of it - I did not come up with it till I got to Panton-street, Haymarket, Where I saw the prisoner drawing it; two other persons were behind him - I asked what he was going to do with it; he said he was a spring-maker, and he was going to repair one of the springs - I saw it had no springs - I told him if he came by it honestly, he would have no objection to go to the person it belonged to - he turned, and drew it as far as Rupert-street; the other two walked behind; one of them called out,"Bob, what a fool you are to draw it;" he made no answer, but walked on till he got to the corner of Archer-street. when he dropped the handle and ran off - I cried, Stop thief! a person got in the middle of the road, he turned back towards me, and I collared him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Look at me, and say whether I was one of the persons you first saw with it? A. I did not take notice - you did not ask a young man if he did not give it you - there were three of you; one had an iron footman in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a person you had a communication with yesterday, and you said you were very sorry you had any thing to do with this business? A. I said it was a great deal of trouble - I was very sorry, as I was very near losing my situation - I suspect it was a person who had followed the cart - I do not think I told him to cut his stick, and say he was one of them.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GOOK. I am a constable. I came up about seven o'clock, and James had hold of the chaise in one hand, and the prisoner in the other; I took the prisoner.</p>

            . I live in the parlour of the same house as the prosecutor - I saw the cart in the kitchen on Sunday, about eight o'clock; on the Monday, about seven o'clock, I saw two men taking it through the passage and out at the street-door - I looked out and saw James coming up the court - I told him to ask Mr. Field if he had lent the chaise; I did not notice the persons - I saw it again about eleven o'clock before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was turning Coventry-street, and saw two young men drawing the cart - I knew one of them, and told them where I had been; we walked down the Haymarket, and one of them who had a white handkerchief and a snuff-coloured coat, asked me to take hold of the cart, while he gave his parcels to the other men- I had not had it two minutes when Mr. James came up - I turned back, and asked the young man whether he did not give it me - I might have run away; but knowing I received it innocently, I scorned to run till I saw the other two running, and then I did run a little way.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

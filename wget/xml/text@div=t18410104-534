On the 11th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner (to the best of my belief he is the man,) came to my shop—I have a very powerful gas-light in my shop—he asked to look at a gold brigade chain, which I showed him, and he purchased it—I then showed him a pin—he said he would take that also, and tendered this note—I asked his name—he said, "Smith, Greenwich"—I said, "What street?"—he said he did not know the street, it ran up by the Hospital—I said, "It is College-street"—he said, "Yes, I believe it is"—I asked the number—he said he did not know the number—I sent my servant next door for the change—she brought it back, and I gave it to him—he was in the shop about a quarter of an hour—this is the note—I have written "Mr. Smith, College-street, Greenwich," on it.</p>

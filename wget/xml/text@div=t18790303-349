I am a warehouseman at Mr. Wilson's, Wood Street—the two prisoners were employed there to drive travellers' traps—in consequence of instructions, I was secreted in the first-floor warehouse on the evening of 21st February—neither of the two prisoners had any business on that part of the floor—I saw them there together on that evening at about 7.20 or 7.30—they came towards a box about four or five feet from where I was hiding—Attfield opened the box and took out five or six feathers—while doing so a young lady came downstairs—Eykelosch gave some words of alarm like "Stand by!"—Attfield then dropped the feathers on the counter, and they stood still till she had gone downstairs—Attfield took up the feathers again and went to the other end of the warehouse, placed them between two boxes, and went downstairs, and Eykelosch went upstairs—I then came out from my hiding-place—I was present afterwards when the prisoners were charged—I went back to the first floor with Attfield, and took him to the box from which he had taken the feathers, and showed him what I</p>

I said to my mate, 'I should like a feather,' and Attfield said, 'I'll get you one'"—on the way to the Justices' room next day he said, "We wanted a feather each, we were going to give one to the girl."</p>

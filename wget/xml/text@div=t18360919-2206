                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and live in Stockwell-street, Greenwich. On the 31st of August the prisoner came to my shop, between five and six o'clock—she was shown into the parlour by my servant, and sat down to be measured for a pair of boots—while she was sitting down I observed her lay hold of her shawl on one side, and hold it very tight, and from that circumstance I suspected she had some<lb></lb>thing belonging to me—I said to her, immediately after measuring her, "Have you not a bad arm?" thinking that might be the case—she said, "No"—I opened her shawl and saw the shoes under her arm—I took them from her, and said, "These are my shoes"—she at first said they were not—I said, "I know they are, and shall give you into custody"—I sent the boy for a policeman, and she was going to fall on her knees to beg pardon, and said she would pay for them, but, being frequently robbed, I gave her into custody.</p>

               <p>think she had moved from her position—she was about five minutes in the shop—she tried several pairs of shoes on, and objected to them—I was frequently backwards and forwards in the shop, getting others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer; the prisoner was my errand-boy; he used to come at seven o'clock in the morning. On Saturday morning, 15th June, I went out to market at a quarter-past four—I locked the parlour-door, and put the key under the mat at the foot of the stairs for the purpose of my daughter getting it—it was the prisoner's business when he came to receive the key of the shop from my daughter, and open it—the key was locked up in the parlour—a passage divides the parlour from the shop—I came back from market about half-past eleven—I received informa<lb></lb>tion, and examined a drawer in the parlour in which I had left 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences—I missed 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the drawer appeared to have been forced open with a chisel—when I came home, I found the prisoner asleep in the shop, and I told him I should discharge him for that—he was out when I missed the money—when he came back, I said, "You are a very bad boy, give me the money, and go about your business"—he denied it, but on the road to the station, he said, "If you will forgive me, I will work it out."</p>

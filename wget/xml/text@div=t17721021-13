The prisoner said, sir, I beg your pardon, you have overlooked a queen Ann's guinea at the bottom of your cash in your hand; I looked it over again, and suffered the prisoner to put his hand among my cash; he took out five guineas, looked over the rest, and found never a queen Ann's guinea among them; then he said he begged pardon for giving me so much trouble, and dropt a guinea into my hand again, in such a way as if he meant to conceal part of the money, by the found it appeared as if he dropt only a guinea; I saw more money in his hand, which he removed into his other hand, in which was a handkerchief; then upon my seizing him, he pushed the money into his waistcoat pocket; I got over the counter; the prisoner ran away; I pursued him, and called, stop thief! when he had run about fifteen yards, I stopt him, and I took four guineas out of his waistcoat pocket, and when I examined my cash account, I missed just four guineas.</p>
               <p>- Shagg. I live at Mr. Nicoll's, in St. Paul's Church Yard; I heard the cry of, stop thief! I went out and saw Mr. Watson stop the prisoner; we took him back to the shop; Watson said this is the pocket he put the money in, and immediately took four guineas out of his waistcoat pocket; the prisoner said he did not know how they came into his pocket, and if they were the prosecutor's, he was welcome to them.</p>

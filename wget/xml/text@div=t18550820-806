                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Mendicity Society. On the morning of 30th June, I took the prisoner, in consequence of information, at Emily-place, Maryland-point, Stratford—I told him he was charged with collecting money of Mr. Burton, No. 39, Oxford-street, under false pretences, in the name of the Sailors' Mission, there being no such society—he said that there was a London Sailors' Society—I said that I was aware of that,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200102"></xptr>
               <p>but that I had received information from Mr. Rayner, who was the treasurer, that it had ceased to exist for two or three years—I know of no such society as the London Sailors' Mission—I have made inquiry about the whole of the Regent's-park—on the way to the station he said that if I would make the matter right for him he would give me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had seen, "Regent's-dock, Limehouse," on one of the receipts, and at Marlborough-street, I asked the Magistrate to ask him where the counting house of the society was; he said that the word "Park" was a false print, and he had erased it, and put in "Dock"—Mr. Hardwicke asked him where it was; and he said that it was held at Sharpe and Rickett's coal wharf, Regent's-dock.</p>

                  </hi>. I was secretary to the London Sailors' Society. I believe it is in existence under the name of Mission—it has a vice-president and a committee—it goes now by the name of the London Sailors' Mission—the vice-president is W. G. Habershon, Esq., the architect—I wrote a letter to him, and received an answer; after which I went, in company with another gentleman, to speak to him—I asked him whether the letter was written by him, or his instructions—he said that it was written by his instructions, and said, "I am the vice-president of the London Sailors' Mission"—his office is No. 38, Bloomsbury-square—I do not know his residence—he stated in his letter, and likewise in my presence, and that of the gentleman who accompanied me, that Mr. Buckingham was authorized missionary and collecting agent for the London Sailors' Mission—I was before the Magistrate with this letter, and they refused to hear my evidence.</p>

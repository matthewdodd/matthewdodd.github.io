                  </hi>. I am a looking-glass manufacturer, in Eyre-street Hill. Between five and six o'clock, on the 13th of October, the prisoner came to my shop, and said, "My brother has got an order for six mantel-piece looking-glasses, he has only got five in the house; could you let him have one to make up the order?"—I knew his brother as a very respectable man—he asked the price and the size, and went back, as he said, to his brother, to let him know—in about an hour he returned, and said, "My brother does approve; if you will let me have the glass, my brother will return the money to<lb></lb>night or to-morrow morning"—I never saw him again till he was in custody—I let him have the glass in consequence of his statement that his brother wanted one.</p>

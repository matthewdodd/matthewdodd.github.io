               <p>Q. Who supplies the India Company with lead? - A. Mr. Poynder.</p>
               <p>Q. So that it must belong either to Mr. Poynder or the Company? - A. Yes; there were three men at top, ready to throw the lead off, and there were two men at the bottom; then the three men at the top threw down three large loads of lead, it was cuttings; and then they all came down into the yard, to where the lead lay, five of them; the prisoner was one of them; then two of them went to the watch-box belonging to the bricklayer's labourer, and took out two large parcels more of lead; each man had his load of lead, all the five; I followed the prisoner, and all five walked out of the yard, into Cutler-street, and from there to Houndsditch, strait down Houndsditch to Bishopsgate-street; three of them turned to the right, and two to the left; the prisoner turned to the right; I followed them till they arrived in Steward-street, at Mrs. Spencer's; the first man that came up to the door is not here; the prisoner came up in a minute; I saw Mrs. Spencer in the parlour; a little girl opened the door; it was then getting duskish: the first man that went in he went directly right across the shop, into a passage; there was a light in the parlour, and the front of the parlour is all glass; Mrs. Spencer came out of the parlour with the candle, and followed him; I then turned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040034"></xptr>round and saw the prisoner I sles crossing the street to come up to the door, and Parker at his heels; I stepped off the step of the door directly, and let Isles up; the same girl opened the door, and let Isles in; I saw him go into the same passage with his load; my partner then went for a constable; I never left the door till the constable came, which was in about six minutes; we rang at the bell directly, the girl opened the door, and I saw Mrs. Spencer in the shop; I said to her, here are two men come in here loaded with lead; she said, no man had come in there that night; I told her I was very sure there was, for I had followed them from the Company's warehouses, and never lost sight of them till they entered the house; she still insisted that no man had come in; I told her I was sure there had; I told her she must give me the candle, I had no doubt but I should find either the man or the lead; then she gave me the candle; I proceeded into the yard instantly, I found there was no lead in the yard, nor no men; it is a very small paved yard; there was a sort of a hovel which I supposed this man might have gone into, I went up there, and there was a pair of stair-cases; but I found nobody; I came down again, and took the candle in my hand; I looked round and saw a large hole in the wall; I applied the candle into the hole, where I saw the lead in the cellar through the hole; I said to Mrs. Spencer, here is the property that the men have brought; I dare say I shall find the men in the cellar; she said, I was welcome to go into the cellar; upon that I turned to the right, where this lead was, in a coal-hole; the quantity was about five hundred weight, as near as I can guess; it was sheet-lead, quite new the greater part of it; there were some pieces which were not new; it was marked "No. 1, Party-wall," with a chalk-mark; from the folds, the double, and the size of it, I suspected that to be the lead; Parker then wrote my name upon it with a knife: then we went into the cellar, and hunted about, but could not find any body; there was a hole that went into the passage, that we suppose they could get out at; we then went into the shop, and found some more lead, with the chalk-mark; I left Parker and the constable, I went for one of the elders, Mr. Ware; I returned in about five or six minutes to Mrs. Spencer's; I went down with Mr. Ware into the cellar to see this lead, Mrs. Spencer went down with us; I opened the lead, and shewed Mr. Ware the mark"No. 1, Party-wall;" Mr. Ware and I and Parker went for the plumber, leaving the constable in the house; the foreman, Foster, came with us; and Mrs. Spencer went down with us into the cellar; he opened the lead, and said it had the marks that came from the shop upon it; he said, he had not the least doubt it was the property of the East-India Company; Mr. Ware told me to put a mark upon this lead; I took a knife out of my pocket and marked the lead with a W, every lot that was there, which amounted to twenty-eight, in the presence of Mrs. Spencer; when Mr. Foster said he had not the least doubt that they were the same marks, and if it was left till day-light he should be better able to tell the marks a great deal; there were eight pieces in the shop, I marked them with the same mark as those in the cellar, a W. There were some sheet-lead and some cuttings in the cellar and in the shop both; then, as we did not take the lead away, Mrs. Spencer gave her word and honour that nothing should be deficient till Monday morning; this was on the Saturday evening; then we went away, constable and all. I returned again on the Monday about eleven o'clock, with Mr. Ware, Mr. Foster, and Mr. Parker; Mrs. Spencer was at home; we went down into the cellar, and Mrs. Spencer went with us; we found the lead had been hauled about, and not one piece upon another, it was quite altered from the state in which we had left it; they were strewed about; the piece that we observed, on the Saturday night, to have "No. 1, Party-wall," was entirely rubbed out, nor a bit to be seen; the W's were all standing; Parker had wrote my name upon one piece, and that I found in the cellar; then we went into the shop, and the pieces that were marked "No. 1, Party-wall," had been rubbed out, and chalked planner; then Ray and Armstrong came, and took the lead away. Isles was not taken till the 21st, about eight or nine days after.</p>

               <p>Q. He did not return to his work the next day? - A.No; then we took the lead to Worship-street; Armstrong and Foster and I then took a piece of lead to the building; the plumber thought it would match; the piece did not match there, but there was one place where it did match a little.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. (Counsel for Isles.)</p>
               <p>Q. One of the bits of lead did match? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it appeared to you that some of that lead was cut that had been affixed to the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. It was the end of a gutter, was it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. (Counsel for Spencer.)</p>
               <p>Q. This shop was, or has been a plumber's shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.It had been shut up for a considerable time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Spencer's husband had carried on the business of a plumber there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that there was a glass partition between the shop and parlour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself; is there any thing more between the shop and the parlour, than four square<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040035"></xptr>of glass, with a large nob in the middle of each? - A. Yes; the whole front is glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself, because I understand the fact is not so; is there more glass than in the parlour door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The shop window was shut up? - A. Yes, and the glass door outside.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the house had been uninhabited for some time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The windows were very dirty? - A. It was dirty, but I could see every thing clear.</p>
               <p>Q. When you knocked at the door, the child opened the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She called her mother, did she not? - A. No, Mrs. Spencer met me coming out of the passage into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.And she told you that you were welcome to search? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She was not taken up, but voluntarily attended the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She attended three times? - A. She did, and was afterwards dismissed upon her finding bail; she surrendered to take her trial.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the Police-officers belonging to Worship-street: I apprehended the prisoner on the 21st of October, in a house in Rose-lane, in the parish of Christ Church, Spitalfields; I saw the prisoner through the keyhole of the door, and I opened the door by force, and took hold of him; I had Ray and Mason with me; I told him I wanted him for stealing the lead from the India warehouses, which had been carried to Mrs. Spencer's; he said he had carried it there, but he was not paid for it; I went on the Monday to Mrs. Spencer's, and she told me we might take what lead we liked, and we took nine pieces; she came to the Magistrate's, and two gentlemen passed their words for her appearance, and she appeared again on Thursday; the lead is in Court.</p>
               <p>Muffett. This is the same kind of lead that is upon the India Company's warehouses.</p>
               <p>Isles's defence. I am innocent of the charge that is laid against me, and therefore I shall leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Isles called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Spencer put in a written defence, as follows:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, I do assure you that I am perfectly innocent with respect to receiving this lead; I never have, at any time, bought any lead that I had the least reason to think was stolen; it is the custom of our trade to buy and fell both lead and glass supposing it honestly come by, giving a fair valuation for it; but the lead in question I knew nothing of till these men, and the beadle, came to ask for it; nor did I see the man that was charged with stealing it till my third appearance before the Magistrate, I then knew him in consequence of having known his master that he was apprenticed to, a Mr. Wildman, a very respectable plumber in Whitechapel, I have known both Mr. and Mrs. Wildman some years; I hope your Lordship, and the gentlemen of the Jury, will take into consideration the whole of my conduct upon this very trying occasion, that you and they will have the goodness to reslect that my conduct was very different from that of a guilty person; that if I had known that I had either bought or received any lead that had been stolen, I should not have suffered them to look wherever they pleased, which was really the case. I beg leave to inform the Court, that in all this affair there has been no warrant, that I went before the Magistrate voluntarily, and that whatever I did was free from any compulsion. My Lord, I have been all my life in the place I now reside in, and the adjoining parish, I have a large family of ten children, and we have been under some embarrasments lately through unforeseen misfortunes; at the time this affair happened, I was in a great deal of trouble, my husband was in confinement for debt. I will not any longer take up the attention of the Court, I have stated plain facts, and I submit my case to the consideration and clemency of this honourable Court; I should not have troubled the Court with a written defence, but that never having been in such a presence before, I should find myself unequal to the task of speaking, I thought I should not be so well able to speak. Clementina Sophia Spencer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 119, Jubilee Street—the prisoner is my nephew, he has lived with me ever since he was four months' old—on 15th January I asked him to fetch his father's burial card down, he did so and put it on the table—he looked rather strange and excited—I sat down, and he struck me on my head with a hammer which is used to break coals with—I did not see the hammer in his hand till I had received the blow—I cannot tell whether I received more than one blow, for the blood ran into my mouth—he then fell down at my feet and begged my pardon, and said, "For God's sake what have I done? I must be mad to do this; I will go for the doctor"—a companion of his came to the door who he says he wishes he had never seen, and said, "Is George in V I do not know his name—I do not know in my excitement whether the prisoner went for a doctor or not; I went to the hospital in a cab—we had never had an angry word—I last saw the hammer three or four days before, but I do not know where it came from when he used it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—I admitted the prosecutrix—she was excited, but my impression is that she was not drunk—she had eight wounds on her head, and some considerable con<lb></lb>tusions—one wound down the centre of her head was lacerated, and was two and a half or three inches long, the others were contused and round it—this hammer would probably produce them—she was in considerable danger, but she appears to be safe now—there must have been as many blows as wounds.</p>

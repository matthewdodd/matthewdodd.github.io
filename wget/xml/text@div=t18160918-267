            . I am comptroller of the Gerrard-street post office. Upon receiving information respecting this business; I questioned the prisoner, respecting this one pound note. It was on the 1st or 2nd of September; I asked him how he came by it. He said he received it from a woman in Ballard's-lane, who had a basket on her arm, and who appeared as a reader. He was counting his silver as it was pay day, and she asked him for change, and he gave it her to get rid of his silver. He gave it her, eighteen shillings in silver, and two shillings in copper. He asked her her name, and she gave the name of Hoby, Wheatstone.</p>

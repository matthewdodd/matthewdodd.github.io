On the 13th of November, in the evening, near seven o'clock, I was sitting in my own shop, by the fire. I was sitting by the right hand side of the fire, and Hanks, the prisoner, sat opposite of me; his knees touched my knees. I have known him forty years; I employed him as a journeyman. Before that I was in the public-house; he came in by accident; he told me that he had been out of employ seven weeks; he said he had never done better than when he was in my service. I said yes, you might have done well, if you had been steady. I had some trifle of reckoning to pay; I had no money but a ten-pound note, and somebody said you have not got a ten-pound note. I took it out of my pocket-book, and put it in the pocketbook again. I went out of the public-house; the prisoner followed me. I sat down by the fire in my shop; he sat down; his knees touched mine. He said, you will fall asleep. I said, no, I shall do very well. I am apt to be heavy at that hour of night. Before that I had put my hand down, and felt whether I had the pocket-book, and after he was gone I took out my pocket-book, and the ten-pound note was gone. I went to his sister, to enquire where he lodged. He lodged at the Golden-horse, Aldersgate-street. I went to the Golden-horse; the landlord said he had not laid at home from the Friday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your property - A. No. I should know the note again if I were to see it; the number is 25, 925. I know he robbed me while I was asleep, because no creature was sitting near me but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FLETCHER. I am journeyman to the prosecutor. The prosecutor had been over to the public-house; he came home to the shop; the prisoner soon followed him. I was walking about the shop; the prisoner asked me to fetch him a pint of beer. I did.</p>

               <p>JAMES HANCOCK. I apprehended the prisoner at a public-house in Kingsland-road. I searched him, and found two-pound in notes, and nine shillings and sixpence in silver, a new silver watch, and a new coat that he had recently bought.</p>

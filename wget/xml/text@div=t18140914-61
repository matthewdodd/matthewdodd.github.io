I told him that a bale had been stolen to the amount of fifty pieces. I asked the prisoner if he had any objection of giving up the person of whom he had purchased them; he declined telling me of whom he had purchased them. I informed him in the presence of M'Knight and Elsworth, that if he did not give up the name, I must take him before the magistrate; at last, he told me that he had them of a young man, a neighbour. He did not tell me his name. He said he was a customer. I took him to the office. Before the magistrate, he mentioned the name of Pratt, who lived near the prisoner's house. I had a search warrant, and searched Pratt's house. I could not find Pratt. I took thirty pieces away from Mr. Elsworth. These are them.</p>

He came to me on the morning of the 22nd of June, he said, he had a friend in embarrassed circumstances; he applied to him to sell forty pieces of cotton, could I assist him in selling them; I replied, I could not tell; I would take the opportunity of going and looking at them. I said, they would not suit my trade. I was going into the City, if he would let me have patterns. I would endeavour to sell them. That is the whole of the transaction; I leave it to your minds, whether under such circumstances I am guilty of the fact I am charged. I purchased them for the sum of sixty-five pounds, and sold them again for seventy pounds; I sold them to M'Knight.</p>

I keep the Fitters' Arms, York Road, Brighton—<hi rend="italic">the</hi> prisoner is my sister—in October last she was staying at my house—on Monday, 22nd October, about 12.30, I went upstairs, and the prisoner called me into a room adjoining her bedroom, which was used as a nursery for my children—her first words were "Oh, George, I have something 30 awful to tell you"—I replied "Good God, what do you mean?"—she pointed to a box and said "There is a dead child in that box"—the box <hi rend="italic">was</hi> in the nursery—it was her own box—she had two trunks—I went and looked at the box—it was not locked—it was shut down—it was an ordinary travelling-trunk, a deal box—I opened it and found the dead body of a child wrapped up in some kind of wrapper or a handkerchief—merely tied together; the head and all was enveloped in it; the box was full of her clothes, and this was at the top—I asked her several questions, when it took place, and what she meant by bringing such a disgrace to my house—she said she was very sorry—she intended to go to a lying-in hospital—that week—she said first of all it happened on Thursday light, and afterwards she said on "Wednesday night—a servant, Rose Lintott, slept in the same room with the prisoner—I had not the slightest idea of her being in the family-way—she was about between the Wed<lb></lb>nesday and the Monday, except on Thursday—she lay in bed complaining of diarrhea.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—the prisoner was staying with us in October—on Monday, 22nd, my husband commu<lb></lb>nicated to me what he had found, and I went upstairs and saw the prisoner—I asked her if it was true what my husband had told me; she said yes, how very dreadful it was—she said at first the child was born on the Thursday, and then on the Friday morning, but afterwards that was contradicted., and she said it was on Wednesday night—on the Wednesday evening she complained of pains in her inside, and she said had had diarrhea very badly all the afternoon—I gave her some brandy—my husband had previously given her some—I told her to go to bed, which she did—I saw her a little after 11 that night; she came down stairs with a pail in her hand—I asked her what she was doing downstairs with the pail; why did she not allow the servant to take it down?—she said she had been very sick, and she did not like the servant to clear it up, so she had done it herself—I advised her not to get up in the morning, and she stayed in bed all day on Thursday—I did not know of her being in the family-way.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi>). I live at 3, Exeter Street, Chelsea—on Tuesday, 15th October, I was in Piccadilly with my husband—the two prisoners came up, and West caught hold of me—I pushed her away, and then she threatened to stab us, and Hurley struck a little girl that was with us—West then tore my shawl from my back, and passed it to some other female, who ran away—it was not Hurley she passed it to—they also tore my bonnet into ribbons—I can't swear that it was either of the prisoners did that—the value of the shawl is about a pound—I did not give the prisoners any provocation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you walking with your husband? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—arm in arm—there was a gentleman and the little girl and another person—there were five of us altogether—my husband did not touch the prisoners in passing—West immediately came up to my husband and made a grab at his chain—I pushed her away from my husband, and she said, "I will stab the man"—my husband ran away—I then went after my husband, and heard the little girl scream, and saw Hurley beating her—there were only two of the prisoners and five of us—some of our party were behind, bat they immediately came to our assistance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On which side was Hurley with respect to your uncle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were both on the same side—I will swear my uncle never touched West—my aunt pushed her away—the prisoners were coming in an opposite direction—they met us—it was about five minutes past nine at night—we were coming from the theatre—West threatened to stab my uncle—nothing was said or done by my party to them—it was about five minutes before they were given into custody—the prisoners were striking and abusing us till the police came up—Harley did not try to run away—they were given into custody as soon as the police came up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

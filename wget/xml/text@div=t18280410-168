            . I was with Roberts, and saw the prisoner with another lad; the prisoner left him about two yards behind, and went up to the prosecutor - he suddenly turned away from him, and ran; I pursued, and caught him - he threw the handkerchief down; I took it up, and Roberts told the prosecutor, who claimed it; I did not say."We must not go to Bow-street," nor did Roberts - I took him first to the watch-house, and they would not take him in, because it was not eight o'clock. I took him to Bow-street - it was then just eight, and the door was shut; I took him to the watch-house again, and next morning having to go to Marlborough-street on another charge, I took him there, as I could not be at two places.</p>

            . This (here) Man pretended to be my Friend; about ten or eleven o'Clock at Night, in the Year 1734, I was coming from Mr. Beal's, a Gardiner, in Ratcliffe-Highway , and he and another would see me Home to my Father's in Kent Street Road; they pretended they would see me safe Home, and just within a Stone's Cast of <placeName id="t17370216-14-crimeloc67">East-Smithfield</placeName>

He said nothing at all to me, but only took my Money from me, and then he went away and left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it Light or Dark when this was done?</p>
               <p>Cross. 'Twas Dark.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him first after this Fact was committed?</p>
               <p>Cross. About a Quarter of a Year afterwards I saw him in Barnaby-street, and as I was speaking to him, and was going to discover my Mind to him, he ran away, and I never saw him since, 'till I saw him in Newgate</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the Knife afterwards?</p>
               <p>Cross. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was dark when you was robb'd, consider - How was it possible for you to know him again?</p>
               <p>Cross. It was dark when he did this; but I saw him that Day at Mr. Beal's, between two and three o'Clock in the Afternoon, and he was gathering Cucumbers: He had made an End of his Work, and pretending to be my Friend, would conduct me home, and so he robb'd me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the Prosecutor in my Life, as I know of. Pray where did I work?</p>
               <p>Cross. At Mr. Beal's a Gardiner in Ratcliff Highway.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Does not your Father go by some other Name?</p>
               <p>Cross. My Name is

               <p>Prisoner. Paul! - O I know him by his Name Paul, very well. He came into Mr. Beal's when I work'd there; but I never saw him before, nor since. I did not know him till he said his Name was Paul, I declare. He was fuddled that Night, and would go down into a sad Place where I never was before; there were three or four Women there with him, and I left him there, because I did not chuse their Company. <rs id="t17370216-14-verdict68" type="verdictDescription">

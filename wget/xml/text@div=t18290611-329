            . I live at Ponder's-end, and employed the prisoner on the 26th of May; I sent him to London with forty-four bundles of tares - I never saw him again till the 1st of June, when he was taken; he was to have brought me sixpence a bundle for them - what he got more was for himself; he was to settle as soon as he came home.</p>

            . I am a constable of Enfield. I took the prisoner on the 1st of June - I told him the charge, he said he should not have done it but for Jessop, and that he had but 16s. 6d. of the money.</p>
               <p>CHARLES JESSOP. I am in the prosecutor's service. The prisoner called, and took 6s. of Mr. Young, of Somers'-town, and several other persons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Where did I leave you? A. At Somers'-town; I had two bundles to sell, and four to go to the Bear and Ragged-staff public-house: you said you were going to the brewhouse to see how many tares they would want to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Upon my soul and body, I came down with him to the tripe-shop, at Islington: we threw down seven dozen of bundles in the yard: he said, "Mind, and be sure you take care of your money," and give me 1s. of it - I had the money, and I said to him, "I shall overtake you - here is the shilling," there was a hole in my pocket, and the money slipped down; I ran back, and could not find it - I sent word to my master by two people that I would work the money out, and he said I should; I went to the field to work, and was taken.</p>
               <p>JAMES OVENELL. He sent word if I did not choose to take him into my employ, he would lay a stick, which he had with a spike in it about my bl-y head, and he had that when he was taken.</p>

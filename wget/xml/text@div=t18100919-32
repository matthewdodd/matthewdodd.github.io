Yes; the deceased lodged in the same house with me, in Red Lion-street, Wapping. We went out of our lodging between five and six, we went to the Dundee Arms public house, the landlady would not let us in, and we walked about the street. We got into <placeName id="t18100919-32-crimeloc176">Great Armitage-street</placeName>

As soon as they had passed me, I heard a row behind me; they were heaving stones at us, and a stone hit me upon my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Jones doing - A. I saw nothing that he did. One of the Portuguese ran after him. When I returned, I found Jones stabbed in the lower part of the belly, he was lying down on his right side. He was taken to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were heaving stones at you and him, did you see Jones do any thing to them - A. No; we had given no offence to them, as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say that the prisoner is one of those <rs id="t18100919-32-deflabel177" type="occupation">Portuguese sailor</rs>

               <p>Q. Were you in company with the deceased in Plough-alley, where the prisoner lodged - A. Yes; we were walking there, he and me; I was not in Plough-alley till the accident happened. We went straitway from Red Lion-street to Plough-alley; there was no other one in company with us; there were sailors and women in the alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not there a great many persons who made an attack upon the Portuguese - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see the house where they lodged surrounded by a mob of people. - A. No, I did not see the house; I know the house now.</p>
               <p>Q. The Dundee Arms is one end of Plough-alley, and Hermitage-street on the other - A. Yes. Jones and I were walking by ourselves; we did not go to any house where the Portuguese lodged. I had not given them any offence, nor he, as I saw. He was with me from the time he left Red Lion-street, till the accident happened.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH PORTER. I live at No 6, Plough-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of Sunday, the 26th of August, did you see any Portuguese sailors - A. Yes, at the end of the alley, the prisoner was among them, he was the first that struck Jones. I did not see Jacobs. I did not see the deceased insult any body before Jones came up. The prisoner said, if he could see the deceased, making use of a bad expression, he would have his life.</p>
               <p>Court. He did not mention his name - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did the deceased come near the prisoner - A. It might be five minutes. Jones was coming quietly along, the prisoner struck Jones with, I think, a stick, Jones had no stick, as I saw. There were about five Portuguese altogether, as nigh as I can recollect. They got Jones down at the corner of Plough-alley, and Jones called out, a knife! a knife! I saw the prisoner, he had a knife at the lower part of Jones's belly, and then I saw the prisoner throw it into the street. Then the prisoner ran about twenty yards towards Hermitage Bridge, before he was stopped, two gentlemen, who are here, laid hold hold of him, he was taken to the Thames Police. Two gentlemen led Jones to the opposite side of the way; he had his bowels in his hand; he asked me if I saw his bowels; I said, I did; he said I am no more for this world. I did not see any stones thrown: I did not see the whole transaction.</p>

            . I am a Swedish sailor. At this time I was coming out of my lodging, and going up Hermitage-street. I saw five or six sailors, Portuguese. I saw the Portuguese take stones from under their jackets, and heave them at the deceased. The deceased said, do not heave the stones at me, give me English play. The prisoner took a knife from under his waistcoat, and came five or six yards and stabbed him under his belly. I collared him immediately, and five or six Portuguese hit me on the head with sticks and stones, by that means he got away from me, and ran across the street. I ran after him, and catched him again; I never lost sight of him. His knife fell down in the street, I do not know who picked it up. I took the prisoner to the office.</p>

               <p>Mr. PRATT. I am one of the pupils belonging to the London Hospital. I saw the deceased the next morning, he lived till eleven o'clock the next morning, and then died.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he wounded - A. On the left side, on the lower part of the belly, with a sharp instrument; in my opinion, that wound was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>REV. EDWARD ROBSON. Q. You are a magistrate of the county of Middlesex - A. I am. On Sunday, the 27th of August, about eight o'clock in the evening, I attended the diseased at the London hospital; he was sensible, perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sensible of his approaching death - A. I did not ask him that question; I administered the path to him, and took the examination from his own lips, and writ it down at the instant, and he signed it, that is the deceased's signature; he was perfectly sensible, though in great pain. The prisoner was present and heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the prisoner understood it - A. Certainly it did; though I was surprized on the second examination, to find that he wanted an interpreter upon what the deceased said. I asked the prisoner two or three questions, he gave me answers. The man was brought before me in custody. I went to the London hospital to take the deposition of

I went up to the house where several of the Portugueze lodge, my shipmates then came to me. Several of the Portugueze then came up, I was then fighting another Portugueze with a stick, the prisoner seeing me likely to get the better of him, struck me with a knife and stabbed me in the belly. I am certain the prisoner is the man who shoved me in the alley, and I am certain that he is the man that stabbed me with the knife.</p>

With a deal of persuasion he left the house; in about seven or eight minutes the deceased returned again, and there were six with him outside of the door; he used violent language and struck one of our men, his name is Lopez. I shut the door and the windows, the deceased went away, our lodger came in; he returned, in about seven or eight minutes, with the end of a rope, he had seven or eight comrades with him, he thrust violently against the door and the window, saying, he would break the door, if the b - y b - r did not come out. Mr. Gill persuaded him not, as the men were quiet, saying it would be against the law to break the door; the men were quiet at that time, and the house was shut up. He said, he would not leave the alley that night, and every b - y b - r that he met, that he thought was a Portugueze, he would split his head open; revenge he was determined to have. I know no further, than I heard the cry of murder in about ten or twenty minutes afterwards. The prisoner was not in the house during any of these times, but Lopez was, he was the person that was first struck.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You are the servant of the lodging house keeper where the Portugueze lodge - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. The American sailors and the Portugueze sailors are always fighting - A. Yes, I generally hear of them fighting. I did not see the murder done, nor did I go to the hospital.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190020"></xptr>Q. The man that you called the deceased, was not he an American sailor - A. Yes; he is a Welchman, as I am informed, he is called an American.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that the person you have been talking of was the deceased - A. No, I do not; the man I have been speaking of, was a tall man pitted with the small pox, and a speck in one eye, and long tied hair.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he and I lodged together in Rodriquez's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the man being killed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day he was killed, did you see him at the house where you lodge, and at what time - A. From four to five in the evening, I do not know for what they came; I was at home, I saw the deceased come into the room, at the lower part of the house, where I was; he called to all the Portugueze to come out to fight, they refused; the deceased went out, and we all remained in the room. He came in again the second time, they pushed him out of doors, then the deceased struck me; there were seven or eight with the deceased. As soon as we pushed him out of the door, we locked the door and fastened the windows, and remained inside of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When the door and the windows were fast, did you remain within, or did you go out to walk - A. The prisoner and I went out to take a walk as far as the London Dock, on our return home, the deceased, with some other men, followed us home to the house. They would not let us into the house. They fell upon the prisoner and struck him, I ran away and never returned back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the diseased after he was wounded - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that the man that was wounded, was the man that you are talking about - A. I do not know that he is the man that died; I recollect a man in their company who had a stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the man ran away, before you heard of a man being killed - A. About two hours afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Pratt. Did you observe any thing particular upon the eye of the deceased, that they have mentioned - A. I think I do, indistinctly, there was a mark on the man's eye, he was marked with the small pox, a middle sized man.</p>

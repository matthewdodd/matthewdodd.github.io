                  </hi>. I live at 4, Windmill Lane, Deptford, and work at a baker's shop—on Saturday, 6th May, I was passing the Acorn public-house and saw the prisoner come out—Mr. Howard followed him immediately—they were talking together and Jones said "You struck me first"—Howard said "I did not," and crossed the road—Jones pulled off his coat, turned up his sleeves, and ran after Howard, who said "I won't fight, I won't fight, I will come out in the morning and fight"—Jones caught him by the arm punched him in the neck, and they both fell—Jones got up, put on his jacket, and ran away—Howard remained where he fell, and a drunken man came and lifted him up—they got him up and set him down again on the kerb—two policemen came and he was taken away.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Acorn at Rotherhithe—on Saturday, 6th May, about 4 p.m., Howard came in with a man named Crawley and had refreshment—several people were at the bar, and the prisoner afterwards came in—there were no angry words in the house—they went out together and ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards I heard an altercation outside—I went to the door to prevent them coming in again and saw the prisoner put his hand to his face and look at it, and then he took out his handkerchief to wipe his face—he then began to spar up to Howard, who said "I won't fight"—Howard ran across to me and the prisoner followed sharp after him and chased him across the road and back again almost to my door; Howard turned suddenly round, rushed at Jones, and they seemed to exchange blows; they threw one another, and, I believe, the prisoner fell</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 61, Lower Queen Street, Rother-hithe—I was passing the Acorn, saw Jones outside and heard him say to Howard "You struck me twice"—Howard said that he had not—Jones said "I will hit you for hitting me," and pulled his coat off, but Howard said that he would not fight, and went across the road and Jones after him—Howard went towards Mr. Coomb's window—Jones put his hand up to hit him, and they closed together and fell on the kerb stone—Jones got up, stood a few minutes and put his coat on, and when two constables came up he went away—the policemen and I picked Howard up and washed his eye—Jones and Howard both appeared three parts drunk—the eyes of both of them were bleeding when I first saw them, but I don't know how it happened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon, of 12, Plough Road, Rotherhithe—on Sunday, May 7th, about 5 o'clock a.m., I was called to the deceased and found him in bed—he was conscious and complained of pain between his shoulders—his pulse was slow and his respiration laboured—there was complete paralysis of body and limbs—I saw him three times that day, and I was told that he died at 12 o'clock—on the following day I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>, and found a fracture of the seventh vertebrae of the neck and great effusion of blood into the spinal canal—that fracture was the cause of death—he was paralysed from the neck downwards, and there<lb></lb>fore I did not think it necessary to examine the viscera—he was an old patient of mine and a healthy man—it is not possible that such an injury could be inflicted by a fist.</p>

               <p>ten minutes past one o'clock, I was passing Mr. Knight's, and saw two young men draw their hand from the window, take the things from under their jackets, and give one to the prisoner—he put it under his jacket and crossed the street towards the river, where the brass was afterwards found—I told them I would go and tell—the prisoner told me not, and began to run—I told Mr. Knight.</p>

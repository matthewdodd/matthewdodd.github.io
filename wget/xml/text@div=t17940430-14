               <p>Q. Was you so on the 20th of August last? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was the prisoner at the bar employed in the Post Office? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his employment in the Post Office the 20th of August? - As a <rs id="t17940430-14-deflabel68" type="occupation">letter carrier, and he assisted in subsorting of the letters</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17940430-14-defend168 t17940430-14-deflabel68"></join>.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his duty in that character? - The letters are sorted first by twelve sorters in twelve divisions.</p>
               <p>Q. When they are sorted by the twelve sorters to whom are they delivered? - To the letter carriers, who subsort them into the different districts to deliver them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that part of the prisoner's duty on that day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the letters directed for Gerard-street fall among those that he sorted? - It might or might not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is his walk to carry letters in Gerard street? - No, it is not. There are one hundred and ten districts and twelve divisions; and there were ten districts in this division that he forted. The first sorters make them into twelve divisions, when the postage is tolled and the letters are delivered to the carriers, and they are subsorted by the letter carriers of that division, and they are subsorted by the letter carriers of that division, and they subsort them, and each one take to deliver to their own district; one of them divisions are delivered out to the letter carriers, who subsort the letters for their own districts; there were ten in this division.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Gerard-street in that division in which that man was one of the ten to sort? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Gerard-street must be among them sorters? - Naturally speaking it must be, but it might be given to others, being put in wrong by the first sorters under a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any particular period in which the letter carriers make their payment at the Post-office? - Every other day.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the days? - Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.</p>
               <p>Q. In the week in which this 20th of August fell, was the prisoner at the bar regular in making his payments on the Monday, Wednesday, and Friday-(Produces a memorandum book.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are the entries in that memorandum book, made by yourself? - They are. On the 21st of August he was deficient eight pounds and four-pence on that day, Wednesday, by two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he in fact pay it? - Not till the day following, Thursday, it was paid into the revenue on the Friday following, but I think he paid it on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the consequence if a letter carrier does not make good his payments? - The post master's order is, that he be suspended till such times as it is paid.</p>
               <p>Q. According to the rules of the Post Office when would he have been reported? - On Friday, if it had not been paid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. If I understand you right, there were nine others into whose hands these letters might have fell? - Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a great many persons by at the time that this process takes place? - Yes, I believe one hundred and ten.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300020"></xptr>Q. Is there any strangers admitted? - Yes, sometimes they come in enquiring for letters, and when the gates are opened they will come in to enquire for letters, but not in general till the sorting is all over, except an old woman, that supplies the letter carriers.</p>
               <p>Court. Are there any other sorters in the room besides these ten sorters of this division, when they are sorted by the letter carriers? - All the divisions are sorted in the same room, they are three rooms, but they are all connected together.</p>
               <p>Q. So that all the sorters have access to all these rooms? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. If I understand your description right, there is a class of sorters, and a class of subsorters? - There is.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time the prisoner at the bar was employed as a subsorter, and not as a sorter? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. In these twelve divisions it sometimes happens that a mistake happens, a letter gets into a wrong division frequently? - It is impossible to avoid that.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor's Counsel. When a mistake happens what is done with the letter? - There are boxes for each of the twelve divisions, they are thrown off to the division it belong to.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was there any thing before that said to him, either to induce him to say it, or to threaten him to say it? - He was in bed when we went to the house, and Shillcock by the direction of Miller, desired him to come down; when he came down stairs, he was asked by Miller what he had done with the fifteen pounds bank note? he hesitated some little time, but however by interrogating him with some degree of spirit, he said it was all gone different ways, and said if we would let him alone, he would make it up in the morning; very little more passed then, he put his clothes on, and we took him away in a coach, and we brought him down to the Brown Bear, the next morning he was examined at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. At Bow-street there was some memorandum made in a book? - I will not take on me to say positively there was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. But as to the time you was going to speak of, was there any thing in writing taken down at that time? - I rather think there was not; it was what I did not much attend to.</p>

               <p>Court to Wedd. What was done with the letter? - I put it in the Post Office myself at Cambridge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rolse. I keep the Post Office at Cambridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Who assists you in it? - Nobody, but my wife occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a memory of any such letter as that coming into your office? - That is impossible; I generally keep it myself, sometimes my wife, but that Monday evening the 19th, I was at home and my wife had no part of the business at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately in the evening had you sealed that bag that night? - At the time that the Wisbich Mail comes in, that commonly comes in a quarter after ten, sometimes sooner, and sometimes later, I delivers it to the guard. I put the letters into the bag before, I shut the box at nine o'clock; it is a bag sealed for London only.</p>
               <p>Court to Peter Wedd. You say you put the letter in the Post, did you pay any thing with it? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you put it in? - Into the letter box.</p>
               <p>Rolfe. I saw Mr. Wedd go to the box, and had some particular conversation with him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if Mr. Wedd put it in you are absolutely certain you forwarded it in proper time? - I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am conscious of my innocence, I was out nine weeks on bail, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300023"></xptr>twice surrendered myself, and my bail even persuaded me to be absent if I was guilty; I told my bail I was not guilty and I would take my trial like a man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is certainly true that this man did twice surrender himself, after having been out twice upon bail to take his trial.</p>

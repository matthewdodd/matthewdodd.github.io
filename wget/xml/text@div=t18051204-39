             sworn. I live at the cook's shop, Tothill-street. A quarter before seven o'clock on the 8th of November, the prisoner brought a sheet, a shift, and a coloured apron; she asked me to let her hang them in my room, as her own was so small she had no convenience. I told her she might and welcome; she hung them up, and they remained there till Saturday twelve o'clock, excepting the shift, which the prisoner took away with her. Mrs. Thirlkill came to my room, and asked me if I had such things; I told her I had; she took the sheet and apron off the line.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I washed on Thursday, I hung my things up to dry in the kitchen under where I live; I went out early in the morning and took the things with me; I asked the evidence to let me hang the things in her room till I took them away myself; they hung there from the time I took them till Saturday, when the prosecutor went and took them off the line. I wanted some money, so I pledged the shift.</p>

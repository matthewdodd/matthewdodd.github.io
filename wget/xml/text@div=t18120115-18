            , I occupy the house myself. On the 16th of November we lost the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how it was taken. - A. I cannot say. I heard no tidings of the coat until the 24th of December. I was passing down Fleet-street, and recognised the coat on a gentleman's back, I accosted the gentleman, and asked him how he came by it, he told me he purchased the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that gentleman here - A. No, he is not, he went with me to the shop, he bought the coat in Hare street, Piccadilly. My brother attended there with an officer Mr. Hornbuck, who bought the coat, myself and brother, with the officer, went to Bow-street. The prisoner is a workman that worked with us at the time that the coat was missing, he left our employ on the 16th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the coat. - A. It is here.</p>
               <p>Mr Gurney. Had you seen the coat before you had lost it. - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you had seen it. - A. I cannot say to a day, the last time I saw it was on the 13th or 14th of November, in our shop in Fleet street, it was a finished coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear positively to that being the coat.</p>
               <p>A. I can, by the particular manner in which it is made, we had the fellow coat made in the same manner, I cut the coat out myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You found this coat on the back of an officer. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that officer is not here himself. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This is your dwelling-house Mr. Croft. - A. It is, my brother lives in the house adjoining, there is a communication from one house to another, but not so as to make it one house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this coat in your house, or your brothers. - A In my house.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not venture to swear that whoever took the great coat that you lost they took it from your house, and not from your brother's - A. Yes, I could. They are never taken into my brother's house - his house is a private house.</p>
               <p>Court. If I am right, you are positive to the coat. - A. Yes, I am.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Mr. Hornbuck, a dealer in second-hand clothes, 13, Hare street, Piccadilly. The prisoner at the bar brought a coat to me, and I brought it for my employer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner. - A. I am, the prisoner is the person I bought the coat of, and the coat is the coat I bought of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you bought it of him - A. I cannot say precisely the day, it was the 19th or 20th of November, some time thereabouts, about three o'clock in the afternoon. I gave two guineas and a half for it, he asked me three guineas for it, I believe it never had been worn at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Somebody brought this coat, and asked three guineas, and you beat him down to two guineas and a half. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The coat is worth about 10 l. - is it not. - A. It is. I can swear the coat is the coat I bought of the prisoner, by the mark I put on it.</p>
               <p>Q. You mark other coats the same. - A. Yes, but we never had such a coat before.</p>
               <p>Q. When the officer went with the coat to Bow-street, they had the cruelty to take you there. - A. They did take us there.</p>
               <p>Q. They called you a receiver, that you had bought goods at a quarter of the value - A. They did say that.</p>
               <p>Q. To find out the thief, at last you fixed upon this person. - A. I fixed upon the person that I bought it of.</p>
               <p>Q. That we have on your word as an honest man, who bought the coat at two guineas and a half, and the coat worth ten pounds. - A. I did not know the value of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150029"></xptr>Jury. Q. (to Simpson.) How did you find the man you bought the coat of. - A. Mr. Croft had a suspicion of the prisoner; he sent one of his men with me. I took him at a house in Higlers-lane, Blackfriar's-road. From the description that I gave to Mr. Croft, he said he suspected that man, and it proved to be the man I bought the coat of.</p>

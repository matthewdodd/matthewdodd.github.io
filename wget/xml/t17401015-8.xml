               <p>Theophilus Swift . On the 16th of September , about eleven at Night, as I was coming through <placeName id="t17401015-8-defloc40">St Paul's Church-Yard</placeName>

I felt it go, and I immediately cry'd out; the Villain has stole my Watch; I had a Friend with me, who pursued the Prisoner up Cannon-Alley, into Queen's Head-Alley; he fell down, we seized him, and saw the Watch lying within a Yard of him. I am sure the Prisoner is the Man; he never was out of my Sight 'till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him, whether he was sober at this time?</p>
               <p>Swift . I was; that declares itself, otherwise I could not have missed the Watch so soon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him, if he did not say, he could not tell which of the Men took his Watch?</p>
               <p>Swift . No, I always said he was the Person; I saw his Hand go down to my Pocket, and when he drew it out, I felt him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. By what Circumstances is he sure that I am the Man?</p>
               <p>Swift . The Man that put his Hand down to my Pocket, was the Person I pursued.</p>

            . I was with the Prosecutor when this happened, and saw the 2 Men come along; I gave Way to them: The Prisoner ran against Swift, and he immediately said, the Villain is gone with my Watch; I followed him through an Alley, and half Way up another, he fell over two or three Steps, and then I laid hold on him; he cry'd out he was robbed of his Hat and Wig, which were lost in the Fall; the Watch was found lying not a Yard and half from the Prisoner. I am sure the Man that came up to the Prosecutor is the same Person I took; for there was nobody between him and me all the Pursuit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether it is probable that I could throw the Watch away, when he followed me so close?</p>
               <p>Thompson. By the Force of the Fall, the Watch might fly out of his Hand.</p>

On the 23rd of January, in the afternoon, he came into the shop, and asked to look at some prints in the window, which he did - he then looked at some quills; he said they were very good, and their governor used a great many, but they did not want any then - he then asked to look at some account-books; he said they were very good, and if I would allow him he would choese out three to go to Mr. Baker, the lawyer, No. 7, Finsbury-circus - he asked if I could send them; I said Yes - he went out of the shop, then returned, and said he would send a light-porter for them; Webb afterwards came, and said he had called for the three books, which their young man had chosen out for Mr. Baker, the lawyer, No. 7, Finsbury-circus - I was going to pack them up, but he said I need not be particular, as Mr. Baker was waiting in the office, and the other young man would call and tell me if they would do; he then went out with them - Evans followed him, and I was sent for in about ten minutes - these are the books.</p>

               <p>COURT to ANN WREAKS. Q. When you parted with these books did you intend that the prisoner should have the property, or was it merely to take it to Mr. Baker? A. He was to take it to Mr. Baker, to see if it would suit him; it was to be a ready money transaction, and I was to allow him so much for each book - they were not sold on credit, or sold to either of the prisoners; Baker said he would give me a good order, and recommend the shop.</p>

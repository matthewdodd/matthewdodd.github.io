               <p>Q.How lately before that, had you been in the room? - A.

               <p>Q.You are a watchman? - A. Yes: On Thursday morning, about twenty minutes after five o'clock, the prisoner passed me with a bag on her shoulder, at Seven Dials, coming out of Lumbercourt. My good woman, said I, what have you got in this bag? What is that to you, she says. I laid my hand upon the bag, and I thought it was wet linen, being so well packed. Where are you going with this bag, says I; What is that to you, says she, I am going home. Where is your home, says I, where do you live? I shall not tell you, says she. If you don't, says I, you must go to the watch-house directly. When I spoke about the watch-house, she dropped the bag, and ran across the street to get away from me, I suppose; I called my partner; we took her to the watch-house, and gave her up to the constable of the night to search her; I was by when the bag was opened.</p>
               <p>Q.Was any thing found upon her? - A. She dropped a dark lantern, and a key, a wrench, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200049"></xptr>some combustibles, to get a light with. (Produces the bag.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the bag she had across her shoulders? - A. Yes.</p>

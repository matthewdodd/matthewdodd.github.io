                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. James Henry Stewart, jeweller and optician, 406, Strand—on 30th November I fastened up the house about 11 o'clock—I saw to the whole of the astenings—between 3 and 4 in the morning of 1st December, my wife and I were awoke by a strange kind of noise; I got out of bed to go to the window, but before I could open it I heard some glass fall in the yard below—I opened the window, looked out, and saw a man going over a wall which separates the back of our house from the back of the first house in Bull Inn-court—the entrance to the court is two doors from our house—my wife sprang a rattle while I was dressing myself, and some constables came and appeared at the window from which the prisoner got out—I let them in, and we examined the back parlour window—the puttey had been carefully removed, the window broken, and the hasp pushed back—later in the morning I searched the window, and, on the sill found a couple of chisels, which I produce, also some paste in a piece of paper—I saw the broken pieces of glass scattered about.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 16). On the morning of 1st December, about a quarter past 3, I was on duty in Bull Inn-court, Strand, about six or seven yards from the prosecutor's house—I heard a scuffling noise in the house, 15, Bull Inn-court—I said, "Who's there?"—I received no answer—in a minute or so the door came open about a few inches and was slammed again—I said, "Come out, whoever you are there," and directly the door flew open, and the prisoner, with another man not in custody, rushed from the house into the Strand—I pursued the prisoner, calling "Stop thief!"—he turned towards Temple-bar—I pursued him till near Wellington-street, and after I had turned him some distance, nearly half-way back to the house again, I caught him; I should think I had run nearly half a mile—when I caught him, he said, "What are you going to do with me now?"—I said, "I am going to take you to the police-station," and I did so—I then went back to Bull Inn-court, and in the passage of No. 15, close by where the prisoner came from, I found this dark-lantern, and this rope very ingeniously tied together for the purpose of letting a person down—I then went to Mr. Stewart's house, 406, Strand, and saw last witness—when I returned to the station, I searched the prisoner, and found on him this knife, these two keys, and this handkerchief stained with blood—</p>

               <p>the prisoner's fingers were out and bleeding—he was wearing this waistcoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are three buttons missing from it; they are common buttons—about half-past 9, I searched the top of the water-closet on the wall leading over into 406, Strand, and found, these two buttons, which exactly correspond with those on the prisoner's waistcoat—they are exactly the same description—the house, 15, Bull Inn-court, is divided by a wall from the prosecutor's premises—the house in Bull Inn-court is occupied by lodgers, who go in and out at any time of night—it would be possible for a man who broke the window of the prosecutor's house to get over the wall to the back of 15, Bull Inn-court, and then to get out from there.</p>

Q.</hi> Had the house, No. 15, been broken into? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say that it had;. there were no marks of violence on it—when the two men rushed out, the other man ran towards Charing-cross—I did not lose sight of the prisoner at all before I caught him—he ran from the court as far as Wellington-street; I shot past him there, and then he turned back again, nearly to Beaufort-buildings, and I caught him by Fountain-court—that is about one hundred and fifty yards from Wellington-street—there were not many persons about—he had been running perhaps five or six minutes—I am quite sure I did not lose sight of him—I did not search the prosecutor's house, because there were constables there before I got back; they had heard the rattle sprung by the prosecutor's wife—I said nothing to the prisoner about the buttons at that time, I did next morning before he went before the Magistrate—I pointed out to him that some were missing, and said, "These buttons that I have found exactly correspond with the buttons on your waistcoat"—he made no reply.</p>

On the morning of 1st December, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I was on duty in the Strand, and heard a rattle spring from the second floor of 406, Strand—I ran up Bull Inn-court, and went into the first house, No. 15—I went through there, and saw this board laid from the kitchen stairs on to the window-sill which leads up to the top of the water-closet—I found this centre-bit, two gimlets, a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, and likewise this piece of iron, on the top of the water-closet leading to the back of 406, Strand—I also found this bag—I saw two holes in the top of the water-closet, and this board was suspended from the water-closet into the premises of 406, Strand, level with the parlour window, which was broken.</p>

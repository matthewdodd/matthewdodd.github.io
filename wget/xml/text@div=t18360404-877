                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and watchmaker, and live at No. 3, Wellington-street, Woolwich. On the 17th of March, I went to bed about eleven o'clock at night, as night, as near as I can judge—I saw the last person up in the house—I examined the doors and windows that night—they were all safe—the fastenings were all on, and the bolts right—the shop window is a projecting square window, about six feet long, fastened with a bar and two bolts at the end; and the door was fastened with two bolts and a lock—I was awoke about half-past one o'clock in the morning by the cracking of glass—I immediately got out of bed, and an to the shop door—my bed-room is on the ground floor, about seven yards from the window—when I got to the shop door, I heard the glass tricking as if it was outside the window—I put off the top bolt of the door, and heard some persons running from the door, from the outside, very quickly—I could not tell whether it was more than one person—At that mo<lb></lb>ment I gave an alarm, as loud as I possibly could, to the family up<lb></lb>stairs—my father and mother, and brother-in-law—I then unbolted the lower bolt, and unlocked the door—I went outside, and by the light of the gas-lamp, which was about thirty yards distant, on the other side of the way, I distinctly saw a quantity of glass immediately under the bar of the shop-window—there was a piece of gold among the glass—I took that up, and came inside again, and got a light—I saw nobody—when I came inside, I found the second pane in the window from the door, broken—it appeared as if it had been forced by some power from the outside—there are five shutters outside the glass, and a bar—the bar was sprung in a semicircular form—that bar was outside the window, and a hard shell was placed inside the shutter, between that and the lower rail of the win<lb></lb>dow—it was an ornamental shell for the mantel-piece—that kept the shut<lb></lb>ters out at the spring that they were at—there was about an inch aper<lb></lb>ture</p>

               <p>between the outside sill of the window and the inside of the shutter from that it appeared they bad forced the glass by some instrument—I can scarcely think an arm could have been got in, unless it was forced by some other arm to keep it out, unless the bar was more sprung to admit an arm, as the further the bar came, the shutters kept tighter, as there was none of the shutters down—I found a gold watch-chain was gone, a silver guard, with a silver slide to it; several brooches, among which was a coral one; and a stone brooch without a stem: a gilt ornament for the hair; a cornelian heart, with a gold loop; and other things—the value of the different thing gone was about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I had seen these things the night before—they were quite safe in the window when I went to bed—in the inside, between the inside sash and the outside sash of the window—if they broke the window, and put any instrument in, they might reach them with the instrument—the chains laid on a piece of plate glass on two iron brackets, and above that the silver guard hung—it appeared as if an instrument had been put through and cut the silver guard in the centre, and pulled it out of the loops; and the piece of plate glass was split right in the centre for the chains to drop into the aperture; but two of the chains fortunately had dropped the other way, inside—there were several flint watch-glasses broken, and came down with the other things, falling into the aperture—I then went and dressed myself, and came out and gave information—I have seen some of the things since—I have got the two slides of the chain—I got them from Nathan Hart—they are mine—I know them—they are a particular manu<lb></lb>facture—I have not the slightest doubt about them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman. I apprehended Thomas about two o'clock, on the morning of the 19th of March, in Artillery-place—he was in company with Robinson and Belcher, about a quarter of an hour before I took him—I followed them—they were all walking abreast, all in a row—Belcher is the only man I knew before—I followed them some distance; and in Artillery-place I got within twenty yards of them, and Belcher and Robinson ran away—I took Thomas into cus<lb></lb>tody—I knew Belcher before, but not the others—I did not lose sight of Thomas, except when he turned the corner—I am quite sure he is one of the men who was walking with Belcher—when I took him,</p>

               <p>I told him I took him to suspicion of breaking Mr. Charlton's shop open, and asked him where Belcher was—he said he had run away and that the other man' name was Robinson—I said, "What is you name?"he said, "Thomas"—I put him in the guard-room, while I went in search of the other two—this was on the Saturday morning, about two o'clock—I searched him, but found nothing on him.</p>

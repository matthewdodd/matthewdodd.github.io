                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050003"></xptr>Do you recollect the day of the month? - No.</p>
               <p>Where did you lose them from? - A three-pair of-stairs back room in my house. The prisoner lodged in that room. They were all there when she took the room. She had the room about three weeks or a month. When I missed them I made a search after the prisoner; she went out on the Thursday morning. I found her on the Friday afternoon at a publick-house in Windmill-street. I thought by her not coming home all Thursday night; that she had left the room. When I found her I asked her what she had done with the things. She was very much in liquor, and gave me several answers. I took her to my house, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>What time did you take her? - About one o'clock. I sent for the constable at about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>What did she say about the things? - Nothing, in particular. She told me of four articles that evening before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Was she sober then? - I believe she was. She told me the things were at three pawnbrokers, and mentioned all the things I had lost. She said three articles were at Parker's in Princes-street; and I found them there; they were, a tea-kettle, flat-iron, and window curtain. She said she was sorry she had done it, and she would pay me so much a week if I would not prosecute her. I said I would not take any thing of her, but if she would tell me where all the things were I would not trouble myself about it.</p>
               <p>Was that before she told you where the things were? - Yes. She would not tell me where all the things were.</p>

I ran directly, and I saw the woman lay on the ground, and the prisoner running away; I run after the prisoner and the other woman, and the prisoner in turning the corner of Short's-gardens fell down, and I laid hold of her directly, and I told her she should go to the round house, I found this cloak upon her, she resisted at first, and would not get up off the ground, afterwards she said she would see the woman home, she said she was going to see the woman home to Newtoner's-lane; I asked Mrs. Giles if she lived in Newtoner's-lane, she said no, I then said, you shall go to the round house, and she said, Mr. Joseph do not hurt me, and I swore she should go to the round house.</p>

I had six 5 l. notes, two sovereigns, and about 10 s. I put my breeches under the pillow, and saw the prisoner take them away, take the money out and throw away a piece of newspaper which they were wrapped in - nobody but her was then in the room. She went down stairs, I ran down, naked, to follow her, but she was gone - I had been about an hour in the room. I was drunk or I should not have gone - I was so drunk, that when I saw her take the money, I could not help myself.</p>

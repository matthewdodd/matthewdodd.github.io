                  </hi>. I am servant to Mrs. Humphreys, of Stamford-hill, and have been for two years and a half. On 24th April, about half part 9 o'clock, I closed the house, and went to bed about 20 minutes to 10—I was awoke before daylight by a noise—about 6 o'clock in the morning I got up; I first went up stairs, and then down stairs—I saw the parlour door ajar—I opened the door part of the way, and two men rushed on me, struck me on the side of my face, and I lost my senses for a moment—I beard my mistress scream, and I lost my senses again—when I came to myself; a man was kneeling on my side with a knife in his hand, which he held to my throat, and said, "Will you be quiet?"—I said, "Yes, if you will let me alone"—I then saw that there was a chopper, and a piece of wood lying by the table—he then put me in a chair, and while doing so another man came down stairs, and said something to the man that was with me, which I could not understand—one took one hand, and the other the other, and took me into the kitchen—the man that came down stairs asked me where I the plate was—I said that all I knew was three silver spoons—he said that they were only old things, and asked me where the money was—I told him that I did not know—he then held the knife to my throat, saying that I might do which I liked; tell him where the money was, or they would have I my life; that they had killed my mistress, and would kill me—I then told him all that I knew was in the house, I told them where the money was—they were going to take me up stairs, and I asked for a shawl, and a little water, which they let me have—they then took me up stairs, and I showed them where the money was—one of them broke the drawer open in the front parlour where he first attacked me; he then said something to the man who was standing by me, which I did not understand—he took a rope out of his pocket, one tied my hands, and the other my feet; the one that was with me the whole of the time then went up stairs, leaving the other with me—before they did that they carried me out of the front parlour into the back, after tying my hands and feet—he then went up stairs, and when he came down they wanted to bring my mistress down into the cellar, but he objected to it; he said, "They want to bring the old woman down into the cellar, but I object to it"—after they were gone, I got the rope loosened by working my arm on the arm of the chair, and then I got out of the window—I saw four men, their faces were covered; one with a red handkerchief, one with a piece of crape or net, the other with a piece of crape or linen put over his head, and his hat, on top of it, and the fourth I only saw through the crack of the door; I think his face was covered with something, but am not sure—when I got up stairs my mistress was tied with her hands across, and the rope passed under the bedclothes, and then tied round her legs, a thick handkerchief was tied over her mouth, and two pillows over her face—I found these strange tools (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the wash house, about an hour after they left—this piece of steel was among them—this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) belongs to my mistress, I know it well—when I was taken down stairs I saw now they got in—the brick wall was broken down by the side of the wash house door, which was closed; that was fresh, and was large enough for a man to get in, it was about a foot from the ground—a man getting into the wash home would have access to the rest of the house; it is a passage leading from the wash house into which they broke, it is by the wash house door—if you got through the hole you would find yourself in the passage, and could get into the dwelling house—there was nobody whatever in the house but myself and my mistress—I know who I succeeded as servant, by sight; her name was Charlotte Towers, but it is Horwood now—about six or seven weeks</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070063"></xptr>
               <p>before the burglary, a man and woman came to my mistress's house; it was on 3rd Feb.—I recognise Fleckart as the man—it was the day before this letter came (<hi rend="italic">produced, dated</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th Feb.</hi>)—I was not at home when they came, I came in while they were there, about half past 5 o'clock, or between 5 and 6 o'clock; it was Sunday, and I had been to church—my mistress told me, in the presence of the man and woman, that they had come to tell her that Mr. Rush had had two fits, and was lying at Salisbury—I said to my mistress, "Never mind, people have two fits, and they recover"—I then seated my mistress into a chair, because she was very ill; she is a very old lady—my mistress told me that the man (Fleckart) was ill—they wanted me to go with them to Mr. Bush's office, as he was going to be telegraphed—I did not go, I offered my brother or my father to go—the woman said to Fleckart, "Never mind, dear, you can call to-morrow, as you go to Waltham Grose"—my mistress told me to look at the man, to as to know him when he called the next day, and I looked at him—(he did not call the next day, another man called, and brought a note)—Fleckart appeared ill, and had some gin and water; he was then shown into the yard, that is where the brick wall is, through which the hole was afterwards made—he could see it when he was in the garden, and could see the door adjoin<lb></lb>ing it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About how long were you in a state to observe the four men? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About half an hour—they were there from 6 o'clock till ten minutes to 8 o'clock—it is about half an hour that I can speak to seeing them, it might be more, I do not think it was lees—I answered them when they put questions to me—the man that held me told me that if I was not hurt then, I should not be—the only thing I asked them was to let my mother know how I was tied—I did not have a good deal more conversation than I recollect the particulars of—I asked them not to kill my mistress; and they told me that they would drop a line to the inspector to tell him to come and untie me—the shortest of the four did not speak to me at all, the other three did—the one who did not speak to me is the one who I cannot positively swear to having a mask or not—I had not an opportunity of observing him—I was about the distance from him that I am from that table, but I only saw him through the crack of the door—I am sure there were four men there, and that I saw a man through the crack of the door—the door was open, and I saw between it and the poet—through the opening, not the crack, it was wide open—he was not standing there long—I was sitting in a chair—I did not hear them all go up to my mis<lb></lb>tress, but I heard them all four come down, because I was sensible when they came down—I heard two come down first and two afterwards—one of them used very foul language to me—the other two were drinking gin at the time in the room where I was, the fourth standing so that I could see him through the crack of the door—he did not stand there before he went up and after he came down; but I was carried from one parlour to the other—I did not-see the four men till they had come down—I did not see them give the fourth man any gin, but they took a bottle of gin out and left it on the stairs—it was through the back parlour door that I saw the man standing—the woman who came seven weeks before, was taken in custody, but I could not identify her—I say that the man that was there was Fleck<lb></lb>art, I had never seen him before—I saw him again on, I think, the Tues<lb></lb>day morning after I saw him on the Sunday, walking along the street in Newington, near the Cemetery; I did not speak to him, I was in a green grocer's shop—he looked at me and I knew him directly—I did not see him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185607070064"></xptr>
               <p>after that till the Sunday he was taken into custody—a policeman came for me and told me be Lad got a man in custody—he did not tell me who—I went with Mr. Rush, I knew that I was going to see some man, I did not know who—I thought I was going to see if he was one of the thieves—nothing was said to me about the man who was there on Sunday—he was there on Sunday about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after I was there—I offered him some spirits because he was going to drink water, but he declined—I heard him speak to my mistress—he had lit a candle before I went in, for my mistress to write her collector's address down—I was not there, but I found a candle alight when I came in, and a man, whom I say is Fleckart, and a woman, who kept her veil down all the time—on the Sunday following, when I saw Fleckart, I went back to my mistress directly and told her—on the Monday some man brought a letter, that was not Fleckart—I received the letter—when I saw him on Tuesday it was between 10 and 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you quite sure of that, because it is important? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am—I will not be positive about the Tuesday following the Sunday, but to the best of my belief it was Tuesday—I will consider; yes, it was Tuesday, I am sure—I have stated that before the Magistrate—it was at the shop of a person named Arbour at Stoke Newington, not Newington on the other side of the water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, residing at Stoke Newington. I know Mrs. Isabella Humphreys—I have visited her professionally a few times—I saw her last evening, about 7 o'clock, she was in a state of extreme feebleness, quite incapable of making the effort which would be necessary to come into this box—she is about eighty years of age—she is in a perfect state of feebleness, in a state of physical exhaustion; her vital power is exceedingly feeble.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The deposition of Mrs. Isbella Hwmphreys read as follows</hi>:—"I am a widow, and I am nearer eighty years of age than seventy—I am not able to travel to London—in February, on a Sunday, a man and a woman came to my house—I let them in myself—they went into the front parlour—I think Fleckart is the man who came with the woman—before I let them in they said they had something particular to tell me about Mr. Rush, and then I let them in—my servant was not at home—when in the parlour the man, I think, said Mr. Bush has had two fits, one in the morning, and one in the night, and the woman told me to go close to the man, because he was deaf—I went close to him, and I found he was not deaf—one of them said, 'Hare you told the lady the worst?'—the other said something to him, I could not hear what it was—they stayed some little time—the man said how he got up the hill he did not know, that he was taken with diarrhoea—I had no brandy, and I gave them some gin—he had some gin and water, and the woman drank some gin—he went out of the front door, and I opened the back door leading into the back yard—as he passed, he halted at the steps leading to the kitchen, where the brickwork was removed—the woman re<lb></lb>mained in the front parlour; when I returned I found her there—she wanted to go up stairs to the water closet—I told her she could not go there, and then she did not want—the man came back into the parlour, and sat down, and I showed him Mr. Cattle's card, the collector—my servant returned, but, before she came back, they asked for my servant to go to the telegraph office—they had said that Mr. Bush was ill at Salisbury, and that Mrs. Rush had gone down to him—I refused then to let my servant go—they did not go, and there was a rap at the door, and I think the man went to the door, and my servant came into the room—they said they would come the next day, and let my servant know how Mr. Bush was—I said,'Take notice of this person, that you may know him again when he calls to<lb></lb>morrow'—he had said he would let me know at 11 o'clock to-morrow—it was nearly dusk at this time, and the man lighted a candle himself—they then left the house—the next day a man came with a letter to my house—it</p>

               <p>was not the same man—to the best of my belief Fleckart is the man who came with the woman—the letter produced is the same the man brought the next day—he was alone—that letter opened my eyes—I did not take particular notice of that man—I cannot say that either of the prisoners is that man—the man said he would wait for an answer—I declined giving any answer—he asked me to give him something, and I gave him a shilling—I sent my servant for a fly, and I went to town to Mr. Bush's—when I was in the fly another man came to the window and begged me not to go, and said, 'Discharge the coach'—I would not—I do not know that I should know that man again—I cannot say that either of the prisoners is that man—when I got to town I found that the story about Mr. Rush was untrue—I remember the night of the burglary—I first felt something shake my head, and then I heard a noise; I awoke my serrant who slept in the same room, it was scarcely light at that time; I then heard a noise as you let off a volley of guns; I asked her if she heard a noise, she said, 'No;' I did not go to sleep again; I sat up in the bed; my servant did not get up till some time afterwards, and first went up stain and came down again, and ran down the stairs—I heard a scream in the house, and then heard footsteps running up the stairs, as of more than one person—some persons came into my bed room, I cannot say I saw two, but one held my right hand down by my side, and the other held my left hand; it looked like two black dogs jumping on the bed—the men said to me, 'Where is your money?'—I screamed, and they said, 'Will you be quiet' using foul language, and put a hand over my eyes, and pinched my nose, and held my lips, and caught me by the throat, and I could hardly breathe—when they found that, they took the hand from my mouth—they said to me, 'We have killed your servant, and we will kill you, 'and one said, 'Give me a knife, and I will cut her throat—they broke open every drawer and every locked place—there were three in the room, two on the bed and one breaking the drawers—the man on my left side put a rope round my right wrist and then tied my two hands together, and he then passed the rope from my hands to my legs, and tied my legs together—they then tied a handkerchief over my mouth and round my head, and put two pillows over my head, and I could not scarcely breathe at all, and I was everything but dead—I had a silver watch tied round my neck with a tape—they took that watch from my neck—the watch now produced is the same watch, it had a cracked glass in it; it had a common key attached to it with a piece of tape—I had a great many sovereigns in the drawers, I cannot tell how many—I had received on 14th Jan., with Mr. Bush, a lot of money—I put that somewhere in the room—I think I had other money then—I had a silver teapot, and some silver spoons and forks, two gold watches, one diamond ring, and other jewellery—I missed all the money and the articles I have named from the bed room—I afterwards saw that the drawers in the front parlour had been broken open, and I missed three or four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—I had received the notes from Mr. Birch, a tenant of mine, in Grove-lane—I had some gold in the front parlour, in a little table drawer, I do not know how much—I missed that gold also—the lock was broken open of the table drawer—when the men left, in going down the stairs, one of them said, 'That is the day we will come'—my gold watch I gave 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for—I did not touch any of the money I received when I was with Mr. Bush—I have no doubt that Fleckart is the man who came in February with the woman on the Sunday—the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Clapton, and am carman to Barber and Sons, plumbers and house decorators. On the morning of 25th April about twenty or twenty-three minutes to 8 o'clock, or thereabouts, I was driving a pony and van in Springfield, Upper Clapton—I had been on a message—I was coming towards Stamford-hill, out of Springfield—I met two men—when I first saw them they were on the run, but as they approached me they ceased, and came to a walk—they were coming in a direction, from Stamford-hill towards the marshes, in a direction from Mrs. Humphreys'—they were about half a mile from Mrs. Humphreys' house—they were dressed in dark clothes, both of them wearing red wrappers up to the chin—I noticed the men particularly—Fleckart is one of the men—I noticed him particularly, because he so much resembled one of our work<lb></lb>men; one of our painters—I have no moral doubt that he is the man—I saw two other men about eighty yards behind the first two—they came from the same direction, and when they came to the end of the road they hesitated for about a moment, as if they were doubtful which way to turn; they then came on towards me—they walked fast—as they came near me one of the men took off his hat, took a red handkerchief from it, and wiped it over his face; that completely hid his face, so that I could not see it—I believe Horwood was one of the men, but I cannot swear to him—his trowsers were spotted up to the knee, either with whitewash or paint, but I thought he was a painter—the men passed within two yards of me—they all passed me within the same distance, close along side—there was not a soul else about that morning—I am sure that the man I recognized was not the painter I knew; he was at work in the City at that time, at the Alfred Fire Office.</p>

I know the locality about Lea-bridge pretty well—I know the Temple Mills—persons going from Stamford-hill towards Temple Mills would cross over Lea-bridge—the high road from Stamford-hill would take them through Hackney, and that way into London; but when they get to the turnpike at Clapton, turning to the left would take them to Lea-bridge—that is a less frequented road than the high road—as you cross Lea-bridge, the Temple Mills are on your left; that would take them back again nearly opposite Stamford-hill—I beg pardon, it is the Copper Mills that are on the left, Temple Mills are to the right—persons going over Lea-bridge to the neighbourhood of Whitechapel, could go to London without going to the Temple Mills; they could go near the Temple Mills if they thought fit—it is between Lea-bridge and London—I took Fleckart into custody on this charge on 5th May—he was at his own lodging—I told him he was charged with being concerned, with three others, in committing a robbery at Mrs. Humphreys', at Stamford-hill—he said, "Have you any one else?"—I said, "Yes, two men and a woman"—he said, "Good God, I am <hi rend="italic">sold!</hi>"—I said, "You are further charged with going to Mrs. Humphreys' house, with a woman, five or six weeks ago, with intent to commit a robbery"—he said, "Well, if I went with a woman on that occasion, that does not prove that I committed the burglary; I can prove I was ill the day it was done"—I had not said anything to him about the day upon which the robbery was effected, and I made the reply, "I have not said what day; what day are you speaking of?"—I do not think he made any reply to that—I left an officer in charge of him—I saw him again two or three days after—I asked him how he felt this morning—he said, "Very weak"—I said, "You are not able to be moved yet, I believe"—he said, "No; I hope in a few days I shall be able to get on my legs, and get out with you.; and if you will allow me to go with you, I think I can take you to the other parties," or "to find the other parties," or words to that effect—"I think I can take you to find the other parties," those were the</p>

               <p>and went with it to Payton's house—I did not show him the warrant—he was in bed—he came down stairs, and said, "Have you heard anything fresh?"—I said, "Yes, I have, something very serious against you, Payton" I—said, "This robbery that he is accused of at Stamford-hill, there was a great deal of plate and jewellery, and other property stolen, has he left any behind at your house?"—he said, "No, he has left nothing at all here"—I said, "Do be cautious, if I should trace anything, or find anything after this notice, it will be a very serious thing with you, you had better look minutely and see"—he said, "I am quite certain there is nothing here"—I asked him if he saw Slark with any watches at the time he was there—he said, "No"—I said, "Has he given you a watch, or left one here, has he given you one for a keepsake?"—he said, "No, there is no watch here"—I said, "I am informed you had a watch on board the other night that you had never been seen with before"—he said, "Good God! who could have told you that? what will they say next?"—I said, "Payton, I have a warrant to search your house, and I am waiting for the superintendent to come, and no doubt you will be taken into custody"—upon that he paused for a second, and then got up and went out of the room, and went up stairs with his wife, who I believe was at this time in the passage—in about five minutes his wife and he came down stairs; his wife had a watch in her hand, and said, "Here is a watch that I found upstairs, which they must hare left behind"—he said, "You must not take that guard, that is mine"—there was a silver guard to it—I took possession of the watch and chain—I said, "I shall take charge of the guard, if it be proved to be yours, no doubt you will have it again"—I then left—I afterwards went again and searched the house further, but found nothing material to this inquiry—he was taken into custody—I came up to London, and showed the watch to Mrs. Humphreys—it is the same watch that has been produced to-day; it is the watch that was produced before the Magistrate, when Mrs. Humphreys' deposition was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, painter, and glazier, of No. 11, Dunstan-street, Kingsland-road. I know Horwood, he is married to my wife's sister—I know Trowers, he is ray wife's brother—I recollect, last Jan., going to a lodge meeting at the King's Arms, Milk-street, Spitalfields—Horwood was there, he is a member of the society—Fleckart came with him, and was introduced by him as his friend—he called Fleckart <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, and said that his friend <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> was the man for Mr. Humphreys' <hi rend="italic">job</hi> that he could make tools, and was not afraid to use them—Fleckart was within hearing when that was said—I shook my head at Horwood to tell him not to speak in that manner; I did not tell him—I told a police constable afterwards of that—on a Sunday morning, after some parties had been to Mrs. Hum<lb></lb>phreys' house, and an attempt had been made, I saw Trowers—I think it was in Feb.; I went out with him, and said, "I understand Mrs. Hum<lb></lb>phreys' house has been attempted to be robbed, and you know something about it"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I told him I was sure he did know something about it—he then told me that he and <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> (that is Horwood) and <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi> (Mrs. Perkins) met a friend of his at Shoreditch Church, and walked up the Kingsland-rond—he said, "I and <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi> walked up the left hand side, and <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> and his friend walked on the right hand side, and carried the tools; we walked till we got near to Mrs. Humphreys' house, and then we parted; the man and <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi> got into Mrs. Humphreys' house, and me and <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> watched outside; they stopped in, the house for some time, and then they came out, and said that they had not got any<lb></lb>thing; that Mrs. Humphreys treated them so well that the men had not the heart to rob her"—he also said that when <hi rend="italic">Annie's</hi> brother came home, whose name I hear is Slark, he would break into the house if he got down the chimney, or had the slates off the house, or got in through a brick wall, for he was a very determined fellow—I pressed him, of course, to hare nothing to do with such an affair, and so on—a few days, or a week after<lb></lb>wards, I saw Horwood, and he told me the same story as Trowers bad told me, that he, and <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi>, and they all met at Shoreditch Church; but, in addition, he said that his friend <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>, the engineer, was the man that weni, and that he would go through the chimney but what he would get in—I afterwards heard of the robbeiy being committed, and saw Horwoed and Towers together at Horwood's house, in Trafalgar-street, Walworth, about two days after it was committed—I think it was at the latter end of Feb., or the beginning of March, that I heard that the robbery was committed—I told them that the house had been broken into, and Trowers said that <hi rend="italic">Annies</hi> brother and some of his <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> had done it, and Horwood said the same—they asked me whether I knew how much was taken away—I told them I did not—they said that if they saw the tools ihey should know whose make they were, and that what was stolen was far enough in the country by this time—about two days after that I saw Horwood, in the presence of his wife, who is vory deaf; she cannot hear, unless you speak</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the Custom House at Newcastle; I am now living with my daughter, at No. 37, South-street, Lambeth; I am sixty-four years of age; I have been in London five years. Fleckart is my son-in-law; his wife is my daughter—I recollect his coming home with medicine in April last; he showed it to me—it was Thursday, 24th April; that I can vouch for, because he was very bad, and I paid attention to him—I saw some medicine which he brought home; it was leeches—he came home with them, I think, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I understood that he had come from the hospital that day, and I believe there was a letter, but he did not show it to me—he went to bed immediately he came in—he sleeps in the front parlour, and I in the back—his wife was there that night, and she applied the leeches; I did not see them applied, but I was there the whole night—I saw the blood afterwards; that was about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—the leeches were applied immediately he went to bed—I saw a lotion—I can undertake to say that he remained at home, and in bed, the whole of that night; he never went out—I never went to bed; I stopped up to attend him; I saw him frequently, and he was in great pain and suffering—I do not know whether he took a pill—next day, the 25th, he was very bad indeed, and in bed the whole day—he never was out of bed till they took him away—on the 26th he was so bad as to be obliged to send for a doctor; Mr. Gough was sent for, and continued to treat him till the police came and took him away from the house—I am not in the habit of taking a drop too, much—the prisoner was obliged, some two or three weeks before, to assist me up stairs, and he hurt himself, but it was not through drink; I was certainly sick; he was obliged to help me, and I consider that he strained himself—it was some weeks before the 24th that he met with the accident.</p>

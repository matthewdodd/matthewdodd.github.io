                  </hi>. This receipt is on one of our bill-heads—it is the prisoner's handwriting—he was my clerk—in March I did not receive a post-office order for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nor did the prisoner account to me for that sum—George Althans is at the bottom of this receipt; that is his name—it is his business to sign receipts in this way if he entered it in the book and gave me the money—this order is in the prisoner's handwriting, imitating mine—it is signed "A. Duffie," my name—he had no authority to sign orders for the payment of money, but he had authority to send a receipt to my customers, and to account to me for the money in the regular way—he had no authority whatever to sign any document simply with my name.</p>

             I was an officer, and had come to make inquiry about the castors which she bad sent to pledge: I asked to whom they belonged - she said they belonged to a friend of hers; I asked who the friend was, and where they resided - she said they were gone into the country - she did not know where they resided, but she expected they would return in a few days; this was after I had told her I was an officer: on my conveying her to the Compter she gave me another account of how she became possessed of them, and in consequence of that I returned with her to Shipyard, in search of the person she said she had the castors from; I found Marshall there, but Shearston was gone - I asked Marshall what had become of the young man; she said he had gone out of the house immediately - I then took Gray to the Compter: I endeavoured to discover the owner of the property, and advertised it, but could get no information, and on the 11th of October the Magistrate discharged Gray, on her own recognizance to appear when called on; the castors were given over to me, and have been in my possession ever since: I first saw Miss Palmer about a fortnight after Gray was discharged; I was sent for to the Bank, and produced the castors, which she claimed and identified. On the night of the 1st of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw Marshall and Gray walking up the Old Bailey- I said to Gray, "You did not appear according to the recognizance you entered into;" she said, "I did not know what I was to do:" I said, "You have left Shipyard" - she said, Yes; I said, "Where do you now live?" she said she had no lodging; I took them into custody, and the nurse at the Compter searched them - some keys were given to me, which Gray said were hers, and that she lodged at Mr. Smith's, No. 51, Portpool-lane; I went there next morning (Sunday), and found a box in her lodging, which was locked - the keys I had opened it, and in it I found, among other articles, this fan; I asked Gray repeatedly, if she had pledged any thing else, or ever had any thing else - she said she had not, repeatedly: I asked her if the whole contents of the trunk were hers; she said they were; I asked her afterwards about a watch - she denied having had one; I told her I had received information that she had pawned one of the gold watches which were lost - she said she never had; I said, "You had better say you never pledged any of the forks or the mustard-pot - she said, "Yes, I did pawn them;" I asked where she had pawned them - she said somewhere about Fleet-market, she could not exactly tell me the name of the street. On Friday, the 7th of November, Crossley came to the Justice-room at Guildhall, to prefer some complaint, and I took him into custody: I got information, and went to Harrow on Sunday, the 9th, to Northall, to a cottage kept by one Ball, a bay-binder; I saw Ball - he came out of the cottage; I got in at last, but the prisoners were not there - I went into the yard, looked to the left, and saw Shearston just stepping through a gap of a hedge, which led to an adjoining field; I called him, and said, "Your name is Robert Shearston - I want you;" he stood still - I took him, brought him into the cottage, told him I was an officer, and apprehended him on suspicion of robbing the house where his sister was a servant - I did not hold out any threat or inducement to him; he was dreadfully agitated, and said he was very sorry for what he had done, and hoped his poor sister had not got into any trouble; I said, "It was a shocking thing of you to be guilty of such an act, when you were bound to protect the property;" he was so agitated he could say nothing more -I then brought him to town, and on the road he said he had given the whole of the property, except the clock, to some persons whom he named; I asked what he had done with the clock - he said he had lost it: before that I cautioned him not to say any thing which would be injurious to him - on our way to town he wished to see his sister, and saw her at Miss Palmer's; they were both so dreadfully agitated that neither of them could speak; I only heard the sister say, "Oh! Robert, how could you do so;" I took him away directly - he told me he understood the duplicates were wrapped up in brown paper, and placed somewhere for security, but he did not know where; I afterwards found the duplicates at Price's gin-shop, at the corner of Broad-court, Long-acre - I received them from Mrs. Price, wrapped up in this brown paper, which also contained a pair of snuffers and four knives, which have been used.</p>

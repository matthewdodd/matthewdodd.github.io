The prisoner is my uncle; we were formerly partners in selling pens and quills - the partnership ceased three years ago. I had a dispute about his wife's business some time ago, before the Magistrate, but none with him. She, him, my wife, and I, were at Lambeth-street Office together in March; his wife made a charge against mine, which was dismissed. On the following afternoon, about five o'clock, I was in my kitchen, the prisoner knocked eight or nine times; I knew his voice; he called me a b **** and a thief, and threatened me with my life to come up; I went up and opened the door - my child was not with me. I opened the door and as I trod off the wooden step on the stone step of the door, I received a stab on my right side, and as I came off the step I received another in my hand. I had said nothing at all to him; I saw nothing in his hand at any time. After he had stabbed me, my wife picked up the knife - I never saw it in his hand - I struck him with a broom stick which I had in my hand before he stabbed me - it was by the threshold of my door where he stabbed me. I struck him with the broom stick on the head; I was on the ground. I was pulled down, I cannot say by whom, there was so many there - the people came up seeing the scuffle. I do not know how I came on the ground. I went to my father and shewed him how I was stabbed, and then returned home.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get away from where you lay down - A. Three or four people lifted me up, I do not know them. I believe the prisoner ran away. I did not strike him before he stabbed me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. After you struck him did you not both pull off your clothes, and fight for a quarter of an hour - A. No, we did not fight at all, that I swear. We live next door but one to each other.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not you give your wife the knife - A. She picked it off the ground. I never said I would hang my uncle.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you never said that when your uncle struck you and you were going to strike him, that you saw a knife under his coat sleeve - A. I do not know that I ever did. I believe he kicked me when I was on the ground, but I was insensible. I said that a young man who is gone to Brighton parted us.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not call out that you were stabbed immediately - A. I was afraid, because my wife was in the family way.</p>

            . I was standing at my door on the 6th of March, (I live next door to Myers the prosecutor), I saw the prisoner come up; Myers's door was shut; I heard the prisoner call him a b - y b - r, and knocked at the door repeatedly. I saw him put his left hand into his left coat pocket, and making use of very bad expressions all the time - he took out a knife, opened it with his right hand, and put it up his left sleeve - he said he would have his b - y life. The knife fell from his sleeve, he picked it up and replaced it;

             came up in ten or fifteen minutes, and opened the door; the moment he got off the wooden step on the pavement, he pulled his knife from his sleeve and stabbed him; I saw this quite plain. His knocking at the door had brought a great number of people about the door. It is a private house. I am inclined to think he was in liquor, but not so far gone as not to know what he was doing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not your name Cook - A. I have gone by that name; it is my mother's maiden name. I have not seen my husband for twelve months. I get my living as I can. I let a room to three females.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the uncle and nephew fight long - A. I did not stay to see, for when the blood came from his hand I went in doors. I went out again in a quarter of an hour and saw him come out in his shirt and say,</p>
               <p>"Look here how I am stabbed."</p>
               <p>Q. Do you let out a room for unlawful purposes to men and woman - A. I let the room to the women, they do as they please. I saw no broom stick in the prosecutor's hand - a little boy picked up the knife, and gave it to his wife, as she says, but I did not see it. I did not see the prosecutor strike him.</p>

I heard my brother's voice; I called her up to the door; he was speaking loud; I went up and saw my son George open his street door, he lives two doors from me; he opened his door with a broom stick in hand and struck his uncle over his head; he staggered, then he threw the stick down and struck him with his fist till he fell; then my brother pulled his coat off - my son had none on, and they fought for a quarter of an hour. When my son came out he struck him instantly with the stick, and the blood gushed out of his temples. After fighting my brother was taken into his own house and then into mine; he was very bloody. In about a quarter of an hour my son came to my door, and said, he was stabbed; this was the first I heard of it. I said,</p>
               <p>"Why not say you was stabbed before you fought;" he opened his breast and shewed it me, and I did not see a drop of blood, it looked like a wound. My son has said, he would go twenty miles to hang his uncle at any time; and my son hung himself once, about twelve years ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say that when he presented his side to you, there was no appearance of a wound or blood - A. None; I saw a wound but no blood. I cannot tell whether it appeared a fresh wound, there was blood on his shirt, on his back and trowsers; I saw none on the side of his shirt, nor on his breast. I saw no knife.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's sister. I came down the terrace, and saw the prisoner come along; he knocked at my nephew's door by mistake as it appeared; then he looked and went to his own door momentarily, and before he could get rightly to it, George came out with a stick, and gave him a blow at the side of his neck.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Not on the head - A. No. He kept himself up as well as he could, but a hard blow came the second time, and he fell; he got up, pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and they fought away ten or fifteen minutes. I was close to them, and saw no knife; after fighting, the prisoner fell, and George fell on him; somebody took them up.

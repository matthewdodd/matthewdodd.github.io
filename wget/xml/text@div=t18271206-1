On the 29th of October, at near eight o'clock at night, I was coming from Hyde Park-corner to Grosvenor-gate, in a direction to my own home: I was in the Park - it was a moon-light evening; I met a man at the crossing where the road comes out, near the bason in <placeName id="t18271206-1-crimeloc4">Hyde Park</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you make any resistance at the time? A. I did not at the moment, for I was struck with astonishment; he ran across the Park, in a direction for the Serpentine-river, with my umbrella - he had nothing else at that time: I followed him - he ran up by the side of the Serpentine-river, a little beyond the Humane Society's house, and then across the road, and across the grass, among the trees. I followed him to the spot, and as soon as he arrived there he made a sudden stop; I seized my umbrella, and wanted to wrench it from him - he wrenched it also, and broke the handle of it off; he then said he should not let me off in this way, and knocked me down with his fist, and for the moment I was senseless. As soon as I got up I found my clothes literally stripped open, and both my trousers pockets turned inside out - both my waistcoat and trousers were opened. I had had a brown silk purse, with four sovereigns and four shillings in silver in one of my trousers pockets; as soon as I found my pockets turned out I found every thing I had possessed was gone; I had a key of my trunk in my pocket - that was gone; and my pocket handkerchief - I had one glove on my hand at the time, and the other in my hand - that was gone, but the one on my hand remained; I saw the prisoner standing at a little distance from me, and made towards him - he held the umbrella up against me, saying if I attempted to come another step that way he would beat my brains out with the umbrella, and if I did not return the same way as I had come, he would certainly murder me; I was rather frightened at the time, and did not proceed further after him, but saw him go in the direction of Cumberland-gate, round the ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he walk or run? A. He walked away - and as soon as I saw him going away I made the best of my way between the barracks and the green, and succeeded in arriving at Cumberland-gate before he got up; I told the gate-keeper what had happened, and begged him to come out and shut the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the gate-keeper assist you? A. No - I ran to the gate, and shut it myself; I turned my head round, hearing footsteps behind me, and saw it was the man who had robbed me, coming up; I then charged him with the theft, and told him he was the man - he denied it; I said,"You are the man, you know it - you have robbed me of four sovereigns - you have robbed me of my all;" with that he shoved me from him, and ran off back again into the park, towards Kensington-gardens, among the trees; two soldiers came up, and hearing the cry of Stop thief! they ran off, and followed him, and succeeded in taking him - another person came up, and, seeing the exhausted state I was in, came to my assistance - I had fallen down.</p>
               <p>Q. You say two soldiers took him? A. They did - I was then in a very exhausted state, and had fallen down near the gate, and the witness who came up had seen the umbrella drop between me and the prisoner at the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. What, had you a struggle at the gate? A. Yes - I seized him, and charged him with the theft, and he shoved me from him; the umbrella fell from him; he had it in his possession at the time I seized him - it was taken to the watch-house by one of the officers, I believe, but I cannot be certain who carried it, I was so confused; the prisoner was brought back by the soldiers, and taken to the watch-house; one of the witnesses brought my glove to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the person who robbed you before that night, to your knowledge? A. No - I am certain he is the man; I had a clear view of his countenance, for it was moon-light: there are no lamps near that place. I accompunied the soldiers and the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. You are a servant out of place? A. Yes - I had been out of place about three days when this happened; it was rather before eight o'clock when I got into Hyde Park; I went from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060004"></xptr>Hyde Park-corner gate, in a direction for Grosvenor-gate; I had not been at home that evening - I had left home about twelve o'clock in the day - I had been with a neice of mine to school, and then to deliver a message to a friend of mine, who lives near Finsbury-square - I remained with him the remaining part of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure, when you went to see the friend, that you had the money in your pocket? A. I had, and I had my hand in my pocket before I entered the Park gate- I am quite certain I had the money when I entered the Park; I first met the prisoner near the bason, in the road which leads from the gravel-pits: I swear I did not speak to him before he spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live when you were in place, before this happened? A. With Mr.

               <p>Q. Did you ask the prisoner which way he was going? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk in the Park for pleasure, or amusement? A. No; the reason I was going there was that, I had owed a person some money, and was going down to Cadogan-place, to pay it - the person I was going to was

            , who lives at No. 79, Cadogan-place, Sloane-street, with the sister of the gentleman I had lived with; I had borrowed some money of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not as high up the Park as the magazine? A. I was afterwards - I had followed the prisoner there, after he took my umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him about the bridge at the end of the Serpentine-river? did you say you were going there on business, and ask if he was going? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He snatched the umbrella from you then, turned upon you, and stunned you? A. He did stun me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you so insensible as not to know who took the sovereigns? A. He is the man who took my umbrella; I was insensible, but there was nobody else near me; and, as he took the umbrella, I have no doubt he is the man who took the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had you to go up so high in the Park? A. I came through Piccadilly, and, having walked so far, felt myself rather tired, and having promised my wife to return home early, I thought I would defer what I intended to do; the prisoner arrived at the gate two minutes after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he followed you there instead of running away? A. He arrived there after me, but he did not go the same way as me; I was not astonished to see him arrive there, as I saw the way he was going - he could have run another way; he came to the gate in a different direction to that I did; I have reason to think he thought I was gone in another direction.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the gate were several people assembled? A. No, but when I gave an alarm there was - it was not said, in my hearing, that I was making a sham of being robbed, and that I was not robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the umbrella in your hand as you went out of Cumberland gate? A. I cannot say, as I was in a very exhausted state; I do not believe that I had it in my hand then - I will not swear it, but I do not think it possible; I will swear it did not drop from my hand - I swear I had not got it in my hand when I arrived at the gate, for when the prisoner came up he had it in his hand; it certainly did not fall from my hand, because I had not got it. I went with the prisoner to the watch-house; we were pretty near together - I was not at his side; the watchman and soldiers took him along; I did not see him throw any thing away; I have no knowledge of his throwing any gold or silver away.</p>
               <p>Q. You met some friend, I believe, as you were going to the watch-house? A. No - a total stranger to me acted as a friend, and went with me to the watch-house, and afterwards to the office - he did not represent himself as a night officer.</p>
               <p>Q. At the watch-house did you say to the prisoner,"Why did you hurt me? I did not wish to hurt you?" A. No; I said, "You wanted to take the umbrella from me - why did you wish to injure me? I have never done you an injury;" I might have said that also at the watch-house; I had some dirt on my clothes when I arrived at Cumberland-gate; I do not know that any body made an observation about that - they might - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say at the watch-house, that he had forced you against a clump of trees when he robbed you? A. I said he shoved me against a tree when he took my umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear you did not make proposals to him, which caused him to be very angry? A. No, I made no proposals to him; he charged me at the watch-house with making proposals which are quite against my nature, and which hurt my feelings; I had not got the umbrella when I arrived at the gate, but whether it was afterwards given to me I cannot swear.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. After you had lost your money, you say the prisoner walked off towards Cumberland-gate: what direction did you take to get there before him? A. I ran down between the trees, and crossed a little wooden bridge- we went in different directions; I ran as fast as I possibly could; he came up to the gate about two minutes after me, as near as I can recollect, and the umbrella was then in his hand; as soon as I saw it was him I seized him by the collar, and he dropped it on the ground; that was while I was scuffling with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to believe you had the money in your pocket before you entered the Park? A. I was going to pay the money, and I then put my hand into my pocket; I felt the money in my purse, and buttoned up my pocket; I am quite sure I had the purse, with some money in it, in my pocket then, and I had not met a single person from that time till I met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You were knocked down, and made insensible - your pockets turned out, and money gone, and you saw the prisoner standing a little distance from you? A. Yes - he might not be above a yard from me. I concluded he was waiting to see which way I was going.</p>

            . I belong to the Coldstream Guards. - About eight o'clock on the night of the 29th of October, I was at Cumberland-gate, and heard the cry of Murder! Robbery! and Stop thief! which came from the gate, close to where I was standing; I turned into the gate, and ran into the Park; I looked to my right, and saw a man running along by the side of the wall, among the trees - I pursued him - Charles Bruce, a fellow-soldier, was with me; several other people followed him - I gained ground on him- he looked back, and turned to the left; when he saw me gaining ground on him he turned, and said, "Who are you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060005"></xptr>following?" I collared him, and said, "If you attempt to stir I will knock you down;" he said, "Let me sit down a minute:" he had his waistcoat and trousers unbuttoned - he sat down for about a quarter of a minute - he got up, and Charles Bristow* came up to me.*This name is printed Bruce, by mistake, in the preceding page,</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did he give for wishing to sit down? - A. He gave no reason. The prosecutor came up, and said he was the villain who had taken his property - he said,"That was the man."</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say? A. He looked very indifferent indeed, but said nothing; several people wanted to lay hold of him; I said, "If you want to take him I will have nothing to do with him; they let go of him, and I took him- he is the man. I went into the Park on the following morning, and found the prosecutor about twenty yards inside the gate, at a place where the prisoner ran down - Bristow was there, and he picked up a silk handkerchief; I picked up a leather glove and a penny piece - I gave the prosecutor the glove; I found that glove about two yards to the right of where the prisoner had ran the night before; when I found the glove the prosecutor might be about three yards from it. When I first saw him in the Park he was about fifty yards from that place; it was about half-past six o'clock in the morning; I had left the barracks about a quarter-past six.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prosecutor go into the Park the next morning, but found him there? A. No, I found him there; whether he had been to the spot where I found the glove I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where had you been that evening? A. I was taking a walk - I belong to Portman-street barracks. I was standing outside Cumberland-gate, with Bristow, talking to two girls; I heard the cry, it proceeded from a very little way inside the gate; I did not particularly notice what sort of a night it was; I could very well see the prisoner running down by the trees.</p>
               <p>Q. Which trees are you speaking of? A. Towards Kensington-gardens; when I first noticed the prisoner he was about thirty yards in front of me - several people were pursuing him; I did not see the prosecutor, not to discern him; I got up to the prisoner in not more than five minutes- he appeared quite out of breath; he had no umbrella then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to see any thing fall from him, or thrown from him, if it had? A. I did not see it; I was not near enough to him to see it: I was not above thirty yards from him when I pursued him, but I do not say I was no further from him all the time - I had him in sight all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you seized him did you see the prosecutor? A. I might say, in about three minutes - he came up to me; Bristow was the first who came up, and the prosecutor next. The prisoner was not out of my hands till I delivered him to a constable; I did not see him throw any thing away, nor did I search him - he might have dropped a thing carelessly without my seeing him; he was in a most exhausted state, as if he had run three or four miles; the prosecutor was very much flurried, as if the prisoner had knocked him about - he was in a flurried and agitated state- I parted with him in Oxford-street, when I gave the prisoner to a watchman. I did not appoint to meet him in the Park the next morning; I went there to see if the prisoner had thrown any thing away, as the watchman had told us nothing was found on him; we told the watchman we would come up in the morning, and see if he had thrown any thing away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor describe to you what property he had lost at the time? A. Yes, and told us the road the prisoner had taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it as light when you left the prosecutor as when you were in pursuit of the prisoner? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then could he not have found any thing if it was dropped as well that night as in the morning? A. No; there are a parcel of leaves strewed about; they would not cover a handkerchief, but it was brown, the same color as the leaves.</p>
               <p>Q. For what you know, the prosecutor might have been in the Park all night? A. He might; Bristow found the handkerchief: the prosecutor was six or seven yards from him.</p>

            . I am in the same regiment as Welch. I was at Cumberland-gate about eight o'clock on the night in question - I heard a man screaming out Murder! in the Park; I and Welch ran into the Park as hard as we could- the prosecutor said, "Stop the robber!" I at that time saw a man running near Cumberland-gate, among the trees, near the wall, towards Kensington-gardens; we pursued, and Welch seized him; I might be ten or twelve paces behind Welch; when I got up the prisoner was sitting down, as if he were going to ease himself; we brought him up to the watch-house; on the following morning, between six and seven o'clock, I accompained Welch to the Park, and saw the prosecutor there, looking about for the money; we went in the direction we had followed the prisoner, and I picked up a silk handkerchief, which the prosecutor owned- I gave it to him; I picked it up on the place where the prisoner sat down; I saw Welch pick up one glove and a penny piece, thirty or forty yards from the handkerchief, in the direction the prisoner had run; he gave the glove to the prosecutor; I had left the prisoner in the custody of the watchman the night before - I saw him next morning at the office - he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. What sort of a night was this? A. A very moon-light night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other persons running? A. Only Welch and me; we passed by the prosecutor, and overtook the prisoner; we did not go to the watch-house, but gave him into the hands of the watchman at Cumberland-gate; I did not observe his clothes being dirty; the prosecutor's clothes were dirty, as if he had been thrown down; I saw the umbrella in the prosecutor's hand when we brought the prisoner back.</p>

            . I live at No. 9, King-street, Golden-square, and am a tailor and draper. On the night of the 29th of October I and my wife were coming across the Park; I think the clock might have struck eight about five minutes before; we had spent the evening at Pimlico; I walked across the Park, for the benefit of the air, having been confined all day - when we got to Cumberland-gate I heard the prosecutor exclaim, "For God's sake, shut the gate - I have been robbed, and in danger of my life;" he did not wait for the gate being shut, but lifted up the bolt to do it himself, and seeing the prisoner coming up to him, he exclaimed, "This is the villain,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060006"></xptr>or rascal, who has robbed me," and immediately seized him - a scuffle then took place, and the prisoner released himself from the attempted grasp of the prosecutor, and, having on a long great coat, the prosecutor laid hold of the tail of his coat, with a sudden jerk, and I saw an umbrella and hat fall on the ground, from which the umbrella fell I cannot tell, not to be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the result of the jerk? A. The prosecutor fell, and the prisoner ran off towards the barracks, alongside the wall; I was anxious to follow him, and did so, about forty yards, but my wife wished me not - the prosecutor exclaimed, after he got up, "For God's sake, stop him;" several persons ran after him: I did not observe any soldiers then; I remained by the gate, and the prisoner was brought back by two soldiers and the prosecutor - I am sure he is the same man I saw scuffling with the prosecutor; I saw him handed over to the patrol; I did not hear him say any thing then; I said to the prosecutor, in the prisoner's presence, as we were going to the watch-house, "You seem much exhausted, you had better take my arm," which he did - when we got to the watch-house the prisoner said, "You villain, will you take my life?" Luscomb at that time was so much exhausted he was scarcely able to give the charge; the prisoner continued to worry him, and I desired he should have some water, which having been given him he then gave the charge. The prisoner said he would give him all the money he had lost to let him go; the prosecutor said he did not want money, but justice; after that, he said, "I will give you 10l. or 20l. or 30l. if you will let me go - I can easily raise it - I have nothing to do but to send for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that said publicly or privately? A. Publicly, before the constable of the night; the prosecutor said he did not want any of his money, and when he observed,"Would you take my life," he replied, "You would take my life - I want nothing but justice;" the prisoner came before the Magistrate next morning in a different coat - he had observed, when they were about to strip him, that he had nothing about him but a penny and a halfpenny, but they were not found; I saw him searched, but he was not thoroughly searched - his shoes were not taken off; he had a loose great coat on that night, and I believe I have seen that great coat on a companion of his just now, who wanted to draw the soldiers on one side; he appeared next morning in a blue straight coat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you happen to know whether the prisoner was allowed to go at large that night? A. I saw him locked up, and I believe he was kept in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, in a scuffle between the prosecutor and the prisoner, an umbrella and hat fell to the ground? A. Yes- that was the first time I had observed the umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether the prosecutor had that umbrella in his hand before he fell? A. I cannot - I did not see it in the prisoner's possession.</p>

            . I am an officer of High-street, Mary-le-bone. I was at the office at the time this charge was given - what passed was taken down in writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you overhear any conversation between the prosecutor and prisoner at the time they were waiting? A. No. Brown was at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you overhear any conversation between them in the office? A. Not as I can safely swear - I was on duty there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You happened to be the officer on duty there - did you remain in the Magistrate's room while he was examined? A. Yes, but it not being a case of my own, I did not take notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. If any thing had been said, loud enough for every body to have heard it, you would have heard it? A. Yes; Webster was the officer at the second examination, and the glove and umbrella were handed to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say, but that I am innocent of robbery, or any thing of the kind; he knew I had not robbed him - he had been using very bad expressions towards me, and he means, by accusing me, to save himself, by taking me up, and charging me with a highway-robbery: he ran to the gate when I ran after him, and he was stopped by two soldiers, and whatever he said to them they let him go; I came up, and he knocked me down, and he collared me when I came up to the gate.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

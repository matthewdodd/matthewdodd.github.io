               <p>Do you know that box? - Yes, it was sold at my master's the 6th of June, by the prisoner, for two guineas.</p>
               <p>In what manner did the prisoner come into the shop? - He came in and asked me the value of this box, there was a jeweller in the other part of the shop, he said the intrinsic value of the gold might be worth two guineas; I told the prisoner, he asked me if I would give that money for it; I told him yes, I gave it him, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Court. The jeweller told you that the gold was worth two guineas? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you ask him where he got it? - No, I did not; he said he was to sell it: I supposed it was somebody's that had given it him to sell; on the Thursday following, I was sorting of hand-bills, and I saw this where this box was advertised; I looked at the box, and thought it was the same; I carried it to Mr. Bond, at Bow-street, my Lord Milford came to our house, I told him that was the box; I was going to give it to him, but he would not have it till he described it, which he did; that it had a picture of a lady, dressed in orange; he said it was his own, and he took it away: I am sure it is the same box.</p>
               <p>When did you see the man afterwards? - I believe it was about eight weeks after he was taken, I gave the description of the man; I saw him at Sir Sampson's.</p>

               <p>Have you seen him at any time very lately? - I never saw him after he entered Lord Milford's service till I saw him in Tothill-fields; I saw him a little before he entered Lord Milford's service; I always looked upon him a very honest simple fellow, but not very acute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Where did he live before he went to Lord Milford's? - At Sir

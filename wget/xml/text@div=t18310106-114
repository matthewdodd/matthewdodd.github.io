On the 8th of October, about a quarter to three o'clock, I was in the <placeName id="t18310106-114-crimeloc656">George public-house, George-yard, Whitechapel</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know a pugilist called Jack, the Painter? A. No; I have been called by that name, but am no pugilist - I never heard myself called by that name but once; that was by Joshua Hudson; I have been called so by a party belonging to this man, but I never answered to it - it is not my name; I was at the Tennis-court last, four or five years ago, or it might be three years - I will not swear I was not there six months ago; I saw Deaf Burke fight a battle once as I was coming through Hackney, about six months ago - I never fought a pitched battle with him; he knocked me down and I fought him - I do not know whether he is a fighting man; I never saw him before in my life - it was eight or nine years ago that I fought with him; we were both boys - it was at the Red House, at Battersea, that I fought him; there were about four people present when it began - it lasted an hour and a half; I do not know how many were there before it was over; it was not a pitched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060059"></xptr>battle - no agreement had been made about it; I have not seen him since he fought at Hackney, and that is the last fight I saw - I have seen three or four fights at the Red House, at Battersea, as I lived there once; those are all the fights I have seen - I never heard of Mike, the Baker, and never challenged him to fight for a sovereign - I never challenged any body; I have fought at school - I was about eleven years old then; I have not fought since, except when Burke knocked me down - I am not a prizefighter, and never challenged the prisoner to fight for 100l. - I have not said that as soon as this was over I would fight him for 100l.; it is not likely, for he is a prize-fighter- I have played at hustle-cap, (producing his hat) - that is not played at with the lining out, that I know of; this blood in my hat was caused by putting a bird into it when I was out shooting with a gentleman - I believe my wife tore the lining out in a passion; I sometimes play with the lining out, and sometimes with it in - it is always played at with a lining at Abrahams', in Duke's-place, where I was robbed of my money; I never played at any other house -I was robbed of 185l. there; I brought an action for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you play at hustle-cap for large sums? A. Why, they betted me 60l. I never played there but three times - it is called Howard's coffee-house - I was robbed the two first times, and the third I was defrauded of my money - I had been playing at the George three successive days; I was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not at work at hustle-cap? A. I was not playing at hustle-cap at this house - I was tossing halfpence up in the air; the money I was robbed of was given me for a particular purpose - I was never charged with housebreaking; I know Goff and Hall - I was never in their custody; I was never charged with breaking into the the house of Thomas Powell.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in that man's (Goff's) custody? A I do not know, if I say Yes, whether I tell the truth - I was not charged with housebreaking; I was never in custody for a burglary at the house of Thomas Powell - I never was in the custody of Hall or Goff; if I say I was, I tell a story; and if I say No, I tell a story.</p>

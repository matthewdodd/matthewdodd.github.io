                  </hi>. I am the wife of Abraham Hale, a soldier: I get my living by washing, and live in Deane-street. I was passing through St. Giles's on the 24th of February—I had been to draw a little money—I had a union breast-pin, a sovereign, and a half-sovereign—I had been drinking, and got a little intoxicated—I fell down in a passage, and the prisoner picked me up—I said I was very much obliged to her, and I would treat her, and we drank together—about eleven o'clock, as I was going home, I missed my pin—I do not know when I lost it—the prisoner told me to take care of my money—she said she would take care of it, and lock it up—she put it into my bosom, as I thought, but I found three farthings instead of the sovereign and a half—the policeman has got the pin, but I have not seen the money—I came from Hull.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. Giles's. I saw the prosecutrix and the prisoner together, at the corner of Lawrence-street, St. Giles's—they were standing talking rather loud together—I was quite a stranger to them—I stood to listen—I saw the prisoner put her hand to the prosecutrix's bosom and then to her own—the prosecutrix pulled open her cloak, seized the prisoner's bosom, and took out a pin, and showed it to me—the police<lb></lb>man came up, and said, "What is the matter?"—the prosecutrix said, "Nothing now," that she had got her pin, and she did not want to have any more to do with her—they were both in liquor.</p>

About a quarter-past eleven o'clock in the evening of the 24th I was passing up High-street—I saw the prisoner and prosecutrix at the corner—the prosecutrix had her cloak off—I asked what was the matter—she said, nothing, as she had got her property—the prisoner went on a little way—I took the prisoner, and the prosecutrix identified the piece of rag that the three farthings were wrapped in as being the piece the sovereign and the half were wrapped in.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic"> The prisoner, in a very long address, stated, that she and the prosecutrix had been drinking in several public-houses, and when they were about to part, the 'prosecutrix suddenly accused her of robbing her of her pin, but she found it in her own bosom.</hi>)</p>

            . I keep the house where Mrs. Stedley lodges. My wife hearing a noise, told me some body was above. I knew the Prosecutrix was out, so I went up stairs, and the Prisoner was in the room. I asked her, what business she had there? She said, Mrs. Stedley had sent her for something. Said I, How came you to come without the Key? for the door was forced open. I told her, I would keep her till Mrs. Stedley came in. (She threatened me very hard, if I kept on detained her) and when Mrs. Stedley came, she said she did not know her, and had never seen her before that she knew of.</p>

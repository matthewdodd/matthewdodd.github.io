            . I am surveyor of Hyde-park. I went to Fox's house, on the 24th of January, and found these two iron bars, which were taken from the outlet at Hyde-park; and in consequence of what passed, I went to the prisoner's house, in North-street, Knightsbridge - he was out; I sent an officer, who brought him in about five minutes; I asked him how he became possessed of the iron, which was at Fox's; he hesitated, and said he bought them honestly; I asked where, he said of two boys; I said, "Did you know them;" he hesitated, and then said "I don't know;" his wife said "Yes, Rosser, you do know; you had them from young Griffiths;" he said "Yes it was him and another person he did not know - I asked where Griffith's lived; he made no answer, but his wife said, "Just by, in Cross-street, over a stable:" we went in search, but could not find him; I asked the prisoner what he gave for it; he said 1d. for 3lbs., which would be 1s. 10 1/2d. - they are worth 17s. 4d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. As old iron, would it be worth more than he gave? A. It was not old iron; 17s. 4d. is the new price; he went with me to look for Griffiths - the prisoner keeps an old iron shop.</p>

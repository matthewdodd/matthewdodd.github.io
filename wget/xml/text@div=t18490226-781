I live in Church-street, Greenwich, with my mother, who keeps a coffee-shop and lodging-house—on 2d Feb., at a quarter-past nine o'clock, I had occasion to go to the water-closet—I took my watch out of my pocket, and hung it upon a knob in the window—I left it there, and forgot it—I saw the prisoner that morning when he came down stairs, but I did not see him go to the water-closet—I saw him go out—I saw him again the same evening; but before that, I had been to the water-closet, and missed my watch—Mrs. Doughty asked him to come in and have some coffee—he consented to that, and I sent for a constable—this watch was given up to me.</p>

On the 7th of May, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed, and got up - I stood on my landing place, and heard a dog bark - I called to the watchman, and told him to try the door - He said it was not fast - I went down, and found it only on the latch-the watchman was in the house-my till was open, and my back parlour sash-window was wide open-it is on the ground-floor. I lost 4l. 17s. out of my till - I went to bed about ten o'clock the night before, and was the last person up - I left the door chained and bolted, and the window down - I am sure of it, but will not say, that the window was fastened - I did not count the money in the till myself - I saw some papers in it, rolled up - I saw my wife roll the money up in them - I know there was a bank dollar there, and ten or twelve three shilling. pieces, besides some shillings and sixpences. I went round the courts, and met the patrol, and within half an hour after, I went to the prisoner, who lived about one hundred yards from me - He had lived with me once - We found him in bed, and money in his breeches pocket, amounting to 4l. 17s. -4l. was rolled up in papers, and the rest loose;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210018"></xptr>they appeared to be the same papers that my wife had rolled up - I found several bills in my own hand writing, which had been in my hands the night before - They were in his pocket also.</p>

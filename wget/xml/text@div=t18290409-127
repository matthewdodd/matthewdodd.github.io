            . I am a constable, and live at Ball's-pond, Islington. I took the prisoner Shaw into custody on Tuesday, the 24th of March, at Ball's-pond; when I went into the house I told him I wanted him for a robbery in Essex; he said I must be mistaken, he was not the man -I took him to a public-house close by, and then told him I wanted him for a robbery at Hillingdon, near Uxbridge; after I handcuffed him he told me, provided he had been in the country, two like me should not have taken him: I took him to Islington watch-house, and on searching him found two letters in his hat, which I produce - I was going to take him to Queen-square; he said as we went along, that I should be very sorry that I took him; I said, "Why?" he said, "Because I am sure to be hung, and my wife will be transported."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure, that before this, you had not said any thing to him to induce him to state any thing? A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You told him at first you wanted him for a robbery in Essex? A. Yes, that was true; he made this statement next day, going to Queen-square; I had told him I wanted him for a robbery at Hillingdon - I was going along the Strand when he said this; I did not tell him not to say anything.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state this to the Magistrate? A. No, but I stated it to two Queen-square officers immediately I got there; my only evidence was that I had brought him to the office; I produced both the letters at the office - the Magistrate told me to take care of them, and produce them here; I took him on the 24th, and was before the Magistrate on the Thursday week after that: none of the conversation appears in my deposition, that I know of; I mentioned it to the clerk.(The letters being read were as follows:)</p>

               <p>TUTTON'S Defence. Baker says I had the bundles at the time I was at Brentford - does it stand to reason. if I was guilty of robbery I should go there to fight a man, having the stolen property exposed? On the Monday morning I went to ask a man named Weedon for work, his wife said he was gone to Islington - I called on the man whom I was going to work with, went into a public-house with him, and had something to drink: I was with him all Monday, Tuesday, and part of Wednesday - I came home over the bridge to the Six Bells public-house -I and Baker did fight, but I had no property about me, nor was I in company with any other man.</p>

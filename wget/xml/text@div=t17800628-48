               <p>I live in St. Chad's-row, at the bottom of Gray's-Inn-lane. On the 14th of May, at about ten minutes after ten o'clock at night, I was stopped by the prisoner in <placeName id="t17800628-48-crimeloc240">Gray's-Inn-lane road</placeName>

               <p>Was it light enough to be sure to the man? - I really believe him to be the person; I would not wish to swear positively to him. I was stopped by three men. I had seen the prisoner the evening before; when he came into my shop for some eggs. The three men came up with their cutlasses and said D - n your eyes, or blast you, your money. I said, you are joking, you do not want money. They repeated the same again, and struck me on the head with a cutlass, which cut my hat and the shoulder of my coat.</p>
               <p>What sort of night was it? - Moonlight, but over cast. They did not rob me, for my wife and another person who was with me gave an alarm at the Blue Lion and the people there came out to my assistance.</p>

               <p>I was with Mr. Webb; we were walking up the road three men stopped us and demanded our money; while they were with Mr. Webb, his wife and I went and gave an alarm at the Blue Lion.</p>
               <p>Is either of the men here who stopped you? - The prisoner at the bar is one of them.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is one? - I am not sure, I believe he is.</p>
               <p>What makes you believe he is one? - By what I could see of him before he came near us.</p>
               <p>To Webb. Where did you afterwards meet with the prisoner? - I took him on the Wednesday after, just below my house. I saw him the next day with another man, but was afraid to take him then.</p>
               <p>What was he doing when you took him? - Walking about in the neighbourhood where I live. He said, he was serving an execution for an officer in Fullwood's-rents, the morning that I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How came you to take him afterward if you was not sure he was one of the men who robbed you? - I really believe him to be one of the men.</p>
               <p>You took him upon suspicion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. You had seen him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If you had not seen him before should you have taken him up? - Without doubt I should, from what I saw of him that night.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you any idea he was a person you had some knowledge of at the time he stopped you? - I had.</p>

He was a-bed at the time; this was Whitsunday at night; he went to bed between nine and ten o'clock. I called him out of bed to take care of my horse, which was at the door. He put his breeches on and came down and took my horse, and went to bed again immediately. I lay on the ground floor. I am sure he was not out.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - An officer in the court of Fullwood's-rents; he goes out with me to do business. I sent him with an execution to Battle-Bridge the day he was taken up.</p>

I live at the Manor House, East India-road—on 12th April the prisoner brought this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and showed it to me to obtain the money—my clerk was present—I said, "I do not think this is Captain Whitney's writing; I am sure it is not"—he said, "No; Captain Whitney did not write it, but he signed it; I got another man to write it, and he blamed the man for writing it so badly"—he went on to say that Captain Whitney was suffering from severe rheumatism, which I knew to be the case—I said I had men on board the ship which Captain Whitney commanded, could they identify him—he said, "I was not at work on board the ship, but at Captain Whitney's private house"—believing that to be his signature, I ultimately directed Mr. Taylor, my clerk, to give him the money—I had seen the prisoner before—he gave the name of Russell</p>

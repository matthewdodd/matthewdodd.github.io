             sworn. - I was at the corner of Tyler-street, on the 11th of December, about half past eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner, Bowden, pass me, with something like a little box under his jacket; a little time after, I heard of the robbery, and saw him again, and took him.</p>
               <p>- WEATHERBY sworn. - I am a constable: I was sent for to apprehend the two prisoners; I told them they must go before a Magistrate; Bowden hesitated a bit, and then said I might do my worst, for he would not go; he knocked me down several times, and I was obliged to get assistance; I came back again for Acres, and he went very quietly with me.</p>
               <p>Acres's defence. I went to the house to enquire for a man that was quartered there, and she said he was not at home; and we went out to get some steaks for dinner, and came back again to have them dressed; they took away this man, and then they came, in about a quarter of an hour, and took me away.</p>
               <p>Bowden's defence. I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called their serjeant, who gave them a good character.</p>

I keep a jeweller's shop at 128, Camden Road, St. Pancras—on 25th May last I went to bed a little after 11—before doing so I went into the shop myself, and the place was all square and the property there—the following morning I was called by the police a little after six o'clock—I sleep on the ground-floor—I went into the shop; it was all in confusion, and the window stripped—the shop door was shut—I missed 35 watches, 86 rings, and other property, worth about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have only recovered this pair of eyeglasses produced—a square of glass had been taken from the back window which looked into the yard—the shop door had been opened on the inside.</p>

I took the prisoner in charge at Lambeth Police-court—I told him the charge was for committing a burglary at 128, Camden Road—he said, "Oh, you are dreaming"—I conveyed him to Kentish Town—I said, "How do you account for the eyeglasses?"—he said, "I bought them of a man"—he was searched, and nothing was found on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I bought the eyeglasses in the Meat Market. I did not have them till the 12th June, and the robbery was committed some<lb></lb>where about the Derby Day. I left them at the pawnbroker's because I had been sleeping at a common lodging-house, and did not want it known, as they asked for my address. The witness was serving a customer, and did not ask me a question.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the parish of St. Mary's, Newington; on Sunday night, 28th June, my children, my grandchildren, and I went to bed about half past 10 o'clock—the doors and windows were all perfectly secure—I suppose I had slept a bit—I was then disturbed by a noise like the wind shaking the window of the one pair of stairs room—I listened, and I suppose I dozed off to sleep again—after that I heard a knocking as if some one had got a hammer—I opened my eyes and there was a light in the room—I thought it was a stormy night, and that it was lightning—I heard the noise again—I got out of bed and called out, "Mary, there is a noise in the house"—the prisoner Jones ran to me and gave me a violent blow in the face, which stunned me—he was about to strike a second blow, when I caught his hair and held him—I do not know in what part Jones was when I jumped out of bed—I did not see him till I felt him—I hallooed out "Thieves! murder!" and in an instant the policeman was there—he said, "Open the door"—I said, "He will murder me"—Jones was then striking my head as hard as he could—the policeman hallooed out again, "Let me in"—I said, "Mary, Mary, come to me!"—she came in and Jones got away—I do not know whether all the blows Jones gave me were with his fist—I thought it was with a sledge hammer, it was so violent—he got away and ran out—I afterwards saw how the house had been entered—when the servant came I went down and tried to open the street door, but I could not—I set my back against the door—the servant came and opened it—I said, "They are gone out of the back"—the policeman came in and followed them out—my neighbours came and they went out and found a ladder—I missed an old fashioned cellaret which had been in the back parlour, and an old fashioned desk which had been in the front parlour—this screw driver was brought into my bed room, and this knife was found in the house, it is not mine—they were not in the house the night before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to the last witness—on that night, between Sunday night and Monday morning, the 28th June, I was alarmed by hear<lb></lb>ing my mistress scream—I went out of my bedroom to my mistress's room—as I was going, the prisoner Jones met me on the stairs; he gave me a push; he said, "You b—, I will kill you"—I did not do anything; I was very much frightened—he rushed down the stairs—I cannot say whether he went out of the house; he made his way to the back way—I afterwards looked at the back door, and found it open—it had been fast the night before—I found this screw driver beside the bed in my mistress's room.</p>

On the morning of the 29th June I heard cries from Mrs. Richardson's house—I went up and was waiting at the front door—I was admitted and passed through the house—I found the back door wide open—I went through and pushed the water closet door open—I there found this property—there was a ladder at the back window, and the back bedroom window on the first floor was open—I was informed by the last witness that the men had escaped—I scaled the walls of the back premises; as I knew the locality, I thought it was impossible they could escape any other way—I scaled the walls of several other premises, and in the eighth yard I found the two prisoners together, near the back window of a house—I asked them what they did there—they said, "Don't strike us, don't strike us"—they then paused for a moment, and one of them said, "We give ourselves up; we have done wrong; we won't resist"—I found on Jones one key, some matches, and this pocket handkerchief—I found nothing on the other but a handkerchief and a comb.</p>

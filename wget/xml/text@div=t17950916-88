               <p>Q. Did you know this woman before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live with her? - No, I did not; she lodged in a place called <placeName id="t17950916-88-crimeloc499">Church-lane, St. Giles's</placeName>

               <p>Q. What time of the night did you go to her? - About six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went on your duty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she go away? - I cannot say. The girl came up to me at nine o'clock, and asked me where she was? I said, I did not know; the girl asked me if I had any money? I told her I had. I missed eight shillings and sixpence, and my pocket handkerchief; I was sober enough.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew where to find this woman the next day? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew where she lodged? - She told me the present time she lodged there; but I did not know where she lodged the next night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to give her? - She asked nothing at all. I did not tell her about any thing, only went to bed along with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You made some bargain? - Only to go along with her. I had been with her once before in the same house. I told the watchman belonging to the place if he see her to take her up; and so he did. I cannot swear whether it was she or the girl that awaked me took it.</p>

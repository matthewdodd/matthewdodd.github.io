On the 16th of September, in the evening, I quitted my house between seven and eight o'clock; it was between light and dark; I had locked my door, and fastened my windows. I returned at half after nine, and when I went to open the door, I found it opened; I put the key to it, and pushed it open. I went and got a light, and went up stairs; when I went into the bed-room, I found my box was broken open; the window by the side of the box was also open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed what your box contained before you went out - A. Yes; I was at it about five in that afternoon; all was then safe, and I shut it after me. All the articles named in the indictment were in the room; all the things together cost me about seven pounds. I went out immediately, and told the watchman of the robbery. That same evening, Mr. Jackson produced to me a gown and an apron of my property; he first asked me whether I had had a gown with two darns in the back; I told him I had, and then he produced the gown, which I immediately knew to be mine.</p>

            . I am a headborough of the parish of St. George's in the East. On Saturday, the 16th of September, I saw the prisoner, between the hours of eleven and twelve at night, in Cable-street; that is not so much as half a mile from Old Gravel-lane. I observed something under his coat. Knowing him before, I suspected all was not right. I saw him go into an old clothes' shop; I stood at the door, and watched him; I saw him offer this gown to the woman for sale; they could not at first agree about the price; he was about coming out, but he did not; he went back again; they agreed upon the price; I think it was three shillings and fourpence for the gown and apron too: they were counting out the money when I went in. I seized the prisoner, and took the gown and apron off the counter. I asked him where he got them? he said, from his mother's. I told him that was not true for it would not fit his mother; I knew his mother. He then said it was not his mother's, but his sister's. I then took him, and locked him up in the watch-house. Soon after, I heard that a house had been broken open in Crane-court, Old Graval-lane; I went there, and asked the prosecutrix what she had lost? she said, several articles; at last, she said, she had lost a blue gown; this gown was blue. I asked her could she describe it by any thing else but the colour, and then she described two darns, which the gown really has upon the back of it. She described the apron also sufficiently to prove to me, before I shewed them to her. I examined the door of her house, and could perceive that it had been broken open with a chisel or small crow.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home from the Royalty Theatre on this night, and saw this gown wrapped up in an apron, upon the ledge of a window, and I did not think any harm in selling them, and Mr. Jackson came and took me up when I was in the shop.</p>

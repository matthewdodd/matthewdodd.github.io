                  </hi>. I am sister of the last witness. I recollect seeing him serve the prisoner with a pennyworth of spruce on 1st March—my brother went out—I saw the prisoner again in about five minutes after my brother had gone out—she then came for a pennyworth of gin—I served her and she gave me a sixpence; I put it in the till—I observed there was only one sixpence there before that, that made two—I saw the prisoner again in a few minutes, she came for change for a sixpence—I gave her change, and put that sixpence in the till, that made three—I am sure there were only three sixpences there—the prisoner came again in a few minutes, and asked for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy, she put down a sixpence—I put it on one side while I served a gentleman with some beer—I then looked, and found it was bad—I received another sixpence from some sailors; that was good—I did not mix that with the other three sixpences—I pot the one that the prisoner gave me by my side and said to her, "You gave me a bad sixpence"—she then gave me a shilling—I said to her, "I believe you have given me some more bad ones"—she said, "I have not, I will go and ask my husband, he gave it me "—she ran out, I sent a person after her—she was brought back by an officer in a few minutes—I gave the officer the three sixpences out of the till—from the time my brother left the bar till I gave the three sixpences to the officer, no one could have gone to the till—they were the only three sixpences that were there when T took them out.</p>

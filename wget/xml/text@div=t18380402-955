                  </hi>. I live in Mermaid-row, Chelsea, and am the wife of Michael Murray. The prisoner lived in my house six weeks—about twelve o'clock at night, on the 5th of March, I was lying on my bed with my clothes on, waiting for my husband—I had a half sovereign, three half crowns, and one shilling in my pocket—I went to sleep with that in my poc<lb></lb>ket, and awoke at five o'clock in the morning—the prisoner was sitting up in my room when I went to sleep—when I awoke, my pocket was cut, and I could not find the money—the prisoner was gone away out of the house—I found her in a public-house in Jews-row, drunk, about an hour after—there were some more persons in my room—I cannot swear that she took it—I seized her pocket, and found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a rag in it—I knew the rag—it was mine, and had had my money in it when in my pocket—I asked her for my money—she abused me and said she had not had it—I cannot ex<lb></lb>actly swear to this rag—I do not know whether it is the one I had—I told the Magistrate it was—I partly guessed it was.</p>

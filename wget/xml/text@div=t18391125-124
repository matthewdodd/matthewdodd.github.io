Between seven and eight o'clock in the morning on the 11th of November, I saw the prisoner: in Star-street, Paddington, five or six miles from Willesden—I stopped him asked what be had got in the rush basket which be had—he said, "Poultry"—I asked him where he was going to take it—he said to Smith<lb></lb>field market, and that he had brought it from Mr. Tanner's, at Harlesden<lb></lb>green—I found in the basket five fowls, some of them were warm—in one of his pockets I found two more fowls, and one fowl in another pocket<lb></lb>found on him some lucifer matches—he said then that he meta man on the road, who asked him to bring them to London.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant to Mr. John Elmore, who lives in the parish of Willesden. The prisoner came to me on the 10th, in the farm-yard, and asked if I could give him a job of work—I said I should want two men on the Monday, that I should see Mr. Elmore in the course of the day, and if he came on the Monday morning I would set him to work—I saw the hen-house all safe that night, and on the Monday morning I opened the door, and sent a man in to let the fowls out—they all flew out so fast I could not count them, but I knew I had lost some—I saw eight fowls at the station-house on the Tuesday, and they were Mr. Elmore's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a musician, and live at 40, Lower Grove-street, Commercial-road—about half-past 7 on the night of 12th July I came home—the prisoner lodges in the same house—I found him in the parlour—the landlady asked me to play a tune—the prisoner could hear that—I said I would, and I took out my concertina and played "Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye"—the prisoner then said, "You b——Englishman play us some<lb></lb>thing we understand; don't play such b——<hi rend="italic">muck</hi> as that"—my daughter, hearing a disturbance, came down stairs, and the prisoner struck her in the face—she has not been well since—I said to the prisoner, "What do you mean by such misconduct as that?" and then another man there, called "Big Henry," who has gone to Germany, struck me with a knife—the pri<lb></lb>soner threw sand in my eyes, and I could not see, and I was then struck at the back of the head with a knife—my daughter saw the prisoner strike that blow—I could not see—the prisoner went outside and got the sand, then he and Big Henry got me in the passage, and jumped on me, and I was in<lb></lb>sensible, and all over bruises—I was taken to the hospital and could not go to my employment for three weeks—I was bleeding for about an hour and a quarter—I did not strike the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness—on the night of 12th July, between half-past 7 and 8, I was up stairs, and heard my father come in and play on the concertina in the front parlour—I then heard some words, and heard the prisoner say, "Don't play that b——muck; play something we understand"—I went down stairs and stood by the door—I could see the people inside—I asked my father to come up stairs, and the prisoner struck me in the face, and I bled a little just under the eye—my father said to the prisoner, "What do you mean by this conduct?" and then" Big Henry "struck my father on the back part of the head with a knife—the prisoner went outside, got some sand, and threw it in my father's face, and he could not see—the prisoner then struck him, and pulled him down—I did not hear him say anything—he struck my father with a knife on the back of the head, and then he and "Big Henry" pulled him down, and both kicked him—they did not both use the same knife—I did not see the handle of the prisoner's knife; it had rather a large blade—I am sure there were two knives—I went afterwards with my father to the hospital—he was rather insensible.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 27). On the evening of 12th July, about a quarter to 10, from some information given to me by some people who were round Leonard's house, I went to a cooperage at the back—there is a wall between Leonard's house and the cooperage—when I went into the cooperage I saw the prisoner behind a door at the further end of the shed, at the rear of No. 40—he said, "There is the man," pointing over the wall of a beershop next door—I believe he said, "I am not the man"—the cooper who was there said to him, "What are you doing here?" and he said, "I got here for fear the police would take me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the surgeons of the London Hospital—on the night of 12th July the man Leonard was brought into the hospital I dressed his wounds—there were three small punctured wounds on the scalp—they were not done with a pointed blade—the knife could not have had a point; they were jagged wounds—they could have been done with the broken end of a clasp knife—he had bruises on the hip and arm; they would be produced by stamping on him—he was not in the hospital at all—they were not dangerous wounds; they were not produced by a sharp-cutting edge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You would think it was a peculiar instrument that caused those wounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as to sharpness—they might have been caused by the same knife—there was nothing to mark any particular dis<lb></lb>tinction between them—a knife probably would produce them all, but it would not be an ordinary knife.</p>

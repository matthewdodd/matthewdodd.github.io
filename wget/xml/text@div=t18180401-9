On the 4th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, as I returned home I saw the prisoner and three or four others, about my window-it was quite dark-the lights were lit, but the shop-door was open. I went up to the window, they went away; I crossed the street and watched them; I came across again, and caught the prisoner with his hand in the window - I collared him; he was in the act of drawing the thermometer out; he had moved it from the place where it was, but had not got it out of the window. I saw him with his fingers under it. The other boys escaped.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The Court ruled, that the shop-door being open, the prisoner could not be convicted of breaking and entering.</p>

             the 20th of December.</p>
               <p>Did he leave them then? - He had almost murthered me the Thursday before.</p>
               <p>How long did he continue to lodge with you? - Till the 20th of December. He was taken by force by the neighbours the Thursday before, upon my cry of murther! for a quarter of an hour. They thought they could not have got in. I had one finger broke to pieces. He was rescued at Buckingham-gate. I went out of town on Sunday morning, and left the man in the house.</p>
               <p>How came he to quit your lodging? - I was not in town.</p>
               <p>Did he go away of his own accord? - He was taken by the neighbours the Thursday before.</p>
               <p>Was you in the house? - I went about fifty miles off. On Thursday morning I missed almost every little necessary in the kitchen. When I came back he had taken off the upper bar of a large kitchen-grate.</p>
               <p>What else was taken away? - Seven china plates and one very large dish, earthen ware, a very large stone jar, two padlocks, and one key; he took the padlocks off and then the doors were open, and he took the key of the outer door.</p>
               <p>Have you ever found any of these again? - I have seen things I believe to be them; the jar I really saw; the two locks are in court; the rest he has in his possession now at his lodgings.</p>

               <p>That is the prisoner at the bar? - Yes. He told me they were his, he kept them in his pocket a good while; he said that I might have them.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A barber and hairdresser. I shaved and dressed Captain Malcomb at that time.</p>
               <p>Where was it he gave them to you? - In his own lodgings, at this woman's house.</p>
               <p>Where was she then? - Not present at that time; she was I believe out of town. Mr. Malcomb came to me and desired I would come along with him, he had got an order he said from Justice Hyde to break open the door.</p>
               <p>When was that? - I cannot tell what day of the month it was.</p>
               <p>Why was you to break open the door? - He said he could not get into his lodgings.</p>
               <p>What time of day was this? - About four o'clock. I cannot tell the month.</p>
               <p>What time of the year was it? - I think after Christmas.</p>
               <p>Did any body else lodge in the house besides him? - I believe not at that time.</p>
               <p>Was the outer door fast? - Yes it was locked. There was a man answered him out of one of the windows. Mr. Malcomb asked him if he would open the door; he said no. Then Mr. Malcomb said he had an order from the Justice to break open the door. He got a hatchet and broke open the door, and got into his own apartments. Mr.

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050010"></xptr>What was there a constable with him? - Yes, he brought a constable with him. He is here.</p>
               <p>And the constable was by at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He went into his own lodgings? - Yes, and packed up his own things. I helped to move away what he said was his own property, to a room he had got at the Cheshire-Cheese, in Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Were there any china plates taken away? - No, it was all earthen-ware, except one large red earthen dish.</p>
               <p>Are you sure there were no china plates at all? - Yes, I am sure of that, and there was a jar with some pickles in it.</p>
               <p>Did you see the plates and dish in his room when you used to attend him? - Yes, I have seen them, at different times in his room, a month or six weeks before this time.</p>
               <p>Did you see him use them? - Yes, I have; they were in common use.</p>
               <p>Where did these locks come from? - I cannot tell. He knocked one off the street door, when he was locked out once before; the other padlock belonged to the place where he kept his clothes.</p>
               <p>There was a key? - I never saw the key of the street door; I do not know whether he had it or no.</p>
               <p>You said a man looked out of the window? - There was a man whom the woman had left in possession while she was gone into the country.</p>
               <p>Did you stay till the prisoner came from the lodgings and brought the things away? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did that man come down to take care of the door? - Yes, and Mr. Malcomb called in the landlord who owned the house, and said see that I have got no more than my own property.</p>
               <p>Who is the landlord? - He is not here; his name is Groker, he lived next door but one to the house; he was standing at the door at the time the things were moved away.</p>
               <p>How long did you attend the prisoner at the lodgings? - Nine or ten weeks.</p>
               <p>He had been locked out once before had he? - Yes, that was about a fortnight before, I believe.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I was employed as a constable to take Mr. Malcomb up. We went with a warrant to search his lodgings. The prosecutrix said she would swear to that plate particularly. She insisted upon having it; I said I did not know that she had a right to take it without she positively could swear to it. She said she could. I said it was hard to swear to a plate. I took the plate away, and put a mark upon it that I might know it, and it has been in my possession ever since. The landlady where Mr. Malcomb then lodged, attends, and will swear that she bought these plates.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this is a most shameful prosecution.</p>

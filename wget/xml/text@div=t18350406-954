                  </hi>. I am an officer. On the morning of the 1st of April I was on the wharf at Pimlico—I heard a boat come along the Grosvenor Canal—I watched, and saw the boat come along, and the pri<lb></lb>soner in it—he went to the side of a barge, and took some coals into the boat—the boat then went on—I followed him—he went by the side of a barge—I said, "What are you doing?"—he said, "Nothing"—he had the rope in his hand at that time, and dropped it—I took it up, and pulled the boat up—I saw the coals in the boat—I said, "Is this nothing? I saw you take these"—he said, "Say nothing, and I will give you half-a-crown"—I left the boat with another officer, and took the prisoner to the watch-house—he said he was guilty—he said there were four other person on board the barge; but he told me not to disturb them, for, they had nothing to do with it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I went on board the barge at twelve o'clock at night—I was going to see whether it wanted pumping—this officer came on board, and asked what was in it—I said I did not know—he saw the coals in it; but how they came there I do not know.</p>

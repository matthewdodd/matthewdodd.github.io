             sworn. - I saw the prisoner's hand in the man's pocket; I am a lodger; I was waiting in this house, as I do on a Sunday morning; I went up stairs, and when I came down, I saw his hand in his pocket again, but I saw no money taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor drunk? - A. He was rather stupid; he seemed as if he had been drinking that morning, or the over-night.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Boddington) Are you sure you had the money in your pocket? - A. Yes, I know it was the same man, because I saw him going to pick another man's pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you in your pocket? - A. One dollar, three shillings, and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it all gone? - A. Every half-penny, I had not one halfpenny left to help myself.</p>
               <p>Q.When you were sober, did you take the man up? - A. I never saw him after that, till I could learn out his name.</p>
               <p>Q. To Steele.) When you saw this man put his hand into his pocket. what did you do? - A. I told him to leave off; there was nobody in the tap-room at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any money found? - A. Not that I heard of; he was taken on Monday night to Queen-square; I was there; he made me go as a witness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was drinking at the time that the man lost his money; I know nothing about his money; I am quite innocent of the affair; the house that he was drinking in is a house that takes people in from three o'clock in the morning till 12 at night.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be out? - A. I was upon guard.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your serjeant here? - A. No, here is a serjeant that will speak for me.</p>

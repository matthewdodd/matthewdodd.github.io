He saw my master, Mr. Booth, pay me these notes - he is the prisoner's uncle; they were country notes, three of Holdsworth bank, and one Yarmouth. He and I were coming up to London together on the 6th of October, and my master asked him to shew me where the notes were payable; he asked me if he should change them for me - I refused, he then said "If you will let me change them, I will meet you at a public-house" - he left me, I was never at the house before, and do not know where it was, I saw him go into the banking-house, in Lombard-street, but did not see him come out, and never saw him again, till last night - he never gave me the money. He said that he had not got it then - the public-house was not above two rods from the Banker's in Lombard-street.</p>

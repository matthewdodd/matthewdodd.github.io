                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper. On Tuesday the 15th of No<lb></lb>vember I was in company with two ladies in the Strand—in consequence of information I felt my pocket, and found I had lost my handkerchief—it was produced to me immediately—the prisoners were afterwards brought up, but I did not wait to see them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 125.) I was in the Strand between six and seven o'clock, I saw the two prisoners in Oxford-street, and followed them to Strand—I saw Doyle put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, draw out the handkerchief, and run away with it—he tried several gentlemen's pockets before—they were in company together above an hour—I did not see Finch do any thing, but he was so situated that he must have seen Doyle trying, because every now and then he hung back, and Doyle took hold of his hand, and pulled him up to the gentlemen several times—while Doyle was taking the handkerchief, Finch endea<lb></lb>voured to hide him—another officer took Finch—I did not see whether he stood still as I ran after Doyle directly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who was the person that was to hide the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Finch—I did not tell the Magistrate that I saw Doyle try several gen<lb></lb>tlemen's pockets that I know of—I might, or might not.</p>

I was with Gibling—I did not see him take Doyle—he ran after him—at that time Finch was running away—I ran across to him, and then he stopped—I laid hold of his arm, and ran up to the prosecutor, and asked if he had not lost his handkerchief—Finch said nothing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live with my father and mother, at No. 3, Old Justice-court, Harrow-street. I know the prisoner—I lived near her—on Monday, 4th Sept., I was at her house from morning till night—I saw her with the child in the evening—she went out of the room, taking the child with her into the back kitchen, about 10 o'clock—in a few minutes her husband told me to go and see where she was—I went, and found her in the back kitchen, and the baby lying on the stones—it was dressed—I said to her, "Pray, Mrs. Harrington, pick the baby up; it will catch cold and die"—she said, "No; let it lay and die, and I will be hung for it"—I did not offer to pick the child up—I went back, and told her husband—she came after me in a few minutes, carrying the child with its head under her arm, and her hand under its feet—I left at 12 o'clock that night, and went again next morning about 8 o'clock; the prisoner was then sitting on a chair with the baby in her lap, in her own room—they have but one room—I did not say anything to her—she went out of the room a little while after I went in; her husband's brother and two young children were in the room—after she had left, we all went to breakfast, and she returned after breakfast—she had been out nearly an hour; she was carrying the baby in her arms, and it looked very black in the face—she said to her husband, "I have done it, I have done it!"—he said, "What have you done to the baby?"—she said nothing to that—he said, "Let me take it to the doctor"—she said, "No, I won't; I will take it myself," and she went out with the child—I saw her after<lb></lb>wards when she came back, in about half an hour—she was then sitting in Mrs. White's room, and had the baby in her lap—I went out on an errand, and when I came back she was in her own room with the baby in her arms—MR. Harrington's aunt and sister, and another old lady, came, and then she got up and went away with them—I saw the child about 11 o'clock, lying on the bed, it was then very black in the face.</p>

                  </hi>. I occupy the first floor front room, at No. 5, Harrow-street, in the Mint, the same house as the prisoner; she lived in the back room. On Tuesday, 5th Sept., while I was at breakfast, the prisoner came into my room—she had the baby with her—she was very dejected, she said she was very poorly—I asked what was the matter—she said that she had been up all night, owing to her husband's brother sleeping there all night—I gave her some tea and bread and butter, that seemed to revive her, she seemed better after it—she stayed about twenty minutes, and then left the room—she said she was going to the doctor's somewhere, she did not know where—she returned in an hour and a quarter afterwards, and came into my room—she appeared much more distracted, and worse than when she came in first, and the baby appeared quite different—I said, "Mrs. Harrington, what is the matter with the baby?"—she said, "I have given it laudanum "—I said, "How much have you given it"—she said, "Half a tea spoonful"—I said, "That is too much for a baby, how many drops were there?" she said, "Three or four"—I saw that the baby became worse and worse, and I said, "We had better take it to the doctor "—she said, "Yes, do "—a friend of Mrs. Harrington's was there, and we took it to Mr. Rendle—it was not dead then, it died on Thursday morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eleven weeks—I have a family of my own—the prisoner has two other children—she has always behaved in the most affectionate manner to them, like a good mother—she treated this infant very kindly indeed, as much so as any mother could wish—I have never seen anything about her to lead me to suppose that she was of an unkind temper to her children or anybody else—she was washing, five days after her confinement—it is very dangerous to get about so soon as that—she seemed very wild when she came into my room on this Tuesday morning—that was seventeen days after her confine<lb></lb>ment—she suckled this child—it would not take the milk for the first week—when the infant does not take its milk properly, it very often flies to the head of the mother; it did in this case—from the time of her confinement till this happened, I do not think she was in her right senses—when she had taken some tea, and a little bread and butter in my room, she said she was going to the doctor's with the child—I do not think it had taken any laudanum at that time; it seemed perfectly healthy—it was a very small baby, but very healthy in appearance and manner—when she came into the room again she said, "I have done it!" and she came in like a wild person, like a person bewildered, not in her right senses—I said, "What have you done?" and then she told me—I really do not think she was in her senses—I do not believe that mothers accustom themselves to give laudanum to their children, unless a medical man mixes it for them—the prisoner appeared wild and strange in her manner ever since she got up to the washing, not like a domesticated mother or wife, not like she was before—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at No. 33, Bridge-house-place, Newington-causeway. On Tuesday, 5th Sept, a child was brought to my house to be examined—it was a male child, about a fortnight old—it appeared to be thoroughly narcotised, and nearly dead—I administered some medicine—the prisoner was not there—I sent the child home after giving it some medicine, and then followed—I saw the prisoner, and said to her, "I fear, Mrs. Harrington, you have poisoned this child "—she said, "I hope not"—I said, "What have you given it; have you given it laudanum?"—she said, "I don't know"—I said, "Where is the bottle that you gave it out of?"—she began to look for it—a bottle was given me, and she identified it as the bottle—I said, "There is no laudanum in this bottle"—she said it had had some wine in it since; which was the fact—the child did not appear to revive, and it was taken to the workhouse—my assistant attended it that evening, and I attended till the death—it died early on the Thursday morning—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination by order of the Coroner—the external condition of the child was in no way injured—all the organs of the body, except the brain, were thoroughly healthy—the brain itself was congested, and the membranes covering it were full of blood—the centre and base of the brain also had a very large quantity of serous fluid—connecting those appearances with the symptoms I saw during life, I have no doubt the child died from the effects of a narcotic poison—I should say that that appearance of the brain is common in infants who die from apoplexy, or some disease connected with teething; but tracing it from the beginning to the end, I should say in this case it was the result of a narcotic poison—there was nothing in the brain itself to induce me to suppose that a narcotic poison had been used—I could not detect any by analysis, nor any in the stomach by analysis—the effect of a narcotic poison</p>

               <p>is to produce an extra fulness of the blood vessels of the brain, and that causes the watery part of the blood to escape from those vessels; they can hold it no longer—I did find those appearances—I found no poison at all in the stomach—the child might have died from the effects of a narcotic poison, and yet no traces of it be discovered in the stomach—there was a period of forty-eight hours between the administration and the death, and it would most likely have been absorbed into the system—I have admi<lb></lb>nistered laudanum to children of that age, but I never ventured beyond the tenth part of a drop—I think a drop might be fatal; it has been fatal—I have been very often obliged to leave off giving it to children when I have given only one-tenth part of a drop, on account of untoward circumstances; that is, they appeared stupified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The appearance of the brain was very much like what it would be in serous apoplexy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly the same—the serum had been extravasated from the blood vessels, and was collected in the centre of the brain—that is exactly the appearance of sanguineous apoplexy—if I had known nothing of the circumstances of the case, I should have said the child had died from sanguineous apoplexy—children are very sub<lb></lb>ject to convulsions, proceeding from bad milk, or anything of that sort—in such a case, I should quite expect to find the appearances I have mentioned, but the order of circumstances previously would be different—a child would be convulsed before it became stupified, here it was stupified first—I saw the child when it made in my surgery what appeared to me to be the last gasp, and I did not expect to hear any more of it; that was on Tuesday, but it did survive till the Thursday—within a second after I looked at the child, it ceased to breathe—I looked at it for several seconds more, and there was no sign of breath at all—I dipped my finger into a little ammonia, that being a powerful stimulant, and applied it to the mouth two or three times, and there was not the slightest sign of life—I then supposed it to be dead, and directed it to be taken home—it was not rigid—I followed the child with my assistant; it was still in the same condition, in a state of perfect coma—I put my ear and my face close to the child, but did not perceive the least sensation of anything like breath—I did not try a glass—I applied the ammonia simply to detect whether life was present, and to excite it if there was the least effort at recovery—it could not swallow—if I had given it anything, I should have destroyed the last remnant of life; it would have remained in the throat—I administered medicine, wine, and various stimulants, but no emetic—it vomited without—an emetic would only unnecessarily disturb—it did not vomit until all the laudanum, I be<lb></lb>lieve, had been absorbed into the system, and produced these narcotised effects.</p>

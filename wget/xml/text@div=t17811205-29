               <p>On Saturday, the 17th of November last, in the evening, as I was minding my business in the shop, a man came to ask the price of a waistcoat, I took it to the counter, in the shop, with two or three others, and shewed them to him. In the mean time, as I was shewing this waistcoat, I had not been gone above two or three minutes before there was a cry of somebody has stole your cloaths.</p>

               <p>Did you see her drop it? - I was close to her.</p>
               <p>You picked it up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it your's, is it the same great coat? - Yes; here are the marks in the coat, where she pulled it off from the hooks.</p>
               <p>Is it the same coat, has it been in your possession ever since? - It has.</p>
               <p>Was it your great coat? - It belongs to the partnership.</p>

               <p>Where was it hanging before it was taken? - It hung at the shop door.</p>

               <p>I was coming up Holborn the same evening, and I saw a woman snatch a coat that was hanging at Mr. Butler's door.</p>
               <p>Is this the same woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see her pursued and taken? - I saw her throw down the coat.</p>

               <p>I never took the coat; I was going up Holborn to Mr. Lane's, a pawnbroker, to get a gown which I had in pawn, and I was stopped; I don't remember what they said to me, I was in a great flurry. I never took any thing in my life, nor never was accused before.</p>

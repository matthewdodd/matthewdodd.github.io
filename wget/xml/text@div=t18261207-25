            , pawnbroker, High-street, Kensington. I know the prisoner. On the 30th of October he came into our shop, between five and six o'clock in the evening; I had never seen him before; the shop was lighted with gas - he offered a chronometer in pawn; he was about ten minutes in the shop - I asked how much he wanted on it; he said, 1l. - I asked where he got it from, as that was a very low value; he said he gave eight guineas for it, eight years ago, and bought it of a groom, who was his fellow-servant; but he did not want more than 1l. on it, as it would be easier to take it out again - that his name was Samuel Clarke, and he lived at No. 5, Turnham-green, in a gentleman's service - I said he might have had a great deal more on it - he said he knew that he could have more on it in town - I gave him 1l., and it has been in my possession ever since: I should think he was ten minutes in the shop; I am quite certain of him.</p>

On Monday, the 6th of November, I received information from the housekeeper, and upon searching the house, missed a chronometer, which had been kept in a drawer in my bed-room, with my confidential papers - the drawer was locked as usual - I missed nothing else; the box of the chronometer was left; it is worth fifty guineas; it was made on purpose for me - I had not been to the drawer for a month, therefore had not seen it for that time - I am certain the one produced is the same; I have had it ten years, as a Captain in the Navy, to ascertain the longitude; I know the number and the maker's name, Earnshaw - the key which is now to it is mine, but not the ribbon.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house on this charge - I said nothing to induce him to confess; he said voluntarily that he had taken the chronometer and pawned it at Kensington - I asked him where the duplicate was - he said I should find it in the lining of a sedan-chair over the Captain's stables; I went and found it there; here it is - he also said there was a waistcoat of the prosecutor's at his mother's, at Brook-green - I went there the next morning, and his mother gave it me.</p>

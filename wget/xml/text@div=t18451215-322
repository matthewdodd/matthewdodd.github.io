                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker, and live in William-street, Woolwich. These watches, which the prisoner sold to Brown and Whealon, are very common indeed, as common as could be made—they will not do the work of a watch in any way—they are of no use—this one is run down now—it would just go while he could sell it, and no more—it would cost about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. making—the valuable part is the case, which would fetck above 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is a pretty neat looking watch.</p>

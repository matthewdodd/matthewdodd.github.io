I was going by Mr. Davidson's in the morning, and they called me, and asked me if I wanted work, I said, yes; when I went in, they had plenty of men, and did not want me; I stood a little while, and there came in a waterman, and asked for a bag of biscuits; I asked him if he wanted any body to carry them for him; he said, yes, he would give me threepence; and just as I had got them up, they came after me, and took me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who was it that delivered the bag to the waterman?</p>

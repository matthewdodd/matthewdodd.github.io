                  </hi>. I live in Montague street, Russell-square. About twenty minutes after three o'clock, last Saturday, I was walking in Montague-street, arm in arm with my cousin—I was walking on the side next the houses, and felt some person touch me—I turned round, and saw a person, not the pri<lb></lb>soner—I said, "What are you doing?"—he made some reply—I saw some other person coming—I turned ray head to that person, and did not see which way the first person went—I had a brown silk purse in my pocket, on my right side next the houses, containing a half-sovereign, and the other money stated—I spoke to a gentleman that I saw, and in two or three minutes the prisoner was brought back in custody—I did not see a second man besides</p>

                  </hi>. I was walking with the prosecutrix in Montague-street, about half-past three o'clock—she stopped suddenly, and I heard her say, "What are you at?"—the person she spoke to said, "What do you mean? I am doing nothing"—just at that time I saw a brown purse on the ground—the prisoner stooped, picked it up, and ran away—when he started, I saw a shorter person with him, and they both ran away together—the prisoner was brought back in two or three minutes—I immediately recognised him as the person who picked up the purse—I am certain he is the person—he had run round the end of Montague-street, crossed the road, and went towards Bury-street—I there lost sight of him—we were about half-way up Montague-street when this happened.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw the man that your cousin spoke to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not turn to see who she spoke to, my attention was so taken up with looking at the prisoner—I did not see another man at the time—while my cousin was speaking to the other man, the prisoner was staring us full in the face, so that I could not help seeing him—there was nothing to prevent my cousin seeing him that I know of—the prisoner was standing behind me—I turned round when I heard my cousin speak—he was not at my side, but at the side of my cousin, somewhat behind her, and I have no doubt that he is the person who picked up the purse—I had scarcely lost sight of him before he was taken, only when he crossed the road for a minute, but I followed, and saw him in custody.</p>

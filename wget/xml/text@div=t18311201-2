My gelding grazed on the forest, not in an enclosed field - I saw it safe on the 20th of October, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and missed it about half-past five that evening; I did not know the prisoner - I found him the next day, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, in Smithfield-market, with my gelding; he had got it in a halter - I asked how he got it; he said he was selling it for a man named Williams, but gave no further description of him; no Williams came forward to claim it; I took him into the public-house, and gave charge of him - he said nothing more than that he was selling it for Williams; I am quite sure it is mine - I have had it four or five years.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in charge; I asked him where he got the pony - he said a man named Williams had hired him to sell it for him; I asked him where Williams lived - he said he did not know- that he was an entire stranger to him, but he had slept with him the night previous at a public-house in Kent-street; I asked him what Williams was - he said a hawker, and that he himself was also one, but he had had nothing to do for the last three months; I asked where Williams was to be found - he said he did not know, but he expected to meet him at Liverpool, to give him the money, and that he was gone there to ship some goods; on searching him I found a toll-ticket of the Bermondsey gate, dated the 21st of October.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Williams is a man I know very well, and I have worked with him many times. Witness. I am quite positive he said he only knew him by sleeping with him the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I slept with Williams at the Royal Oak, Kent-street - he said he had a horse for sale, and knowing me to be out of employ he asked me to go to Smithfield, and sell it for him; he told me to lay out the money in goods, come to Liverpool, and meet him where the mail-coach starts for London.</p>

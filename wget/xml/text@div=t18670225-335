                  </hi>. I am a letter carrier, of Russell Street, Sydenham—I was present when the prosecutor's cart was upset—the contents went on the ground, and I saw Terry pick up a parcel and put it under his arm—he stood by my side about a minute or a minute and a half, turned quickly round, went across to Francis, who was in a cart, and gave it to him; he put it in the back of the cart and covered it over—I made a communication to Potter, went with him, and called Terry twice—he turned round and said, "What parcel? I have no parcel"—I said, "That will not do for me: you have a parcel in that cart"—he called to Francis, "Heigh! give me that parcel"—Francis then handed the parcel out of the cart to Potter, and said to Terry, "You knew the parcel did not belong to you"—Terry said, "I was going to take it to the owner"—when Terry found that Potter had got hold of his arm he owned to it at once—a con<lb></lb>stable came, and he was given in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far was the cart Francis was driving from the place where the parcels were upset? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than fifteen or twenty yards straight across, it is a very wide road—Francis was forty or fifty yards off when Terry called, driving slowly away; if a person was sitting in the cart with his face to the horse, his side would be to<lb></lb>wards where the parcels were lying in the road.</p>

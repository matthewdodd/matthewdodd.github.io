                  </hi>. I am the wife of Bartholomew Maloney, and live in Moor-lane, East Ham. On the 1st of January I hung a shirt out to dry near my door—I went to a neighbour's, about four or five hours after<lb></lb>wards, to look for it, and could not find it—I saw it again last Friday three weeks—this now produced is it—I know it by a stain in the corner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 30.) I went to the prisoner's house on the 14th of April, in consequence of information—I asked her to produce a shirt, which she did—the prosecutrix said it was hers—the prisoner said it was her own property—I asked her how it came her pro<lb></lb>perty</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184205090200"></xptr>
               <p>—she said she purchased four yards and a half of calico, at a shop at Stratford, at 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a yard; that she made a shift for her child out of that quantity, and put the remainder into the shirt—I have measured the shirt, and there are five yards in it—the prosecutrix said she made two shirts at one time, and I have compared this with another shirt she gave me, and they seem to me to correspond—I went to the shop at Stratford where the prisoner said it was bought—they said that was about the price of calico, but they could not say who they sold it to, as they sold such a quantity of it—the prosecutrix pointed out this mark on the shirt before I found it—it is an iron mould, and will not wash out.</p>

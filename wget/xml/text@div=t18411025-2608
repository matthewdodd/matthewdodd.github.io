                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 9th of October, I was in the Chalk-road, Battle-bridge, Islington, between five and six o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner standing within a few yards of the Sutton Arms public-house, having hold of a man by the collar, shaking him—the prisoner appeared to be intoxicated—I went up and told him to leave go of the man, which he did—I said he had better go home, or I must take him to the watch-house, and lock him up—he said he would not go home, nor yet to the watch-house either—I then talked to him quietly, telling him to go home, and got let a mob get round him, laughing at him—there were persons assembled around him—I then took him by the collar, and dragged him towards his home, as they told me it was not far off, just</p>

               <p>above—after I dragged him a few yards, I let go, and talked to him quietly—he walked a few yards by himself, and then said he would not go any further—I took hold of his collar again, and dragged him towards his home, as they told me, and a man came down, a neigh<lb></lb>bour of his, and accused me of ill-using him—I said I had not, and it was no business of his—the prisoner at this time got from me, pulled a pistol out of his right-band pocket, cocked it, and presented it at me—as he was going to pull the trigger, I struck him in the breast, and he fell, and as he fell, he pulled the trigger, and it went off, but before he pulled the trigger, he said, "D—n you, I will give it to you"—he was felling down as it went off, and after he fell, and got up again, he said, "Yon would have had it safe enough, if you bad not knocked me down"—I then sprang at him—the witness said I had better search his pocket to see if he had any more—he said, "I have not got any more about me," but I found another pistol in his left-hand coat-pocket, loaded with two balls—I took him to the station, and drew the charge from the pistol.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in partnership with John Gould<lb></lb>smith, of Qloudesley-terrace, Islington. I know the prisoner, and have visited him professionally—I remember, among other occasions, seeing him, on the 24th of April, in consequence of what had been represented as a severe fall—I went to visit him since, but had great difficulty in seeing him—I have considered him in an unsound state of mind from the 8th of July last; indeed, from the 24th of April I did not think his mind sound—on the 24th of April he was living in William-street, Chalk-road—I found him at that time flushed; he appeared to have been drinking; we entered into conversation; he was hurried; he appeared to have a great number of projects in his mind, and told me boastfully of the money he had made and could make from his secrets—I mentioned to him that there was a Frenchman in London who said he had the power of producing a blue dye without the use of indigo—he appeared to catch at that circumstance, and in a moment he said, "Oh, I have got it, I have it; that is worth a thousand pounds to me; thank you; I will make you a handsome pre<lb></lb>sent"—he appeared in an excited and hurried state—I should say it was inconsistent with the liquor he had had, but arose from something more—by the request of his relatives I saw him, on the 8th of July, in the place where he resided, within a door or two of his mother's—it was a coach-house and stable, surrounded by a wall—his sister accompanied me to the place—she knocked at the door—he asked who was there—she said, "It is me Charles"—he then cautiously opened the door, and she said, "Mr. M'Crea has come to speak to you about my mother, who is very ill"—he replied, "I don't want to see him, I shan't see him," shutting the door in</p>

               <p>my face, which I prevented by putting my foot between the door and the cill—he then became very violent, took up a post or piece of timber, and said he would knock my brains out if I did not leave instantly, and I left—I had given him no reason for conducting himself in that way to me—he would not let me in—I saw his relatives afterwards, and expressed my opinion of his state of mind, and recommended that he should be put under confinement—I was prepared to certify that that was necessary—on Saturday, the 9th of this month, I saw him at the police-station, Islington-green—he was lying on the floor in a state of hysterical insensibility, and partly drunk—I could form no judgment of him then—I left, and returned in about an hour and a half—he was then sitting on a bench, and the mo<lb></lb>ment he recognised me he got up in a violent rage, struck at me and kicked at me—if it had not been for the police he would probably have injured me—next morning, about nine o'clock, I visited him again, accompanied by Barlow—for caution's sake, Barlow was first sent in to him—I placed my<lb></lb>self in a position out of sight of him, but where I could hear what passed—Barlow said that his mother and sister were greatly distressed, and had mentioned something to him about a conspiracy—he replied quickly, "They are at the bottom of it; I know all about that, but I have tricked them"—he said, as soon as he got out he would settle matters with that brother of his—I then advanced towards the door, spoke to him through the grating of the door, and asked him about the conspiracy—I said, "Your mother and sister appear greatly distressed that you should have such an idea"—he said, "I know all about it, and know what you are come for, and you may take your leave"—I then asked him what had become of the bottle of prussic acid which he had had in his pocket—he said, "What do you know about the bottle of prussic acid?"—I said, "Because you asked for it last night"—he then very cunningly said, "Oh, oh, might I not have something else in my pocket in a bottle besides prussic acid?"—he was agitated and irritable, and I took my leave—I observe a twitching and irritation about the nerves of his face now—I have not had opportunities of observing it before, I have had so few opportunities of seeing him—I have been in practice thirty years, and have had several cases of unsound mind—in my judgment he is not accountable for his acts, because he is labour<lb></lb>ing under a state of unsound mind.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 280.) I have been stationed at Islington. In July last, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner at William-street, standing at a gate in front of his house—as I passed by, he said he expected there was a quantity of fellows coming down from a part where there are a lot of cottages in the field, he called it the island, that they were coming to attack him, and pull down his house, and he expected they were going to abuse him, and duck him in a pond—he said they were coming in a body, and he expected them that night—he asked me to send for assistance to the station, that it would require five or six men, because he expected they would overpower one or two—I endea<lb></lb>voured to calm him—his brother came out in the course of the conversa<lb></lb>tion—a brother policeman came up—I remained some time to see if any<lb></lb>body came—there was no appearance of anybody coming, and never such a thing projected, I believe—I communicated to my brother constable what I thought—I remained on the beat till six o'clock in the morning—I was on the same beat till the end of August—there was never any ap<lb></lb>pearance of anybody going to hurt his house—I have talked to him several times—he seemed to me to be labouring under the delusion of somebody going to attack him—he talked about a man named Lowe, a law-writer, and a respectable person named Crouch, and about a law-suit, and when I reasoned with him about his suspicions, he said I was as bad as them—he asked me to go a little way from home with him the following morning, to see him safe from home—I said I would—I went more out of curiosity than anything—he called a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and I rode half-way to Smithfield with him—he said he was going on different business—as we went along, he talked about the combination against him, and said he would purchase a remedy while in town to-day, that he should not require the assistance of the police any more—I asked him if a man attacked him, should he con<lb></lb>sider himself justified in shooting him, and he seemed to think not in that case, but said he should have some remedy which would end the dispute—I could not make out what it was—I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> before he made any purchase—he told me once that he had lost a spaniel dog, and he ex<lb></lb>pected it was in the island where the people were combined against him—he has several times stopped me, and mentioned the conspiracy to me—one night in August he said he would have a law-suit against the parties combined against him, that he would get an action against them, that he had plenty of money, and he could soon settle them—I consider it was a delusion, as I knew the people he referred to, and I had spoken to them—I reasoned with him about it, that they had no idea of doing him harm, and then he said I was as bad as them, and he thought I knew something about it, he thought I was in the conspiracy, and had been bribed or something—I should say he was labouring under a delusion—I considered so from the first time he wished me to send for a constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gaoler at the Police Court, Hatton-garden—the prisoner was in my custody on the 11th of October, he conducted himself in a very strange manner—he said he was sure his beer had been drugged, and something put in, but he was sure the witness Winslow had</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I live in Harley-street. I have been called on professionally to visit the prisoner, with a view to form a judgment of the state of his mind—I saw him twice in Clerkenwell-prison—the first time was on the 19th of this month—I was with him about twenty minutes, endeavouring to detect whether he was of sound or un<lb></lb>sound state of mind—I was quite satisfied he was of unsound mind—he conversed with me very irrationally—I have no doubt it was his genuine conduct.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were his delusions of a particular sort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he said he was afraid of a conspiracy, of persons annoying him, two par<lb></lb>ties especially, named Dodd and Winslow—that he had heard them speak<lb></lb>ing of him under his window, and they were determined to have him out of his bed, and he had barricaded his house against them—that he heard them speaking up the chimney, and heard them repeatedly on the roof of his house, and he had had henbane and hemlock put into his beer by his mother—he was full of delusions and fears—on the second occasion, he told me that at times he thought himself the murderer of Mr. Zachary Turner, of Exeter, and that at times he thought his head was on the wrong way, his forehead behind.</p>

On Wednesday evening, the 17th of February, I had occasion to go to my stables - my mare was then safe; I went again on the following morning, about five o'clock, and she was gone - I went to Northampton, gave information at the Police-office, and circulated hand-bills. I saw the Times newspaper on the 22nd of March, and in consequence of an advertisement I came to London that night; I went to Queen-square office next morning, and found my mare in Hutchinson's stables, Princes-street, Westminster, and knew it to be mine - it is worth 25l. or 30l.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the 20th of February I went to Hutchinson's stables, on business - he showed me a mare, and after waiting two hours Lamb came there; I took him into custody, and went with him after the prisoner to the Nightingale stables, Catherine-street, Paddington, but did not find him there - I left Lamb there with a brother officer, and took Taylor, the ostler of that stable with me to look for the prisoner; we went to Adam-street, Marylebone, and saw the prisoner there - the ostler pointed him out to me; I went and asked if he had authorised a man to sell a mare for him, and for how much - he said he had authorised him to sell the mare for 30l.; I asked if he had authorised him to sell it for more or less than 30l. - he said he desired him to sell it for what he could get; I asked where he got the mare from - he said he brought it from a village on this side Birmingham - I said I must take him into custody on suspicion of stealing it - he came very quietly with me till we got to the gate of the Nightingale stables, and by some means he gave me a trip, threw me down, and started away; two or three other men there endeavoured to keep me down while the prisoner made his escape - I had my hand dreadfully cut, and also my knee; I hallooed Stop thief! as loud as I could, and got up, with my pistol in one hand and staff in the other - I endeavoured to clear my way as well as I could; he was stopped by some man, and taken into a public-house - I went in, and secured him; I had two hundred and fifty bills printed, and advertised the mare.</p>

            . I am ostler at the Nightingale stables. On the 18th of February, at half-past six o'clock in the evening, this mare came to our stables; the prisoner brought her - nobody was with him; she appeared as if she had been rode, but had stopped, and been rubbed down - she was not very dirty, but sweated; she remained there till Saturday, the 20th, when Lamb came with the prisoner; about seven o'clock in the morning Lamb rode her out for about twenty minutes, brought her back, and said she seemed rather shy; the prisoner said that might be, she was not used to town - they went away, came again about one o'clock, and Lamb took the mare away - Lamb was to be back at three o'clock: the prisoner came at three, but Lamb had not returned; he stopped about there for two or three hours, and laid down in the stable; about half-past six he got up, and said,"I shall go on to Adam-street, and if Lamb comes he knows where;" Lamb came with two officers about eight o'clock at night; I went with Drew to the Royal Oak, Princes-street - the prisoner was not there - we found him in Adam-street, and Drew took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On what day did you first see the prisoner? A. Thursday, the 18th, at half-past six o'clock in the evening, in Catherine-street, Paddington.</p>

            . I am a coachman. I have known the prisoner two years; I saw him on a Friday in February, just by the Stingo, between that and Baker-street - he said he had got a mare which would very likely suit some of my customers, as I sell horses at times; I said I could not go to see it then - I went next morning at seven o'clock, and met him at the Nightingale stables; I took the mare out a few yards, and told him she was a little lame, rather shy, and would not suit my customers - I told him in the afternoon if he liked I would ride her to Westminster, and show her to a man; I took her in the afternoon to Hutchinson's stables, and showed her to him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 34.) On 9th Feb. I went to Mr. Boyd's warehouse, in Friday-street—the prisoner was given into my custody—I said it was for robbing his employers—he sat down in the library, and wanted to know the particulars of the charge—I said, "One of the firm will be up presently; you can ask him"—Mr. Boyd soon came up, and he asked what he was charged with—Mr. Boyd said he charged him with robbing him for some time, and that he best knew what of—Whale and his brother, I believe, were in the counting-house—the prisoner did not make any answer, but said to me, "What is become of those two men?"—I asked what two me—I said, "Those two brothers, Whales"—I asked him why he asked that question—he said they had been taken into the counting-house—I asked him how he knew that—he said by passing and repassing in the course of the morning he had seen them—he said, "Are they in custody? because if they are not they ought to be"—I said I knew nothing about that, and I asked him where he lived—he said at 2, Edmund's-place, Shepherdess-walk, City-road—I asked what part of the house—he said he occupied it in common with his two brother's-in-law; that he slept in the top front room—I asked if he had any boxes there—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he had any keys to them—he said, "No," they were open—I took him to the station, and went to 2, Edmund's-place—I saw a woman there, who told me she was his wife—I found this new handkerchief in one drawer, in the first-floor front room, and in a lower drawer some calico—I found these two black handker<lb></lb>chiefs in the bedroom—I then went back to the station—the prisoner was brought into the charge-room—I told him I had been to 2, Edmund's-place, and had found these black handkerchiefs, and his wife said he had bought them at Messrs. Boyd's—he said, "I have done no such thing; I did not</p>

                  </hi> I am warehouseman in the calico department of Messrs. John and Christopher Boyd. The prisoner was their porter for two or three years—he had access to their warehouse—here is a mark on this calico—the width of it is thirty-five inches; the length was fifty-two yards—it is marked with the manufacturer's mark—these pieces are, in my judgment, part of one entire piece—to the best of my judgment these two fag<lb></lb>ends are off the same piece—here is a selvedge and the blue ends—this is the book in which we enter all the articles sold to any persons in employ of the firm—I make entries in it—it goes back nearly three years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many person are in your department? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three—each of them is allowed to sell—it is the duty of the person who sells to enter—if I make a sale I give the length, and the price, and the name to a second person, who would write it in the book—we never send a piece out without entering it—I may not have entered it till two or three hours after the sale—we always enter them in the day—we might make a sale at ten o'clock in the morning, and enter the goods at six in the afternoon, if we are very busy—we do not enter them from recollection, but from the goods—they never go out before they are entered—persons in our employ have the privilege to purchase goods at cost price to any reasonable amount—I sup<lb></lb>pose pose Messrs. Boyd would not consider it right if they purchase a large amount—I never knew of any limit—I cannot say whether the prisoner has pur<lb></lb>chased from 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods—he has purchased calico, I only know that from the books—I do not remember his making purchases—I have never served him, not seen him served, to my knowledge—I have never seen him take away goods—I know nothing about selling this piece—the worth of this whole piece would be about 17<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>—it is 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—he could have bought it at that price—it has been cut into pieces—I do not know that he has bought 150 yards of this calico within twelve months—here is one</p>

"You must be foolish; you may as well have anything for your own use when you want it"—I was taken into custody—I said to the prisoner, when I was in the library, "How came you by the handkerchiefs"—he said, "That is nothing; you say you bought them in a sale in the Borough, and that will clear you"—when I was in the Compter I told the prisoner I was uneasy, and wanted to tell the truth—he said, "You must be foolish; you are sure to get off"—I said, "What am I to do then?"—he said, "You will not be ale to get a character; you cannot get a situation where you are known: I will give you the money to take you abroad, that is 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the handkerchiefs he spoke about were two that I was charged with stealing—they</p>

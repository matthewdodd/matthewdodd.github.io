On the 1st of March I was the last person up, and went to bed about twelve o'clock - I fastened the doors. I got up at seven o'clock in the morning - it was light then; I found my shed in the yard had been opened - it is enclosed in the same fence as the dwelling-house, and was shut up at night; the fence is a seven-foot rail. I came down stairs and found the door of the dwelling-house tied. I could not open it - it was done to prevent my going into the yard. I broke it away and got into the yard, and found part of the fence broken down, the shed door opened, and the hen roost broken open; the shed had been latched the night before, and there was a secret latch to the hen roost, which was also fastened, eight fowls were gone, and fifteen rabbits. I went and found some of the rabbits in possession of Smith, of Brick-lane, and the cock I found on the Tuesday following in Quaker-street. I found the remainder of the rabbits in possession of Thomas and Oakes, who were in a room in the act of picking two fowls, and one laid in a basket between them, ready picked. I sent for an officer and had them taken. The shed is built of wood, and tiled over - we use it as a washhouse.</p>

Thomas and Oakes were each picking a fowl, and one laid in a basket before them, and some rabbits were running about the room, and some were in a basket near the bed; I asked how they came by them; they said they found them in a sack near North-green - I cannot say which spoke. I asked if they had a black-bird in a cage; one of them said it was up stairs - the prosecutor went up and brought it down. I took them to the office. I apprehended Castle in bed at that house a fortnight afterwards; I had been there several times, but could not find him before. He said he was sure the boys would state sufficient here to clear him, that he had nothing to do in it himself. I produce the black-bird and cage.</p>

Castle came in and asked whose they were; we said we had found them - he said if we did not take them out, he would throw them out.

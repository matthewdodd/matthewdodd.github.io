               <p>ELIZABETH SMITH. I am the wife of William Smith; I have a daughter named Elizabeth; she is a child. On the 21st of June she was at the door - I heard her cry, and went out; she had had a necklace on, and which had been fastened with a snap - I then missed it; the prisoner once lived in the same house with me with her parents.</p>
               <p>CHARLES FOX. I have known the prisoner for some time - I received some information, and took her - I told her it was for the necklace, which she took from the child's neck - she said she had not got it; I said, "You have it in your pocket;" she said, "I have no pocket" I found she had it in her bosom, and I took her to the office.</p>
               <p>GEORGE OSTERMAN. The prisoner lodged in my house with her parents; she went out about half-past ten o'clock with a boot in her hand - I heard the child cry that somebody had taken the heads; some person said the girl had a shoe in her hand - we went, and found the prisoner;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080094"></xptr>she put her hand into her bosom, and dropped these heads - I took her.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

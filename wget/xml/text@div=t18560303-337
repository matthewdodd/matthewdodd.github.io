                  </hi>. I am porter to Sampson Copestick and others. On Friray, 22nd Feb., there was a bale of goods outside their pretnises, three or four yards from the door, consisting of ten pieces of calico—the carriers are in the habit of depositing their goods there, and they are signed for by one of our men inside—I saw the prisoner there in the morning, and again between 2 and 3 o'clock, loitering about, and leaning against the case—I missed the calico about a quarter past 4 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, out of employment. On Friday, 22nd Feb., I was in Bow Churchyard, waiting to see the last witness—I saw a bale of goods reared up against the wall, three or four yards from the door—it fell down on the pavement, and the prisoner took it up, placed it against the wall, and placed himself against it—I left the premises about 3 o'clock, leaving him there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and am just turned eleven years of age, I live with my father and mother, and am employed by Mr. Reynolds to ride in the cart, and look out for the goods—I was in Bow Churchyard on 12th Feb, between 3 and 4 o'clock, with my cart; the driver had gone away—I saw a bale of goods on the pavement before Messrs. Copestick's, and saw the prisoner there—he said, "It will do you good if you will carry this," and than he said, "It is too heavy for you," and put it on his own shoulder—there was no one with him, it was on a case at the time—I had seen him before—next morning one of the men at Messrs. Copestick's asked rae about it—I thought it was the prisoner's property.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I produce the jacket which I took from the prisoner - this shilling and this halfpenny were in the pocket; I was going to cry ten o'clock, saw the row, and the prisoner was running from the crowd with it in his hand - he turned the corner and I caught him; I asked him how he came by it - he at first said it was his own, and then said it was the man's who was fighting, and he was going to take it home to his wife; I took him to the watch-house, then went to the crowd, and brought the prosecutor, who claimed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the jacket half a dozen doors from where they were fighting.</p>

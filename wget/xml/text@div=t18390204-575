                  </hi>. I am a foreman in the employ of the East and West India Dock Company. On the 15th of January, I was engaged in the tea warehouse of the West India Import Dock—the prisoner was an extra labourer in that warehouse, and was at work in the east wing—there are four floors on each division—I observed the prisoner in the west division, where he had no business—I asked what he had been doing there—he said "looking for a truck"—I told him to go to his work, and took no further notice of it—on the next morning, about the same hour, I saw him going to the same spot—I then said nothing to him, but watched him—there</p>

               <p>was in that west wing a chest of gunpowder tea, No. 13—I saw him remove the lid, put his band in, take out some tea, put it in a small bag, and put the hag into his pocket—he then left, and went to another room—I followed, and called him, but he went on—I called him a second time—he took no notice, but ran—I ran, and caught him—I told him to give me the tea he had—he said he had none—I said he had—I attempted to take the bag from his pocket, and in the struggle he contrived to empty the whole of the contents of the bag into a basket of rubbish which was there—I sent for an officer, and gave the prisoner in charge—I then went back to the chest, and saw evident marks of its having been plundered—I weighed it, and found it one pound deficient, as near as I can tell—I saw him empty about three-quarters of a pound into the basket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames police-officer, in the employ of the Company. I was there on the 15th of January, and took the prisoner—the foreman told him the charge in my presence—the prisoner made no answer—I examined the rubbish-basket, and took off the top about three quarters of an ounce of tea, of the same quality as that in the chest—I think there must have been three quarters of a pound, or a pound—I went to the prisoner's house the same morning, and found something there.</p>

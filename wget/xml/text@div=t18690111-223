                  </hi>. I am a stationer, at 27, Norton Folgate—on 3rd January, about 11 o'clock, I was walking in High Street, Shoreditch, with my two sons, twelve and fourteen years of age, one on each side—I was pushed at the back of the neck on to my knees and face—I can't remember what happened after that, I was so excited and shaken—I had a purse in my left trousers' pocket, with 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it, in silver and copper—I saw it at the station afterwards produced by a policeman—this is it—I did not see the prisoner—I was so injured, and my knees hurt so much, that I was quite insensible.</p>

I was on duty on this night in High Street, Shoreditch—I saw the prosecutor walking along with two boys—I saw the prisoner there with two or three more—he pushed up against the prosecutor and knocked him down—I ran to his assistance, and seized the prisoner's hand, with the purse in it; he was in a stooping position—I said, "What have you got here?"—he made no reply, but struggled to get away—his companions ran off before I got up—I took him to the station.</p>

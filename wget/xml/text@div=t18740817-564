                  </hi>. I lived at 146, Evelyn Street, Deptford—in May last I was foreman to my brother, a wood dealer—I have known the prisoner eight or nine years, and last November she threatened that she would blind me with vitriol and that my brother should keep me all the days of my life—on 24th February I complained of her at the police court for an assault—Mr. Henry Pook was my solicitor there and the threat in November was mentioned—the prisoner was bound over in 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to keep the peace towards me—I had ceased to visit her about Christmas last—during the nine years I knew her I never allowed her any agreed sum—I was not providing a home for her—only what I thought proper to give her—on 1st April there were other proceedings before the magistrate, in which I was defendant, and the prisoner complainant, and after several adjournments, that matter ended in April in my favour—the summons was on account of two children which I believe I had by her—on 23rd May, when I had not seen her or communi<lb></lb>cated with her since Easter Tuesday, April 7th, I was in Evelyn Street, just after midnight, and saw her and another woman; she said "You are the young man. I want to see"—I stopped and said "Indeed"—that was just outside Mr. Watts' shop—she said "I want to know what you intend doing"—I said "You have done all you can, and you will have to do the beat you can"—she then drew her arm from under her shawl and threw something in my face, saying "Take that"—I felt burning and said "Oh, I am blinded"—I have never seen anything since—I struggled towards the fence and heard something fall and break on the pavement—a young man who I knew led me home and I. have been under medical care ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have never lived with the prisoner, but I have been nine years cohabiting with her—I don't know how many children I have had by her, but she has had three children I believe during that time—I saw her sometimes once in two or three weeks—she used, to work at our place till I seduced her, and after which I went to see her occasionally—she has been out of our service eighteen months—the eldest child is, I think about five years old, and the next about three, I think—there is a third, I believe, and I think that is the last—I was summoned for the maintenance of the children—I never declined to give anything to support them—I always allowed support for her, but I never lived a day with her—I have discontinued my visits ever since last February, when she took the summons out—I have never been summoned for assaulting her—I think</p>

               <p>she did once complain of my giving her a black eye, which I believe, I did—that was the only time I struck her—I never slept there, but I have been there up to 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning—I may have slept there some nights, but never till 6 a.m.; I was always at work by 6 o'clock—she had not to go to the hospital sixteen months ago on my account, not when I knew her—I remember her saying that she had a fractured rib, and she said that I had fractured it—I cannot recollect when that was—I think the last money I sent her for the support of the children was about the 6th or 7th May this year, and this happened on 24th May—I know I sent her money in May by one of my <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>—I sent her money up to the very night the summons came, but not afterwards—I did not appear before the magistrate—the result of the summons was in my favour—I knew that she was married, she was living with her husband when <hi rend="italic">J.</hi> first knew her—I knew him before I visited her, but I believe she was separated from him when I visited her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. My age is thirty-one—she is older than me, I believe, I first had criminal connection with her about eight years ago—I do not believe her husband had left her then, but I don't know—I know I hit her when she complained of a black eye, she met me one evening and molested me, and drove my pipe into the roof of my mouth, and I got so <hi rend="italic">riled</hi>, that I hit her in the face—that is the only time I hit her to disfigure her—on another occasion she hit me twice, and knocked my hat off, she threatened several times to blind me, and to make a curiosity of me—I am not guilty of any violence which fractured one of her ribs, that I am aware of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Emblin Street, Deptford—on Sunday morning, 24th May, I was called and found Gilley suffering great pain in his eyes, and there was an appearance of whiteness in them—there were marks of vitriol on the under side of the brim of his hat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was suffering from the throwing of some irritant fluid into his eyes such as vitriol—he has been to the senior surgeon of Guy's Hospital, but he has not recovered his sight, and I am afraid he never will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I really think that—I have had a long experience of injuries from vitriol, being connected with the police force—my opinion is that his eyes will never be of service to him again—his vision is of no use to him; he fancies that it is, but it is not—I never knew anyone recover who was so bad as he is—the humours of the eye are thickened and opaque, so that the rays of light are not concentrated—that is caused by thickening through the burning—there was much vitriol on his coat and trousers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I examined one of the prisoner's eyes on the day this occurred—I don't think it was much hurt, but she told me that she had got something in her eye, and I told them at the station what to do.</p>

On 27th May, about 1.15, I went to the prisoner's house, 6, Ropemaker Street, Deptford—she was up, and was in the ground floor front room crying—I told her I had come to take her in custody for throwing vitriol in Mr. Gilley's face—she told me she should not have done it if it had not been for. Mr. Pook, the solicitor, mentioning it in the former case—I took her in custody—she said at the station that she bought a pennyworth of vitriol three months previously, a pennyworth a few weeks previously, and a pennyworth) on Saturday, the day before, and that it was in a bottle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I saw about four children there—she was not in bed—it was past midnight—the children were not in bed, they were crying and</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). I saw Gilley at 146, Emblin Street suffering great pain—I went back to Mr. Watts' house, and found traces of vitriol on the pavement, and parts of a broken jug in the road with a burn<lb></lb>ing substance adhering to it—I saw the prisoner afterwards at the station, and asked her what was the matter with her—she said that in throwing the vitriol at Mr. Gilley a portion of it had gone in her own eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Gilley's hat, vest,. and necktie were very much burnt—his tie has tumbled to pieces since—I only noticed a few spots on his trousers and coat—his brother is a large firewood merchant, and I believe she has been working there some time with the prosecutor.</p>

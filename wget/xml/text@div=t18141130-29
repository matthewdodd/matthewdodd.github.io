               <p>Q. On the 17th of November did you lose any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300018"></xptr>handkerchiefs - A. On the evening of the 16th I lost some handkerchiefs, how many it is impossible for me to say; several I lost, I do not know how many.</p>
               <p>Q. From what part of the shop - A. From off the counter. The prisoner and another man came into my shop on the 16th, about ten minutes before nine o'clock, and asked the see some silk handkerchiefs; the prisoner was looking at some silk handkerchiefs as well as the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say he wanted to see silk handkerchiefs - A. Yes, he asked as well as the other; I heard him speak; I was in the middle of the shop; I went up to the top of the shop; I saw his companion take the handkerchiefs off a bundle, and put them under his coat, and run out of the door; I immediately called and said, stop thief. I laid hold of Hedger; I said stop, your companion has stolen some handkerchiefs,</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner Hedger offered to run away - A. He had offered to run away, his back was towards me; the other saw me coming. Hedger just made a move nearly before I seized him; he had not got one pace, he had only just made a move. I told him his companion had stolen some handkerchiefs; he was as bad, he had some handkerchiefs about him. He had none when the officer came in and searched him. He had been there a week before with his companion; I had seen him there. I suspected him the week before, they bought nothing. We were very busy; then they said, there was nothing that suited them. They had not an opportunity of suiting themselves, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any answer to you when he said he was as bad as his companion - A. He said he did not know him, he was a young man that he had met by chance, unfortunately he said, that evening somewhere at the west end of the town. I asked him what he was; he said, a chair stuffer. I went in pursuit of him, it was dark, I could not find him. I missed several handkerchiefs from the parcel; I am sure he took some handkerchiefs, I missed two pieces, one with four handkerchiefs in it, the other I do not know how many.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine them before they were lost - A. I had not counted them.</p>
               <p>Q. The man who took the handkerchiefs escaped - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had nothing upon him - A. He had not; his companion, when he went out, said to him, I shall see you in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not, count the single handkerchiefs, did you - A. No, I did not; I am certain I missed two pieces, one had four, and the other not less than two.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

On 28th May, I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold</hi>, Chel<lb></lb>seasteam-boat; about half a mile from Chiswick I missed my purse whichhad been in my pocket by the side of my dress—it contained a half-sovereign, a half-crown, two shillings, and sixpence, one fourpenny piece, three half<lb></lb>pence, and one farthing—both prisoners were on board—Smith was nearestto me—I accused him of having robbed me, in consequence of what awoman told me—he asked me if I accused him—I said, "I did, and askedhim to take out his money"—he took out a half-sovereign, four half-crowns, and six shillings, and said he showed all he had—I had amongst ray moneya halfpenny with a hole in it which I could swear to—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—when 1 accused him he went round the boat—I followed him—he wentand stood by the side of Flood, who was sitting down—Whitelock, one of thewitnesses, said, in the prisoner's presence, that he saw Smith pass money to Flood—Smith said he had not—Flood said he had not taken his hand out ofhis pocket—his hand was in his pocket then—two gentlemen kept theprisoners on board—the police came, and I heard money rattle in Flood'spocket—I thought he had given something to a little boy, as I saw the boy's hand near Flood—the boy said he had not, but he had thrown it into thewater—my money was in a purse—it has not been found.</p>

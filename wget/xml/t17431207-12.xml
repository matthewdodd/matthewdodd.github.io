Two or three Days afterwards as I was going through Fleming's Church-Yard , I saw the Prisoner, I knew her Face and her Voice; I challenged her with it, and she denied it; her Mother brought down a Watch, and would have shewed it me, but she said, what are you going to do, you shall not show it him, unless he gives you the Marks of the Watch; I said the Maker's Name of my Watch was Kipling; then she said, that was not my Watch. I got a Warrant in Shadwell, and took her; her Mother offered me two or three Crowns to make it up.</p>

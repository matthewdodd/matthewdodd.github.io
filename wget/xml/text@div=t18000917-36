               <p>Wilson. I landed this yarn about an hour before; there was a broken vat of yarn; I was up at dinner, and was sent for by Asbury, and I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that to be your yarn? - A. The quality is nearly equal, and in counting the number of heads there were two deficient, there should have been three hundred and forty skains in that vat, and there were but three hundred and thirty-eight, this one makes three hundred and thirty-nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the prisoner authority to remove any? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Nor to repack it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am as innocent as the child unborn; I saw a man take a piece, and I took it from him to take care of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

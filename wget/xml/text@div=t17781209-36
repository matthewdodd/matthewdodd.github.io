The two prisoners came to my shop, and desired to look at some muslins; while I was wrapping a piece up for them, Taylor took a piece off the counter, and held it up before my eyes, which gave me a suspicion that they meant to steal something. I then saw her take another piece off the counter, and tuck it under her stays; she had agreed for a remnant; the woman said she had but a shilling, and desired me to put it by for her. I agreed to that, and they were going away; Fubbs was out of the shop, Taylor was not quite out; I laid hold of Taylor, and said she had my property about her. I took up her apron, and saw the muslin under her stays; I immediately sent for a constable.</p>

I desired her not to bargain for it, as knowing she had not money enough; she would not take my advice, but seemed determined to have it; upon which I turned from her in a huff; there was a piece of muslin on the counter; my elbow was on it; whether he was angry with me for persuading her not to have it, or what, I am not accountable for that, but he laid hold of me, and said I had taken some muslin.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 45). On Tuesday evening, 19th Sept., about half-past seven o'clock, I saw a horse and cart in the Old Bailey, standing at the corner of Fleet-lane—Lane stood by it, and Rayson took some lead pipe from it, and carried it down Fleet-lane—Lane could see what he did; he was three or four feet from him—I watched him to Mr. Clarke's shop, fifty or sixty yards from the cart, but not in view of it—he put it into the scale there—I went back, and gave Lane in charge, then returned to the shop, and Rayson had gone—I took Lane to the shop, and asked if he knew anything of the lead, he said, "No"—I said I had just seen it taken from the cart, and he must know something of it—he said, "I do not"—I took him to the station—I afterwards took Rayson, at Sattoii-street, Soho—I compared the lead with some on Dr. Dale's premises—it corresponded, and weighed 110lbs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a rag-merchant, of Fleet-lane.

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of Cirencester-place, Marylebone. I contracted to rebuild the Rev. Dr. Dale's premises—the prisoners were in my service—it was Rayson's business to see the lead weighed before it left the premises, and give a voucher to Lane, who is the carman—my instructions were that it should be taken to Pontifex's, in Shoe-lane—the time for leaving work is half-past five—they ought not to have been there at half-past seven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Rayson was foreman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On this occasion; not generally—Lane would know nothing but what he told him—they had both been in my employ many years—Shoe-lane is not five minutes' walk from Fleet-lane—I believe the warehouse closes at six o'clock—I do not know whether it does not close atseven—Lane has said before that it was no use taking lead away late—I have had no reason to suspect Rayson before—by going down Fleet-lane they would have to carry the lead, instead of keeping it in the cart—the foreman has no business to be with the cart when the lead is delivered, but they might have been walking the same road—we had no return made of this, lead—it was not Rayson's duty to deliver it.</p>

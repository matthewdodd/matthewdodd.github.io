                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother; we are tobacco manufacturers in St. John-street—Green has been in our employ about six year—on the morning of the 4th of March, I was awoke by one of my servants—I went down stairs, saw Green, and a policeman in the shop—I said to Green, "What is all this about, Charles?"—he said, "I exchanged some shorts or smalls for some long for Mansford"—he said, "I have occa<lb></lb>sionally done it for him; I know I have done wrong, but I have never bene<lb></lb>fitted a farthing by it; he brought me a parcel this morning which I ex<lb></lb>changed"—I said, "Where is the parcel?"—he said, "This is it"—I said, "Put it into the scale"—he did so—it weighed 8lbs. (<hi rend="italic">the policeman had previously said, in Green's presence, "We have taken a man who says he purchased the tobacco at your house; he is now at the station"</hi>)—I turned to the policeman, and said, "You see this weight, it is 8lbs"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What does the parcel weigh which you have taken. with this man?"—he said, "13 3/4 lbs."—the policeman then laid, "Shall I take the shopman into custody?"—I said, "No, not at present; I am so flurried I hardly know what to tell you to do; we will go to the station"—On finding the difference in weight, I said to Green, "Independently of your rascality in exchanging smalls for long, you. knowing the relative value of each, how can you account for the parcel yon say you exchanged weighing 8lbs., and the parcel you have given away weighing l3 3/4 lbs.?"—he said, "I thought the parcel weighed l0lbs., and I left it for Mansford to take himself; I did not think he would take so much more than he brought"—I and the policeman then went to the station, leaving Green at my house—I saw Mansford at the station—I said to him, "What is the meaning of all this, Mansford?"—he raid, "I have not defrauded you of any thing"—I said, "Don't talk in that strain, this parcel only weighs 8lbs., and the other weighs 13 3/4 lbs.; how do you account for the discre<lb></lb>pancy?"—he said, "I was going to bring you the other portion"—I said, "You were strong enough to carry away 13lbs., but not strong enough to bring it"—we went to his house, but found nothing that I thought proper to bring away.</p>

            ; the prisoner has been in our employ about eight months. On the 22nd of March, from information of one of my men, I went to the warehouse; the instant I got there the prisoner came towards the door as though he was going out; he went back into the warehouse upon seeing of me; he came forwards, I asked him if he had found any of the loose things that had been lost; he said he had found the chain only; he then walked back again into the warehouse; he came forward again. I told him that I was very much afraid that there was a thief about the warehouse, we had lost a many trifling things, I could not tell what become of them; he said he felt himself equally surprized as I did to know what had become of them. I stood against the door post looking at him; he went to the back of the warehouse and came back again; I then asked him if he was waiting for any thing; he said no, and immediately walked out, passed me and went down the step; he got a little distance; seeing him look a little bulky I called to him and asked him if he had got any thing in his pockets; he made an evasive kind of answer as though he did not know what I meaned; I called to him again, he did not stop. I called to him again rather sharp, he then turned round and stopped; I told him I hoped my fears were not true, had he or had he not any thing in his pockets that he should not have; he answered I do not know what you mean, sir, by asking me such questions; I put my hand to his coat pocket and asked him what he had got there so bulky; he said only an old clout or two; I took his hat off his head, his hat was as full of rags as it well could be; I then desired him to walk into the accompting house; he said he was very sorry. I sent for a constable; he came and searched him in my presence, and found five pounds of rags in his hat, pockets, round his waist and in his breeches.</p>
               <p>- WOODMAN. I am a constable; I searched the prisoner; in the crown of his hat I found these rags, out of his pockets I took a great many rags, and about his loins and in the back part of his breeches. I then took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had such rags about my wharf.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had too much liquor; I do not find fault with any thing that Mr. Aylwin has said; if I had told Mr. Aylwin how I had come by them I should not have come in so much trouble; Mr. Aylwin has given us the liberty to take the sweepings of the salted goods to sell, and I thought if there were any of any other sort I might take that too; we had delivered some bags and I swept it up. The reason I concealed it was because the other men did not know of it; it was not worth while sharing of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of the deceased John Boyle, and reside at 30, Francis-street, Westminster-road. On Sunday night, 24th Feb., my husband left home, between six and seven o'clock, with Morris Ryan, to go to a meeting at Vauxhall—about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve my sister-in-law called me out of bed—I went out of the house, and saw my husband, the prisoner Morris Ryan, Mrs. Quinlan, his daughter, and Mrs. Flood, at Riley's door, which is about forty yards, as near as I can say, from our house—Riley and my husband were having some words—I tapped Riley on the back, and said, "Patrick Riley, what is the matter with you and my husband, two men working together?"—with that I fetched my husband over, and said, "John, what is the matter?"—he said, "Nothing,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185003040117"></xptr>
               <p>my dear"—he opened his hands, and said, "Patrick Riley, what do you want of me?"—with that Riley stripped off his jacket, and my husband said to Ryan, "Take my cout and hat"—they each took off their coats, and my husband struck Riley twice with his fist—Riley <hi rend="italic">wheeled</hi> out into the middle of the street before his own door, lifted up his right hand, sprang on his left foot and hit my husband, whose back was turned to him—whether it was on the head or shoulder, I do not know—he then went in doors—the policeman came up, and the words were over—my husband went up to the lamp, and walked a little way, and said to Ryan, "Where is my coat and hat?"—Ryan said, "It is all right, my daughter has got it"—he came down to the lamp, looked up, and was going to fall back, but the policeman, Mrs. Flood, and Ryan caught him—they hallooed out for water—I went in and fetched it, and the policeman put it up to his mouth, and he did not drink it, so I ran for the clergy, and rang the bell—I could get no answer, and when I came back my husband was dead—that was not more than five minutes after the blow—I saw no other blows than I have stated—I saw all that took place—the prisoner and my husband had worked together for nine or ten months, and were always good friends, as far as I understand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Mount-street, West<lb></lb>minster-road. I was called to see the deceased on the 25th Feb., and on the 27th I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there was a very slight mark on the left side of the neck, and a slight mark just above the left temple—I attri<lb></lb>buted those marks to violence—a fall or blow might have produced them; or catching the man by the collar, and shoving him, might do it, by forcing the hand against the neck—in consequence of seeing the mark over the left temple, I made a deeper dissection there, and found more evident marks of violence under the temporal muscle of that side, but still not sufficient to account for death—pursuing the examination I discovered that the man had disease of the heart—enlargement of the heart, with a dilatation of the ventri<lb></lb>cles; the other appearances were healthy—the immediate cause of death was disease of the heart—a person with that disease would be likely to have death accelerated, or caused suddenly, by anything acting on the nerves; fear, alarm, excitement, or a blow—it was a very considerable disease—he might not, without some such cause, have died immediately, but he ultimately would have died from that disease—I think it is more than probable that he might not have died then, if pursuing his ordinary quiet avocations; but I cannot state that positively—I could not trace any personal violence as having caused his death.—(<hi rend="italic">At the suggestion of the</hi>

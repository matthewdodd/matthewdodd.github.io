            . I am warehouseman to Messrs. John Garnet and Joseph Underwood. I deposited a request note in a box at the Excise-office about half-past ten o'clock on the 7th of February; I went afterwards, about three o'clock, and found a permit which I took to the Locker to get a chest of tea which we had purchased at the Company's sale - we sent our cart for it, but it could not be found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you present when it was bought at the Company's sale? A. No; I cannot swear that I had ever seen this chest; I only know it by the marks on the chest and the documents.</p>

            . I am warehouseman at the Company's warehouses in Cutler-street - the prisoner brought a permit to me for a chest of tea, and I helped it on his shoulder - he told me he came from Mr. Young's, in Fenchurch-street, where I knew he had once lived; I took a note of the number of the chest in my yard-book, which I have here (reads) "A. Thacker, one chest, No. 44, Young's man." It had come by the ship Thomas Coutts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then it was out of the Company's yard you delivered it? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a hackney coachman and drive No. 654. On the 7th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, who had a chest of tea with him, hired my coach in Old-street-road - which is about a mile and a half from Cutler-street; I drove by his desire to the City-road, and then he desired me to drive to the Lower-road, lslington - at the turnpike-gate the man asked for the toll, and he would not pay it - he then desired me to let him out - I got down and let him out - he struck me and went away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any proof that it was this chest of tea that the man had? A. No.</p>

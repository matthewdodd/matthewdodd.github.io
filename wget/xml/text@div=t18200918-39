            . I am in the second battalion of Grenadier Guards, on the 9th of July I was at the Tower, Mrs. Abrahams came up with the bed furniture in her hands, and asked me to shew her an officer. I saw the prisoner about ten yards off, I ran after her, and told her to stop till the lady came up; she said I was no constable, and she would not, as she had no property but what belonged to her. I detained her, and took her to Mrs. Abraham's house, when the constable took her in charge I saw a white frock, handkerchief with lace round it in her possession. She said the prosecutrix gave it to her.</p>

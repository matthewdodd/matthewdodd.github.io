On the 4th of October, out of 9s. 6d. in the shop, I going out into the passage for three or four minutes, miss'd 3s. 6d. as soon as I came in, which was a half crown and a shilling. The prisoner had told me before in the morning she had not a farthing in the world. When I took her up, she was for breaking out at the window. Before the constable came, when I went to search her, she said she had no money about her. As she was struggling to get out at the window, her pocket came off, Mr. Wright pick'd it up, and shook out of it a half crown and a shilling.</p>

               <p>They took this money from me, and a half-penny. I was forced to jump out at the window, for she swore she would murder me.</p>

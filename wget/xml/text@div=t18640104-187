I am a bookseller of 355, Strand, and sole representa<lb></lb>tive of the Temperance Loan Society there—I carry on business there, but do not live there—I have known the prisoner about four years—he has on various occasions borrowed money of me—about 28th January last year the prisoner came for a loan of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him this proposal paper (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) to fill up—he said he had come from Thomas West to borrow the money for him, and mentioned the name of William Moore as his surety—he took the proposal-paper away—he partly filled it up there, leaving the spaces for the persons to sign their names—I gave him the note of hand with it, pasted on it—(<hi rend="italic">The proposal being read, was for a loan of 6 l., for Thomas West, higgler, of Watford, recommended by John Dyer, surety J. Moore, of Aldenham Grove Lodge, housekeeper</hi>)—the note of hand was written by me, leaving blanks for the names to be filled up by West and Moore—the prisoner afterwards returned with it filled up (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:"355, Strand, January 28th, 1863.

               <p>the prisoner—I made an entry of having so paid him at the time—this is my book—the entry was made by myself at the time—I have paid money to Dyer in two instances—I remember two distinctly—I can't say positively I only paid him in two—I can find those entries in the book—these are they (<hi rend="italic">pointing them out</hi>)—I entered these at the time I paid them—I gave a man named Hedges, of Watford, a loan—I paid him in person—I think I remember his coming—that was one of Dyer's recommendations—a man named Pegg was the second—I first looked at my book to see if I had paid Dyer when the letter to West was returned—that was some time in May—I destroyed that letter—the other one I left on my desk—I don't know why I did not put West's there—I cannot find it, and I think I destroyed it—I think it was in April that I went down to Watford—I told Dyer I could not make it out, that I could not find out West—I did not say I was afraid he had been hoaxed, nor anything like that—I said that I had been to the post-office and could not find West and I was afraid there was something wrong—he said the man had removed—I went down again in July—I did not give him in charge then—I did the first time I could find him after that—I don't know that he was at Watford working at his trade and living there; I could not find him there—I made diligent inquiries and could not find him—I have not lent him any money since this loan of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sold him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of things, and took a bill for the amount—I have it here—it is dated 15th July; that was after I had found West had disappeared—when I made inquiries for West, Dyer assured me it was all right, that he lived away somewhere else, and came there to market every Tuesday—I was satisfied with that; that was at the same time I took this note—I applied for a warrant against Dyer—an action was brought against me by a man named Sharp—I don't know when it was commenced it might have been in September last—it was somewhere about that time—my solicitor could tell you; I don't know—I don't know what the action was for—I don't know that Dyer was the principal witness against me in that action—when the writ came to me, I did not know who it was from—I have since made inquiry—I don't now know what the action was for—I believe it was for taking some goods from Watford—I have not seen the declaration—my attorney said he would see to it, I was to make myself quite easy, it was an attempt to extort money—I don't know whether Dyer had anything to do with it—I suspect he had, but his name did not appear in any way—I have not seen him to speak to him about it.</p>

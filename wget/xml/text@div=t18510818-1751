                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at 17, Victoria-place, Peter-street, Was worth. On the night of 10th June, about half-past 12 o'clock, I was at the Rodney, in Westminster-bridge-road, standing close to the bar—I saw the prisoner standing close to me—I had a silver watch fastened to a gold guard—as I was in the act of leaving the bar, I felt a tug at my pocket so violent, that it actually pulled my neck down; and with the tug I felt and beard a wrench—I looked down, and saw the prisoner's hand coming from my pocket with the guard hanging in his hand—I seized hold of his hand, and likewise of his collar, and called out that I was robbed—I said to him, "I am robbed, and you are the man that has done it!"—I did not see the watch—a policeman rushed in instantly—I picked up my watch close to the prisoner's feet—I did not see who dropped it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 260). I went into the Rodney about half-past 12 on the night of the 10th—the prisoner was given into the custody of a brother constable—I asked him where the watch was—he said he had not had it—I told my brother constable to search him; as soon as he heard that, he tried to get away—I stood with my back to the door—his right-hand was in his right-hand trowsers-pocket—he drew it from his pocket, and something dropped on the floor—we looked, and there was the watch—the prosecutor picked it up, and I took the prisoner out of the house—as we were going along, he called out to a mob who were following to assist him—he said, "Come on, I will be off!"—he got away—I did not lose sight of him.</p>

I went into the public-house, and saw Mr. Beswick holding the prisoner—he gave him into my custody for stealing a silver watch—the prisoner said he did not steal it—Mr. Beswick had a chain hanging round his neck—I took the prisoner from his hands—soon afterwards Mr. Beswick said, "Here is my watch"—I picked it up at the prisoner's feet—I took him out of the house, and he escaped, but I got him again—he struggled violently to get away, and kept hallooing to some pals, who were behind.</p>

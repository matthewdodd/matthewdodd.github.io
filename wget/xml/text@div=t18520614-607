                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Daubney, a dairyman, of High-street, Notting-hill. I saw the prisoner on 10th May—he came for a quartern of butter—I served him—he gave me a half crown—I gave him change—I placed the half crown in the till, where there was no other half crown—the till went up stairs in my bedroom—the half crown was left in it—the next morning the prisoner came for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of eggs about 8 o'clock—he offered me a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece—I had brought the till down stairs—I put the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece in it, and gave the prisoner in change his own half crown, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when he had got his own half crown he asked me if I would give him smaller change for it—I said, "Do not you like that? it is the one that I took of you last night; is it not good?"—he said, "Yes, it is perfectly good, but my mistress wants so much small change"—I gave him small change—about 11 o'clock I gave the half crown to my egg merchant, and it was bad—I then showed him the crown, and that was bad—on 13th the prisoner came again for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of eggs—I shut the door, and sent for a policeman—I charged the prisoner with passing the crown and half crown—he said he had not been in the shop since the Saturday before—this was on the Thursday—he had been there on the Monday and Tuesday—I bad no other crown nor half crown—Catherine Middleton has access to my till.</p>

               <p>ANN POPE. I live at Happerton. On the 13th of October, my things were under a hedge in a field where I was at work with Wicks; about ten o'clock I saw a man in the field - He went out of the field; we watched him out; in about a quarter of an hour we went to our things to get our victuals, and missed them. The prisoner was taken - He is the man.</p>
               <p>ANN WICKS. I lost five aprons, and my victuals.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN CLEMENT. I am a headborough. I heard the alarm, and found the prisoner in custody; he said he had put the things in a plantation, and showed them to us.</p>
               <p>JOHN MILLER. I am a constable. I asked the prisoner what he had done with the rest of the things? he said they were all he had seen, except the victuals, which he had eat.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was out of work, and eat the victuals, being hungry; I meant to return the things.</p>

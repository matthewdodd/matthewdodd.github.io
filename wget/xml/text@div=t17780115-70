I seized his hand, but he conveyed the watch away. I had him secured, but nothing was found upon him, nor did I expect there would, he having conveyed it away. I made a grasp at the man next to him, thinking I might get my watch, but could not catch him.</p>

               <p>I was in the croud; the prisoner was not next to the prosecutor; there were three more between them; the prosecutor charged two other men before he charged the prisoner with it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never was in any doubt about the prisoner; but I charged another man at the same time, because I saw him receive the watch of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Question to Parrott. What are you? - A soldier in the guards.</p>
               <p>A common soldier? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you not inlist men for the East India company? - No.</p>
               <p>What trade is the prisoner? - I don't know, I had but a slight acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He interposed a great deal in it, and was taken up with him; he said the prisoner was his friend.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

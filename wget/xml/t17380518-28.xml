               <p>Mr. Lewis. I don't know the Prisoner: I was robb'd the 27th of August, 1736, and Wager and Baker were hang'd for it. I was coming from Bedfordshire, and in the watery Lane, near <placeName id="t17380518-28-crimeloc134">Kentish Town</placeName>

I rode on a little Way, and one of them turn'd short on my Horse's Hips. I ask'd him, what he did that for? He immediately whipp'd by me, and demanded my Money. I told him he should have what I had got, but I desired him not to meddle with the Lady that was with me. He said he would not. Then I pull'd out about 13 s. three Copper Pieces, and the Copper Ticket, and gave them; but the Man that was behind said, I must be search'd; and he put his Hand into this Pocket, and took out five Guineas, and two half Guineas. This is the Ticket they took from me at that Time. One of them took hold of my Horse's Bridle, and told me, if I had a Bushel of Arms, they would signify nothing. 'Twas the Man that I gave the Money too, who search'd me, and pull'd out the Gold, a Key, and a Nutmeg. He felt about my Breeches for a Watch, but I assured him I had none, and began to swear at them; but a Man behind, bid me not swear so, for I should not be ill us'd, and he bid the rest of the Gang come away, if they had got what they could. D - mn it, says another of them, he never rides without a Watch; I assur'd them I had none, so they then rode away, to another Man, who belonged to my Company, and stood under a Tree, with some Venison behind him, his Mare would not stand. One of them cry'd, D - mn it, shoot him if he won't stand. I said don't shoot him, let my Horse's Nose come up to the Mare's, and she'll stand. That Gentleman's Name was Walker, but he has been dead about 5 or 6 Weeks. They took about 10 or 12 Shillings from him, and wish'd us a good Night; telling me, they hop'd when it was in my Power, I would use them, as well as they had used me. I can't say I know the Prisoner; 'twould be a vile Thing in me to swear the Man's Life away, when I know nothing of him. I remember the Evidence, for by the Light<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173805180016"></xptr> which came over the Bank, I saw his Face plainly.</p>

            's, at the White-Lion at Hornsey, with Intent to rob any Body we should meet. About 8 o'Clock we met Mr. Lewis, and a Lady, and a Gentleman following them, in the Lane that goes to Kentish Town. We rid past him, and the rest of his Company, then Baker turn'd back, and said there was our Mark; I came up with Mr. Lewis, and my Horse's Head lay upon his Horse's Buttock I took from him what I could find, but Baker insisted on searching him farther, and had it not been for the unhappy Man at the Bar, and myself, he would have done him a Mischief. I search'd him, and took to the Value of 6 l. from him. The Prisoner was behind Mr. Lewis, and was to give us Notice of any Surprize. One Mr Walker was robb'd at the same Time: Baker and Wager insisted upon robbing the Lady, but Mr. Lewis persuaded us from it, because her Horse was startish.</p>
               <p>After we had committed this Fact, we went to Ralph Guy's in Hornsey-Lane, and shar'd the Money we had got that Night, which came to about 50 s. a Man; the Prisoner was present, and I believe had his Share; but he was tired of such a Way of Life, and soon went quite away from the Company, in about a Week's Time. I was apprehended about the Beginning of October, on Account of a Fact that I was not guilty of; I begun to be weary of such Courses, and therefore made a voluntary Confession. I have heard that the Prisoner has been in an Employment ever since he absconded. I saw him (just before he went down to Bristol) about 10 or 11 Weeks ago, in Wood's Close. We are both sorry for our past Follies, and I know he would be glad to receive Favour, as well as I. Our Conversation was on the Hardships, that the unfortunate Man at the Bar had sustain'd, by his being obliged to wander backward and forward, when he should be glad to settle to any Labour. How he came to be discover'd, I don't know; - I did not betray him. I have nothing more to say, and am sorry that I am able, and am obliged to say so much. (Weeping.)</p>

We should have had another Witness here, - Ralph Guy, - he promised to be here; he was here on Wager and Baker's Trial, but he was an unwilling Witness then, and now he has sent a Boy here, who I suppose is to swear he is sick. I must say, the Prisoner has led an honest, careful Life, ever since he got rid of his Companions.</p>

            .) Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Rawlins. Yes, my Lord, for some Years. My Lord, upon the 4th of March last, about Noon, Mr. Maschil detected him in stealing some Tobacco, and he ran away, and threw out of his Hand two or three Hands of Tobacco.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not see the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Rawlins. In Botolph Wharf Gateway, and down Cock's Key Gateway. The Prisoner slung out of his Pocket the Quantity of three or four Hands; and after that, when Mr. Maschil had carried him to the Compter, he ask'd me to go down that Gateway, and said, Perhaps we shall find some Tobacco; With that altogether, there was about 2 lb.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did this Tobacco lie?</p>
               <p>Rawlins. Upon the Wharf, it was to be shipp'd off.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that this came out of those Hogsheads?</p>
               <p>Rawlins. I don't know of its coming out of that particular Hogshead: I saw him take a Hand or two.</p>
               <p>Q.(to the Prisoner.) Will you ask this Man any Thing?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you, my Lord, I was only about to take a little to put into my Mouth, and a Hand came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you ask the Witness any Question?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sir, he did not see me take a Bit out of the Hogshead.</p>

This Man, the Prisoner, my Lord, I saw him take some Tobacco; I pursu'd after him, and catch'd him in a Cellar that I knew he must go through; I catch'd him as close to the Parcel of Tobacco, as close as to that Gentleman. My Lord, he has been a Thief these three or four Years. He was once in Bridewell; and I have often corrected him with such a Stick as this.</p>

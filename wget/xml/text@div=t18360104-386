                  </hi>. I live servant in Artillery-place, Wool<lb></lb>wich. I was in the Earl of Chatham public-house on the 29th of Decem<lb></lb>ber, and saw the prisoner there—I had a pair of boots in the tap-room; and about half an hour after I had seen them safe, I missed them—I had been to my work in the mean time—I had left the prisoner and another woman there, and an artillery-man—I went, about four o'clock, to Mrs. Miller's in High-street—I asked Mrs. Miller if she had a pair of cossack boots which she thought would fit me—she said she thought she had, and brought me my own—I tried them on, and said I thought they would do—the prisoner was sitting by the fire—I fetched the constable, who apprehended her—I had purchased them the Saturday previous, and lost them on Tuesday—I had worn them in the mean time.</p>

I went with the prosecutor to Miller's shop, and got the pair of boots which I now produce—I apperhended the prisoner there—she said she received the boots from a person named Hodge, who was afterwards apprehended, and discharged by the Magistrate.</p>

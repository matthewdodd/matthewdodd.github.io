               <p>Q. (To Mitchell.) Was the copper carried by the last witness, Mr. Williams' property? - A. It was.</p>

               <p>Q. And all your knowledge of the business you derive from that entry? - A. Yes; we are in the habit of receiving old copper from Snow-hill, and the notes which accompany that copper are always copied, when the delivery of the copper is made by Mr. Williams to the mill.</p>
               <p>Q. But all the knowledge you have, in copper being sent at all, is from your own entry, and from what you understand from other people? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this copper been in the warehouse? - A. Yes it had.</p>
               <p>Sedgwick. We went away on the 11th, in the morning, and got to Staines on the 13th, about twelve o'clock in the day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did nothing pass among you why he should take it more than any body else? - A. He sold it to him; he was to bring it up to London, and sell it; he was to give 6d. a pound; he came back next day, and brought eight guineas, and gave us on the table; Drake and I had five guineas between us, and Mrs. Knotts took her husband's money, three guineas, that was half a guinea for the reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it lying when you took it? - A. On Mr. Ashby's wharf.</p>

               <p>Q. No, it is not; if it was, you would be prosecuted, I promise you; since that time, unluckily, you have been taken up again, and been in prison ever since? - A. I have not been out yet.</p>
               <p>Q. And now you are swearing to save yourself from being prosecuted? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you were before the magistrate; when you gave evidence before, you did not give intelligence about this copper? - A. Yes, I did at the first of all.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoners were not taken up for a long time after? - A. Yes, Drake was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the justice and give an account of these people till after that session? - A. No, not till after the session.</p>
               <p>Q. You were ordered to be detained to give evidence respecting this copper; the Court refused, and you were taken afterwards to Hatton-street, notwithstanding the application was refused by the Court; and there gave the account of this copper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. When was it you were first carried before a magistrate? - A. In October.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then state what you are stating now? - A. Yes; I was examined upon this business in October; and in November this information was brought forward.</p>
               <p>Q. And they were not apprehended till after your information in Hatton-street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoners in custody till you had been a second time before a justice in Hatton-street? - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. And discharged? - A. Drake went about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Though Drake was sent about his business at the first examination, and you pretend to swear this business was entered into before the magistrates the first time, were they in custody till the second examination before the justices in Hatton-street; and upon your second examination Drake was again apprehended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Drake was discharged, and told to go about his business, though you had told the same story then that you have told now? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a brass-founder in Shoe-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Aldred? - A. Very well.</p>
               <p>Q. In what line of life is he? - A. I have been in the habit of buying old copper and brass of him for two or three years past; he is a fallow-chandler, and a kind of hawker; he keeps a small shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving, on the 13th of October last, a parcel by the Chertsey waggon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that contain? - A. Various kinds of old copper and brass, bell-metal, and altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent it to you? - A. I believe Mr. Aldred. I have been frequently in the habit of buying old metal.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you a doubt about who sent it to you? - A. I have not. I paid him ready money for all I bought; to the best of my recollection, I paid Mrs. Aldred for this, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that it was on Mr. Aldred's account? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say it is customary to buy goods without taking an account of them? - A. What I deal for in ready money, I never make any memorandum of.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I am very sorry for it. - A. It is the custom of the trade.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It is certainly the greatest encouragement in the world to persons inclined to be dishonest.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you paid him any money lately? - A. Not very lately.</p>
               <p>Q. In October last? - A. No; I did not, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have bought frequently of him? - A. Not very frequently.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That is a very wide word; have you a dozen times, think you? - A. Yes; I think I have.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have known Aldred some time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a cart of his own? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he might have sent it by his own cart? - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. The goods you bought you could not have sworn to? - A. The prosecutor came to me twice; I told them they were perfectly welcome to look all over my metal; and they said they could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I shall take it for granted, that if the prosecutor could not swear to it, you could not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ward. Q. Do you think there was any thing improper in the prosecutor coming to search your house? - A. They behaved very insolent; they halloa'd in the street in the hearing of my neighbours, "this is stolen copper," when I knew they could not swear to it; and I think that was very insolent.</p>
               <p>Aldred's defence. I never had a farthing's worth of this copper.</p>

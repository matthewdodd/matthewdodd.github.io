                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman, and live a Mr. Tipple's farm-house, near Hoxton-town. On Sunday morning, the 4th of Decem<lb></lb>ber, about half-past one o'clock, I was going up Sun-street and met the prisoner—we got in deep conversation together, and walked on—we turned down Long-alley, and went as far as the new market—we went down a court, down one step—the prisoner then gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and wanted to set rather rude—I would not let him, and he struck me over the eye and took two shawls from my shoulders—with that he went away from me—he snatched them off my neck before I was aware of it—my eye bled—the blow almost stunned me—he was taken in about five minutes, not above four or five yards from the spot—the shawls were not found.</p>

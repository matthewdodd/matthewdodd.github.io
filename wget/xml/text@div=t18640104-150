On the evening of 17th December, about 8 o'clock, I saw the prisoner leave Mr. Suttaby's premises—I noticed a small parcel in his hand—I followed him into Fleet-street, stopped him, and told him I believed he had got some property belonging to his master, some books—he said, "No, I have not"—I said "Are you quite sure that you have not?"—he said, "Yes; I have no books at all about me"—I then took him back to his master's warehouse and searched him, and in his right-hand coat-pocket I found this Bible; there is no private mark in it—he gave his address, 36, Nelson-square, Blackfriars-road—I went there, and searched the premises, and found eighty other books, consisting principally of Bibles, Church-services, and Prayer-books—I had no conversation with the prisoner about those books; I spoke to him about the one found in his possession, and asked how he accounted for it—he said he was going to take it to show it to a lady.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nephew to Mr. Suttaby, and am engaged in his business—the prisoner was not authorized to remove any books from the premises—this Bible is our property—a short time ago, I saw a book in the prisoner's drawer; I marked it; it ought not to have been there; it was subsequently found at his lodging among the others—I have looked at all the books—they are Mr. Suttaby's property.</p>

Q.</hi> Had the prisoner been seven years in Mr. Suttaby's employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About that time—he is married—I don't know that he occasionally took home books and returned them afterwards—I have had no conversation with him about the binding of these books—I did not know that his wife was learning the bookbinding; I do not know it now—I was never at his lodging till I went there with the detective—the books are not all Bibles and Prayer-books, some are poets and authors.</p>

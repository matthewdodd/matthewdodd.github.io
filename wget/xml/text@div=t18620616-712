                  </hi>. I am manager of the Anchor and Castle public-house in Tooley-street—on 5th June the prisoner came to the house and asked for half a pint of porter, and tendered in payment a shilling, I gave him change and he went away—I discovered the shilling was bad, and laid it on a shelf behind the bar—he came in again about half an hour afterwards and asked for half a pint of porter and a screw of tobacco, which was twopence—I served him, and he gave me a bad shilling—I jumped over the bar and kept him till I gave him in custody—I kept one shilling in my hand, asked the landlady to give me the other, and I gave them both to the constable.</p>

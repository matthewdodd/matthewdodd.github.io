On the 14th of January, about five o'clock in the evening I heard of this, and went as I was directed; I saw Howard carrying one cheese, and another person carrying one - Howard turned his head, saw me, and dropped his cheese and ran off; his companion saw that, and he dropped his cheese; I pursued them both some distance, but I thought I might lose my cheeses; I returned and took them up - in a few minutes Howard was brought back, and I knew him; these are my cheeses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You pursued two persons? A. Yes; it was dusk - there were a great many persons passing - they had their backs towards me, but Howard turned his face, and I can speak confidently to him; I knew him as soon as he was brought back.</p>

             GREGORY. My husband lives opposite the prosecutor. On the 14th of January I was sitting in our shop - I saw Rust go to the prosecutor's and take two cheeses; I did not see any other person - he turned a corner.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go into a private Room with her?</p>
               <p>Hyrons. I do not know - I went up Stairs with her; missing my Watch, I went down, and asked a Man that was in the House where the Woman was, and he threatened to push me out of Doors; I went out, and he shut the Door against me; I staid some time at the Door, and a Watchman coming by, I told him what had happened, and what I had lost; he asked me what manner of a Person the Woman was, I described her Person to him, says he, I believe I know her, but I cannot get in, because the Door is shut; the Constable ordered me to come the next Day to an Alehouse in Creed-lane; and then I lighted of her, and had her up to Guildhall, before the Alderman, in Person, and charged her with picking my Pocket; she said, she did not pick my Pocket, but knew who had got the Watch - I was no longer with her above Stairs than while we drank the Liquor, which I believe was between six and seven Minutes - there was no body in the Room but the Woman who brought up the Liquor, and she went away directly - I had it in my Waistcoat Pocket, but I did not pull it out while I was in the House - I did not miss it before she went out of the Room, but I missed it before I went out of the Room - I did not sit down, I stood all the Time we drank the Liquor - I never had my Watch again.</p>

            . As I was beating my Rounds, at half an Hour after One, I saw the Prosecutor at the Door (I believe if I had come two Minutes sooner, I had prevented his being turned out of the House) says he, Watchman, I am turned out of this House; then, says I, why did you go into it; the Neighbours<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174309070015"></xptr> cried out to me, you Rogue, why don't you call the Constable, and break the Door open; the Prosecutor said, he had lost his Watch; said I, if you can give me any Description of the Person who took it, I will endeavour to find out the Woman, that is, the Prisoner at the Bar, she knows me well enough, she need not look at me. I went and got a Nap of Sleep, and went in the Morning to see how Things stood, and the House was close shut up. I told Mr Owen the Constable, I believed I should have a Jobb for him about 11 o'Clock; the Prosecutor came to the Alehouse about 11 o'Clock next Morning, and asked me if I would have any Beer, said I, Let us do Business first; I saw Madam and her Partner coming by about half an Hour after 11; thinks I you are the Woman that has the Watch; said I, she is gone into that House; the Windows were broke, but Bawdy-houses generally are so. I spoke thro' the Windows; the Prosecutor went for a Warrant, and after he was gone, she pushed out, I took hold of her, and would not part from her; said I, as there is a Robbery swore against you, I will keep you. There came a Man out, and asked me what I had to do with his Wife; said I, D - n your Wife, what's your Wife to me, I do not mind your Wife. She said, she did not pick his Pocket, but she knew who had the Watch.</p>

            . The Prisoner lodged with me in Grays-Inn-Lane about two Months, till the Time she was taken up. I never knew her to stay out till nine o'Clock. I saw that Night that she came in in due Time; I think it was on a Tuesday, she came Home that Night about eight o'Clock, and did not go out after that - I went to Bed about ten, - she could not get out without my knowing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take the Key up to Bed with you.</p>
               <p>Kelly. No, I commonly leave the Key in the Door. The next Morning she desired me to mend a Slit in her Shoe, about seven o'Clock. She sells Fruit.</p>
               <p>Patrick Wall. I saw the Prisoner come in that Night at eight, and she bid us Good-morrow when she went out in the Morning about seven.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Boot public-house, Cromer-street, Bruns-wick-square, in the parish of St. Pancras. I have seen a cask of rum in the possession of the policeman, and know it to be mine by the quantity and quality marked on it in ray own hand—(<hi rend="italic">examining it</hi>)—it contains rum, which cost me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. without the cask.

               <p>the 12th of February, about seven o'clock, when the policeman gave me information, I examined, and found the bolts of the cellar-flap withdrawn, and the chain off, which would enable a person to get down into the cellar from the outside—the cellar is part of the dwelling-house—the cask bad been delivered at my house on Thursday, the 10th—the brewer's men generally fasten the flap when they come—I think I had seen it fattened on the Thursday—I found four or five bottles of wine broken in the cellar, one with the neck broken off and empty, as if it had been drank out of—three or four had the corks knocked in, and were drank from—two gallons of shrub were moved from the beer to the wine-cellar—the cellar flap was down on Friday—the brick-work from the flap into the cellar slopes, and there is a sort of wet slimy mould on it—there was the impression of corded trowsers on that—I found two or three phosphorus matches in the cellar, which are things I do not use—the prisoner Clarke had corded trowsers on—I should say the impressions were such as those trowsers would make—I first noticed the impressions at seven in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live at No. 3, Brunswick-street. On Saturday morning, the 12th of February, between two and three o'clock, I was disturbed, and thinking it might be time to get up I got a light, and finding I was before my time, which is five, I went outside, and there was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> standing in the street—I came in again, and, a considerable time after, heard the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drive off—my street leads from Cromer-street into the New-road—the prosecutor's house is several doors round the corner—the prisoner Bryant drove the cab—it stood nearly a dozen doors from Speedy's, as I thought, at the corner of Brunswick-street—it was certainly before four that I saw it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bryant's Defence.</hi> I was going up the New-road, towards the railroad, about ten minutes past three o'clock, I met a gentleman at the corner of a street, who said, "Are you hired;" I said, "No;" he said, "Can you carry this, come round here;" he sat on the box, and took me round; his two friends came and got into the cab; he said, "Drive over the water, and over Blackfriars-bridge;" he directed me up Gravel-lane to Green-street; I stopped there; he opened the door, let his friends out, and said, "Go on;" I said, "Where?" he said, "Go into the Borough-road, I will show you;" he said, "Can you get any gin?" I said, not at that time; he said, "Go on, go on;" he opened the door, got out, and said, "When are you going?" a policeman came and followed him; he ran away; the policeman said, "Stop," and I stopped momentarily; Clarke was running, and the policeman caught him, but I never saw him till he was in custody.</p>

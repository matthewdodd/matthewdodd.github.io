                  </hi>. I am the assistant curate of the parish church of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—it is my duty to enter the marriages in the register book—this is the register which I now have before me—on the 11th of September, 1859, there is an entry of a marriage between Louis Gashion and Alice Betts—I celebrated that marriage—when the parties came into the vestry I asked them first of all their names, taking the boy first—he said his name was Louis Gashion and that he was 18 years of age—as is usual when persons are under age, I asked whether he had got any parents—he said they were both dead—I asked whether he had not an uncle or guardian—he said he had—I said that he must give his consent to the marriage, or else I should not marry them—we never many persona under age unless we have the consent of their guardians—upon my saying this, the prisoner presented himself—I think I told the clerk to call him in—he was outside the door—I first of all asked him what his name was—he said "William Gashion"—I said "Louis Gashion says that he has no father or mother, and that you are his natural guardian"—he said "I am," or "Yes"—upon that I said "Do you give your consent to this marriage between Louis Gaahion and Alice Betts?"—he said "Yes;" upon which I said "Are you not foolish in allowing such children to marry?"—he said there were particular circumstances in the case—as the girl was under age I said that her father must be present to give his consent—the prisoner then went out of the church to find the father of the girl—he brought him back with him and the parties were then married—my scruples were not removed; but I was obliged to marry them, the legal objection being removed—it is the custom to make all the entries in the egister, except the signatures, before the the marriage takes place, before the commencement of the ceremony, in one of the books, we keep two—we enter all the particulars of the marriage—the book before me is what is technically called the register—I made all the entries in respect of this marriage, except the signatures, in one of the books before the ceremony—I cannot say whether this is the book, I am not sure—the false entry would be in both books—this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001020059"></xptr>
               <p>is the register which I am bound to keep by Act of Parliament—the two books are copies, one of the other—we have not got the other book here—(<hi rend="italic">Entry read</hi>: "1859: Marriage solemnized at the Parish Church of St. Leon<lb></lb>ard's, Shoreditch, in the county of Middlesex, September 11th, 1859; Louis Gashion, 18, bachelor, gold case maker, 26 Old-street, and Alice Betts 18, spiuster, servant to Thomas Betts, silversmith: married according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England, after banns. Signed, Louis Gashion, Alice Betts, William Gashion, uncle to the man, Thomas Betts and Eliza Betts.")—the name "William Gasbion" is in the prisoner's writing, the words "uncle to the man," are in mine—I derived the information which caused me to make the entry, from the prisoner and also from Louis Gashion—after the marriage Louis Gashion, Alice Betts, Thomas Betts and Eliza Betts came into the vestry and signed the register in the usual course—as the prisoner had professed to be the uncle or guardian of the youth I in<lb></lb>sisted on his coming into the vestry and signing the register likewise—I called out rather loudly "William Gashion, you must come in and sign the register," and I pointed out to him the usual place for the witnesses to sign—I had not then written the words "uncle to the man"—I did not write those words until the Wednesday following—I should not have written those words unless he had said he was uncle to the man—I wrote them because I believed the statement he had made.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business in Brick-lane, St. Lukes—I have a brother named Louis—he will be 16 years old on the 20th of this month—he is the person who was married to Alice Betts—he has no uncle named William Gashion—up to the period of this marriage Alice Betts was a ser<lb></lb>ant in my employment, and, according to the best of my knowledge and belief, she is the prisoner's sister—she left me in August—I knew nothing about the marriage—the prisoner is on relation to me or to my family—I have seen him come into the house to ask for his sister, but nothing more than that—my brother Louis would be entitled to some money if he had behaved himself: it is in my power to prevent it—this signature "Louis Gashion" is my brother's writing—this signature "William Gashion," is the prisoneri's writing—there is no person named William Gashion.</p>

               <p>to the time that they were married I had not seen my mother, or father, or sister, or Louis Gashion, and on the Saturday, a week previous to the marriage, I heard through an aunt of mine that my sister was in the family way, and that young Louis Gashion was turned out of his brother's house, and my sister had gone ostensibly to another situation, but my mother went and inquired, and found she was not there. From subsequent inquiries they found that they were living together as man and wife, in firnished lodgings. My mother and father attempted to separate them. They quarrelled in the street, and Louis attempted to strike my father. The banns were published unknown to me a fortnight. I ran after Louis the length of the street, to inflict some personal chastisement for the injury he had done my sister, but he ran away. I saw nothing more of him till the Friday when they were to be married on the Saturday. My mother came and said, "Well, William, your sister is in the family way, so that they will be together, and they will be married on Saturday; your father is going, and he is so angry that unless there is somebody to represent then they will not be married; your sister is in that state that if you do not go they will have to pay somebody, and they are very poor." I consented afier a little while; I wanted nothing from them, I was earning thirty shilling! a week. I went and did it with an amiable intent, but I have done wrong, I know. I provided them with some food on the day they were married. He said, "I have an uncle living in the lane," meaning Petticoat-lane, "who has no objection to my getting married; he has supplied me with the money, but being a Jew, he will not go to church with me." I thought the difference of creed was the reason. He never promised me a halfpenny; he is in attendance now and you can examine him. I allowed them a trifle a week and did not see them till after I was taken, and I am keeping them at this present moment; that is all I know of the matter; I must leave it entirely in your hands. My mother is in attendance. I should like your Lordship to understand that I had no conception of the law connected with the case when I signed the book.</p>

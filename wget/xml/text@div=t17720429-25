            . On the 27th or 28th of April last year my bailiff informed me that he missed out of my flock four ewes and five lambs; I examined and found they were missing; I saw them myself a few days before; I knew the number, and could swear positively that I had lost them; apprehending they might be only strayed, I made a search in the neighbouring grounds, but not finding them I had a hand-bill printed, offering five shillings reward to any that would discover the offender; I published the bills on the 29th of April; on the next day Mr.

            , a butcher, of Twickenham, came to me, and informed me that he had some sheep in his possession that he believed might be mine; my bailiff went over to Twickenham, and knowing them to be mine he brought them over with him; I knew the ewes by the mark, that is, a red square mark on the back, and three large H's, one on each side, and one just over the rump; we suspected the prisoner; I knew the family; he lived at Brentford; I got a warrant for him, but, when an enquiry was made, he was not to be found, he had fled; so he was not taken by that warrant, but was taken by accident very lately.</p>

               <p>Davis. I had seen him before; he said they were his brother's.

               <p>George Savage. The Prisoner came to my Shop for a Piece of Cambrick, telling me it was for Mrs Webb; she desired to have a Piece at 3 s.6 d. a Yard,- the same sort with which I had served the Prisoner, for Mrs Webb, once before. I shewed her one Piece, but she did not like it; then I took 2 other Pieces out of a Box, and she said she liked the first Piece best. So I bid my Servant take the Book, and enter the Piece (which the Prisoner had chose) to Mrs Webb, and I went to the Compting-House, to make a Bill of Parcels. In the mean Time, my Servant put up the two Pieces which we had shewn the Prisoner, and one Piece was missing. I bid my Servant look carefull,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174007090020"></xptr> over the Pieces, lest we should make a Mistake. He told them over, and still one Piece was missing. The Prisoner being gone out of the Shop, I bid my Man go to Mrs. Webb's and enquire after her, but Mrs. Webb said she had not sent her. Upon this I went to Mrs. Webb, and asked her where the Prisoner lived? She told me she did not know, and made some Words. Then I went to another Friend, and having got Directions, I found the Prisoner, and charged her with a Fraud for one Piece, and with stealing another. I told her Mrs. Webb denied her being sent for Cambrick by her, and the Prisoner immediately said,- then I am ruined and undone' I then asked her where the Piece of Cambrick was, which she said was for Mrs. Webb? She told me it was at the Pawnbroker's; I went according to her Direction and found it; and on Account of this Piece, I indicted her for a Fraud. But I am sure I missed one Piece beside; and I have had several People with me, who have offered me Money not to prosecute; but we are so pestered with these Shoplifters, that we are not able to stand in our Shops .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bargained with him for one Piece at 27 Shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Savage. Yes, for Mrs. Webb at the Crown-Tavern in Smithfield as she said. I accordingly delivered it to her, and she desired me if I went to Mrs. Webb's, to take no notice to any Body,- not even to her Daughter, for Mrs. Webb, she said, would be a Customer to me, but there were so many Drapers in the Field, that she could not.</p>

            . I sent the Prisoner once to Mr Savage's for Cambrick, but not on the 3d of June. When I sent her, she paid for what she had. I have known her a pretty many Years; and believe she has been guilty of pawning things, but I imagine what she has pawned was returned again. I don't know of her ever having wronged me.</p>

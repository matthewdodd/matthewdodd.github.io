I was called down on Friday morning, the 16th of June, and heard that some persons had taken a ham from me - I went in pursuit of them, and found Taylor standing in Pugh's-row; Fransham came up soon afterwards, and they were taken, with the assistance of the constable. - The ham had been left with me, and was my property. I had not seen the prisoners about.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, near Mr. Budding's. On the 16th of June I saw the two prisoners coming up Little Simeon-street together - Fransham came out of the bake-house with the ham; Taylor was close by, waiting for him, and looking into the bake-house; they joined company together, and went away with the ham - I have not seen it since; they were taken about half-past seven o'clock that morning.</p>

            . I am a bonnet-maker, and live opposite Mr. Budding's side door. I saw the two prisoners go down the street on this morning, and then return; Fransham went into the house, and then came out with a ham, partly covered over with his coat - the other was waiting for him; they then went round the corner together - before I could get over Francham was off; the other was waiting at the top of the street. I have no doubt of their persons.</p>

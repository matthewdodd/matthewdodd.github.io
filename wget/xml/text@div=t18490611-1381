                  </hi>. I am a builder, at Willow-walk, Bermondsey—I know the prisoner well, he is a baker, and supplied me with bread—I have occa<lb></lb>tionally lent him money—I paid him what I owed him, and discounted two or three bills for him—I have known him for years—I have occasionally lent him a trifle—at the latter end of May he came to me and said he was very short of flour, and I knew he was rather poor in circumstances at the time, and he asked me whether I could change a bill for him, or get it done—I said, "What sort of a bill is it?"—he said, "If I get my brother-in-law, Henry Ashley, to draw a bill on Abraham Fuller, will you give me the money for it, or get it?"—I said I would—I knew Henry Ashley—he is not a person to whom I would give credit, and the prisoner knew that as well as I did—I know Abraham Fuller; I would give credit to him—I have known his father for years to be a respectable upright man, and I know the young man to be a respectable man—the bill was to be on Abraham Fuller, junior, the son—I afterwards saw the prisoner again by appointment at the Greyhound at Kennington—he then produced this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is drawn by Fuller on Ashley.</p>
               <p>Q. But you said just now it was to be drawn by Ashley on Fuller? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You misunderstood me—it was on the faith of Fuller's name being to it that induced me to give the money for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you ever seen Abrabm Fuller, jun., in your life at the time of this transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but not on this business till the bill became due—I knew him for years, and he knew me—I know Jones, of the Kent-road; he is of the Jewish persuasion—very likely he has a son in the profession in Chancery-lane—at the time he dis<lb></lb>counted this bill, he had 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bills, in which I was interested-they were all lost money except 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and this bill was among them—it bit cost me 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am not insolvent'—I placed no reliance on the prisoner as to his responsibility at all—he might have asked me to discount a bill if he could get Fuller to draw one on his brother-in-law, Ashley—it is a long time ago, but while Fuller's name was on the bill it was quite safe for me—I will not undertake to swear which way it was—I would not curse my soul for the sake of fifty bills—I swear I never said, that as long as he could get me Ashley's acceptance, I did not care if it was a sweep who drew the bill—I got 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 105., I think, from Jones for the bill—it was arranged be<lb></lb>tween me and the prisoner that I should keep 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to meet the bill when it became due—I am not a bill discounter—I have done very little in that line—very likely I have been the means of discounting 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bills in the last twelve months—I should think it was so many as 100 bills, I would not swear it was not—I swear it was not 200—I was very well acquainted with the prisoner, we used to drink at the same public-house almost every night—we were not friends after the bill arrived at maturity—I did not go to the same public-house as he, and drink with him after I was sued on the bill—I do not know what name is over the baker's shop which he kept—I think Ashley's name was, there is another name now—I do not know exactly how long Ashley has been gone away—I should think about fire or six months—in May, 1848, Abraham Fuller, jun., lived in Kennington lane—I then lived opposite Kennington Church, about ten minutes' walk from Fuller's—I never did anything in the bill line for Ashley—I had another bill of the prisoner about a fortnight after this one, and that turns out to be like this one—I never asked <hi rend="italic">the prisoner to endorse a bill-he</hi> would have done so if I had—I believe Jones sued Ashley—I had to pay the expenses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first inquire of Fuller, jun., anything about this bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, some considerable time afterwards—I went to him, and he denied its being his acceptance—I should think it was about two or three months after the bill was due that I met Fuller, and he declared <hi rend="italic">to me</hi> that it was a forgery—the bill was drawn on 29th May, at three months—I never booked ft because it was no ordinary business—I did it to accommodate the prisoner, and therefore I did not enter it—I do not know in what month it was that I met Abraham Fuller the younger, and spoke to him about it—I do not know whether it was in Oct., it was somewhere in the winter time—I think it was before the commencement of this year—I will not swear it was—I think Fuller was served with a writ for the bill—I have made this charge against the prisoner all through the piece—I told him it was a <hi rend="italic">forgery</hi>—I first made</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184906110117"></xptr>
               <p>the charge against him when I gave him into custody, I fancy; that was when last Session was going on—that was after Ashley, Fuller, and I had been sued—I spoke to Abraham Fuller about this bill the first time I saw him—I would not undertake to say when that was; it was more than two months, or five months ago—I swear that—I cannot say what month it was in—I had notice of the dishonour of the bill immediately on its being over due—I dealt with the prisoner for bread—I did not know Ashley in the business, I knew he was connected with the prisoner—I will not swear that his name was over the door, for I never saw it to my knowledge—I dealt with the prisoner be<lb></lb>fore he went to this shop, and I dealt with him there as soon as it opened, about two years since.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say at the time you discounted this bill there were a great many other bills in Jones's hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but they were my own, that I had received from parties in business—Jones would not let roe have one bill until I had paid the whole, or else I should have proceeded against the prisoner when this bill became due—I paid him about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. law expenses upon them—I did not get this bill from Jones above a month or a fortnight before I gave the prisoner into custody—I could not proceed before, because I bad not the document in my possession, don't you see.</p>

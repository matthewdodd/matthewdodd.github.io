The Prosecutor deposed, That there being a Company of People standing together, as he pass'd along his Handkerchief was pick'd out of his Pocket, but he knew not who did it. Another Evidence, a Lad, deposed, that as he was at work in his Master's Shop, he saw the Prisoner's Hand in the Prosecutor's Pocket, and saw him take the Handkerchief, upon which he ran to him and seized him, taxing him with stealing the Handkerchief, upon which the Prisoner gave it him, saying keep it, keep it; that then he held him, and carried him to the Prosecutor. The Prisoner denyed the Fact, saying he was going of an Errand and saw it lie on the Ground, and only took it up, and was for giving it the right Owner.

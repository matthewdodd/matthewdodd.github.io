               <p>Q. What followed then - what did you tell them when they asked you whether they had any money? - A. I told them they always had money when I was there; I was confined there a twelvemonth myself; Levy Cohen then took out the notes, and said, here are six fives, and five twos.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of notes did they appear to be? - A. I cannot read or write, but they appeared to me to look like Bank notes;

             said, do you think they will buy them; I said, I dare say they would, and gave Cohen the pocket-book again in his hand; they asked me when I would go to Jemmy Ogden and Ikey Bull, they told me to ask them twenty-five pounds for the notes, and to take no less; I told them I would go towards the evening, and towards the evening I went to the Blue Anchor in Petticoat-lane, and there I saw Cohen and Jacobs; then we all three went together as far as Newgate-street, and at the corner of Newgate-street I left them; Levi Cohen gave me the pocketbook, and said, mind, take no less than twenty-five pounds for the forty pound's worth of notes; then I went into Newgate, and saw James Ogden, I sold him the pocket-book for twenty-five pounds, he gave me three five pound notes, and the rest in cash.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else present when you sold them to Ogden? - A. Yes, Ikey Bull, and

No, I had not; they told the coachman to drive to Whitechapel, and desired me to call at the Blue Anchor in Petticoat-lane; I afterwards went to the Blue Anchor, and told them I met a girl in Cheapside, and sent her to tell them; and that Jemmy Ogden had told her I might go to hell, and she along with me;

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more about it? - A. Yes; I went along with the thieving boy who lives with Cohen; Cohen asked him if he knew a good sence, Jacobs was present.</p>
               <p>Q. What is a sence? - A. A receiver of stolen goods; they would not trust the boy to go alone, and desired me to go with him; I went with him, and took a pocket-book with forty pound's worth of notes in it, to one Jacobs, a glass-flowerer, in Petticoat-lane, the boy gave Mr. Jacobs the notes; Jacobs took the notes in his hand, but refused to keep them, because, he said, they were all forged; I went back with the boy, and told them what he said; the pocket-book and notes were returned to the prisoners; and that is all I know.</p>

            They came into the room, and asked my husband if he knew James Ogden and Ikey Bull; and he told them, yes; they asked him if he was a man worth money; and he said, he always had a guinea or two; he said, he had some notes, and if he would sell them for twenty-five pounds, he would make it well worth his while, and pay him for his trouble; my husband took the notes in his hand; he then gave him the notes back, and what became of them afterwards I don't know; my husband went out with them, but whether he went to sell the notes or not I cannot say.</p>

William Cuthbert depos'd, that hearing a Woman cry stop Thief, and perceiving the Prisoner running apace, he stood to receive him, and threw up his Heels. The Prisoner beg'd to be let go, for he was pursued by Bailiffs. But he (this Evidence) told him, he should go back to the Woman first. The Watch quickly came to their Assistance, and secur'd him. The Prisoner in his Defence said, that as he was going to Execution-Dock, a Man clapt him on the Shoulder, and he being under fear of an Arrest, thought it had been a Bailiff, and so took to his Heels, which was the only Reason of his running up Burr Street. <rs id="t17241204-34-verdict198" type="verdictDescription">

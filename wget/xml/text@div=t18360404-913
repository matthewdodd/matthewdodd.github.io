                  </hi>. I live at Newington butts, On the 28th of March I was coming from Shutwark, over London bridge, between seven and eights o'clock at night—in passing over he bridge, near fishmonger's hall, I saw three men near me—I walked on to the print shop, near the ham-and beef shop. and was completely pinned in by three men—I made a wrench to get out of their hands, and placed my hand on my book, as I had just came from the Borought bank—I felt a man's fingers under my book—I wrenched myself round, and seized the prisoner by the neck—I said, "You cannot get from me you have robbed me"—a man came up and said."He has picked your pocket of you handkerchief"—the pri<lb></lb>soner then dropped it, and I put my foot on it—the person that pinned me were the same as I had seen before, and the prisoner was one of them—I saved my book—I had observed three very suspicious-looking men against Mr. Humphry's tavern but I could not say that the prisoner was one of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The handkerchief was put on my arm by a young man. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, you dropped it from your sleeve—the other man was much shooter he endeavouered to trip me up.</p>

               <p>as I got opposite Effingham and Wilson's I saw the prisoner take his hand from the gentleman's pocket as the handkerchief in it—I collarad him, and so did the prosecutor—there were two others who ran away.</p>

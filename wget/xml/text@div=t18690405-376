                  </hi>. My wife keeps a milliner's shop, at 42, Pitfield Street—on 19th March, a woman named Davis (<hi rend="italic">See next case</hi>) came in for a bonnet shape—my wife served her—Davis gave me a half-crown—I broke it in half, showed it to her, and told her it was bad—she said that she would go and get it changed where she took it, as she had only one penny—I gave it back to her—she left and I followed her—soon she joined a woman very like the prisoner, but whose face I could not see, about ten yards from my shop—they went down Royal Oak Passage, where I saw Davis pass to the woman the two pieces of a half-crown—I turned back, and stood on the opposite side—they stood on a grating, and the woman who I think is the prisoner, put something down an area—I followed them, and saw the woman like the prisoner go into a chandler's shop—when she came out I went in and asked a question, and then followed them to East Road, to Mr. Green's shop—Davis waited outside and the other woman went in—I went in and asked what she had tendered—Mr. Green showed me a good shilling—Davis then went to Mrs. Brown's shop and the other woman waited outside—I went in while she was there, and was just in time—Mrs. Brown showed me a half-crown, which I broke in half, and kept one piece and gave Mrs. Brown the other—I said, "This is a bad half-crown"—Davis said, "Yes, it is; I am an unfortunate girl; a gentleman gave it me"—I said, "That is a different tale to what you told me in my shop"—she said, "I was never in your shop"—I said, "Yes, I followed you all the way"—I detained her till a policeman came—I asked a gentleman to stop the other woman, but he would not, and she went off—Davis struggled and tried to get away—the people would have rescued her if three or four gentlemen had not helped me—I gave her in charge with the pieces of the half-crown.</p>

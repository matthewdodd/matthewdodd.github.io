On the 30th of July I had come from Warwickshire where I had just left a gentleman's service, and got to town about twelve or one o'clock at night; I went to the Prince of Wales public-house, then took a walk to Westminster; I went to the Crown public-house, and had a few pints of beer - I do not know what street it is in; several soldiers were there; I asked the people of the house to give me change for a 5l. note - the prisoner was one of the <rs id="t18280911-129-deflabel674" type="occupation">soldiers</rs>

            . I belong to the 3d regiment of foot, the prisoner was in that regiment; I saw Bickley give him the note at the Blue Anchor public-house to go and get it cashed - he said he could not go so far, and returned it; I did not see it given again - I do not think the prosecutor was sober.</p>

            . I am beadle of King-square, Goswell-road. Early on Sunday morning the prosecutor came and gave this account; I went with him to Portman-square barracks in the evening, and saw the prisoner - I thought him tipsy; he said he had never seen the prosecutor before - he seemed to know what he was saying; he told us to come next morning, and he would talk to us- we went; he said he had burnt it, as it was a bad note - the prosecutor said it was good; he said, "If you recollect I gave it you back;" Bickley said he had given it to him again; he said, he knew he had, and he had burnt it; I asked the prisoner if he had offered him half a crown to go - he said, he did, and that the Bank was closed when he went.</p>

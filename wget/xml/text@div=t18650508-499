                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger at 16, Langley-place, Commercial-road—on the night of 1st May I was in Little George-street, between half-past ten and eleven, when the prisoner came up to me snatched my watch, and ran away—I ran after her, and as I ran I was knocked down by a man; I got up again and still followed her—I overtook her in one of the streets, I don't know the neighbourhood—I said, "Give me my watch,"</p>

               <p>she said she had not got it—I understood she had let it fall or thrown it—down—I caught hold of her hand and took the watch from her—shortly afterwards I saw a policeman and gave her in charge, this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is a valuable watch, a key was attached to it at the time, that was produced by another constable, this is it, when I took the watch from the prisoner, the key was not with it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi> 559.) I received a description from another officer on the night of 2d May, and in consequence took the pri<lb></lb>soner into custody about two minutes after—I said I should take her on suspicion of robbing a gentleman a few minutes ago in Little George-street, she said, "Oh dear me, don't take me, it is not me"—I said, "I will take you round to the next street and if it is not you, you shall go"—I took her round there and saw the constable and the prosecutor together—he said, "That is the woman that robbed me of my watch"—I said, "Give me the watch"—he said, "No, I shall take care of it myself"—she said, "Pray don't give him the watch, pray don't give him the watch"—she said that she was innocent.</p>

I received information from the prosecutor—he pointed out the direction in which the prisoner had gone—I saw the prisoner at the time running up Little George-street—I went round Jewry-street and thought I should meet her, but I missed her—I afterwards saw her in the custody of the last witness—I picked up this key at four o'clock on the following morning in Little George-street—the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>

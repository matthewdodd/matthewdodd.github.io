                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at Wandsworth police court. I was in attendance there on 15th Nov.—Mr. Beadon was the presiding Magistrate—the police sheet was laid before him in the ordinary course—I took a short note of what took place—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in my own writing—the defendant was sworn and examined as a witness in my presence</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185401020081"></xptr>
               <p>—a person named Twilley was the defendant—Hume said, "This morning, at 20 minutes to 2 o'clock, at Merton Rush, the defendant came up very drunk, and began knocking a man about, and a disturbance was likely to ensue; I told the defendant to go; there were two policeman, Stephen Holmes and another, close by a beershop; I was not drinking with them; I saw pots about; he abused me, and knocked my hat off; I told him to go home, and he put his first in my face, and struck me in the mouth"—on that statement being made, Twilley, the defendant, made an excla<lb></lb>mation which was not taken down—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Looking at your note, tell us what he swore? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said, "There were two policeman, Stephen Holmes and another, close by a beershop; I was not drinking with them; I saw pots about; the two policemen went on before, and did not see the defendant strike me"; they had not any beer that I saw"—Mr. Beadon then ordered Hume out of Court, and asked for his witnesses—he was subsequently recalled, and pressed by the Magistrate on the subject of his drinking, whether there was any drinking outside the beershop, how many policemen there were, and if he himself had drank—he said neither had he drank, or his brother constables, and that there was no drinking outside the beershop—those answers were not taken down; they were in effect the same as he had previously given—the case was then adjourned till the Monday following, and the charge against Mr. Twilley was then dismissed—he had not been kept in custody in the mean time—he was allowed to go at large on his promise to appear, and he did appear—as the charge was dismissed, no formal depositions were made out; there were merely minutes taken.</p>

F. Beadon, Esq.," is my writing, and this "W. F. B" are Mr. Beadon's initials, in his own writing—I sign his name by his authority—when a person is discharged, I mark him discharged.</p>

When he asked me if there <hi rend="italic">were</hi> any beer and constables, I said "no," for which I am truly <hi rend="italic">sorrow</hi>, and deserve not any longer to be retained in the force. I have been in a fever ever since about it, and couldn't take my duty, all through telling an untruth. If it had not been the constables from Tooting, it would not have happened at all. They asked for beer, and <hi rend="italic">gote</hi> 2 pots of ale, and paid for it 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. There were 5 <hi rend="italic">P. C's.</hi>, namely, Hunt, Howe, Holmes, Eggs, and myself, were there about 20 minutes, or little more altogether. We were there a little time before Twilley came up. One of the Tooting constables called on Twilley, but which I don't know, and that was the way he came into the company. There about 10 <hi rend="italic">minits</hi> from the time of Twilley coming up till the <hi rend="italic">P. C's.</hi> left for Tooting. Just when they, the <hi rend="italic">P. C's.</hi>, were going to make a move, Twilley took hold of <hi rend="italic">P. C.</hi> Holmes' <hi rend="italic">cloths</hi>, and pulled him about; and he, Holmes, was not very well pleased about him doing so. He, Twilley, knocked off a <hi rend="italic">P. C.'s</hi> hat. I do not know of him saying to Twilley about it, but I said to <hi rend="italic">them</hi> to behave himself, and not make any disturbance; he, Twilley, <hi rend="italic">come</hi> and knocked <hi rend="italic">of</hi> my hat. I pushed him; he, being drunk, fell to the ground; and he <hi rend="italic">gote</hi> up, and struck at me in the mouth. I prevented him from <hi rend="italic">hiting</hi> me <hi rend="italic">hearer</hi> by <hi rend="italic">putting</hi> out my arm, and being drunk, fell to the ground the second time, and I took him into custody for assaulting me. The <hi rend="italic">P. C's.</hi> were on <hi rend="italic">there</hi> way home when Twilley was taken into custody. I cannot say more about the affair. I am truly <hi rend="italic">sorrow</hi> for what has happened. Did not know that Twilley would speak of the beer; he was the cause of the disturbance. I told a falsehood unwittingly, and am ashamed and <hi rend="italic">sorrow</hi> for it. I hope that Mr. Beadon will consider the case. It is the first time that I have disgraced myself. I expect to be dismissed the Police, and punished like<lb></lb>wise; but <hi rend="italic">there</hi> is pity in such a case; we are all ready to err from the path of duty. I hope Mr. Bicknell pity us. <hi rend="italic">P. C.</hi>, Geo. Hume."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cattle dealer on commission, and live on Wandsworth-common. On Monday, 14th Nov., I was at Kingston fair with my brother—when we came from the fair we went into the town, and stop<lb></lb>ped there some time; we had something to drink—we came from the town together in a little chaise—we came up with a friend of my brother's, in Coombe's-lane, and I got down and walked—when I got to the Leathern Bottle beer shop, at Merton, I saw five policemen; I did not see what they were doing then, but one of them called to me, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">Charley!"</hi>—I</p>

               <p>stopped, and he said, "Will you have any beer?"—I will not swear which of them it was, but I believe it was Howe—they were all standing there drinking at the door of the public house; it was then near 2 o'clock in the morning—the house appeared to be closed—they had got some beer in a can, and were pouring it into a pint pot; I drank some of it—one of them, I do not know which, said they had got half a gallon of ale—they were near enough together to hear what was said by any of them—we paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece round, me, and the five policemen; that made 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—no more beer was got from the house—one of them said to me when I was drinking, "Your pot is as good as anyone else's;" and I said, "I will <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a pot"—one of the others said, "We cannot have any more beer to-night; we hare just called them up, and got this half gallon, and we must not call them up any more"—I drank out of the pot, and gave it back to one of them, who drank again—after that we put the pot and can down, and all moved away from the house—after we had finished drinking we paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, the fire policemen and me—we were about ten minutes drinking at the door of the Leathern Bottle, and then all started together till we got into the road—the house lies a little way back—when we got into the road I will not say positively what passed; I might have got <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> with the others; we were all very good friends together, and the prisoner Hume tripped me up with his foot, and threw me down on my back—I think there were only three policemen present at that time, but I will not say positively whether the other two had gone or not—after Hume had tripped me up, I said, "Don't you do that again, or you will shake me all to pieces"—as soon as I had said that he tripped me up again, and it actually stunned me; I did not know where I was at that time—they got me up again, and when I recovered myself I said, "You mark my words, to-morrow morning I will report you for this"—as soon as I said that he took me by the arm, and said, "I will learn you to insult police constables; I will take you to the station house;" and he said to Howe, "You must come with me"—the three constables left with me were Hunt, Hume, and Howe—as we were going along to the station, one of them said, "I suppose you would sooner go home than go to the station?"—that was either Hume or Howe—I said, "No; you have begun it, you may keep on with it"—I went down to the station house, and the charge was taken by sergeant Reed—I heard Home give the charge—he charged me with being drunk and assaulting the policemen, and with striking him—I moved the iron bar up, went to sergeant Reed, and asked him if I was drunk; he said I was not—Hume was in the station at this time—he and Howe heard what I said to Reed—I said, "Am I tipsy?" and he said, "No, you are not now"—at the time I was at the Leathern Bottle I was not drunk; I might have been drinking a little drop, but I was quite capable of taking care of myself and knowing what I was about—I was kept at the station all night, and on Tuesday morning, the 15th, I was taken before a Magistrate, and heard the evidence that Hume gave against me for assaulting him; I then asked the Magistrate if he would allow me to speak, as it was false, and I told him the truth, that I got out of my brother's chaise to let a friend get up, and walked, meeting nobody till I got to the Leathern Bottle, when I met the police<lb></lb>men, who asked me to drink, and that I drank with them—the Magistrate adjourned the case for further inquiries till Monday, the 21st, when I went before him again, and he dismissed the case, and said he should put it before the Commissioners.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a police constable of the V division—I am not now in the force—I was on 14th Nov., and was on duty in Kingston—I left Kingston after the fair with Holmes, a constable in the same division—we were dismissed by the inspector about 1 o'clock in the morning—as</p>

               <p>we came away we saw the defendant near Merton, with Howe, another policeman—we wanted some beer, and I asked if there was any house open—we met Hunt, and walked together until a light was turned on, and Hunt walked on ahead, thinking it was the sergeant, but it was these two constables—we all five went to the Leathern Bottle—Hume knocked first, and no answer was made, and then Howe went and knocked—the attention of some person inside was attracted, and we got half a gallon of ale-Holmes paid for it—after we began drinking it, Twilley came up—I think he was asked by one of the constables to join the party—we five constables and Twilley drank it between us—Twilley said it would be 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece—I paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Twilley, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Hume, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Howe, 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that made 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was given to Hume—I said what was deficient I would pay half of, and I gave him 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we then left the Leathern Bottle—the house stands back a little from the road—when we got into the road, Holmes and I went home, leaving the other three there—Twilley came on with us—he was an old acquaintance of ours—my district is Tooting, which is three miles and a half off—next afternoon the defendant and Holmes came to my house about 12 o'clock—I cannot exactly swear to the words, but he said, "I locked Twilley up," and that he told the Magistrate he was drinking with five constables, and that the inspector perhaps would come and make inquiries—he said, "Say that you saw no beer, and that you never saw Howe there, but met him at a distance away from the house"—I believe those are the words, but I cannot swear it, as it is so long ago—I believe it was to say that we did not see him with Twilley, but coming towards home.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a Tooting policeman. I have been discharged, and in prison fourteen days for violation of duty at the Leathern Bottle—I was there on the morning in question—constables Hunt, Hume, Howe, and Higgs were also there—Hume commenced calling the parties up, and then Howe—some one came to the window, then came down, and put out half a gallon of ale in a can and a pint pot—we five constables commenced drinking it, and after some time Twilley came by—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the person we got it of—I cannot say whether it was a man or a woman—Hume collected 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid it to me—I cannot say whether Twilley paid anything; he drank some of the ale—we drank it all between us—we left Twilley with Hunt, Hume, and Howe, and went away.</p>

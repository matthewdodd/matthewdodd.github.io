On the 27th of August, between ten and eleven in the evening, I was at work; I looked up, and saw the prisoner walking out of the shop; there was no person in the shop but me; I immediately followed the prisoner; I saw him take his old hat off, and put the new one on; I immediately seized the new hat with my right hand, and the prisoner with my left, and brought him bark to the shop. I am sure the new hat I saw him put on his head, belonged to the shop; a few minutes before, I had just finished it. I gave the prisoner into the custody of an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mrs. Bloomfield - A. In the side-room; she knew nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS JACKSON. I am the constable that took the prisoner into custody. This is the hat. On Sunday morning, he told me he bought the hat at that shop, or the next shop; I could not find any shop that a hat had been bought and not carried away.</p>
               <p>Smeeth. That hat is the property of my employer; it is worth twenty shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Joseph Railton and another, of Regent-street. About five o'clock on the evening of the 7th of January, the prisoner came and asked to look at some sarsnet ribbon, at about eightpence a yard—I showed her some at eightpence halfpenny—she asked if I had any wider—I went to see, and on returning to the drawer, I missed one piece of ribbon—I looked at her, and saw it under her cloak—I rolled up the ribbon and put the drawer on one side—I called some young men, who came, and I took the ribbon from her—this is it—it is worth about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it has our shop mark on it—I had not shown her this, but it was in the drawer—I had shown her some beaver ribbon—the did not say any thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I was sent for, and took the prisoner—she said she knew nothing at all about it, and she never took it—she repeated that a great many times—I asked where she had been—she said with a friend in St. Martin's-lane, taking a glass of rum—I said I smelt she had been drinking—I should not think she was in such a state as to have made a blunder in taking any thing up—she had been drinking.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I went in and asked for a yard and a half of drab sarsnet ribbon—he asked me why a pink would not do—I saw a drab, and told him to serve me with that, but I still had the pink in my hand—the other shop<lb></lb>man asked what I was going to do with that—I said, "Nothing"—he took it out of my hand, and said 1 was drunk—I did not know the officer was gone for, the shopman took the ribbon to the gas, looked at it, and then brought it back, and put it under my shawl.</p>

No, I measured none—she asked for beaver ribbon, and I showed her one she did not like—I went to another part of the shop, and when I returned, I missed this one, which I saw she had.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">ATKINSON</hi>. I was in the shop, and was called by Asbridge, who said he missed a piece of ribbon, and this woman had it under her right arm—there was an opening in her cloak, and I saw it—Asbridge took it from under her arm.</p>

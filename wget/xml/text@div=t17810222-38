            . I lost a counterpane on the 30th of January, a little before eight o'clock at night; it was hanging on a horse in the yard to dry. The prisoner lodged in the same house with me; he went through the passage into the yard. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220063"></xptr> saw him attempt to take the counterpane off the horse; the horse fell down and broke the window. I had a light in my room; the shutters were not shut, so I could see into the yard, he went back through the passage. I followed him with a candle in my hand and saw the counterpane under his arm in the street. I could not overtake him; he got off with it. About half or three quarters of an hour after I saw him stand talking with his wife at the corner of the street. I sent for a constable. The prisoner said he had not got it. I never found the counterpane again.</p>
               <p>- M'ALBAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I lodged with the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner go through the passage into the yard; he did not stay above a minute before I saw him come back through the passage again with a bundle under his arm. He walked very smart; the woman came from the back room, and followed him, but he went away. He came back again about an hour after.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be drunk or sober? - Sober. A constable was sent for who took charge of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>This yard is open to the people of this house and the next. There are four families live in rooms at the upper end; I live in the farthest. I was going into the yard; It was quite dark. I ran against the horse and it fell down and broke the window. Mrs. Bryan called out to know what was the matter? I said I had broke the window. She said if that was all never mind. I went into my room, and staid a quarter of an hour. Then I was going out for something for supper, and she came and said I had got her counterpane. I know nothing of it.</p>

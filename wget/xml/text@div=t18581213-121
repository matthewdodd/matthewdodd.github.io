                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop. On 19th Nevember, I had occasion to go to the police-court in Worship-street—I went in a cart drawn by a pony—I got there about 3 o'clock—I left my pony and cart outside in care of a little boy—I was in the court till 20 minutes after 4—I then missed my cart and pony, and the little boy; I gave information—on the 21st I found the cart under an arch of the railway at Mile-end.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer. On 19th November I was at the police-court, the prosecutor saw me, but I did not notice him—I left the court 20 minutes or half-past 4 o'clock—I went through Long-alley, Liverpool-street, to Mr. Phillip's, a mat merchant—I afterwards went to the King and Queen, in Hare-street, Bethnal-green—the prisoner came in there and asked me to stable his horse and cart—I asked him half-a-crown for it—he would not give that—I said, "Will two shillings do"—he agreed to that—I took in his horse and cart—he did not say where he had come from, only that he had come forty miles from the country—the horse and cart I took were what Mr. Booking had afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. On 19th November, I was at the Woodman public house—the last witness came in and told me something—I went to his stable, and saw a horse and cart, and the prisoner—Mr. Hill said, "This man</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185812130044"></xptr>
               <p>has come forty miles from the country, he wants to sell this horse and cart"—I saw the prisoner, and we made a bargain for it—3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the price—I gave him the money, he gave me a receipt—he could not write—the receipt was written out, and he put his mark to it—it was about 7 o'clock in the evening—the pony and cart that I bought were shown to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written.</hi>) On Friday, November 19th, I went to the Coal Exchange—I have been in the habit of doing so for years, to sell spectacles; some of the customers who dealt with me treated me to some rum—having had some drink previous I was quite intoxicated, and on my way home to Old Nichol-street, Shoreditch, I found myself in possession of a pony and cart—and I am quite at a loss to account how it came into my possession—I drove as well as I was able, through drink, to Old Nichol street to find a stable for it, and in the morning when I was sober to find the owner—I could'nt get one there—I took a lad with me, not being able to take care or drive myself—he drove to the Woodman, Bethnal-green road—when I was inquiring for a stable, a greengrocer said he could put it up for me; he wanted 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but agreed to take 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I got out of the cart and went into the Woodman—the boy went with the pony and cart to see where they were going to put it, and said they put it in a stable under the railway-arch, and during the time the boy was going they persuaded me to sell it, and said they'd give me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—they say I gave a receipt for the money—I cannot read or write—a gentleman seeing the state I was in, saw me home with the boy Henry Butler; my son-in-law gave him one shilling for seeing me home—I recollect nothing of the affair until it was named to me by my wife the following morning—I went on Sunday evening to the Woodman to ask particulars, where I was taken, into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner came to our door last Friday, three weeks—he was so drunk that he fell on the floor—two men were obliged to pick him up—he asked whether we knew where there was a stable to let, and two boys drove the horse and cart towards the house—this was between 5 and 6 o'clock—the prisoner went away with the two boys—he came back afterwards and had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his pocket—he said he did not know where the horse was gone to—another man led him in—that was between 8 and 9 o'clock—where I live is a beer-shop—when the prisoner first came, he had a pint of beer—he did not know what he was doing then, he was quite tipsy—when he came back, he had half a pint more beer—I went home with him to show him where he lived, and when he got in he fell across the bedstead.</p>

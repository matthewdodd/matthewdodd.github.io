             and her daughter - A. Yes; and the next day, about twelve o'clock, she looked at Covington's door. She said, he was robbed as well as she, and that his property was at Wayman's, in the City-road. She said, she knew where there were a good deal of property, shirts and linen, and if I could spare six or seven pounds, I might buy a bargain, if I could keep a secret, and not tell Mr. Covington; that nothing could hurt her. I said, I had no money to spare. After that time there was no peace in the house. She was always scolding me, as she knew I knew all.</p>
               <p>Q. When Covington came to town did you tell him all you knew respecting it - A. I gave him the information I have given you. About a week after he took me up.</p>

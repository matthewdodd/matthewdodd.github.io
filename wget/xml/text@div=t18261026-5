On the 26th of September, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was returning home from Holborn - I was alone; it was dark, and not very moon-light, and in the <placeName id="t18261026-5-crimeloc24">Back-road, by Camden-town</placeName>

I was examined at Hatton-garden. He merely said, "You have, and I will have it."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never say, "D-n you, I will have it?" A. After that he did - he then snatched a paper parcel out of my hand, containing eight yards of lace, and two yards of net; he took 3s. in money out of my left hand - he opened my hand by force, and took it - he then took hold of me with both his hands, then let go with his right-hand, and took a knife from his left-side pocket, held it in his hand, and said if I did not give up what money I had got, he would kill me - it was not a case-knife, nor a clasp one, but a long one, like a butcher's - he held me a few minutes, and then let me go, as I heard footsteps. I was a good deal frightened - my shawl came off one shoulder with his holding me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did this last? A. About ten minutes; I could see him by the light which came from the lodgegate - he appeared to be dressed in dark clothes, with a rough light great coat; he appeared to be in a sailor's dress - he had a short jacket under his coat; he had trousers on. I saw him again on the 28th, two days after, at the office, in the lock-up-room, with seven others, and knew him - I fixed on him myself - he stood in the centre of them; I heard him speak in the lock-up-room, and knew his voice again also. Nobody passed while he was robbing me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the robbery were you getting home? A. Nearly half an hour; I saw my fellow-servant, Thomas, on the road, about a quarter of an hour after I was robbed, and told him - I described the prisoner to him. - When I got to the lock-up-room he appeared to be in the same dress, only without his coat; he had very full hair, combed over his face - it is cut now. I believe him to be the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Have you always given the same account of this transaction? A. Yes. I told the officer his hair was combed, and appeared like whiskers, not that he had large whiskers; I had never seen him before - it lasted about ten minutes. The lodge is not far from the bridge, about a hundred yards I should think; it was light, for the lodge door was open; I did not observe what light it was - I was over the bridge, exactly opposite the lodge gate, and the door was open. When I was in the lock-up-room, Pendergrass told me to look among the prisoners; I said, that was him who stood in the middle - I never said he was not there;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260007"></xptr>nobody pointed him out to me. The prisoner used no violence to me. I know the charge affects his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, be careful, considering the very short time you was with him, can you positively swear to him? A. I am sure it was him.</p>

            . I belong to the Police. About half-past ten o'clock on the night of this robbery I saw the prosecutrix: she described a person to me, as having a white-rough coat, dark clothes, a shiny hat, and large whiskers. On Thursday morning, the 28th, I found the prisoner at the watch-house; he answered her description, except not having whiskers; I fetched her to Hatton-garden, where she saw the prisoner among six or seven others; I said, "Be very particular and cautious what you say, for it is a very serious case, but if you see the man, say so" - I told them all to stand up, and said to her, "Which is the man" - she looked round, and said, "That is the man - I will swear it;" he stood in the centre of the others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then she described him as having whiskers? A. She did. He is materially altered since his apprehension; I cannot say whether he ever had whiskers; he has got his hair cut, and looks cleaner since he was taken; he had on the same jacket and trousers as he has now - it is a jacket used by sailors; she pointed him out in about two moments.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did she say to you he had whiskers, or like whiskers? A. When he was at Hatton-garden his hair was brought forward to the side of his face, which would appear like whiskers; she said, "Like whiskers."</p>

             - we live in Whitmore-row, Hoxton; Harding resided with me. On the 26th of September, the Tuesday before quarter-day, I remember the prisoner coming to my house, about half-past three or four o'clock in the afternoon - Mrs. Harding was at home when he came.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mr. Harding? A. I am not positive whether he was out at the time, or whether he went out directly after; I went out after tea myself - I drank tea at five o'clock, and went out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What, did they drink tea at five o'clock? A. Yes - Mr. Harding was not at home to tea.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Harding stay at home after his brother-in-law came, if he was at home? A. I cannot say - it might be a few minutes, or it might be longer; the prisoner drank tea there, and I left him there. I returned about half-past nine o'clock, and he was gone. Harding came home about ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sitting with them? A. No, not after the husband came home.</p>
               <p>After the Learned Judge had summed up the evidence this witness was re-examined.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE DRUMMOND. Harding does not board with us, but we frequently had our meals together. I rather think now that Mr. Harding did drink tea with us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a window-blind maker. On the 15th of July, between twelve and one o'clock, I went to a house in Union-street, Southwark, for a lodging—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and went to bed by myself—I wrapped my trowsers up, and put them between the mattress and bedstead, became there was no lock to the door—I awoke about four o'clock in the morning and saw the prisoner in my room—I said, "What are you doing here?"—she said, "I am only looking for my comb, Sir"—she said, "If it annoys you I can walk out," and she went out—I awoke again about a quarter to six o'clock—I turned the mattress down to look for my trowsers, and they were gone—I looked under the bed, and there they were—my purse was lying on my trowsers, and the money was gone—I was very tired but not drunk—I live in Fleet-lane, but I had forgotten to take my key when I went out in the morning to spend the day with a friend at Walworth, and I did not like to go to my own house to alarm my lodgers—but the reason I came to go to this place was there was a female crying, and she said, "Pray can you oblige me with a few halfpence, I have three children in Norwood workhouse"—I said, "I have no objection if you can tell me of a decent lodging," and she directed me to that house—I lost a handkerchief, as well as the money—this is the handkerchief—there is a small hole in it, which I know it by.</p>

I took the prisoner riding in a cabin the London-road on the 20th of July—I did not then understand about the robbery, but before the Magistrate I heard the prosecutor had lost a cam<lb></lb>bric handkerchief—I then went back to the prisoner, who was locked up, asked her for the handkerchief, and she gave it me—she said some girl gave it to her—the prosecutor said it had a small hole, and some piping round it, which it has.</p>

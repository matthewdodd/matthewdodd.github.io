But for the Prisoners, several Witnesses testified, that the said Jones first assaulted Swinney, and that they heard no words of Arrest, and that the Baylies had four Swords drawn. The case seemed to lye very hard on the Prisoners; the Writ and Warrant were proved: Five Bayliffs swore they did give Harrison the words of Arrest, and if so, the Killing of Jones in execution thereof must needs be Murder.

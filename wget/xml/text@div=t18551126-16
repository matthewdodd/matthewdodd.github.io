                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the London Militia, and live at Providence-row, Hoxton. On Wednesday evening, 23rd Oct., I was returning home with my wife, at a little after 12 o'clock, perhaps a quarter past—my wife was some few yards behind me—the prisoners came up, and said, "Oh! you have got a top coat on, but still we can see you belong to the militia; do you want any recruits?"—I said, "Well, if you are in<lb></lb>clined to enlist, you had better make application at Oliver's yard, I will see you there to-morrow morning"—that is the depot for the militia—they then walked on, the same way with me, and suddenly Boyce, the tall man, made a spring upon me, and pinioned me against the railings of the church—he was in front of me, and held the railing, with his arm under my throat, to prevent my hallooing, and my head against the railings—I was helpless, and the other person then tore my watch from my trowsers pocket; it was attached by an Albert chain, which they broke, and got the watch—I had, as near as I can guess, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in, my jacket pocket—I distinctly felt his hand in that pocket, and afterwards missed the money—my wife screamed very loudly, and Boyce left go of me and seized her, and then I seized Rush worth by the neck handkerchief; there was a considerable scuffle be<lb></lb>tween us, and I got my watch out of his hand—I had him on the ground, and Boyce was kicking me violently about the body and head, to make me let go of Rushworth—I did not get my money back, Rushworth got up and ran; I ran after him, met a policeman, and he was taken into custody—I was weakened by the kicking, and could not hold Rushworth any longer—I was down in the mud with him—a policeman met us both run<lb></lb>ning, and stopped us both—after I had been before the Magistrate next day, and preferred the charge against Rushworth, I saw Boyce in the waiting</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say, "If I had you on parade I would give you a good drilling?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nor anything of the kind—I will swear I did not hear Rushworth say that he would give me in custody—I was very ill and exhausted, and fell from exhaustion at the policeman's feet—I was severely beaten and bruised, and had lumps on my head as big as an egg—I will not swear that he did not say he would give me into custody—when I was giving my evidence before the Magis<lb></lb>trate, I did not see Boyce sitting close to the reporters' box, but he might have been sitting there—(<hi rend="italic">the witness's deposition being read, stated</hi>: "While I was giving my evidence, I saw Boyce sitting on the form near the reporters' box, but I thought I should know him better when I saw him with his hat on; I said nothing then, we then went into the waiting room.")</p>

               <p>that you saw nothing of the sort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw him standing, not sitting—I did not see Boyce come to the station that very night that I was there, for the purpose of bailing Rush worth for an assault in consequence of a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> between him and me—I did not see him there either standing or sitting I did not speak to him that night, and never saw him at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have heard the deposition read over, and there is not a single word about Boyce kicking you, or your being exhausted by kicking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Neither do I wish that to be urged, only that I was asked what made me fall at the policeman's feet—I believe I said before the Magistrate, that I was very much ill-treated—from the particular way in which you wanted to know all the particulars of the matter to-day, I thought I was at liberty to say the way I was ill-used—I did not tell the Magistrate that there was a lump on my head as big as an egg, I only said that I was very much ill-treated—I do not think my wife and I have talked about this matter twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it true that you did see Boyce standing against the reporters' box when you were giving your evidence against Rush worth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not point him out, because I was then giving evidence; when I had given my evidence, I went into the waiting room, saw him with his hat on, and gave him in charge—when I said, "It is a bad job for me," I meant that they ought not to have given work out in that way; I had left some work, to come and give evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at Boyce now; have you any doubt that he is the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all—my work is manufacturing boots and shoes when I am off duty—I have been a sergeant about nine months—sergeants are selected according to good behaviour in previous regiments, and their ability in drilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutors wife. I went with him to see a friend home, and having left her at her residence we were going home—as we passed the railings of Hoxton church my husband was about four yards in advance of me, and I saw Boyce holding him by the collar or throat, and Rushworth doing something to him, but I could not see what—my husband had his back to the iron rails and could make no resistance in the way he was held—I got between them, and said, "Let him alone, he is my hus<lb></lb>band"—Boyce instantly left go of him, and took me by the shoulders and held me tightly, and Rushworth instantly struck my husband in the face across my shoulders-there was a struggle between them—after that I called "Help!" as loud as I could—I heard my husband say to Rushworth, "You wretch, you have got my watch;" they then struggled together, and both fell on the ground—I then got from Boyce, and tried to help my husband off the ground, but Rushworth seized me by the throat, and with his disengaged hand struck me on the head—I did not fall, but Boyce then took hold of me again by the shoulder, and I called, "Police!"—Rushworth then ran, and my husband pursued him, crying, "Police!" and "Stop thief!"—I did not see what became of Boyce, I saw nothing of him till next day, when I was before the Magistrate—he was there sitting on a form near the reporters' box, and I thought I knew him as one of the men, but I was rather flurried, and did not speak of it; the Magistrate asked me if I should know him again, and I told him, "Yes"—I saw him again with his hat on, and was then certain that he was the man who held me the night before—I and my husband then went back and gave evidence against him—my hus<lb></lb>band works for the regiment, and had some work on his hands at that time—I know that he left work to go before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>the station at that time—I should suppose the charge had taken about ten minutes, not longer—when Boyce came, he asked mo whether I could take bail—I told him it was a case of felony, and I could not take bail—this was almost immediately after the charge had been booked—until the charge has been entered we do not allow persons unconnected with the matter to come into the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that if a friend of the party came and said the charge was all wrong, you would not allow him to come in and state it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, until the charge had been taken we should not allow them in the station—we should admit them into the station at the time, but if we found they were unconnected with the charge, we should require them to go out until the charge was taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing Boyce and his wife had come there after the parties had gone in to make the charge and the door was shut, should you let them in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not during the time the charge was being taken—we generally allow the complaining parties in the station, and the others remain outside—if the friends of a party came, I should hear what their statement was—we let in the complaining party in the first instance and the prisoner, but not any witnesses for the prisoner in the first instance, if we know it—the door is shut the moment the policeman brings in a prisoner—if there was anybody outside who said "We have a charge to make against the other man, his charge his false," I should hear what they said—it was about two or three minutes after the charge was taken against Rushworth that Boyce came in.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you take the charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—after the prosecutor had made his statement, Rushworth said, "I shall also charge you with assaulting me"—I did not take that charge, I could not, because I had began to take the other charge before he made that statement to me—if he had wanted to make a charge against the prosecutor, I should have referred him to the police court in the morning.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 317). I saw Eastland come to the station on this night with Rushworth—I am not aware that he searched him, my attention was directed to the door—it was Eastland's duty to search him—I am not aware that there was any one else there whose duty it would he to search him—I do not know anything about what was found upon him, I had nothing to do with it—I kept the door—Boyce came about two or three minutes after the charge was taken, the parties had then all left the station—we were about ten minutes taking the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet maker, and live in Castle-street, Bethnal-green road. I have known Rushworth twenty-two years, he has always borne the character of an honest, respectable young man—we were brought up boys together—I was apprenticed to his father, and we have always been together up to the very day of his being taken into custody—I knew of his intended marriage, as his mother has stated, and knew the young person he was keeping company with—she has been dead about twelve months—I think that was about the time he took the house in Brett's-buildings—the young person dying, and the house being too large for him, he let some apartments to Boyce and his wife—they had the two parlours and remained there about three months—he then gave up the house because the rent was too heavy—Boyce and his wife took apartments in Haber<lb></lb>dasher-street, and Rushworth went there to live with them, I have seen him there—Mrs. Boyce is in Court now.</p>

               <p>Butts; at the time of the robbery I kept a lodging-house at Clapham. On 4th May, the prisoner and a man who had been in the house since March, left—I was then about to break up my home and tell my furniture—they were seven weeks with me, and did not pay a farthing—I said I was deter<lb></lb>mined the prisoner should leave my room that morning—I went into the room, turned down the quilt, and missed all the three blankets and two feather pillows—she called to me and said, "Pray, Mrs. Taylor, do not pro<lb></lb>secute me; I have stolen your things to live on, and I will return them before I sleep"—she went out and never returned—I did not see her again till she was in custody—I have no doubt she was in great distress, or she would have paid me my rent—she did not do anything for her living that I know of.</p>

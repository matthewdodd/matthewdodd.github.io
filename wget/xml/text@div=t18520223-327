                  </hi>. I am groom to Mr. Detmore, at Wanstead. I had a pair of boots in the stable on 5th Feb., and on the morning of Friday, 6th Feb., I took them into a woodhouse adjoining the stable about 11 o'clock, and towards 4 I missed them—between 11 and half-past 3 no one had been there but the prisoner—he had been in the coach-house and in the stable I should suppose about 1, or between 12 and 1—these are the boots I had in the stable—I have worn them myself—they were bought at my late em<lb></lb>ployer's shop, Mr. Reeves, in the Commercial-road—I have not worn them in my present place—I had no occasion—I cleaned them and laid them by—I do not recollect that the prisoner had wished to buy them—I had been asked by several persons to sell them, and by the young man next door, but I never wished to part with them.</p>

LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where were these boots placed on 6th Feb.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In my wood house, adjoining the stable—there are no means of getting into the wood house except going out of doors—you must go through a little back yard—I placed the boots in the wood house about 11 o'clock—I saw them there last about 12 o'clock—the prisoner was standing in front of the house the best part of the morning—there is not a railing outside the house—it is a private house—the stables and the wood house are at the back of the house—I think the prisoner was standing outside about 12, or between 11 and 12—I just knew the prisoner in the neighbourhood, that was all—he</p>

               <p>has assisted me in my work on three different occasions—I knew him sufficiently to let him work for me—he has not assisted me four or five times with the horses and carriage—I have not had some dealings with him—I sold him the coat he now stands in, and I gave him a dark green waistcoat and a blue coat—I bad a very slight knowledge of him, but I gave him these things because I thought he was a very poor boy—I know these boots—I had this piece of strap put on them after I bought them, and they have gutta percha soles, which I put on myself—I think the prisoner's parents live about four miles from there—the prisoner has been lately potboy at the George, very near where I am—I did not see the prisoner in the stable any time that morning, or hold conversation with him there—he was there in the morning part.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any way to the back yard without going through the stable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not without going through the dwelling-house—I know that no one had been there, for I had been on the premises in the front stable all the time, except just going across the road to the butcher's—I had been to dinner, but the doors were fastened—it was before then that this transaction happened—no one was in the place after 1 o'clock—I fastened the doors a few minutes after 1—I went to the butcher's a little after 11—when the prisoner was in the stable, I let him out, and saw him go away—he was dressed in a ragged coat—he might have concealed the boots between his clothes—I do not recollect telling him to go because I expected my master down—I told him he must go because I wanted to fasten the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to a pawnbroker at Stratford, which is about two miles from Wanstead. I produce these boots, pawned by John Morgan for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 6th of Feb.—the prisoner's person is quite familiar to me, and I think in reference to this transaction; I believe him to be the person—it was between 2 and 3 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> May not his person be familiar because he was a long resident in the neighbourhood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Possibly it may—it might be because he had pawned something on some other occasion—I will not undertake to say that he is the person who pawned these boots.</p>

             sworn. - I took the prisoner to the watch-house; he denied having the handkerchief at first, but going to the watch-house he owned that he had it about him; when I got to the watch-house, he put his hand down, and I helped him to take it out of his breeches. (The handkerchief produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I belong to the 16th light dragoons: I was going to the Two Brewers, in Holborn, to receive my pay; I got up behind a coach, and this boy got up; there were a sailor and a baker running after the coach, and the sailor put this handkerchief upon my knee, and I put it in my pocket; the witness Stapling is not fit to take an oath; he took the oath of allegiance once, and afterwards deserted.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who knew very little of him, but who deposed they knew no harm of him.</p>

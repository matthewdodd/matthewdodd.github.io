On Wednesday last I missed all these things. I had discharged the prisoner from my service about three weeks before that. About February last I lived in Bow-lane, the prisoner assisted me to pack a package containing this property, and moved it to Mr. Graves's, in Philpot-lane - in about six weeks it was removed from there to King-street, and then to St. Mary Axe. About a week ago I found it, and missed all this plate and linen. Suspicion fell on the prisoner, I gave him in charge, and told him if he would make a full confession I would forgive him. I found part of it in pledge at Mitchell's, in St. Mary Axe - the prisoner said he had destroyed all the duplicates.</p>

            . On the 21st of October I was sent for by Mr. Perryman, to take the prisoner on suspicion of stealing this property. The prosecutor accused him of it, but he strongly denied it. Mr. Perryman then said if he would acknowledge taking them, he would forgive him; he did not acknowledge it that night, and I took him to the Compter. Next morning when I went to the Compter to him, I saw Morris, whom I understood was his sister. When the prisoner came out he said he would confess to me - he said he had pledged the prosecutor's property in St. Mary Axe, but not the whole of it. I took him to the Mansion House, and the prosecutor got from him a list of the things which he said he had pledged there - he was remanded until the Monday following; Morris turned out not to be his sister, and the prosecutor gave her in charge. She said if I would go over the water with her, she would give up all that she knew about the robbery; she gave me the duplicates out of a drawer - one was for a table-cloth pledged for 3 s. She took me to a pawnbroker's in Blackfriars-road, where the sheet and table-cloths were pledged; she said the duplicates of them were burnt, and gave me four duplicates of property pledged in St. Mary Axe.</p>

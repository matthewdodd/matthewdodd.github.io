On the 22d of January, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in my own front parlour, which is used as a shop. The house was let out in lodgings; the landlord lives in a separate house. I heard a window break; turned round immediately and saw the prisoner draw the wire out on which the watches were suspended, with both hands, it was fastened by a screw about six inches from the window; the screw was completely torn out; the other end remained fast; part of the wire was completely out in the street. I got up immediately he attempted to take the watches off the wire. I put my left hand through the window, and saved some of them. The prisoner, after standing about two minutes before the window, left it. My wife ran to the street-door, hearing the window break. She could not get out; it was fastened outside by a piece of string. The prisoner left the window. I went to the door, and found it was fastened outside, but by pulling very hard I opened it. The prisoner ran across the road; I saw no more of him that night. I ran across up Blue Anchor-yard, but could see nothing of him. I returned, and found my wife had picked up two watches and a watchcase from under the window. I immediately went to Queen-square Police Office, gave information, and returned home. I found I had lost a small gold watch, and an old silver one; the outside case of the silver one was found in the street. I went out with the officers, but could not see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing him - A. Yes; there was a candle close to the wire; I am certain he is the man. There were two candles and a gas-light opposite. I am certain he is the man. The next morning as I was sitting at work, the prisoner passed by with another man. I said there is the man who robbed me. I went out and followed him for two hours and a half to different places. I was afraid he would get away if I attempted to take him. I got a neighbour to assist me, and we secured him, and took him to Queen-square. I have never found the watches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. I live and sleep in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe the man to the officers - A. Yes; to Gillmore and another man. He was dressed in a blue coat, with gilt buttons; he had white stockings on and breeches. Next morning he was dressed in the same, except having trowsers on. He was taken at the end of York-street and James-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come off a hackney coach - A. No.</p>

            . I live in Gardiner's-lane, and work with my father, who sells sweetmeats about the streets. I was going past the prosecutor's window about half past seven o'clock that evening, and saw the prisoner dash his hands through the window. I am certain he is the man; he took two watches from the window, grasped hold of them, and then ran across the road as fast as he could, down Blue Anchor-yard. I am certain he is the man; I took notice of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was you doing - A. Going on an errand. I stopped to look at him. I went before the justice a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you to go before the justice - A. A little girl, who went to Mr. Spicer, and told him I knew it was the prisoner - I said so a fortnight after; he had a long blue coat on, with breeches and white stockings. I am eleven years old.</p>

She was sent for twice at the second examination, and at last came. They gave her the book to be sworn, and she said she did not think he was the man.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received information on the night of the robbery from Spicer, and went out with two other constables and the prosecutor, till about half-past twelve o'clock that night. I searched several public-houses, where had characters resort, in hopes of finding the man, but did not. Next day I was informed the prisoner was in custody. Gillmore gave him to me.</p>

            Has he any thing remarkable about his legs - A. He wore trowsers, because both his legs are bandy - I never knew him wear any thing else. He generally wore laced shoes. In January I met with an accident, and employed the prisoner to assist me. He went with me, to get up and down off the box, as I could not - he rode behind. He first began to work for me on Wednesday night, the 20th of January - he was out with me on Wednesday and Thursday nights; he left me about six o'clock on Friday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170036"></xptr>morning, and had been with me both nights. I parted with him at Charing-cross. I never heard of his being tried here - he has borne a good character ever since I have known him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is your brother's name - A. Esau Haydon - it is a night coach; I go out at six o'clock at night, and come home at six o'clock in the morning; those are the regular hours for a night coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you stay out twelve hours - A. Yes, and sometimes fifteen. I generally come home about nine o'clock. My brother has two pair of plates and three coaches - he only works two in the day, and the other at night.</p>
               <p>Q. If you go out regularly the other must come home regularly, or you cannot get the plates - A. We do not go out till the other comes home; sometimes sooner, sometimes later, and sometimes not at all; then I stop at home.</p>
               <p>Q. If that is the case, how can you say he was with you on the 20th - A. He was with me; I recollect it by his being taken up. I attended before the justice, but was not examined, they would not let me speak. He was not with me on the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of his being tried - A. No, I never heard that he was tried last June - I am certain of it.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister. My father lives in Duck-lane, Westminster, near Stretton-ground; my brother lived with my father ever since he was born; he always sleeps there when he is at home. He was taken up on Saturday, the 23d of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had he been the night before - A. In bed; he had been out with Haydon on the Wednesday and Thursday nights, he came home about six o'clock on Friday morning; I was a-bed at the time, he came up into my mother's room, my mother struck a light and gave it to him - I sleep with her; he lit the fire, and then went to bed in the one pair back-room, which joins ours - his brother John was in bed at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prisoner get up again - A. He never rose till about eight o'clock that night; I then went up to awake him for me to make the bed, that my father and brother John might go to bed - they sleep in the same bed - the prisoner was then a-bed, I called him twice before I awoke him - he merely got out of bed, but put no clothes on; my sister Emma assisted me in making the bed - he got in again. I took him up some tea and bread and butter afterwards - he was then in bed; I did not go to bed until between one and two o'clock on Saturday morning - I did not see him after I took him the tea; I am certain he did not go out that night. I got up at eight o'clock in the morning, he was then up and dressed, at breakfast with my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the key left in the street-door - A. Yes; nobody could go out without my hearing them, it is impossible. The room where I work is on the ground-floor, under the room he sleeps in; the foot of the stairs come to the room door, which is always open.</p>
               <p>Q. Your brother has a defect in his legs - A. Yes. Ever since he left the Blue-coat School, he has constantly worn long trowsers, with high shoes or half-boots - he never in his life wore breeches and white stockings; he did wear a blue coat with gilt buttons. He was in bed at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the matter with his legs - A. He was rather bow-legged, they are getting much better than they were. He was brought up to the brush-making business, he has latterly been a hackney-coachman, and drove for Mr. Morris. He very seldom drove a night-coach.</p>
               <p>Q. He came home at six o'clock in the morning - A. Yes, and laid till six the next morning. He had nothing to eat but a little tea and bread and butter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever lay in bed so long at any other time - A. Not so much. He was not well; he was over-fatigued, and felt himself very poorly next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of any thing happening at any time - A. Yes, there was something in this Court - he was indicted for house-breaking, and had eleven persons to prove he was as innocent of that as he is of this.</p>
               <p>Q. All his friends, and Haydon, knew he was charged with the offence before - A. Yes; he had twenty-two witnesses - eleven were to prove facts, but not one of them was asked a question.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father, and am hostler to Mr. Morris. On the 20th and 21st of January, the prisoner was out with Haydon and his coach; he came home on Tuesday morning about six o'clock - I let him in, as I was going out to my employ - he sleeps in the same bed with me and John; he was lighting the fire as I went out; he went to bed before he had any breakfast as he was tired. I came home about half-past seven o'clock that evening, he was then in bed. I usually go to bed about eight o'clock, or half-past eight, I went to bed to him about five minutes after eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Had anybody been to make the bed before that - A. My eldest and youngest daughter, they also took him up some tea; he had been a-bed all day. I remained in bed with him until six o'clock in the morning - he was never out of bed. I am troubled with a complaint, and do not rest half the night - I went to work, and after dinner heard he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before the magistrate to tell what you knew - A. No, I did not hear of it until after the first examination; I went to the second examination, but was not allowed to speak. My son always wore loose pantaloons down to his ankles, and high shoes - his legs are rather crooked.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the matter with his legs - A. He is rather weak-ankled and bow-legged.</p>

I heard him knock at the door, about half-past six o'clock in the morning; he was at home and in bed all day. My father came home about eight o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time does your father usually go to bed - A. About nine or ten o'clock; he went to bed that night a little after eight; my brother was then in bed - he was only out of bed once, and that was to have it made. Next morning, a little after eight o'clock, I found him up. He always wore trowsers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He was never away - A. Never; I am quite sure he never once slept away from home during the last two years.</p>
               <p>Q. He was never absent a month - A. Not to my knowledge - that is as true as all that I have sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he never in confinement - A. Yes, he was absent then.</p>

            . On the Friday before my brother was taken up he was in bed all day, because he had been out with Haydon two nights. My father came home about half-past seven o'clock; he then got out of bed for me to make it, and got in again. My father went to bed a little after eight o'clock - I did not see him again till he got up.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother. He lived at home. He came home on the 22d of January, which was Friday morning - I did not see him before he went to bed. He was at home and in bed all day on Friday. My husband came home about eight o'clock at night, Emma went up to make the bed - some tea was sent up to the prisoner. My husband went to bed about half-past eight o'clock; the prisoner was then at home and in bed. I went up to bed about eleven, and saw him still in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. He was at home from the time he came home on Friday morning until Saturday morning - A. That I swear. I work at a mangle, in a room close to the street-door; the room-door is never shut, it is fastened back - I can see everybody that passes in the passage. He could not go out without my knowing it. He usually wore a blue coat, trowsers, and high shoes, which lace up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was you not uneasy that he should be in bed so long without any refreshment, and after being out all night - A. I have a large family; my time is occupied with my work. He has often been in bed all day. He was tried here before, and all my family were witnesses then, except myself, but none were examined, except to character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Bird go to Annis's house with Chambers? - A. No; Wolse was waiting for him to receive the sugars; he was in at Annis's house waiting to sell the sugar; they were never in the house five minutes before they were carried out by a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Wolse received them, and not Annis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where were you standing when you saw these men handing, as you call it, the sugar over the bow? - A. I was not standing any where, I was rowing in my boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the ship were you on? - A. Neither side, I was coming across her bow.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first gave any information upon this business? - A. In the month of November.</p>
               <p>Q. That is near two months after? - A. No, I gave the information to a gentleman, who acquainted Mr. Colquhoun of the business.</p>
               <p>Q. When was Bird taken up? - A. I took him up when there was opportunity for it, I believe it was in November.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear he was taken up before January? - A. It might be January, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in November was it you gave this information? - A. I believe it was the 22d of November.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the first information you gave? - A. Yes, about Bird.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being at the Magistrate's office on the first of January? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing Bird there at that time? - A. No; I saw him at the public-house, the next door; we went up to get a warrant for him, and when we came down again, he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not call you an informer or a stag in that house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you did not pull his hat off, and he called you an informer of a stag? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards? - A. We did not get a warrant because we would not give any alarm; Mr. Colquhoun's office was full of gentlemen about other business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you frequently, afterwards, see him? - A. No, I saw him on Sunday, two or three weeks after, at Mr. Carron's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he ask you to drink with him? - A. Yes; and I said, no, I would not drink with a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not call you an informer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever apply for a warrant from the time you saw him at Mr. Colquhoun's office till you took him into custody? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q.Chambers and you belonged to the same boat society? - A. I do not know what you mean by the boat society.</p>

               <p>Q. You never gave any information till after the ship was loaded? - A. I do not know whether she was gone before Bird was taken or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you never saw him but that once between the time that you saw him at Mr. Colquhoun's office and the time he was taken up? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you never a runner at Mr. Staples's office? - A.Never. When Mr. Staples wanted me to take him any where, I took him in my boat.</p>

               <p>Bird's defence. I was not in the ship.</p>
               <p>Chamber's defence. What he says is as false as God is true.</p>

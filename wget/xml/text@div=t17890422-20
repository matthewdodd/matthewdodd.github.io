Bates, he was going towards Charing-cross, then he began to run; I pursued him about two or three hundred yards, and took him; I never lost sight of him; I found nothing on him; I brought him back to the shop, and found the other prisoner in the shop; it was not Bates that took the things out of the window.</p>
               <p>Court. How near was Bates to the person that took the things out of the window? - About a yard, they were together at the window, I think I perceived them both in company together several times within the half hour, but I will not swear to that; I saw them come up together, but I did not see Bates touch any thing.</p>
               <p>Had you seen them speak together? - I cannot swear that, there were five or six of them together in the course of the half hour.</p>
               <p>I think you say, when you came up to Bates he ran? - He did.</p>

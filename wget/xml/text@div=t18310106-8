Last Tuesday evening, about five o'clock, I went out, leaving my coat hanging on a nail in my room - I returned about one o'clock in the morning, and it was gone; about eleven o'clock the prisoner's father, who lives in the room with me, found his things disturbed - I told him I had lost my coat; I saw the prisoner three or four days after, in Covent-garden watch-house, and questioned him about my coat; I merely asked him to tell me the truth - I did not say it would be better for him; he said he had pawned it in Stanhope-street - I went and found it pawned at Lamb's; it is not here.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the evening of the 28th of December, the prisoner pawned the coat with me, for 2s. - he asked for 2s. 6d., and told me it was his mother's; the prosecutor saw and swore to it at Bow street, on the 3rd of January - it is now at my employer's, but has been mislaid, through the carelessness of persons I left at home; it was my master's fault and not mine: I am sure the prosecutor swore to the same coat as the prisoner pawned; it was in its proper place till the 3rd - I left it at my employer's, and when I looked for it this morning I could not find it.</p>

I am sure the coat I saw on the 3rd of January was mine; I had had it twelve months - the prisoner was present when I saw it; he told me where he pawned it - he was taken to Bow-street for pawning his mother's things; he did not live in the house - it is one of our stations; his father was in the Police - I do not know what he is doing now.</p>

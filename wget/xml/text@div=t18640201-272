                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City-police—On Saturday, 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> January, in consequence of information, I was watching the premises of Messrs. Herring, wholesale druggists, of 40, Aldersgate-street—about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner leave the premises, carrying a parcel wrapped up in this handkerchief—Halford and I followed him to 29, Glasshouse-yard, where he lives—we watched the house till half-past 5, when he left, accompanied by his little boy—he was carrying a paper parcel—we followed him to 33, Great St. Andrew-street, Seven Dials, which is a wholesale confectioner's—we waited outside some minutes—the prisoner looked in the window two or three times, and then went in—I afterwards went into the shop, and found him in the parlour with two women—I said to one of the women, in the prisoner's presence, "Where are the things you have bought of this man?"—she got up, and went into the shop and gave me two bottles of olive-oil and a packet of cream of tartar—she said, "I hope there is nothing wrong; I have bought them of this man; he told me he was allowed to buy at wholesale prices to sell again, and I thought I was doing good for him"—the prisoner said, "That is true"—I then said, "How do you account for these articles?"—he said, "I am employed at Herring's; the oil is drippings from bottles; I am bottle-washer"—I asked him to account for the cream of tartar—he said "It was given to me by Mr. Jennings"—I said, "You have been here for some time"—he said, "No; I have not"—I said, "If not you, your children have been here"—he said, "Yes"—I asked him what he had sent on the Saturday night previous—he made no answer—I asked the woman, Mrs. Pearson—she said, "A bottle of oil, and a little cream of tartar"—I told him I should take him into custody, and I did so—shortly after Halford produced a large quantity of bottles—Sharp was present—I said to Sharp, "I am told all these bottles were brought here by the prisoner—Sharp said, "Yes"—the prisoner made no remark—I asked how long he had been in the habit of coming here—Sharp said for six months—the prisoner made no remark on that—on the way to the station in a cab, I said to him, "That man says you have been dealing there for six months"—he said, "Well it may be; I have a wife and large family,</p>

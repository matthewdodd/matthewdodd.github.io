            . The three prisoners and myself went out with a bag, in order to steal some potatoes, out of the fields at Kensington; we saw some Sheep; then we concluded to have one instead of potatoes; we spread ourselves and drove them up to one corner; we catch'd a Sheep and a Lamb; we let the lamb go, and stuck the Sheep; then we took it into the next field, and skin'd it, and took out the guts, and flung the head into the hedge.</p>
               <p>Q. To the prosecutor; where did you find the skin and guts?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found them in the next field to mine.</p>
               <p>Evidence continues. We put the carcass into the sack, which was the very carcase the Justice ordered to the Gatehouse; we were all concerned in killing it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The Sheep I lost was very large fat sheep; the tail of it of a very large size; the loin tallied with the tail; all the bone was cut on one side; being cut with a large knife without a chopper.</p>

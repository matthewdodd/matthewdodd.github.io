This day fortnight; I took the officer with me, and searched the prisoner's lodgings; we found a coat and a pair of pantaloons of French black cloth; I took a piece with me that I had at home, and by the colour, and by the thread, and in every respect, it appears to be the same, in consequence of that we brought it away; at the same time I found a piece of printed cotton, which I knew to be the facing of a jacket that had been made the week prior to it; it is all here.</p>

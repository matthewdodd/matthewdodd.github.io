               <p>A WITNESS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am cook to Mr. Harmood. Between twelve and one, on the morning of the robbery, I locked the safe in the area. About half past three, the family was alarmed by a knocking at the door: my master got up, and his son, and one of the servants: the watchman had got the prisoner; he took him from the front area; there was a hole in the safe, where the things were taken out; the things in the indictment were missing; I saw them there between twelve and one; I did not see them in the prisoner's custody.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman in New Norfolk-street: I did not see the prisoner take the things; I found him in the area with the things tied up in an old blue apron; he said a man knocked his hat off, and he went to get it; he was not near the bundle at the time; it was about a quarter past three when I took him.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my house, the corner of Holywell-street, and asked for a name I understood of the person in the shop before me; asked me if he was at home; having a paper in his hand I imagined he was a creditor of his; his name was Biggs: he did not ask for that name, but I imagined he meant him. I told him I had taken the shop very lately (I had been in it but a month) I asked him if he was a creditor; he said he was no creditor. He pulled out a paper which he said was a list of some goods he wanted to purchase of this Mr. Biggs, as I understood him; I told him, I could serve him as well as Mr. Biggs could; he then said, he had no objection to deal with me, for he was not engaged to any one; he then gave me an order for sundry goods, to the amount of 10 l. and 6 d. including the package and every thing. He took a little parcel of Persian blue with him, and was to send a cart for the rest; he said, if I would make out a bill and receipt against he came back, he would call and pay me for them; he went away, and came again in the afternoon; he said he was in a hurry, as he must go by the coach, and was afraid it was gone out; he told me his name was

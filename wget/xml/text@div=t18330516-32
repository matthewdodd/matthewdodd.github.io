On the 24th of April I was there, I recollect putting these notes and bills of exchange into my pocket-book; I took them from my pocket-ledger - I cannot be upon my oath that I left my pocket-book on my desk, but I am fully persuaded that I did - I then went home to dinner, and did not go out again - on the following morning I missed my pocket-book and notes; I went to my counting-house, but could hear no tidings of the pocket-book - I had never seen the prisoner to my knowledge; this was on a Wednesday, and on the Sunday the prisoner was taken - I received some information, and went with an officer to the prisoner's lodging; we found his wife at home, she gave us up the pocket-book without any hesitation; it contained the bills of exchange, but not the three 5l. notes, they were gone; the prisoner came home drunk soon afterwards, he said he knew nothing about the pocket-book; he was taken to the station-house; he then said he had left two of the notes with a person at Bermondsey, and had drawn 20s. upon them; the serjeant sent an officer the next morning, and found the two notes - all that is lost is one 5l. note, which the wife after some hesitation acknowledged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160027"></xptr>they had spent through distress - the prisoner said he had found the book in Upper Ground-street, and the next morning he said he found it in Hatfield-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Where is Hatfield-street? A. My gate-way goes in from Hatfield-street, which joins to Upper Ground-street - it is possible that I might have dropped my pocket-book, but I think not probable - I advertised it as being lost supposed between Stamford-street and Nelson-square - I never conceived that I had lost it - I had my privy searched, and then I advertised it - the man who gave me information was at Bow-street - I spoke to him in the street; I gave him a sovereign for his honesty - I did not charge any one with stealing this - it was about twelve o'clock in the day when I put the notes into the book, and I left in about half an hour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.You stated at first that you lost it from your desk? A. I conceived so, but I thought it possible I might have put it into my pocket and lost it.</p>

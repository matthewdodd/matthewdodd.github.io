                  </hi>. I live at 25, Rathgar Road, Dublin, and am a civil engi<lb></lb>neer, at present staying at the Castle and Falcon Hotel, Aldersgate Street—on 9th November I was at the top of Cheapside—there was a great crowd—there were a good number of people by my side, one in particular, Burnett—he was apparently blocking my hat, or trying to do so from behind, and doing something in front at the same time, trying to attract my attention—he snapped my watch out and let it hang—I saw another person, it may have been Regan, with it in his hand, and he passed it behind him—the chain was entangled in his person—I kept hold of it for some time, but ultimately I had to let it go, as it broke—the chain was round my neck—I cried out that I was losing my watch—two policeman came up and seized Regan; I held on to Burnett, the crowd in the meantime trying to trip me up—the prisoners tried to get away, Burnett particularly; he threw himself down—I have not seen my watch and chain since.</p>

I was at the barriers in King Street, Cheapside, on the afternoon in question—there was a great crowd of roughs there, bonneting the prosecutor—I rushed to his assist<lb></lb>ance, and when I got about a foot and a half from him I heard him say, "I have lost my watch"—I looked down at Burnett's hand, and saw a watch and chain in his left hand—he passed it on to Regan, who was on the left-hand side of him, and he passed his hand behind him—there were a good many hands open to receive it, but I could not get at it in time—Regan tried to get away, but I caught him by the collar, and also Burnett—I distinctly saw what was done—the watch was in both their hands—I did not know them before.</p>

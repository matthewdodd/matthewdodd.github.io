                  </hi> I am a linen-draper in High-street, Camden-town. It is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Pancras—the prisoner came to me as shopman on 16th Sept.—he slept in the house that night, and left about half-past seven in the morning—I did not see him go—he was gone when I came down—after he was gone, at a little after eight, I also missed 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold from a private desk, which was not locked, at the end of the shop—I had seen the gold safe the night previous, about ten o'clock—I also missed some neck-ties from the window—I had bought them about the middle of the day on which the prisoner came into my employ, and I had put them in the window between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I went to the station, gave information and a description of the prisoner—I did not see him again till I saw him in Newgate last Session—I have never seen the neck-ties again—there was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver in the desk also.</p>

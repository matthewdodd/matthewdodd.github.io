                  </hi>. I live at No.5, Artillery-place, Bermondsey, Mr. William Everett put me and my brother in to take charge of the premises—he formerly occupied the house, and left it for the purpose of its being pulled down—the house does not belong to him—he was the former tenant—he</p>

               <p>pays the rent for it till it comes down for the Rail-road—I have every reason to believe he is not settled with by the Railway Company—my bro<lb></lb>ther works for him as a labouring man, and sleeps in the house as well as myself—on the 30th of March I was sitting in the parlour, about eleven o'clock in the morning, and heard a stamping over my head—it was a sin<lb></lb>gular noise, and lasted for a considerable time, at least an hour—I had not been out during the day, and did not think any body could be in the house—after hearing the bell-wire pulling by my side, and the tea-things rattling, I became alarmed, and was too frigntened to go out immediately—in the course of a short time I saw the two prisoners open the door, and come into the room—when they saw me they retreated—I followed them—they went through the passage to the stair-case—I followed, and got up to them on the stair-case—I instantly caught hold of Griffiths, and said to him, "It is you that have so frightened and alarmed me"—he said nothing to that—Callaghan was in the front, and Griffiths behind him—there are same small stairs leading to the yard, and the oil-cloth was torn—I hit Griffiths, and said." You worthless villian, it is you that alarmed me; I have a sword in the next room; had I known it, I would have run it through you"—both tried to make their escape, one before the other, and they fell to the ground—I then ran to the front of the house, and gave an alarm—Griffiths was coming through a crowd which I had round me, and I caught hold of him by his bo<lb></lb>som, and saw he had my pillow-case—Goodman afterwards came to my assistance, and he found out the other prisoner—there were two holes made in the wall, and a brick taken out at a time—the hole was boarded up—it is of an immense size, and would either lead to the stable or the back part of the house—you can get into the house through the wall—it is the wall of a garden—if a person came through the hole, they would first come into the garden—there was, a short time ago, a hole under my kitchen stairs, but that has been blocked up—I found the articles named in the indictment disturbed—some were mine, and some my brother's, who lives with me, and also his wife's.</p>

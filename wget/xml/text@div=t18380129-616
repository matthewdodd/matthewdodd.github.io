                  </hi>. I am shopman to Ezekiel John Baker, who lives in White<lb></lb>chapel-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel. I fastened up the house on Thursday night, the 25th of January, and on Friday morning, the 26th, between eight and nine o'clock, I missed eight guns and eleven pistols, out of glass cases—there were no marks of violence about the place, but I was not the first who entered the counting-house—I had left at five minutes to eight o'clock the evening before, and the guns and pistols were then safe in the counting-house, which is in a yard enclosed with the dwelling-house—it joins the dwelling-house—there is a dining-room over the front shop—you pass through to the back shop, without going into the open air—it is part of the house, and joins the dwelling-house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 126.) In consequence of infor<lb></lb>mation I went to a house in Vine-court, Whitechapel, and took the prisoner Sarah Thatcher into custody on the 28th of January—I asked her what she had done with a basket which she had on Friday morning—she said she carried it to a woman in the Commercial-road—I had not seen her with a basket—it was in consequence of information I put the question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give her any caution that you were putting questions, and that her answers would be given in evidence against her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not particularly that—I put the question to her from information I had received, but nobody told me to put the question—I got the information from a per<lb></lb>son named Singleton, in Whitechapel-road—I believe he is a colour-maker—my brother officer, Arnold, was with me at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well, what did she say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said she gave it to a woman is Commercial-road—I locked her up, and went to No. 7, Morgan-street, Commercial-road—I saw her mother there, but said nothing to her, and, without my saying a word to her, she said that her daughter had brought the basket down to her house—I had not mentioned the basket—she said it entirely of her own accord, without my having said any thing about a basket—she said she would go with my brother officer and me; if I would take a walk down to Prince's-street, Whitechapel, which she did, and said if we would stay a bit she would produce the pistols—we did, and she brought the pistols to us, and delivered them to me—this was in Haydon's-alley, Prince's-street, Whitechapel-road—she went there with us, and got them for us—Arnold was with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that the woman, merely on seeing you, volunteered to state that the basket was brought there, and the pistols, and that she would go and fetch them, without you telling her what you had come about? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not put any questions at all to her, nor did I hear my brother officer do so—she had been down to the station-house, and seen her daughter after she was locked up.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 127.) I was with Argent when he took Sarah Thatcher into custody—she denied all knowledge of the pistols at first—she is deaf, but I spoke loud enough for her to hear—she told me she knew nothing about them; but on Argent taking her down to the station-house, I heard her say that they were brought to her house, and she took them to a woman in Commercial-road—I asked if she knew the woman—she said she did not—she was locked up—I afterwards met with the mother, and told her it was a bad job for her daughter—she said it was and if I would stop a little while she would go and fetch the pistols.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it is not true that nothing was said to her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said it was a bad job for her daughter—I do not know whether Argent heard that—he was behind me—she brought the pistols, and delivered them to me, and said that her daughter brought them to the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say any thing to induce her to admit that she had them, and then to fetch them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She did not admit that she had them till I re<lb></lb>ceived them—she said she would go and try and find them for me—she did not say she had them—neither the young woman nor her mother said that they knew what was in the basket that was brought; but when the</p>

               <p>old woman brought the pistols forward, she said the pistols were brought to her—she said they were brought in the basket, and she burnt the bas<lb></lb>ket—she did not say that she had opened the basket—the young woman said she did not know what was in it—the elder prisoner said that she took the pistols out, and destroyed the basket—she mentioned this in the sta<lb></lb>tion-house in the presence of me and several others—I did not mention that before the Magistrate.</p>

On the 12th of August, between twelve and two o'clock in the day, I was alarmed, went down stairs to the area, and found a quantity of silver plate strewed about the area, and the prisoner at the top of the area-steps in the custody of one of my servants, and another man. I sent for a constable, and gave him in charge; we found the property on him.</p>
               <p>EDWARD VINCENT. On Wednesday, the 12th of August, I was in Dorset-square; as I passed the prosecutor's iron railing, I heard a woman scream out, cry Stop thief! and saw the prisoner run along the area, and dropping the spoons - He let several tea and table-spoons fall in the area, and the sugar-tongs and more spoons on the area-steps. The moment he got to the top of the areasteps I collared him, took him into the kitchen, and locked him up while I fetched an officer.</p>
               <p>ELIZA TITCOMB. I am servant to Mr. Stephens - I was in the kitchen with my fellow female servant, and heard a spoon fall; I ran to the butler's pantry and found the prisoner coming out of the door; I am sure he is the man. I asked him what he wanted? he produced a sugar-sifter and a tea-spoon. I told him he had got more - He said he had not; I said if he had not got more I would not let him go; he immediately attempted to make his escape - I caught hold of him, and held him several minutes; he struck me and got from me, I run after him and caught him-again he ran from me. I gave the alarm, called out Stop thief! and went up the area steps after him, Vincent came up; as the prisoner ran along the area he dropped several things-the other servant ran and picked them up. I saw her pick up the silver cream-jug in the area near the kitchen-door; I saw him drop the six table-spoons, a large gravy-spoon, and some tea-spoons in the area. I afterwards saw the plate in my master's possession; I had seen it safe in the pantry just before.</p>

               <p>MR. STEPHENS. It is mine. I told the servant to pick it up when I saw it strewed about the area. They have all my initials on them, and are worth above 6l.</p>

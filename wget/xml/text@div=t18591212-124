Police!" and as I opened my door, I saw Patrick Lanagan, the deceased, and Collins, just passing—when I got to my gate they had passed me about ten yards—I stood at my gate; I did not move—when they were about twelve yards off they had apparently got hold of each other—I cannot say whether Collins had hold of the deceased or the deceased hold of Collins; they were both together—Collins suddenly snatched himself away from Lanagan—Lanagan turned round directly, saying, "You are not a going? you are not a going?" I could not tell whether the man had got hold of him, but all in a moment the deceased fell—I could not see whether he was struck—it was a very dark night—there was a struggle, and he fell—I did not move from my gate—the prisoner came past and spoke something; I did not understand what he said, but I knew his voice—he then went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Member of the College of Surgeons, and live at Norfolk-place, Marlborough-road, Chelsea—on Monday morning, 21st November, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I saw the deceased—he was lying on his back in bed, at No. 9, Bull's Gardens—he was insensible and suffering from compression of the brain—he died—I do not know at what time—I made a post mortem examination 24 hours afterwards—there were no marks of external violence—there was a swelling on the back part of the neck,</p>

               <p>more on the left side, with discolouration—there was no mark of violence on the head—I could detect nothing externally—afterwards, upon examina<lb></lb>tion, I discovered a large clot of blood between the muscles, and upon washing that away I discovered a fracture of the skull, more on the left side, with rupture of the arteries, which ramify internally—the cause of death was compression of the brain—that resulted from the fracture, which was the primary cause of death—such an injury might have been caused by some direct violence—it could not have resulted from a blow from the fist—the blow knocking the man down on the kerb stone, might account for the fracture—I am of opinion that the fracture arose from an external blow—he would become insensible immediately from such a blow—the extravasation of blood would so have crippled the brain that he would not have power over it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the swelling in the back of the throat appear to be from a very violent blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was from the pouring out of the blood from the tissues of the muscles—that was one of the results of the fracture; not the immediate effect of the blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows</hi>—"I went to see my father on Sunday evening. He was very dangerously ill at 20, Bull's-gardens. A little after 10 I had occasion to go to the water-closet which is in the front garden; after I came out I heard a moaning noise and I went outside the gate. When I got out I saw a woman lying on the ground, with her face on the ground, very drunk; I lifted her up and asked her where she lived; she told me Caroline-place. I led her a few steps, and let her go; I stood; she went about twenty yards, staggering along, and fell down again; I lifted her up and led her five or six yards; she said she was all right. She went along; I stood and watched her till she got to the corner of Caroline-place, Bulls-gardens; she fell down then in the middle of the road; I picked her up again, and was carrying her to the footway to inquire of the neighbours; with that this man (<hi rend="italic">the deceased</hi>) came up and struck me on the side of the head. He had not spoken to me nor I to him, and I had never seen him before. He asked me what I was doing with that woman. He was about to strike me again, when I put up my hand to save myself; he still kept hold of my arm, and shouting out, "Police! police!" I wished him to leave go of me; I told him to leave go. He would not, and I gave my arm a wrench round to get away from him, and down he fell, and I went away back to my father's house. I stopped with my father all night, and I delivered myself up on the Tuesday."</p>

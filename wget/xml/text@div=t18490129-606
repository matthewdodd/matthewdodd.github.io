                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police-inspector</hi>) I apprehended Nobes at a public-house at Horselydown—I told him it was on suspicion of stealing three sacks of oats from a barge—he said he knew nothing about them—I asked if he had been at Horselydown-stairs on that Tuesday night—he said no, he had been carrying mangel-wurzel, and after that had a fare, and he was not on the stairs after four o'clock in the afternoon—I asked whether he had not been there in the evening, I had told him I took bim on suspicion of stealing three sacks of oats, and I cautioned him—he said he had not been there—he then said, "I recollect I went down at nine o'clock to get my sculls, and I saw Easton there"—I found on him a small sample-bag with some oats in it—I said, "Here are some oats here"—he said they were not the oats I was looking after—I took Dean the same night—I told him it was on suspicion of stealing some sacks of oats—he said be knew nothing about it—I cautioned him—I asked him if he had been carrying any oats that night—he said he had not—I asked if he had seen Nobes that night—he said, "No"—I said, "If any man will swear he saw you carrying oats it would be wrong"—he said, "Yea; he would swear to a d—d lie."</p>

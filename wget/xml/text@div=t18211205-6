            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in St. Martin's-le-grand. On the 12th of November, the prisoner came to my shop and asked if I wanted to buy waste paper, and produced a quantity of copy books, not used, I believe forty-six. I asked where he got them, he said his fellow apprentice gave them to him, and that his masters<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050008"></xptr>were Messrs. Baldwin Craddock and Joy, Paternoster-row. I said I thought they were not honestly come by, and I would not buy them; he said very well, he would take them back. I then thought I would buy them to detect him; they weighed 4 3/4 lbs. at 4 d. per lb. - I paid him 1 s. 5 d. for them. In about an hour, I went to Messrs. Baldwin and Co's., and from there to Messrs. Whitaker's, in <placeName id="t18211205-6-crimeloc35">Ave Maria-lane</placeName>

About a quarter past five o'clock, the prisoner came in there, I charged him with selling me the books, he did not deny it, and was secured.</p>

            . I am in partnership with W. Budd Whitaker. The prisoner was in the service of our bookbinder, he frequently came to our shop with books; we sell copy books, he had access to them when he came to the shop - Mr. Todd came to me on the 12th of November, and produced forty-six, which I knew but had not missed. In about an hour, the prisoner came in with some more books, and was secured - they were not waste paper.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received the books from Todd, he told me how he came by them, we went to Whitaker's, he described the person he had them from. The prisoner came in in about an hour, and did not deny the charge; he said he lived in Montague-court, Little Britain. - I went there, and found two more of the same sort of books.</p>

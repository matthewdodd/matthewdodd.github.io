I had a sovereign, a 5 s. piece, two or three shillings, and a sixpence or two. When I awoke I felt in my pocket for money to pay for my beer and it was gone. I complained to the landlord. It was safe half an hour before I went to sleep - it had been paid me in the house.</p>

            . I am servant at the house. When Cantle went to sleep; the prisoner was in the tap-room and nobody else. I was there all the time; I do not recollect whether they were in the same box - I did not see them near each other. When Cantle awoke the prisoner was gone. I am sure nobody but him was there. Cantle complained of losing his money - it was between eleven and twelve o'clock on Saturday night.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for on Sunday morning, and took the prisoner in custody, and asked him what money he had got - he said he had only three halfpence. I said, "Nonsense, you have more than that." I struck his trowsers, heard money rattle, took him back to our place, and a crown piece, four half crowns, two shillings, and one penny dropped from him.</p>

We were living in the same room, and nobody knows anything about it except us two. The reason why he now picks a quarrel with me is, because I would not sign him a cheque for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with which he wanted to run away to America. I was acquainted with him in Paris, where he has been a wine merchant and a bankrupt. He is a Jesuit. We were in account together, and I had a right to do this.</p>

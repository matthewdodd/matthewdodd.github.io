                  </hi>. I am a furniture dealer, of 59, Cable Street, St. George's—on 6th September I returned home about 9.45—as I went into the house I heard glass falling—I stood and listened, but heard nothing more—I unlocked my bed-room door, against which I keep a large bedstead; that had been moved away, and I saw the shadow of a man outside my window, with his arm through the glass—I said "Who is there?"—he jumped down, and I went to the yard-door and caught him—he said "What is this; here is a shilling; here are two shillings, I only fell against the window; let me go"—it was the prisoner—I said, "I want to see what damage you have done"—a lodger came down, and I went and looked at the back window, keeping hold of the prisoner—I found that two squares of glass were broken, the catch was put back, and two gimlets, which were put to keep the catch down, had been removed—he said "You see I have only broken a window"—I shut the door, bolted it, and said "I shall give you in charge"—I called a neighbour, and my wife fetched a constable—two gimlets, a screw, and a bar of iron 2 ft. long, were found outside the window—he must have got the gimlets from the inside, he could reach them through the broken glass—I knew the prisoner before, coming to a lodger in the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Is there any opening into the back yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—you did not say you came to see a lodger, Mr. Rose—you frequently did come to see him, but he has left my place five weeks; that is the reason you knew the ins and outs of the place so well—you may have lodged in the house with my mother formerly.</p>

I was called, and the prisoner was given into my charge—I found a square of glass over the catch broken, and the catch put up, and a square broken at the bottom—I found this bar, and marks corresponding with it—I also found this other bar, which is part broken off the first—there were marks both on the top and bottom sash, which might be caused by this bar—the prisoner said that he went to water there.</p>

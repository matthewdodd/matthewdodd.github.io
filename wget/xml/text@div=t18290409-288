            . I am a draper, and live at Greenwich. I have a brother John, and one named William, who was unfortunate in business, and was in prison; he lived at Greenwich also - I know John Pettit, who lived in Seymour-place, Bryanstone-square; I produce a forged bill for 7l. On the 18th of September I saw my brother william draw a bill of the same date and amount exactly - the one I produce is the prisoner's hand-writing; the whole of it: he did live at Sheerness, but on the 18th of September he was a prisoner in the King's Bench, and was so on the 21st of November, when this bill became due - shortly before that I received 7l. from my brother William, which I gave to my mother; to pay the original bill with, that had been paid to the prisoner, but I am certain neither the signature, accept<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090132"></xptr>ance, nor the indorsements, William Pettit and

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Here is a receipt to the bill in the prisoner's writing? A. Yes, and the letters C.B.P.</p>
               <p>Q. That means Copy of the Bill of Pettit's - why not tell us before, that those letters were there? A. I was asked about the indorsements; there is no stamp to it - my father did accept a bill, of which this is a verbatim copy, but without a stamp - the original has never been presented for payment, but we have bad a letter about it; this is the original bill (looking at one produced by the prisoner); my mother is nearly blind, and did not know but she was paying the original bill - I have a letter stating that the bill was not paid, and we must look to it; we received that the next evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, it was not paid in full? A. All but 3s.; the original bill was given to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have there not been continual quarrels between your family and the prisoner, about law bills? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the letter written before the bill became due? A. After; the post-mark is the 22d of November, but the letter is not dated - one came the same morning from the holder of the bill; I and my brother William paid the original bill to the prisoner - he would not take it without my indorsement; there is a receipt for 7l. on the copy.</p>

            . I received 7l. from my son about the 17th or 18th of November - we at that time lived in Seymour-place, Bryanstone-square: the money was given to me to pay a bill; on the 21st of November the prisoner came to Seymour-place - I had not enough by 3s., and I paid him 6l. 17s., telling him he should have the remainder in the evening; he was in the Bench that day, but he came to me between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning - he said he had brought the bill, and presented it to me; he said he came for payment of the bill, and next day I received this letter (looking at it) from him - I know it to be his hand-writing; he only said he had brought the bill for payment, and gave me this paper - I did not know but it was the original bill; nobody else was at home - my husband generally goes out for a walk between nine and ten o'clock, and returns about one; I saw the prisoner write this receipt on the back - he then went away; he had called on the 19th for it, but I told him I should not pay it till the three days grace were up - he had a paper in his hand then; what it was I do not know - if he had said the paper was only a copy I should not have paid him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he never sue your family for a bill of costs? A. No, not a just bill; he sued two of my sons, but not these sons; I did not look at the bill, for knowing him to be the holder, I thought it was all right.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you look at it when he brought it? A. No, he laid it on the table; I doubled it up, and put it away; but next morning, I found it was not the right bill - we have had a letter from one Rogers, demanding payment of the original bill; the prisoner came twice before, I paid it; he never sent for the 3s.; we sent to the King's Bench to get the bill, but he would not give it up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He could have avoided all proceedings by handing you back the original bill? A. Yes, I told him so; Pettit and him have not been at law - he was employed by a married sister of Pettit's - I live in Drummond-street, Euston-square; sometime after the warrant was lodged, he shewed me the original bill; he said he had got it back, and would send a person to meet Pettit about it, which he did.</p>

               <p>On the 30th of January my wife and I went out in the evening and left the prisoner, who was our <rs id="t17800223-8-deflabel47" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>What time did you return? - I believe a little after eight o'clock. My little girl informed me that a person had called on the prisoner, and that they both went out together. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them.)</p>
               <p>Had you seen them before you went out? - I do not recollect that I had seen them for several days, perhaps weeks before.</p>
               <p>Have you found any of them again? - Yes, in Grub-street; I went the same night to the girl's mother to acquaint her that the prisoner was gone away, and asked if she knew where I could find her; she said she did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230014"></xptr>not know of but one place where it was likely to find her, that was in Grub-street. I went there and found her and the things; the things were tied up in a sheet. I said they were mine. There was an old woman and her daughter in the house with her; I took them and the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. Mr. Arnold sent for me to Grub-street; he claimed these things (producing them) as his property; I took the prisoner, and the woman and her daughter before the Alderman; there the prisoner confessed she took the things.</p>
               <p>Was any promise made to her to induce her to confess? - None at all that I heard.</p>
               <p>Was there any threat made use of to her before you went or when you were before the alderman? - No, not a word that I know of.</p>
               <p>(The goods produced were deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I confessed more out of fear before the alderman than the truth.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She always behaved exceeding well; I respected her as a servant. I think she said when she was before the alderman, that the young woman took part of the things away, and she took part of them.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said before you went before the alderman to frighten her? - Not by me.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any body else say any thing? - No.</p>

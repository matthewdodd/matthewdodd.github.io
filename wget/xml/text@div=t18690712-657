                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Francis Wyatt Truscott and others, printers—Allen was their carman, and Watts was his assistant—on the morning of 6th July I looked into the van, and found a quantity of paper which should not have been there, about eleven reams of double foolscap, and two of post, value 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was not addressed to anyone—I followed the van to the railway arch in Gravel Lane—Allen came along with two sacks on his arm, got into the van, and drove to his house, 21, Wel<lb></lb>lington Street; he there took out two large bundles in the sacks, and put them into his house—he closed the van after him each time—a boy named Elderkin was with him, who drove the van away, and the prisoner went into a public-house—I have seen the paper since, it is the property of the firm.</p>

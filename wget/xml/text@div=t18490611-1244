                  </hi>. I am ten years old, and live with my uncle, John Keys, who keeps the Horse and Groom public-house. On Thursday afternoon, 3d of May, about five o'clock, I was coming from school, I had a bag containing four books; the prisoner and four others came up behind me—I had never seen the prisoner before, but I am sure he is one of the persons—one of them laid hold of my legs—I kicked him and he hopped away, and then the prisoner came and held my legs; I fell, and while I was down, one of them took my bag away, one held my neck, another had hold of my collar, and the prisoner had hold of my legs—they then all got up and ran away—the prisoner knocked me about the face and body—they all ill-used me, and broke one of the hooks off my coat, and a button off my waist-coat, and searched me—it was in Paradise-fields—they tried to search my waistcoat-pockets, but I held my elbows close so that they should not—I think I was on the ground about five minutes—I ran after them, but could not see a policeman, but after I got home, my aunt sent me for one—I went next day to the station at Hackney, and there saw the prisoner; I am certain he is the one that held and beat me.</p>

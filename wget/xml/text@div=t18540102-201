On the morning of the 3rd May this charge sheet was laid before Mr. Hardwick, the police Magistrate, who heard the charge—Mr. and Mrs. Booker attended, and the defendant was sworn as a witness, on a charge against them of indecently exposing themselves—I took down his evidence—(<hi rend="italic">reads:</hi>—"Henry Amor, police sergeant, <hi rend="italic">A</hi> 21, says: 'Last night, about a quarter past 9 o'clock, in Hyde-park, I saw the prisoners on the footpath.</p>

They were halfway between the wicket gate and Albert-gate. I told the prisoner I should take him into custody, and he sung out for the police.'")—the marriage certificate was produced before the Magistrate, and he discharged them, but directed inquiry to be made into their characters—on the following Monday they attended at the police court, and were dis<lb></lb>charged—it was not necessary for them to come on that day, but they did come—the defendant was expected, but I cannot say that I was in Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a china mender, at No. 1, Parkside, Knightsbridge, the first shop from Hyde-park-corner. I have had that shop getting on for four years—it is only a shop—I live at No. 30, opposite—I have been married ten months—this is the certificate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my wife's maiden name was Eliza Westbrook—she is the daughter of a shoemaker—we were married at St. Peter's, Pimlico—she was living in the neighbourhood with my aunt—my sister, Charlotte Booker, has continued to live with us since our marriage—on 3rd May I had been out on business all day—my sister was taking in some work of my cousin in the evening, and the shop not being very large, I said to my wife, "Let us go down the park"—we went out together, and came to the wicket gate—my wife went through first, and I noticed the prisoner speak to her—I said, "What is he talking about?"—she said, "Never mind, he is drunk"—I turned round, called him a vagabond, and asked him why he was insulting my wife—he only said, "I know you, go on"—I had never seen him before, and did not know he was an officer—we pursued our walk about, fifty yards, when my wife turned round and said, "This drunken fellow is following us"—I saw a policeman coming in the opposite direction, and just as he passed by I called out, "Police! police!—the defendant then ran up, and said, "Hold hard!"—I gave him in charge, and the policeman was going to take him when he turned round and said, "I am your superior," and told him to take me and my wife in charge, which he did—I asked what we were charged with—the defendant said, "Never mind, you take them"—I asked two or three times, but was not told what I was charged with till I got to the station—I said I lived only just in front of the railings, and asked him if he would not come and see where I lived—he said he could not go without an order from his sergeant, and the sergeant said I should not go—I told him that the woman was my wife—I ran to my own house, stopped at the gate, and then said, "Here is where I live, now I will go with you"—they took me into the park again, where the defendant had got my wife with a few people round her—we came out at the Apsley-house gate, and I said, "I had better have a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, I do not wish to be exposed "—the defendant said, "You are not going in that; hold him b——y tight!"—I and my wife were taken down Piccadilly to Vine-street station, without any charge being made against us—I found Mr. Burnett at the station, who asked the officer what the charge was—he whispered, and the sergeant then said we were charged with indecency—I cannot say that I heard the defendant make the charge, for I became insensible, not being in good health at the time—my cousin, who had brought the work to the shop, came to the station with our marriage certificate, and on its being shown at the station we were allowed to go home—it was then very nearly 11 o'clock—we went to the Mary<lb></lb>lebone street police office next morning, before Mr. Hardwick—the defendant</p>

I was four years 126 days a soldier, and was appointed sergeant part of that time, which my discharge from the regiment will show. The good character I had from the regiment procured me a situation as constable in the metropolitan police force, and was appointed sergeant in the A Division, which rank I held when this charge was made against me; I have felt ashamed to apply to my friends for assistance, and being without funds, am consequently undefended.

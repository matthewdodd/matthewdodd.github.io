             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live at Walworth: I have known Mr. Reeves, three years and upwards; he was a <rs id="t17980110-41-deflabel237" type="occupation">stock-broker and dealer in coals</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17980110-41-defend422 t17980110-41-deflabel237"></join>; he lived next door to me: In June, 1796, he applied to me to advance money upon Scrip receipts; I accordingly advanced nearly 2000l.; he lodged with me Scrip receipts for the loan of 7,500,000l.; in January following, he applied to me to advance more money; he had bought for me, before that, 2000l. Imperial Annuity; I added that to the former, making, in all, near 4000l.; I was not satisfied with the original security, but I requested to have a better security; he told me, if I would sell out of the Imperial Annuity, he would give me heavy Scrip, that is, Scrip paid up in full. On the 19th of January, Mr. Reeves and I went to the Bank together in a coach.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Was that the day you sold out of the Imperial Annuity? - A. I believe it was. When we got to the Bank, Mr. Reeves was very ill, and he went into a private place; he told me to go into the Rotunda, and he would go and see his principal.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, where were the receipts he had originally given you? - A. I had returned them to him; he told me to stay in the Rotunda till he returned; in about two hours, he returned to the Rotunda again, where I was waiting impatiently for him; he then brought me six Scrip receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these, and see if those six are among them? - A. I marked them at the corner, all but the bottom one.</p>
               <p>Q. These six appear to be paid up to the full? - A. They appear to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in that state when he delivered them to you in the Rotunda? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a seventh, how came you by that? - A. In October, there was some more money coming to me, and he said, he would give me another receipt, but only let it remain, for money was very scarce; I never transacted any business with Mr. Reeves as a principal, I always considered him as a broker.</p>
               <p>Q. There is another piece of paper attached to that, whose hand-writing is it? - A. Mr. Reeves's; he wrote it in my presence; I put an unlimited confidence in him as a broker, and as a man I always had the highest opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection whether those six paid up in full were any part of what he returned to you again? - A. I cannot ascertain that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him, and what, when he was in the Rotunda? - A. I have already related almost all the conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these at any time converted into stock? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation respecting their becoming stock? - A. I asked him, why he did not make good the agreements; he talked of his principal as a great man at the Stock-Exchange, who returned 100,000l. a day, three or four times over.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the reason he gave for their not being converted into stock? - A. The reason he gave was, that the more stock that was brought into market, it would depress the market, and they found an advantage in keeping the stock out of the market.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say found that advantage? - A. The people that he said belonged to these papers.</p>

               <p>Q. Are these in the same state in which you received them from him? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. This matter was not discovered till the October following? - A. Not till the last day of October. (The receipt read).</p>

On the 30th of October, I was sent for to the Bank, and found Mr. Reeves and Mr. Parry there; an enquiry was entered into between Mr. Reeves and Mr. Parry respecting some Scrip receipts, to the extent of between 4 and 5,000l. after that enquiry had been gone through, Mr. Parry suggested to me, that he believed Mr. Ashforth was in the same situation with himself, that he held some deposits of Scrip from Mr. Reeves; Mr. Reeves was in an adjoining room, I went to him, he was then under the care of a peace officer; I told him of this, and asked him if he had made any such deposit with Mr. Ashforth; he said, he said, he had; I asked him to what amount; he said, to the amount of about 4000l. in consequence of which, I sent to him; I pressed Mr, Reeves to tell me from whom he had those receipts that he gave to Mr. Parry and Mr. Ashforth; he said, he did not know, it was a considerable time ago, and he had forgot.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wood. I submit to your Lordship, that the evidence given in support of this charge, does not prove the indictment. My Lord, The first objection that I shall take the liberty of stating is, that the indictment states that the prisoner at the bar forged a receipt, purporting to be the receipt of Christopher Olier; now, upon looking at the face of the receipt, your Lordship will see, that it does not purport any such thing. It is true it bears the signature of C. Olier, but that may be Charles, or any other name beginning with a C, but does not purport, upon the face of it, to be Christopher Olier. My Lord, I understand there was a case of that sort lately, which my learned Friend, Mr. Knapp, will cite to your Lordship, in which that objection was taken, and prevailed. My Lord, with respect to the other objections, I think it will be better for me to take your Lordship's opinion upon this, before I proceed to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The case Mr. Wood has alluded to, is the case of the King and Gilchrist, which was determined by all your Lordships; it was reported in this place by Mr. Justice Buller, of which I have a very correct note.</p>
               <p>In February Sessions, 1795, the prisoner was indicted for forging a certain paper writing, purporting to be an order for the payment of money, and purporting to be signed by T. Exton, and to be directed to Lord George Kinnard, William Morland, and 
               <persName id="t17980110-41-person434">
                  Thomas

                  </persName>
            , bankers and partners, by the name of Ransom, Morland, and Hammersley; and then it is set out in the indictment, in the way in which it purports to be stated. The objection was, that the bill was improperly described, the name of Lord George Kinnard not being upon the face of it, it could not purport to be directed to him. The Jury convicted the prisoner; and, in July, 1795, at the Sessions here, Mr. Justice Buller says, "I give the opinion of ten of the Judges, who were all that assembled, and were unanimous upon the point; I must make an observation upon the manner in which indictments of this nature are drawn. It is the duty of a good pleader not to clog the record unnecessarily, to take care not to throw too much proof upon his client, and not to state repugnant, or absurd matter. The books are full of distinctions as to the words purport and tenor, and the necessity of using the one or the other; but I find no determination that both shall be stated; the purport is the substance of the instrument as it appears upon the face of the instrument itself; the tenor is an exact copy; where the tenor is set out, the purport must be necessarily included; the forms of indictments are now much more complicated than formerly, and, I think, much worse. The indictment stated the prisoner to have forged a certain paper writing, signed T. Exton, purporting to be a bill of Exchange, and then setting out the tenor is quite sufficient; there must be a tenor set out, and then the purport is included. Lord George Kinnard, Morland, and Hammersley, carrying on the banking business under the name of Ransom, Morland, and Hammersley, the pleader thought he must take the name of Lord Kinnard, which is not necessary, which renders it inconsistent with itself, and repugnant to the bill, for it does not appear to be so directed; and as such direction is not upon the face of the bill, the indictment is bad, and the prisoner must be discharged from this indictment."</p>
               <p>Now, it does seem to me, my Lord, that this objection goes, all fours, with the objection that Mr. Wood had taken. The objection there was, that the appearance of the bill contradicted the purport; - what is the objection here? It purports to be signed by a person having a christian name belonging to him, namely, that of Christopher.</p>
               <p>Does Christopher appear to be the person whose name the bill purports to bear? Certainly not; but C. Olier, which may be Charles, or any thing else; and, therefore, that determination seems to me to govern the present objection; and, I trust, your Lordship, upon that authority, will be of opinion that it is fatal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Balmanno. I will only just mention to your Lordship another case, reported in Mr. Leach's book, the case of 
               <persName id="t17980110-41-person435">

            , where it was decided, that an instrument, purporting to be a Bank-note, must appear so upon the face of it; and, that no representation of the prisoner can alter the purport of it.</p>
               <p>Court. This case, a little, varies from the cases that have been cited. As I understand it, the prisoner gave a receipt with C. Olier subscribed to it, thereby purporting to be the receipt of 
               <persName id="t17980110-41-person436">
                  Christopher

            , who is one of the cashiers of the Bank. The case of Gilchrist differs from this, because the name of Kinnard does not at all appear upon the face of the bill; but this seems to me to describe it exactly as it is; a receipt for one hundred pounds ten shillings, with the name C. Olier, thereto subscribed; therefore, I do not feel the weight of the objection; I will mention it to my Brothers who are up stairs, and if they have any doubt upon that point, it shall be saved.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wood. I am to submit to your Lordship, that there is not sufficient evidence to be left to the Jury, in order to convict the prisoner of the offence charged in this indictment. My Lord, in order to make an offence within this Act of Parliament, it must clearly appear, that the instrument supposed to be forged, was forged subsequent to the passing of this Act of Parliament for raising a Loan of seven million and a half.</p>
               <p>My Lord, this Act of Parliament passed on the 14th of May, 1796, and the clause upon which the indictment was founded, is the twenty-second: "That if any person or persons shall forge, or counterfeit, any receipt, or receipts, for the whole, or any part of the said contributions towards the said seven millions and a half, or shall alter any number, figure, or word therein, or utter, or publish as true, any such forged receipt, shall be adjudged guilty of felony, and suffer death, as a felon, without benefit of clergy.</p>
               <p>Now your Lordship will see, that the Act is merely<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100056"></xptr>prospective, and, therefore, unless it has clearly appeared in evidence, that the receipt, which has been uttered, was actually forged, subsequent to the passing of this Act, I conceive the prisoner ought to be acquitted. Now your Lordship will see, that the first receipt is dated the 26th of April, which is before the passing of the Act, and the uttering a receipt which had been forged, prior to the passing of the Act, could not have brought the defendant within that Act. Now, I take it, that there is no evidence in this case to prove, that the receipt was forged, subsequent to the passing of the Act, and your Lordship will recollect what the evidence is; the several receipts were deposited in the month of June, and if they were the same receipts or part of the same receipts that were returned to Mr. Ashforth, at the time they were returned, then, most undoubtedly, the case would have been clear; but, my Lord, it is not so, because your Lordship will recollect, that Mr. Ashforth says, he would not pretend to say, they were the same receipts that he had had in his possession before. Therefore, how does the matter stand upon the evidence? That certain receipts had been delivered subsequent to the passing of the Act, and (which is a material circumstance, that I must beg leave to call your Lordship's attention to) the first of those receipts bears date the 26th of April, and the others have no date to them, therefore, non cunstat, all these might have been forged before the passing of the Act, and if they were, I conceive the prisoner cannot be found guilty. The first payment, your Lordship will observe, was on the 26th of April, and it is possible, that all might have been paid up at that time, for subscribers to the loan have an opportunity of paying in the whole of the subcription, and it does not appear to the contrary. That is my objection, that inasmuch as it does not clearly appear, that the receipt uttered was forged subsequent to the passing of the Act, the defendant ought to be acquitted.</p>
               <p>My Lord, There is another objection, which I trust your Lordship will think clear and decisive, and that is, that this receipt, which is supposed to be forged, is not a receipt to which this Act of Parliament applies; and here I beg leave to state particularly to your Lordship, the nature of this subscription, and the nature of the clauses contained in the Act. My Lord, it is clear, that to constitute a forgery within this Act of Parliament, the receipt itself must purport to be a receipt for a contribution for the purchase of these annuities, mentioned in the Act. Now, my Lord, let us see whether this receipt does purport to be a receipt for any subscription, or contribution, for the purchase of the annuities mentioned in this Act. My Lord, the Act begins with reciting that the Commons of Great-Britain have resolved that the sum of seven millions and a half be raised by annuities, in manner therein after-mentioned. It then directs that the contributors shall, for every 100l. contributed either in money or Exchequer-bills, he entitled to the principal sum of 100l. in the 3 per Cent. Consols, and an additional principal sum of 20l. in like Annuities; a further principal sum of 25l. in the 3 per Cents. Reduced, and a further annuity of 5s. 6d. for a certain number of years. The interest upon the Consolidated Annuities, is to commence from the 5th of January 1796, upon the Reduced Annuities, from the 5th of April 1796, and I believe the 5s. 6d. Long Annuities are to commence from April likewise.</p>
               <p>Then the 19th Section of the Act says, that all monies to which any person or persons shall become entitled by virtue of this Act, in respect of any sum advanced, or contributed towards the said sum of seven millions and a half, on which the said respective Annuities first mentioned shall be added to the joint Stock of Annuities, transferrable at the Bank of England, which had been consolidated by former Acts of Parliament, so far, with respect to the 3 per Cents. Then, with respect to the 25l. 3 per Cent. Reduced Annuities, they are likewise to be added to the old Stock of 3 per Cent. reduced Annuities, and the 5s. 6d. Long Annuity is to be added to the old Stock of 5s. 6d. Long Annuities. Now, if your Lordship will please to advert to the terms of this receipt, your Lordship will perceive that it is quite a distinct Annuity, for it is a receipt for a subscription of 670l. for the purchase of 1000l. in the old Stock, which had been consolidated by the former Acts of Parliament. In order to have been a receipt within this Act of Parliament, it ought to have been at least for the sum to be created into a Stock by this new Act, and added to the old Stock; whereas it is a receipt for 1000l. in a Stock which has been long consolidated, and which this Act does not authorize the sale of; here the receipt does not appear to be a receipt for the purchase of Stock to be added to the old Stock, but is a receipt for the purchase of the old Stock itself. There is a material difference between a man giving a receipt for 1000l. 3 per Cent. Consolidated Annuities, as long ago as the 25th, 28th, 29th, 32d, or 33d of George II. and one that is to be created in 1796.</p>
               <p>My Lord, There is another thing - Every person, subscribing under this Act of Parliament, is entitled to three different species of Stock; for every 100l. he is entitled to so much 3 per Cent. so much Reduced Annuities, and so much Long Annuities. Now this is merely a receipt for the purchase of Stock in the 3 per Cent. Annuities. The Governor and Company of the Bank of England may say, we think sit to divide this, and therefore we will give different receipts; but that has not appeared in evidence, and therefore it is not to be presumed that such receipts are given; and supposing such receipts are given, it is not for the Bank of England to bring persons within the penalties of this Act of Parliament, by any particular acts of their own. A receipt, under this Act of Parliament, must be according to the terms of the Act; it therefore ought to have been a receipt for the receipt of so much, for which the person was entitled to such a quantity of 3 per Cent. Annuities, such a quantity of Reduced Annuities, and such a quantity of Long Annuities. - Therefore, My Lord, upon these grounds, I submit to your Lordship, that the prisoner ought to be acquitted.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wood was followed by Mr. Knapp and Mr. Balmanno, on the same side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I will trouble your Lordship with a very few observations -</p>
               <p>Court. It is unnecessary to give you any trouble, Mr. Fielding, for I do not see that these objections have any weight. With respect to its being forged prior to the Act, it seems to me to be for the Jury to say, upon the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100057"></xptr>whole of the evidence, whether it was forged subsequent to the passing of the Act, or not; though I do not know that is necessary that they should do so, for it does not matter, in a case of forgery, if the receipt was forged, and was uttered and published after the passing of the Act, every ingredient of the crime is complete.</p>
               <p>The next objection is, that this is not such a receipt as that to which the Act applies. The argument of the Counsel has gone upon reading only a part of the receipt; if the whole of the receipt was read, it would be impossible to doubt what it was for; for it states the Loan of 1796, for seven millions and a half, 1000l. 3 per Cent. Annuities, to be added to the 3 per Cent. Consolidated Annuities of stock then existing. The indictment goes on, and states the receipt more fully: - Received of

            , Esq. the sum of 67l. for a deposit of 10 per Cent. upon 670l. subscribed by him, in pursuance of the above-said resolution, and upon the due payment of the remaining 90 per Cent. of the said sum of 670l. the said subscriber or his assigns, by his or their indorsement thereon, will, in exchange for this receipt, become entitled to 1000l. joint-stock of Annuities, consolidated at the Bank of England by the several subsequent Acts. - Is not this Act one of the subsequent Acts by which this stock was consolidated?</p>
               <p>The next objection is, that it must be adapted to the very terms of the Act, that the subscribers shall be entitled to a certain proportion of 3 per Cent. Consolidated Annuities of the 3 per Cent. Reduced Annuities, and of the Long Annuity. Now let us see what is the clause in the Act, which makes it a forgery to counterfeit a receipt for the whole, or any part of the said contribubution - Now, does not this appear to be a receipt for a part of this contribution? - As to there being separate receipts, I am to understand, that the Bank, in doing their business, do it correctly; there is a very great inconvenience in having them separate and distinct, because a man has an opportunity to purchase in what stock he pleases; but, in the course of this argument, the second set of Counts is entirely forgot.</p>
               <p>These objections have been argued by the Counsel very ably, and with all that zeal that does them credit, when a man has so much at stake.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I have known Mr. Ashforth for a considerable time, and transacted a great deal of business for him in my line of Scrip receipts; the loan of seven millions and a half for the year 1796, being considered advantageous to purchase, I purchased many of them for Mr. Ashforth as well as myself; having accounts to settle with Mr. Ashforth, for money advanced by him, with only the first payment made upon them, and having inadvertantly lost the opportunity of making the other payments, by being confined to my room by severe indisposition; on my recovery, I went to the Stock-Exchange, and purchased Scrip receipts with the whole payment, I cannot tell whether they were forged any more than if they had been Bank-notes passing through my hands. My Lord, Scrip receipts are as current as Bank-notes; I cannot recollect of whom I purchased them; there are many gentlemen about the Stock-Exchange, who keep no minutes of their business any more than myself; if I had had any idea of forging, or uttering a receipt knowing it to be forged, I certainly should not have attended the Stock-Exchange as I did; I was attending the Stock-Exchange to the very hour, and in fact, at the very minute that I was apprehended.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL NESBITT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Wood. Q. You have been pretty largely concerned in the negociation of Scrip? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual to negociate Scrip without taking any account of whom you purchase them? - A. It is very much the practice upon the Stock-Exchange; it is so in my own case; it is impossible for me to say of whom I have bought them.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you have known some instances of it? - A.Particularly so in the month of October or November, I forget which, in the settling of a large sum of Scrip, I missed it; I looked over my accounts, and could not find it; the next morning, I stuck up an advertisement at the Stock-Exchange, but I could not learn any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it customary to negociate full Scrip? - A. Yes; suppose I want to borrow money, I go to my banker, and deposit that, it is more handily done than transferring stock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. How long have you been employed as a broker? - A. Upwards of twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I take it for granted, you have heard of Lyon's case formerly? - A. Yes; I know the case.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that circumstance might have shewn you, that now and then, paper passing about might be dangerous? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever purchase Scrip without looking at it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In the purchase of Scrip, what is it material to consider? - A. The party of whom you purchase, and to see that the money is right. Having had very large concerns in Scrip, I have found, when I have attempted to take an account of the letters and numbers, I could not get through my business; I should have known who I bought 5000l. of, and who I had bought Scrip of; but if it had been forged, and had been afterwards brought to me, I could not have said, who I had had it of.</p>

               <p>Q. When all the payments are made upon this Scrip, you are entitled to a dividend upon that stock from that time, are you not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you keep it out of that stock, of course you have no dividend? - A. If I keep it after a dividend, I procrastinate the payment of the dividend.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you keep heavy Scrip that is paid up, by you, you lose all the interest of that stock you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100058"></xptr>turn it into? - A. Provided I pay it up, or convert it into stock before the dividend becomes due, then I should lose that interest.</p>
               <p>Q.Understand me, supposing the payments upon the subscription of 2000l. are all made up at that very moment, you may convert it into stock? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if you keep that Scrip by you six months, you lose the advantage of six months dividend upon that stock? - A. No; if I keep it, and do not make it into stock, I only lose the interest upon the interest; as soon as I turn it into stock, I get the arrears of the dividend.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you ever had an opportunity of taking Scrip, without making any minutes, by which you would be able to know of whom you have bought it? - A. Yes; I have bought large quantities of Scrip.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you happened to have any loss in consequence of it? - A. No; I always make a minute of what I buy, but not of the persons.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know if it is the constant practice for jobbers to take minutes of every transaction? - A. We always make minutes of whom we have them of, but the Scrips are apt to mix, they are like such a number of Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Giles. Q. Though you do mix your Scrip, you take minutes of whom you receive them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were to make a deposit of Scrip with a third person for a principal, should you not take an account of whom that principal was? - A. Yes; but Scrip is as negociable as Bank-notes.</p>

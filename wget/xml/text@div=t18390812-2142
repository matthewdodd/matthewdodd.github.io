                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live in Walbrook—I have one partner—the prisoner was in my employ. On Friday, the 19th of July, I told him I had heard he had been offering our goods for sale, and asked him to explain it—he said he had bought a couple of pairs of screens of Dodd and Co., and made them up for sale, to see what was doing in the trade—I asked if he had sold them—he said, not—I said, "Then you can produce them"—I accompanied him to his house,</p>

               <p>and while there found several articles of our property—I showed them to him, and said, "Oh, Satchwell, did we deserve this of you?"—he burst into tears, and said, "I was perfeetly wretched, sir, and will tell you all about it"—he said he had been in the habit of taking goods from us for some time, and selling them to Sewell and Co., of Fore-street—fancy albums and needle-cases—I asked how many—he hesitated—I said, "A hundred?"—he said, "Oh, that is a good many"—I said, "Eighty?"—he made no reply—I went to Se well's and found among other things five dozen souvenirs, sixteen needle-cases, and thirteen albums—(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)—these are my property—I never authorized him to sell them.</p>

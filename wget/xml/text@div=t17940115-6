On Monday night, the 25th of November, I lost ten shirts, and a shirt; I sent round to several pawnbrokers about Westminster, and the next morning, Mr. Hill's servant, a pawnbroker, in the Broad-way, Westminister, stopped two of the shirts, and took the girls that brought them; and the gentlemen of the Police in Queen's-square, Westminster, committed the two girls that brought the shirts. About a fortnight afterwards, I was before the Police, they sent to me to know if I knew any thing against Finch; I went there, and as he stood at the bar, I suspected a shirt of mine being on his back; they made him shew the mark, when I was positive to the shirt.</p>

About a fortnight after I heard that Mrs. Storr had lost this linen, I was sent for into Orchard-street, to a little court called Paviour's Court, when I got there, the person of the house told me, that there was a man that they had got in their charge for cutting down of lines, and folding up some linen, that lay in a garden; I took him to Queen's-square; on this charge, he was sent to Tothillfields for re-examination; before he was re-examined, I was ordered to go to Mrs. Storr, and the pawnbroker, and order them there by the morrow with the two girls, which I did; at the magistrate's, Mrs. Storr swore to her property, and the pawnbroker swore the same as he has just now; then after that I searched the man, and found this shirt on his back, which Mrs. Storr swore to be her property, I likewise took.</p>

               <p>Pawnbroker. These are the very shirts that were stopped by me; I know them by the marks that were put on them. My name is Simmon; they are marked T. P. S. No. 10, and No. 6, it was by that, we stopped them; we were informed that shirts of that mark had been lost.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Storr. I am very clear that they are my property, from always having the handling of the linen, and by the particular marks.</p>
               <p>Q. How came these to be particularly marked from the others? - I bought the cloth with intent to give it away, and marked them different from the others.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Them there three shirts, I was coming over the fields, and I picked them up; I did not mind what they were till I brought them home; when I came home, standing very much in need, I put one on, being the best of the shirts; the other two, I asked these young women to go, and pawn them for me; and they said, they would; when they went to the pawnbroker's with them, the pawnbroker stopped them; and the people told me, if I did not go out of the way they would take me up.</p>

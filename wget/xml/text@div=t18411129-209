                  </hi>. I lodge at M'Farlane's, in Ratcliff-highway. On the 16th of November, I went to bed there—I bad a sovereign in my watch<lb></lb>pocket—I placed my trowsers at the foot of the bed, and when I got up next morning the sovereign was gone—the prisoner and another young man slept in the same room—I spoke to the prisoner about it, and he said something which threw suspicion on the other person who slept there—I then spoke to the other young man—We prisoner went out shortly after—I afterwards gave him in charge from something I was told.</p>

I went to a house in Blue-gate<lb></lb>fields, at the request of M'Farlane, and found the prisoner there—I asked if he had any money about him—he said, "No"—I searched him, and found 13 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a knife in his pocket—I asked him where he got it—he said he had earned it by taking some clothes down to a shipmate, and the knife was bought at Mr. Cadman's—in taking him to the station, a halfpenny dropped from his trowsers—I afterwards found four half-crowns wrapped up in a piece of paper, concealed in the lining of his hat—he said he knew nothing of them.</p>

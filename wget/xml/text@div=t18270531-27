In consequence of information, about the second week in May, I gave him in charge of Lewis, in my shop, as I had an anonymous letter; I and the constable went with him to his lodging in Lancashire-court, Bond-street; we found our property there, concealed in different parts of the room - there were buttons, various wrappers, and some remnants of calico; I found in a box, which was locked, different lengths of Irish linen, four or five yards together, and a new clothes brush; we could not miss this property, as it was taken from a large quantity, and perhaps at different times; he had no access to our premises except when he was in our service. No one article is worth 40s.</p>

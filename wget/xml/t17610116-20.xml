            . I am foreman to Mr. Churchman; he losing a leaden pump [for which Manton was tried.] I had marked those cocks and other things, thinking to detect the person that stole the pump; and the prisoner happened to be the first man that was catched in stealing. He went into the nail room after some nails, and brought me the key again. And before he went out of the yard, I went into the room, and found one of the co cks gone. I followed him, and found it upon him. He was very sorry for it; and I dare say he will take care for the future. He was quite innocent as to the leaden pump. This is the first thing I ever heard or knew him to be guilty of. [ The cock produced.] This I know to be my master's property; for I marked it with a center punch; here is the mark upon it.</p>

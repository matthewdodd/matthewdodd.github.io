                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, living at 3, Endle Street, Hackney—on the 8th July I had a brown mare, which I saw safe in a field on Hackney Downs at eight o'clock that night—at five next morning it was gone—I next saw it on the 16th or 18th August in the New Cattle Market, in the possession of a man named Hedges, for sale—I claimed her—when I lost her she was worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I communicated with the police, and had bills printed, offering a reward.</p>

I am a general dealer, of 2, Manning's Place, Marylebone—on the 9th Jury, between four and five in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner opposite Ryan's public-house—he had a brown mare for sale—it was the same I saw outside the police-court—I was looking after one for Mr. Lonnor at the time, and I said I thought it would suit him—we went to Mr. Lonnor's, and the prisoner told him he had had it a month, drawing coals and coke—Mr. Lonnor gave 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it.</p>

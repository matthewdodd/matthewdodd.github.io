             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Public-office, Hatton-garden: I took the prisoner into custody on Saturday, the 22d of June, at his master's shop, as he was sitting at work on the shop-board; I searched him; he was very unwilling to have his left hand breeches pocket searched; I directed my brother officer to hold his hands while I searched him, and pulled out this key; it is the key of his master's door, as I understand; he used to have one, and his master the other; I asked him what he had got else; he said, nothing else material to me; I put my hand into the same pocket, and there I found the scutcheon belonging to the door that had been broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account of that scutcheon? - A. Yes, he said he picked it up against the door as he came in on the morning, or some part of the day, I cannot take upon me to say exactly; I searched him the same day; he said he picked it up, and I think it was the morning; I found a little key in the same pocket; I asked him how he came by that key; he said it was a trifling thing, I might throw it away, he had picked it up in the street at the same time; I told him I would not throw it away, it might be of service hereafter; I took him into custody; he told me he lodged with his mother, I think the place is called Ship-yard; I went there with him, and enquired of the mother if he lodged there; the mother said, yes, he did; I thought he did not from some circumstance that occurred; I searched the house, and found nothing there; I then took him to the Office, and he was committed for re-examination on Wednesday. On Tuesday morning, I received information from the prosecutor and another witness that there was a box at a house in Great Shire-lane belonging to the prisoner; I went there, and saw it, at No. 14 I believe; I tried this small key I had found on him, and it fitted the lock of this box, and all these things were in the box; the prosecutor and Stantiford were present with me; and as a convincing proof that this box belonged to the prisoner, I have had him in custody before, and the master agreed that he should be sent on board the Tender, and the master, instead of doing what was proper, kept the indentures; he should have cancelled them; and here is his discharge from on board of the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the house where you made this search? - A. I do not know the person's name, it is a chandler's shop; the woman behaved very civil indeed; she shewed me the box, and said, if she had known that he was such a kind of a person, he should not have come there to lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a lock has that box? - A. It appears to be a common one by the key, it is very strong.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Look at these articles, and see which is your's - do you know these articles? - A. The clothes and boots were in my possession; the clothes I swear to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Lake.) Look at these boots? - A. I can take my oath they are Mr. Hookamfreer's property, I was to take them to the Minories to be stretched; I am servant to Mr. Fraser, but my sister-in-law and brother live with Mr. Hookamfreer; the boots are perfectly new, and his name is inside of them, and there is not one boot in a hundred that has such a strap, it is a brown webb strap; they generally have a white one, but this was made for strength, as I was informed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that you left them at Mr. Wells's shop? - A. I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is my first crime that I have committed, and I hope you will have a little mercy.</p>

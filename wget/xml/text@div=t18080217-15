In the evening from information I sent for an officer and had him searched; the officer found some metal in an inside pocket of his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it type metal. - A. Yes; the same that we received from Mr. Nicholls; his apron was tied over his coat, and before the metal.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was produced had it the appearance of metal that was taken from the fire. - A. Yes, burned paper was attached to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was found on him. - A. About three pounds; it was worth about three shillings.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOWYER NICHOLS. Q. Are you in partnernership with your father. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, some time back you had the misfortune to have your premisses burned by a fire. - A. On Monday the 8th instant; all that was dug out of the ruins was intended to be sent to Mr. Figgins.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the metal that was taken from this man. - A. Yes. I have not the least doubt that it came from our premises, by its appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time it was taken, it was the property of Messrs. Nichols. - A. It was.</p>

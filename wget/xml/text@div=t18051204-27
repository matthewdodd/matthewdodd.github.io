Last Saturday, the prisoner at the bar came into my shop, took up a goose, and immediately went out; my boy saw her take the goose, I did not; I saw her come in and go out; she was brought back then; she had my goose in a basket, she acknowledged to having it, and begged me to let her go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say how she came to take it? - A. She said she was very much in distress.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. In Holborn.</p>

             sworn. Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, did you ever see her before? - A. Yes, in my master's shop; I saw her last Saturday; she came in, and looked at a goose, and after having turned them over, she put one under her cloak, and went out of the shop with it, and went up a court, and put it in a basket; I followed her and brought her back to my master's shop; she wanted to beg pardon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you, my lord, I was going up Holborn; I do not know whether I was coming by that shop or no; this young man followed me, and asked me what I had in my basket; I told him I had nothing at all belonging to him; I went back to his master's shop; his master could not swear to it; if I had been guilty I would not have gone back.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot swear to the goose, I had so many; my boy saw her take it.</p>

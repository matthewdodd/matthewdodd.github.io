               <p>I keep the Highlander public-house, the corner of Whitcombe-street; on Thursday, the 18th of August last, between the hours of ten and eleven at night, three men came into my house, one of them I can swear to, which is Clarke; one I am doubtful on, which is Cox; and I think Robson was another. They asked for two shillings worth of salmon, and had two or three pots of porter, and five slices of bread, a quartern of brandy, and sixpennyworth of rum and water; they said about twenty-five minutes, and paid their reckoning, and went away; they were gone before eleven, and might come about half after ten. I knew Clarke before, I never saw Robson, before, but I took particular notice of Robson, because he was a particularly likely young man. I am not positive to Robson.</p>

             The young man they call Robson had been there before that day, with two more, whom I do not know; I can swear positively to Robson. I kept the pocket book till a person called for it, I cannot say who it was. Nobody said any thing to me, but they all three went into the parlour, and I saw it there on the seat when I went in for the candle, about two minutes after they were gone; they staid about five minutes. I found it on the seat where the other two were sitting whom I did not know. I knew Robson before. The room had been empty an hour.</p>

               <p>I am a soldier in the first regiment of foot-guards. On Friday morning, August 19, I was coming past Johnsons-court, Charing-cross, Cope and Robson were getting out of a hackney coach; they asked me to go in and drink with them at the Mitre, which I did; during that time Cope pulled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140042"></xptr>watch out of his pocket, and said they had made it last night, with a 10 l. Bank note, and nine guineas, among four of them, in the presence of Robson; and they asked me to ride with them to Tower-hill in a coach, and I rode with them to the Savoy, and Robson and Cope got out there, I thought myself in bad company, and went away. It was a green cased watch, and a dent on the inside; I think I should know it again, (looks at it) I really believe it is the same watch. They were both very much in liquor, but I will not positively swear to it; there was nobody in the coach but Robson, Cope, and me.</p>

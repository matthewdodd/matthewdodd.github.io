            . I know the prisoner Sales - I also know Pelser; I remember the night of Mr. Bowles' robbery - before that I saw Pelser at the Crown, New-cut, Lambeth; we had some conversation, and I agreed to meet him at the White Lion, Wych-street, and did so; I went there by myself, and the next day I went to a house in Shire-lane, by Temple-bar - that was the day after I was at the White Lion, and the Crown in the New-cut; I met Henry Wood and Pelser at Shire-lane - Sales did not go with me then; I took him afterwards - I went to Sales' house in a day or two after I had seen Pelser; I went in consequence of what had passed between me and Pelser - I saw Sales, and he went with me to Shire-lane - that was two or three days after I had met Pelser at the Crown; when Sales and I went to Shire-lane, we met Henry Wood and Pelser there; two women came in and then went out -Pelser, Sales, Wood and I were in the room together; we shut the door - Wood said he knew of a thing as good as a gift, that he could get a great deal of wedge meaning silver; the conversation went on as to how they were to go down to the place to get it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was a proposition made to go down? A. Yes - it was made by Wood, Sales, Pelser and myself; Wood and Sales said they thought it would be the best way to go down in a gig - we had no money to pay for a gig; Pelser said he would pawn his watch to raise the money - we separated that night, to meet next afternoon at three o'clock, in Shire-lane; I went out with Pelser next morning, and he pawned his watch for 1l., at Higginbottom's, New-cut; we then went to a livery-stable in Wellington-street, Blackfriars-road, where Pelser deposited 6s., as he told me, but I did not see it; he came out and said it was all right, we had got the gig - he said so; I went from there with Pelser, to Sales' house, in Brandon-street, near the Kent-road - it is about a quarter of a mile from the Elephant and Castle- we saw Sales; Pelser and myself said we had left the money for the gig, that it was all right, and we were to meet altogether at Shire-lane, at three o'clock next day, to appoint the time to go at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know at this time where you were going? A. No I did not; Pelser, Wood, and I met there at three o'clock next afternoon, but Sales was not there - Pelser and Wood lived in Shire-lane; I and Pelser went from there to get the money for the gigs back again, in consequence of what passed, and I believe at one place in the Waterloo-road, part of the money was returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were two gigs? A. Yes, at two different stables; we went to Sales' house, and he was not at home - we went back from there to Shire-lane, and met Sales at the door and a person with him who I had never seen before, named George Williams; Sales was in a passion, and we said it was put off because he did not come to his time - he was in a great passion at that, and swore very much; he said he would be d-d if he would be played with by any b-r; Wood and Pelser came down stairs, and were alarmed at his being there, and we all five went away; Pelser and Wood said they would go and try to get the gig to convince him we had paid for them - we all five went to the livery stable in Blackfriars-road; Sales. Williams and I stopped at the corner of Wellington-street - Wood and Pelser went to the stable and got the gig - when we saw the gig coming we said it was all right; Wood and Pelser drove to the corner of Rowland Hill's chapel - Sales got into the gig there: Wood and Pelser were in - I and Williams were to walk to the Flower Pot, Bishopsgate-street, where they said they would wait for us; Wood gave me a shilling, and told me to give it to a coachman that would be there and in a little time a coach came up with Edmonton and Tottenham written on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get to the Flower Pot? A. Yes, and met them there; I and Williams stood there waiting for the stage - the others waited at the corner, and said they wanted to get something which they were short of; I think it was poison; a stage came up with Tottenham and Edmonton written on it - we got on it, and stopped on the left-hand side, by a public-house on the road; I do not know whether it was Edmonton or Tottenham - the gig was at the door at the time; it was sometimes before, and sometimes behind the stage; I do not know the sign of the public-house - I pointed it out to the officers, and went in with them; I described the bar to be a round bar, and a very handsome machine in it - we got down there, and saw Wood, Pelser and Sales drinking something there in a glass; I think it was brandy and water - they got there before us; I and Williams had a pint of porter, a biscuit and some cheese - they took no notice of us at the bar - we all went outside together, and had some gin; the stage was waiting all this time - I and Williams got on it, the other three got in the gig, and we went to a house on the left-hand side of the way, with some pillars before it, where the stage stops - I have pointed out that house to Myers and Goff; we got down there - it is by a lane leading to Enfield; I think it was about ten o'clock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180010"></xptr>when we arrived at that public-house; the gig had not arrived - it came about five minutes after; Pelser came into the room, and said they were all ready - Sales and Wood remained in the gig; there was some joking in the tap-room while Pelser and Williams were there - after that Pelser took his seat in the gig; Sales and Wood were in it - Williams got on the step, and I ran behind; I sometimes laid hold of the gig - I should think the gig drove along three miles from the public-house; I should know the place where it stopped at - I saw it, and have not seen it since; it was a wooden gate - Wood got out of the gig, went in, and led the horse down the lane; there is a hedge on the right-hand side of the lane, and a wooden paling on the left; when the gig stopped there I had two phials given to me by either Wood or Sales, I cannot say which - I was to go down the town to a public-house Wood was to shew me, and where Mr. Bowles' servants were, I was to sing a song, ask them to drink, and to pour the contents of the phials into what liquor they (the servants) were drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know before that it was Mr. Bowles' servants? A. No - I have been told that since; I do not know whether Wood or Sales gave me the phials - they were both present; Wood told me he would describe the livery the servants wore - I refused to go, as I did not like it; I said the servants would be at home and in bed - I poured the contents of one phial out on the ground, and I believe I let the other fall on the ground; Wood said he would go and get some hay for the horse; he went, and I think Pelser with him - he returned with the hay.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time had you heard the chimes of a clock? A. Yes - at this time it was as near as possible half-past eleven o'clock; after the horse had the hay Sales said it was time to go and put away the type, which means the dog - I had not heard any dog there; Sales got a piece of liver out of some part of the gig - whether it was the pocket or not I do not know; he cut it into four pieces, cut a small piece out of each piece, and put something in mixed up about the thickness of mustard - the liver was tied up by Sales; I got a piece of string out of my shoe, as they had not string enough to tie the whole; Wood and another went to give the liver to the dog - I think Sales was the other; the dog barked very much first of all, but it was soon quiet - I could not see the house, but could see lights from the window; the house appeared about one hundred yards from the gate - they soon returned, and said the dog was quiet enough; Sales said it was quiet, and said if the dog could get any water he would go off, or burst, like a cannon - he made that observation directly, it was about half-past eleven o'clock; Sales said it was time to get the things out - he said it was time to go to work, and he began to trim a dark-lantern, which I think he had in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What things do you mean it was time to get out? A. There was a centre-bit, a crow-bar, a chisel, and this dark-lantern.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought these things? A. Williams had some in his pocket, and some Sales had in his pocket; they were all taken out - I saw them in the hands of Sales and Williams; they bid me stand by the horse, and not move - Sales, Pelser, Williams and Wood went away together, desiring me to stand by the horse and not leave till they returned; they were absent about two hours and a half, I think - I know it had not gone three o'clock; each came back loaded; as they came along I heard the tingle of something as it came along the fields, and I afterwards found it was a dial - it had two handles to it, and two of them carried it between them; they all returned together- there was a desk, four hats, two great coats, a white rug which might stand at a drawing-room door, and a decanter or water caraft; they were all packed up - I went into the gig first to help to pack them but they did not like the manner I did it; I was bundled out, and they packed the goods in the chaise; Wood and Williams got into the gig, and drove off - Sales, I, and Pelser were left to walk; the gig drove off - we kept up with it as long as we could, till it at last drove out of sight, and we stopped at a public-house on the right-hand side, as if it was in the main road - we had beer, bread, cheese, and onions there; I do not know any part of the road - I should know the house again; I have not pointed it out - I think it is about two miles from the gate where the gig had stopped; we remained at the public-house about twenty minutes, and met the gig a little below the public-house - it seemed as if it had come out of a lane below the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not overtake it? A. It was stopping about and seemed as if it had come out of a lane; Wood got out of the gig - Sales and Pelser got in; it drove off rather fast, and left Wood and me to walk - Sales was driving the gig; I walked with Wood about a quarter of a mile till we got to a bridge - I had occasion to stop behind, and Wood went as very fast; I did not see him again -I walked home as fast as I could; it was six o'clock when I arrived at Shoreditch church - I was very tired, and went from there to Brandon-street, where Sales lived; I got there about eight o'clock, and when I got into the room I found Sales, Wood, Pelser and Williams there -I was very much fatigued, and could scarcely walk; I threw myself down on the bed, and had a cup of tea brought to me - the place was all in confusion; the desk was broken open - there were papers and books, several purses and papers, and sealing-wax; there was a silver card case, which was engraved, but had no letters on it- I saw the dial, the great coats and hats, but I did not see a painting which was wrapped up in the rug.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was wrapped in the rug? A. I was to hand this rug up to them in the gig, and I could feel the glass in it; I saw the rug at the house - I saw some paintings at Sales' house, and have seen them since(looking at some) - there are no marks on these, but they were exactly like these; I have seen this bird before, and I have seen this one before - they are the very things I saw at Sales'.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Sales do any thing with all, or any part of them? A. These paintings were left alone - they were thought of little or no value; there was a box silver mounted, with a crest on it, and compasses and things in it: Sales and Williams rubbed out part of the crest -Sales and Williams took these with some other silver things away, and returned with 3l. odd shillings; Pelser went out with a great coat, and brought 1l. back - Sales gave me 1s. to go to buy two hat boxes; I brought them to Brandon-street, and took out two hats in them, one white and the other black, and was told to get what I could for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180011"></xptr>them; to pledge or sell them, but not to bring them back; I took one to a pawnbroker's, Mr. Walmsley, London-road, where I had pawned on my own account before - that was a large white hat; I pledged it for 4s. - I pawned the other hat, a black one, for 5s. or 6s., and the woman I bought the hat boxes of had the tickets; I have since seen the same white hat - I should know it again.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the woman had the tickets, then you went back to her? A. I went back to her, and had two more boxes - I sold one of the other hats to the woman for 3s., the other was an old white one; I could scarcely get any thing for it, and left it with the woman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you taken four hats? A. Yes, but not altogether; I took out two first, and then returned to Brandon-street to fetch the other two - I bought two more boxes, and then got the other hats; one I sold for 3s., and left the other with the woman - I went back to Sales with the money; it was put together, and divided into five parts - each had 19s. 6d.; I do not think one divided it more than another - it was thrown on the table, and reckoned at 19s. 6d. each; each took up his money - the dial, desk and other things were left with Sales at the house; Sales said he had broken up the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by leaving every thing else at Sales' - do you mean the contents of the desk? A. Yes, every thing but what I have named; Sales told me Williams had taken the dial out, but it was stopped - I went to Sales two or three times afterwards; there was a book with an immense sum of money entered in it of annuities, and money, as much as 10,000l. at a time - I wanted that book to be sent back to Mr. Bowles.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to hear of Mr. Bowles? A. The name was on several papers - Sales said that was the gentleman, and that he lived in St. Paul's Church-yard; I think it was Carington Bowles; Sales said he would take care of the book and papers, he would not let any thing be taken out of the place - Sales was dressed that night in a large drab great coat, trousers, and a sort of engineer's coat; I should know the great coat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Drab is not an unusual colour for a great coat? A. No, but I think I should know it if I was to see it - I should know it, for I have seen it when he has got it out of pledge: I follow the paper-hanging and painting business, and did so at the time of the robbery: I was not in employ then - I have not worked for a master, except Mr. Greenwood; I worked for myself - I have worked for Higginbottom, the pawnbroker, within three months: I hung paper for him- it may be within a month of the robbery; I had to paint and paper a room - that was not the last job I had before the robbery; the last was at the Crown, in the New-cut - I was employed there a few days before the robbery; I cleaned a house down for Mr. Webb - I owed him money, and received nothing for it; I had my dinner, breakfast and supper, which was set down against the little work I had done; I was a publican before I was a paper-hanger, and have had four houses - I failed as a publican in 1822; before that I was a gentleman's servant, and ceased to be so when I took the Castle tap in 1821 - I failed, to the best of my knowledge, the latter end of 1822, or it might be 1823; I had been in four different public-houses in that time - I went from school to be a servant; I was first with a cabinet-maker, and had 13l. a year - I left there to go to a gentleman's service.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you have been an honest man up to this time? A. I never had a stain in my character in my life; I knew I was going to do what was wrong, to rob a house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go against your will? A. I went down actually from want; I never intended to go into the house, but to look after the horse and gig - I would not have gone into the house, nor would I go to the servants; I went down with a view of holding the horse and gig - I knew I was doing wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give information of it till you were taken up? A. Yes, I told a person named Tucker that I had done it - I do not know whether he is here, for I did not know whether the trial would come on to-day; I mentioned that I was concerned, but never told an officer till I was taken up myself - I did not think I should be found out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not expect to be tried and convicted, when you were taken up? A. Yes, I certainly thought I should be convicted; it was not to save myself that I impeached other persons - I knew I was guilty; I had heard Wood was taken and hung, and I knew I was guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not do it to save yourself? A. No - I told voluntarily - I did not exactly expect to save myself; I thought it might go easier with me; I never had an idea that it would save me, but thought it might be lighter for me; I do not know exactly what situation I am in now - I am here to speak the truth; I do expect that perhaps giving my evidence may save me, but I should have told it if it would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not tell it before it was found out? A. I thought of course it would not be found out; if I had not been taken I do not think I should have said any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your sole motive in telling of it to save yourself? A. No, it is not; every thing I have said is as true as that; I do not give evidence to save myself - I confessed openly and voluntarily - by giving evidence I hope for mercy, but do not know that it will save me - I do not expect it will save me, because I do not know what dangerous situation I am placed in; every man has a wish to save himself - I wish to save myself if possible, but I tell the truth: I am not swearing to save myself - I am speaking the truth: I know the meaning of wedge, by hearing several characters who came to my public-house mention it- I never knew type meant a dog before; I heard it from Sales' mouth - I did not ask him what it meant; I do not know that I ever heard it before; I might, but to the best of my knowledge I never did; I did not know where I was going, but knew it was about a robbery; I went to hold the gig - I would not assist in it; it was said I was to mind the gig - I certainly knew there was to be a robbery; they did not say they would give me part of the plunder, but I was to be satisfied for going down.</p>
               <p>Q. With part of the plunder? A. I was to be satisfied - I firmly believed I was to be paid out of the money they would get for the things which were taken; I never saw Wood before - I had seen Pelser several times; I was not intimate with him, but have drank with him - he used the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180012"></xptr>Crown, in the New-cut; I had seen him there for the last five or six months - I had never seen Williams before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not agreed before you went down that you was to have a share? A. No - we never said a word about it; Wood said there were four chests of plate - no agreement at all was made for me to have a share; I did not bargain to have any thing at all - the name of the person to be robbed was not mentioned; I did not know what part of the country we were to go to - I should have stopped at the house they went to, be it whose it might; I was not a housekeeper at this time - I lived at No. 11, Hollis-street, Clare-market; I have been there about a year and nine months - I was apprehended at the Crown, New-cut, where I have done a good deal of work, and often used the house - I have known Sales three or four years or more; I frequently met him; our first acquaintance was at the young woman's he lived with - I have pawned on my own account six or seven times at the place I pawned the hat; I was in distress at the time; the coat I now have on was lent me by Drinkwater, the wardsman - he afterwards sold it me for 8s., which my brother-in-law sent me; he sent me 2l., and I bought a waistcoat - I borrowed the coat yesterday, to go to Hick's-hall, and when I came back he said I might have it for 8s.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been conversing with the officers? A. As I came from the watch-house they said, "You know there has one suffered for it;" I said I did not know it before - he has not suffered for this robbery; I never heard he had suffered - I have been living in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not conversed since you were taken up, over and over again, with the officers, as to the evidence you were to give? A. When I confessed to the officer, as we walked by Bethlehem, he said Wood had suffered; I said I thought Wood never would have told of me - that I was very sorry for it, that it was an unforeseen thing altogether, and I went, being in distress.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not to save yourself from suffering that you confessed? A. I thought it would tend to a little mercy for me - I do not fear it will go harder with me if I am not believed to-day; I fear for the situation I am in - I have told the truth; I had 19s. 6d. - I do not consider that an equal share, when the other things were left there; I had as much as either of the others had then: I would not have gone the distance for 19s. 6d. - I should not have gone to rob nearer or farther off at any other time but that night; I really should have gone with them wherever they went -I would not have gone to injure any man with any foul weapon or any thing; I did not know I was going to Mr. Bowles' - I did not rob any body; I was aware I was going to do what I ought not; I had been at work for Mr. 
               <persName id="t18300218-6-person161">Webb</persName>
             a few days before the robbery - I had finished Higginbottom's work in a day and a half, then worked for Webb - he gave me my victuals; I worked for him till two or three days before the robbery.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask for work any where else? A. When I go about I always ask for work; I think the robbery might be planning three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. Then instead of going to work you were three or four days planning this robbery? A. I went to Shire-lane - all the plan was, it was said it would be the best way to go down in the gig; I was not there two hours; I have given a direct account of it - I have never heard of any reward being offered concerning this robbery; I have seen the bills since I have been in custody - I never had one - I read a little of it; Myers, the officer, had it - I did not read it all- I saw something about burglary and about 50l.; I judged it was the robbery I had been concerned in, but did not read sufficient to know, I had not an opportunity - I knew it was about that robbery, by their saying at the house that it was the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. The hand-bill offers a reward, or a pardon to any body who will turn evidence? A. No, I never saw any thing of that kind, nor heard of it; to the best of my knowledge I saw nothing of it but "burglary, 50l." - I did not see any thing about offering a reward to any person who would give evidence so as to convict the thief, nor hear of it; I thought certainly the officers would have the 50l. if they apprehended any of the persons; I did not expect any body else would have any of it - I cannot say whether it happened on the 18th or 19th; I think it was on a Monday.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 21st of October, in consequence of information, I went down to Mr. Bowles' house, at Enfield, and examined the premises; I found the pannel of the hall door completely out - I examined the lane leading to the premises; I found a quantity of hay laying there, and an appearance as if a gig had come up there - I think the 21st was Tuesday; Pye was with me - I saw him pick up a bottle, which I have; I examined it - I cannot state what it contains - it is in the state I found it, and the liquid is in the same state; on farther search another phial was found - I produce that in the same state; they were both close to where I supposed the horse had stood - they were five or six yards from each other; I am not a judge of laudanum - I produce a paper which I saw Mr. Bowles find in a ditch; it was marked as it is now, "Nux vomica, poison;" the ditch is in a very narrow lane - on one side a hedge, and the other a paling; it was about a hundred yards from the house.</p>

               <p>JOHN WILSON. I am a constable of Enfield. I was on duty near the White Lion at Enfield, on the night of the 19th of October. On Tuesday morning, the 20th, about three o'clock, I stood against the White Lion door - three men came up and went into the house; the White Lion is on the right hand side, coming from Mr. Bowles' to London - I saw three men come up and go into Turner's, who keeps the White Lion; I went in, and saw them - I then went and met two men in a gig - the horse seemed jaded; I then went back to the White Lion to see if the three men were there, and they were gone - Turner's is a night house; the chaise was going towards London - I saw all three of the men that were in the house - the prisoner was one of them, I am positive; he was dressed in a drab coat, and a pair of corded trousers - Lee was another of them I am sure, for I took particular notice of them.</p>

Cannon and Dickers': there is nobody here from them - I went with Sales myself to get it out of pawn; I have been in trouble on family affairs - my wife put me in gaol: I have been in Horsemonger-lane gaol twice - my wife put me there once, and I went there for this robbery; I was locked up there twice before I went for this robbery - I was locked up for bail; I only stopped in one night, my bail came in the morning - that was the first time; it was three or four years ago: I was there again two or three years after, and was there seven days, for being intoxicated - Mr. Swabey was the Magistrate; I had done nothing - I was taken up intoxicated, put into the watch-house, and sent there for being drunk; I do not know whether they called me a vagrant or not - I had done nothing but got intoxicated; I was not put there for any crime.</p>

               <p>MR. BOWLES, JUN. I was not aware that these paintings were in my desk till I found them in the officer's hands; they are mine - there were memorandum books, a cash-book of my private account, and I believe some purses in the desk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say, more than that I am quite innocent of the charge - I know nothing of the robbery whatever; I have no witnesses, only my indentures to prove I served seven years to an engineer or millwright - I have been in the habit of working in the country, not in town.[Friday, Feb. 19.] <rs id="t18300218-6-verdict40" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I live in Carthusian-street, and am clerk to Mr. Bowyer, of Barbican—he is an auctioneer, and sells horses on commis<lb></lb>sion. On 6th Aug. the prisoner came into the yard, and said he wanted a horse to run a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he was dressed respectably, and had a black coat on—I told him to go into the stable—he went through the stable, and I saw he was talking to Mr. Gower in the yard, and looking at a horse—there was a brown gelding put in harness, and the prisoner drove it in a break with one of our men—while he was away Mr. Gower said something to me, and left it to me about the horse—when the prisoner came back he came up to me—I was in the counting house—I asked him what he was doing—he told me he was working three <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, and he had four horses, that he had lost 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he was at St. John's-wood, but since he had left St. John's-wood He was doing a great deal better; that he had a horse die two or three days before, and that was the reason he wanted a horse—he said, "Wifl you let one of your men go with me to my stable with the horse?"—I thought it was true, and I wrote a bill for the bone, 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was to be paid in a month—the prisoner accepted the bill, which I have here—thin is it—the man and the prisoner then went away with the horse—he gave his direc<lb></lb>tion, No. 63, Ponsonby-place, Vauxhall-road—I went there the next morn<lb></lb>ing, and found he was only a lodger there—the address was correct—he had told me his stables were there, and that was where the hone was to go—I did not see any stables there—I have seen the hone since—it was the property of Mr. Gower.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, and live at No. 56, Barbi<lb></lb>can. On 6th Aug. the prisoner came into my yard, between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon—he spoke to me, and said, "How do you do?" I said, "Very well, but I don't recollect you at the moment"—he said, "Mr. name is Marks, you know me very well"—I said, "Well, I see many per<lb></lb>sons, probably I may"—he said, "Don't you recollect me when I was at St. John's-wood, in partnership with Prior?"—I said that it might be so, but I saw so many faces, I could not say—he then said, "I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> proprietor, I have been unfortunate, and lost a horse last night, and want another to replace it"—I said, "There is one, and only one, in the stable; I have worked it myself for a week, take it and try it; go where you like with it; take my man with you; if you like it the price is twenty guineas; if you don't like it, don't have it"—he had before said he was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> proprietor, that he had three <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, and he had lost a horse the night preceding, and this was to replace the one that died—he said he was the owner of three or four horses—the horse was put in harness at his request—it was in harness half an hour—I afterwards directed my clerk, if he felt satisfied, and thought it right, to deal with him—that was in consequence of what the prisoner had said—I gave my clerk authority to take the bill which the prisoner said he would give—when the prisoner said he should want credit, I said, "I know nothing about it, go to my clerk,"I was dining at the time—I don't recol<lb></lb>lect the prisoner before—I can't say that I had not known him—I had known the person whose name he mentioned as carrying on business with at St. Jobn's-wood.</p>

I took a horse from Mr. Gower's to Westminster, the prisoner was with me—he took me first to a corn dealer's in Strutton-ground, West<lb></lb>minster—he said it was his own shop, and Mrs. Marks attended there two or three hours in the course of the day—he went in and got the key out of the shop, and showed me round the corner to a stable—he unlocked the stable door and put the horse in—he locked the door again—he showed me three door ways—he said his <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> stood there—he gave me a shilling to go to the public house—he came back and took the key to the corn dealer, and came across to the public house to me, and gave me half a crown—I saw Mr. Jones—he was standing against a pony and cart which was standing there—the prisoner told me that he (Mr. Jones) was his managing man, and that the pony was his, and he had bought a gig for it, and he was to pay ready money for it when he fetched it away—I stopped up the street, and saw the prisoner stop talking to Mr. Jones—I then saw a man, and asked him some questions—I stopped about half an hour—I went back to the stable and the horse was gone—when the prisoner parted from me at the public house he shook hands with me, and told me he should most likely see me the next day—I afterwards saw him riding the horse, coming out of another yard further up—I did not say anything to him—I whistled, and he turned his head to me and held his hand up and galloped away.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The letter of</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th December was read as follows:</hi>—"Sailors' Home, London, Dec. 27, 1878. To the Assistant Secretary, Board of Trade, Marine Department, Whitehall Gardens. Sir,—No one but the Lord Chief Justice of England and a jury of my fellow-countrymen can decide the point in dispute between the Board of Trade and me, since the Board of Trade declines to discuss the matter with me any further There there<lb></lb>fore becomes a cruel necessity forced upon me to adopt some unprecedented means of forcing on a trial in the Criminal Court, which I can only do by placing myself in the undesirable position of a prisoner committed for trial But independent of this object, the misconduct of your colleagues in their treatment to me justifies me in denouncing them all as a gang of dishonest, unprincipled, and cowardly robbers, tyrants, and oppressors, and as I must hold somebody responsible for their misconduct, I hold you respon<lb></lb>sible for the department of which you are assistant secretary, and demand from you the instant restoration—restitution is the proper word—to me of the second renewal of my master's certificate of competency, bought and paid for by me, sir, as well as earned, eleven years ago, by 17 years' hard service under the British flag. If you are able to comply with this impera<lb></lb>tive demand, and I know whether you are or not, this letter ends here, and my case begins and ends with your compliance with my just demand. If not, then, sir, singling you out from the gang of daylight robbers who take a mean advantage of their power to ruin and destroy me upon a plea which itself is a gross, infamous, monstrous, and most cowardly libel upon my character and reputation, that everything in connection with my history during the last ten years tends to disprove. <hi rend="italic">I threaten—mark the word, sir</hi>—I threaten you with a sudden and violent death as you emerge from the head office of the Board of Trade to-day to return to your private residence, and take care I am not armed and fully prepared to carry out my threat. I am a true-born Englishman, sir, and I must either have redress for my wrongs, or I must be completely annihilated. In this crisis, sir, I quote the motto which appears beneath the Royal arms above the doorway that they adorn, and closing my letter with the shout of 'God and my right,' I have the honour to remain, your obedient servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">WM.

               <p>had known him previously—he was under my care from 26th February, 1876, until 1st May of the same year in Colney Hatch Asylum—when I saw him on the 9th January last I was with him about two hours and a half—I had conversation with him during the whole of that time—I formed an opinion as to the state of his mind—I believe he was of unsound mind—he had various delusions, first of all as to his own connections, which were great; secondly, as to his own aspirations, which were great likewise—he wrote love letters to one of the Royal Princesses—he passed from under my charge at Colney Hatch in this way: he constructed with great ingenuity a skeleton key, with which he liberated himself early in the morning of the 1st May, and escaped from the asylum, and when he got to a port by the seaside he sent me back the key which he had constructed, with a polite note.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I believe he knows perfectly well what he is about now—his whole mode of proceeding is very insane—I think that when he wrote this letter he knew that he was making use of the threat which is contained in it; that he knew the character and meaning of the language he was using, and that he knew the threat he made use of was an illegal thing—he was quite capable of understanding that—he is highly intelligent John Rowland Gibson. I am the surgeon of Newgate—the prisoner was under my charge in the prison in 1869—my opinion then was that he was of unsound mind—he was then charged with sending threatening letters—I saw him again the other day when Dr. Sheppard saw him, and I quite agree with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I agree with him in the answer he gave, that although the prisoner's mind may have been affected, he knew the value and meaning of the language he was using—I think he perfectly understood; whether he intended carrying it out is another matter, but I think he perfectly under<lb></lb>stood that the threat to murder was an illegal and a wrong act; of course I speak from the experience I have had of him since he has been with us, I do not know the state of mind he was in at the time—I saw him on the 2nd of the present month; the letter was written on 27th December—I do not recollect what the state of his mind was in 1869; I merely know the fact that he was here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> You were here a month ago; the Lord Mayor sent a request that I should report on the state of your mind—I did not examine you; I had a conversation with you, but you protested against my examining you, and therefore, not being able to go fully into the matter, I excused myself from making a report to the Lord Mayor without having a full opportunity of judging—there was no one to prosecute, and the case there ended—I had a general conversation with you, but no examination—you protested on the score of submitting your statements, opinions, and principles to the arbitration of any medical man; you told me that you looked upon doctors as your natural enemies, and you therefore objected to express any statement, opinion, or feeling to a medical man—you said that you preferred to submit your thoughts, feelings, and statements to a jury rather than to two doctors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Before I commence my defence I feel constrained at this crisis to utter the ejaculatory prayer to the Great Judge of all judges,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187901130014"></xptr>
               <p>and to say in the hearing of this Court, and in the hearing of all England, "God defend the right, and confound the wrong, for His great mercy's sake, through Jesus Christ our Lord." Gentlemen of the Jury, the question that has to be decided by your verdict is not a mere question of life or death, or imprisonment or liberty, to me. I care nothing for death. Death has been my playmate since I was a little boy twelve years of age, and I have gone through a thousand fiery ordeals to gain the object which I have gained to-day. Therefore I bespeak the patience of the entire Court to hear me to the end. Nevertheless I feel constrained to adopt the bold and fearless language of that bold and fearless' outlaw who, after having achieved a thousand daring feats, and being brought at last into the presence of a con<lb></lb>queror so mighty that he wept because there was nothing left to conquer, cried out to his judge, "Alexander, I am your captive. I must hear what you please to say and endure what you please to inflict; but my soul remains unconquered." I sincerely trust that the noble and learned Judge presiding over this case will respond to my appeal, and answer me in the language of the mighty Alexander, telling me to speak freely, for that it is not for him to silence me. With regard to the question of counsel, I received a letter from the Almagamated Society of British Seamen, offering assistance in my defence. I replied, thanking them, but declining it, in my belief that the spirit of truth and justice will impregnate the Court as I stand a prisoner at the bar of England. In commencing my defence I feel impelled to remind you of the beautiful prayer contained in the Litany of the Established Church, which so beautifully links my case, that of the desolate and oppressed, with the case of the widow and fatherless, that every Sunday morning hundreds and hundreds of consecrated lips give utterance to, and that is responded to by the no less beautiful expression, "We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord." I propose to confine my defence to the establishment of the truth of the statements which I made to Sir James Ingham on the 2nd inst., and by the ability with which, in your opinion, I prove the truth of those statements, I propose to vindicate the sanity of my mind. (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner then proceeded to contend that there was no proof that he had delivered the letter, and that if he had, the threat, if any, only referred to the day men<lb></lb>tioned in the letter.</hi>) He then added: I have no ill-feeling towards Mr. Gray, but I think I was justified in resorting to some ruse, in order to bring the case I have against the Board of Trade before the public eye of Britain. By writing the letters I was merely pretending to ape the madness which has been shouldered upon me on and off for ten years, entailing medical examination after medical examination, most annoying to me. I entreat you, my lord and gentlemen of the jury—I ask you indulgently to consider the tre<lb></lb>mendous odds that I have to contend against. I am only a poor mariner of England, doubly and trebly branded with the stigma of insanity, dragged into a reluctant contention with a gentleman who in his own person represents a whole Department of the Imperial Government, and if I have resorted to a harmless stratagem, in writing these letters, to draw the Board of Trade out of their great stronghold, it is not because I would enter into open rebellion against their authority, but that I might again honourably place myself beneath their jurisdiction. I would not hurt the wing of a fly or dislodge a hair upon a baby's head; and all the thunderbolts which the Board of Trade can launch will never drive me out of my beloved country. Gentle<lb></lb>men, your verdict to-day will either be a last culminating wrong or the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187901130015"></xptr>
               <p>healing balm for all my previous wounds. I will say no more. I will leave the matter to God, to the Jury, and to his Lordship.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 19, Anchor-street, Bethnal-green, and am a silk-manufacturer. I have known the prisoner about twelve months—he called on me in July last—I cannot recollect the day of the month—he came and said to me, "You are a manufacturer, are not you, Adams?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "And you sell on commission, don't you?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I have a piece of black satin, will you take it out, and sell it on commission for me?"—I said, "It is no use taking any goods out, I cannot sell my own; I am obliged to pledge them"—he then said "I shall be very much obliged if you will take and pledge a piece for me"—I said, "I do not like to do such a thing, but if it is your own, I don't mind doing it, where I pledge my own"—I then went with him to his house, in Thomas-street, and he showed me a piece of black satin, on the foot of a bed, wrapped in dressers' paper—the weaver puts silk in thin picking-paper, when his work is finished—it is sent to his employer, and afterwards to the dresser, who puts it into thick paper like parchment—the paper was very much torn—he said he had got some money to make up, to send into the country, and should be much obliged if I would pledge it for him—he carried it down stairs, and walked with me as far as Cottens's, in</p>

I am in partnership with Alexander Duff, and live in Spital-square, in the liberty of Norton-Folgate—we are silk-manufacturers, and have an establishment at Sudbury, Suffolk, as well as in town. I have known the prisoner many years—he was in the habit of weaving silk for us, off and on, during that time, both in the country and London—in July last he was living in London, and came frequently to our warehouse—we were not in need of pawning or selling on commission—the prisoner was a weaver employed by us—last July he worked at his own house, in Thomas-street—he used to have the material in a dyed state, unmanufactured, to weave at home—it was then his duty to bring it home to our warehouse, but he never had the piece in question to manufacture at all—we should send it to the dresser after the waver returned it to us, and the weaver would not have anything more to do with it—the pieces he made never wanted dressing at all—one was velvet and the other serge—I have my book here, which shows that the prisoner was at our warehouse in London on the 7th, 8th, 13th, 15th, and 29th of July—I saw a piece of black satin on the 8th of March at Mr. Cotten's, in Shoreditch, and know it to be our property, by my private mark on it, and the number—it measured eighty-one yards—I am positive it has never been sold—I had missed this very piece, but my stock being very large, I thought it might have been put away with others—I have gone through my book and stock to ascertain this had never been sold—the entries in the book are my son Alexander's—Kendall saw the same piece of satin—he is a dresser—I employ his master—this piece of satin is worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was in picking paper at the pawnbroker's—that is a thin paper, used by weavers, not by dressers—it was to cartridge paper, which is called dresser's paper, at our warehouse.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Refreshing your memory by your notes, state what Adams said in the prisoner's hearing on the 10th of March? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Adams stated, "Bass came to me and asked me if I would take some pieces of satin to sell for him by com<lb></lb>mission with his own goods;" that Adams told Bass he could not do it, as he was himself obliged to pawn his own property to raise money occasionally, and he wanted at that time to raise money—that he was in the habit, or about to take certain goods to Cottens's to pledge for himself; that Bass then said to him, "Will you take some for me with your own?"—Adams afterwards went to Bass's house, and was shown by Bass some satin wrapped in dressers paper, which he took off and placed in picking-paper, telling him he would be glad if he would take that with his own goods to Mr. Cottens and pledge for him, as he wanted a little money to send into the country; that he took altogether two pieces, one of about eighty-nine yards and the other about seventy-nine yards—not at the same time—he took one piece to Cottens-that he took one piece of satin, and there was sufficient interval between the first and second taking to allow Bass to make a piece similar to that pro<lb></lb>duced—Adams was asked to sign his examination, which he did, and said further that Bass had the tickets for both pieces of satin, as well as the money—Bass, I recollect, was about to make a statement—he was checked by his solicitor; but he did say, "I did give two pieces of satin to my fellow-prisoner to pawn for me, as he says,"and added, "they were given to me by Mr. Charles Peacock"—there was a professional gentleman attended for Adams when he made his statement—after that Adams was put into the witness-box, and after that he said Bass had the tickets and money—the same professional gentleman then acted for Bass—the statement was made by Adams while he was a prisoner at the bar—Bass was remanded till the 17th.</p>

I live at 28, Draper's Place, St. Pancras, and am a laundress—on 20th March, I was in the Kentish Arms, from 11 till 12 o'clock at night, with Elizabeth Tomlinson, and my cousin, who was rather the worse for liquor—I was not, and Tomlinson did not appear to be—the prisoner came in about half an hour after we were there—he threw some whisky and water over my cousin—nothing had happened before that—he was pushed by some of his companions who were with him—I asked him what he did it for and he told me he would do me the same—he went to the bar and got a glass and threw it over my cousin—I asked him again what he did it for, and he said he would serve me the b----same—I told him he should not, he dared not do it, and he said he would show me if he dare not, and he hit me then with his fist—he threw a glass over me before he hit me—I picked up a pint pot and told him I would hit him if he hit me again—the hit me again and I caught him by the scarf—I held him and the barman came to put us out—several of his companions were trying to get me away from him—he told me to leave go of his scarf, and I said I should not—he had no sooner said "Leave go," than I was laid down at his feet bleeding—I know no more till I got up—I saw his hand coming towards me and the wound was on my right breast—I did not see his hand strike me on the breast—I put my hand up to protect my face as I thought from the blow, and he cut both fingers with the knife.</p>

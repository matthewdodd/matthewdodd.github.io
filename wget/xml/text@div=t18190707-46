            . I am clerk to Messrs. Hinton and Co., proprietors of the Isle of Dorcas Colour Works. On the 2d of June, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I was in <placeName id="t18190707-46-crimeloc244">Holborn</placeName>

At that instant a man on horseback, riding at a very brisk trot, rode against him, and knocked him down on the pavement. I exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"The rascal has rode over the man! Stop him!" He rode on thirty or forty yards further, when his horse's head was turned by some persons, who stood in the road before him. He was going towards the west. I ran after him, and came up to him when he was stopped, seized his horse by the saddle, and said,</p>
               <p>"You brutal rascal, how dare you to run over a man." He answered,</p>
               <p>"it was his own fault, why did he not get out of the way?" The indignation of the crowd was very much excited. I insisted on knowing who he was, and his giving me his name and address, which he at first refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man on horseback - A. The prisoner. As he appeared a respectable man, I asked him for his card; he said he kept no card - he appeared perfectly indifferent. After some altercation with the persons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181907070015"></xptr>around him, he said he was known to Mr. Francis, the linen-draper; Mr. Francis was called from his shop, which was just by. I believe the prisoner gave him his name and address, as Mr. Francis said so. He said something to Mr. Francis, which I did not hear, and Mr. Francis requested me to give my name and address, which I did in one of his books.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the street at the time the old man was crossing - A. It was perfectly clear; an ordinary caution would have prevented the accident.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The old gentleman staggered in a state of alarm, before any thing was near him - A. Yes. I saw neither coach, dray, or any thing else in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock was it - A. About twenty minutes before six. I am sure it was not an hour earlier.</p>

            . I am assistant to Messrs. Corbyn and Co. An elderly man was brought into the shop - I should think it was a little before five o'clock; we drink tea at a quarter before five, and had not been to tea - five or six persons brought him in - the prisoner came in in about ten minutes after. The man was perfectly insensible and the circulation was very languid. The prisoner said if the man was struck down by him, he was very sorry. In a short time the man came to himself partially, and complained of a pain in his head, and once he said he had a pain at his back - he could not tell what had happened to him. He sent for his wife, and was taken home in a coach; we had given him some medicine - he drank about a tea-spoonfull. There was a slight tumour on the left side of the head, but from its appearance I doubted whether it was an original tumour or not; I thought it was an old tumour and the stones had struck it - there was only a slight scratch on it. I believe he lived in one of the streets leading from Bedford-row. I found a letter in his pocket, directed to

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Bedford-row. On Wednesday evening, the 2d of June, I was sent for to Mr. Coe - I do not know his christian name, but I think it is James; he lived in Robert-street, Little James-street, Bedford-row. I found him on his back in bed, continually sick, and unable to say what had happened to him - he said he had now got his death-blow. I asked him how he got the blow? his wife said by being knocked down in the street; and he said, Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would a blow on the head produce this sickness - A. Yes. There was a slight tumour on the left side of his head. The blow that he received must have been on that tumour - the blow must have occasioned the tumour. I was sent for to him, about seven o'clock in the evening, and at one o'clock in the morning; he was then convulsed, and I bled him. He died that morning at ten o'clock. The blow he received on his head, in my judgment, was the cause of his death,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you open the skull to examine his head - A. No. If I had not heard of the blow, I should not say it was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this I believe he had been almost suffocated with drink - A. Yes, three or four months before.</p>

            . I am chief clerk to Mr. Justice Best. I am a stranger to what passed in Holborn, but I saw the old man lying on his back apparently dead. I saw him carried into Messrs. Corbyn's shop; he appeared to me to be certainly in a fit - his mouth was closed, and his lips perfectly close; he appeared rather convulsed in the face. He laid directly across the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear as if he had been knocked down by a horse - A. Certainly not, his head was towards the north, and his feet right across.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Did you see the prisoner. - A. He was brought back on horseback.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM FRANCIS. I am a linendraper, and live in Holborn, between Hand-court, and Featherstone-buildings, on the south side of the street. On the 2d of June, about twenty minutes after four o'clock, I heard a noise, ran to the door, and saw the deceased lying on his back, with his head in a direction to the north; he laid right across Holborn, in an oblique direction, about ten yards from my door. I am certain it was not later than twenty minutes after four; my clock stood in the shop opposite the door, and I looked at it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was anybody with the man - A. No, several persons ran across, and carried him into Corbyn's. I saw the prisoner on a pony trotting past my door, at a tolerable sharp pace - persons were calling out Stop thief; Paul was among the persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. I knew there was such a person; he is a baker - I knew his family, but was not acquainted with him. He stopped of his own accord at the end of Featherstone-buildings - Paul then seized the bridle. I returned to my shop immediately, supposing they were going to take him there, but I heard a person say,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Francis knows me." I went out, and the prisoner told me his name - Paul had got hold of the horse. There was a great altercation; Paul was exceedingly violent, and swore that he was a d - d rascal for riding over the man. I heard several persons say, the gentleman was not in fault. The prisoner said he did not know that he had knocked a person down, but he was willing to compensate if he had done any damage or injury. As soon as the crowd would permit him he went to Messrs. Corbyn's to see the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time ask Paul for his address - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true that you asked him for his address, and he wrote it in one of your books - A. It is totally untrue - it was given in my absence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. Q. You was acquainted with the prisoner - A. Not personally. He was just turning his horse as Paul seized the bridle.</p>

He begged that every attention might be paid him, and he would be answerable for the expence.

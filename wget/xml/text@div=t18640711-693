                  </hi>. I am a medical student, of 66, Frith-street, Soho—on 15th June, about 4 in the morning, I returned home, opened the door with a latch-key, passed through the house into the yard, and then heard a noise, and saw the prisoner and another man in the passage, with several things in their hands, hats and table-cloths, which they threw down, rushed out, and shut the door in my face—I went to the door and saw one go in one direction and one in another—the prisoner was the nearest—I followed him into Greek-street, and a policeman and I caught him at the same time—I found on him a hat and coat of Mr. Boddy's, a resident in the same house—I did not lose sight of the prisoner—it was perfectly light.</p>

I was on duty in Frith-street at 4 o'clock on 13th June, and saw the prisoner run across Frith-street into Soho-square, and the prosecutor behind him, who tapped him on the shoulder—I went to the house and found three hats in the passage on the floor, and two table<lb></lb>covers by the side of them, ready to be taken away—the prisoner had on a hat and coat, and a pair of kid gloves, which are identified.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 66, Frith-street, in the parish of St. Ann—on 12th June, about 12 at night, I saw that the door was fastened by a latch—there is another entrance at the back from a stable, a private mews, which is secured by a padlock inside—I cannot say whether the door of the house was fastened when I went to bed, but there was no access—persons are obliged to come through the stable to get to the back door—I am not in the habit of going to see whether the back door is open—these are my gloves (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

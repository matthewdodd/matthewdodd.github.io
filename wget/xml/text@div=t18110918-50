The prosecutor came up, and charged him with taking a five shilling paper of halfpence out of his pocket; I searched him, I did not find any halfpence about him.</p>

He came to the Compter and threatened to transport me, and offered to take four shillings; I at first told him I would not; he knows he took the four shillings.</p>

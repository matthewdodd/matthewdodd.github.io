When I came down, at six o'clock in the morning, I was informed that a man had come out of the next house (which was empty) - I went to the door, and found it open. I went down to the bottom of the house, and found two rolls of lead in the chimney-corner, which I knew to be mine. I went to the house-top, and found a hole had been made through the tiling, and that the lead had been cut away from my house. I came back and took the lead, and had some more fixed in the place. The same evening, about eight o'clock, I went to the back of my premises, and found a man standing at the cellar-door of the empty house - I asked him what he wanted there; he said, he was waiting for a man. I told him I supposed he belonged to the party that was there in the morning. I found the door was open again, and went in; - I got a light, and went into the house, and found some men had been up to the tiling again. I ran up and took the two prisoners there - I asked them what they wanted; they said, they were looking for a lodging - I gave them into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. They were hid behind a chimney. I compared the lead, and it exactly fitted the place.</p>

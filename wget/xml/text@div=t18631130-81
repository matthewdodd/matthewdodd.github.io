                  </hi>. I work for the Midland Railway, and live at Tower-hill—I am about thirteen years old—on 22d November I was with two other boys at the Tower-stairs, sitting in a boat—the prisoner come down, came into the boat, and said to me, "I will chuck you overboard"—the other two boys, who were playing with a skull at the back of the boat, escaped, and left the skull there—I went to catch it, and the prisoner came behind me and threw me head first into the water—the water is ten feet deep there, and four feet of mud—I had my best clothes on—I went down, and when I came up again the prisoner happened to catch hold of my collar, after Mr. Metcalfe hallooed for the Thames police, and Mr. Metcalfe came to my assistance, and carried me to the shore.</p>

I am a waterman—I saw the three boys playing in the boat—when they heard that the prisoner was coming, two of them escaped, leaving the oar slipping out of the rullock—Kirby went to save it, but it went overboard—as the prisoner came down I heard him say, "I will throw you overboard"—he went into the boat, and Kirby begun to cry, and got from one thwart to another to escape, and the prisoner gave him a violent shove on the back, and sent him head first into the water—he went down, and as he came up the prisoner caught hold of him—I ran to his assistance and dragged him ashore.</p>

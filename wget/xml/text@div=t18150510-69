I lost my gown and shoes at my master's, where I lived servant, at the Black Swan, the corner of School-house-lane, Ratcliffe Cross. The prisoner, and another woman, a neighbour, came in, the last Sunday was a week, and asked for a lodging; master said, he had no lodgings. I thought she was distressed; I said to my master, I would give her part of my bed for one night. When I went up to bed, she pretended as if she was asleep, and in the morning she took my gown and my pair of shoes from the bed side; I missed them when I went up to clean myself; she was gone then. I went over to the woman that came over with her, and the woman said, she had not seen her since the morning, she did not stop there five minutes. When I found her, she had my shoes on, and I found my gown at the pawnbroker's.</p>

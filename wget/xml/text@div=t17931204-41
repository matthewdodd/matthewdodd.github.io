               <p>Last Monday week I lost the things. In consequence of a person that gather rents of some houses that belong to me, coming to my house with a woman, I understood that the man had taken some materials out of my yard. The prisoner is a tenant, rents the house of me; I sent my foreman down with this woman to the place, for that he knew my property better than I did.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a foreman in the carpentry line to Mr. James. I found this property on the prisoner's premises, on Monday the 25th of November, about twelve o'clock. I found the batten, quartering, and the scantling, in the day time; they were found in Dale-street, Mile-End New Town, in a shed that he was building.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him work at it? - By the information that the woman gave, I saw these things in a shed; the cupboard we found on him in the street, at six o'clock at night, the same evening, in Dale-street. The same evening,(Monday night) when he was taken before a magistrate he confessed every thing that he had done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that confession taken in writing? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about this cupboard in the street? - He said he was going to take it away, when we asked him what he was going to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of all these things? - I suppose fourteen or fifteen shilings; we never brought a quarter of the property away, that was on his premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where this property came from? - It must come out of Mr. James's yard; here is a piece now in court, which we cut down with a saw, a bit of scantling the boy cut down; I saw him cut it; and marked it for him myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040100"></xptr>Q. What was the mark made with? - With chalk.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that chalk on it now? - It could not be, because it was cut down with a saw.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the same scantling? - Because I will swear to the piece by the size; and there is a mark in the end of two nail holes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this scantling kept? - In a shed, in Mr. James's yard, <placeName id="t17931204-41-crimeloc230">Newinn yard, Shoreditch</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17931204-41-crimeloc230" type="placeName" value="Newinn yard, Shoreditch"></interp>

               <p>How far was this from where you found it? - Near a mile, if not more. There is a piece of batten, that we had several hundred feet of it; there is no particular mark on it, I can swear to the batten being Mr. James's property, because we have pieces in the yard of the same sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose there is no batten about London of the same sort as your's? - No, I do not suppose there is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the singularity of it? - It is three inches thick and six inches wide.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to it by that? is there any thing else that you know? - I can swear to the quartering, it is three inches by four.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that any thing remarkable? It is Scotch fir.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a good deal of Scotch fir about town? - Not much. There is no particular mark on it. The cupboard I took down myself out of an old house, it is painted on one side.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see it last, before you saw it in the possession of the prisoner? - The last time I saw it, was in Mr. James's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to that from the appearance of it? What was the colour of it? - It was white when it was painted, I suppose; it is only painted on one side, it is rough on the other.</p>

               <p>I am Mr. James's porter. I was coming up New-inn yard with Mr. Halson and I met the prisoner with the cupboard in his hand, and I said you have got my master's cupboard; yes, says he, I have; says he, let us go and have a pot of beer together; I immediately called Mr. Halson we went to Mr. Saunders's house, the prisoner, I, and Mr. Halson together, he went with us, from there we went to the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. Now independent of what past at at the justice's do you know any thing of the batten quartering or scantling? - No, I cannot swear it is my master's property.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Had you ever seen this cupboard on Mr. James's premises? - Yes. I have, it has been a white paint turned rather yellow.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. I understood from you that your people knew more of this property? - I can swear to the batten.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see it in Dale-street? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to the cupboard can you swear that? - As for my own part I am seldom or ever in the yard, I believe it to be my property, it was taken down out of a public house.</p>
               <p>Tooling. I bring the cupboard here, I carried it to Mr. James's warehouse and brought it out of Mr. James's warehouse to bring it here; I believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>court to James. Supposing you had seen it at another part of the town should you have known it to be your's? - I cannot say I should.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say but what it is my own, there is nothing brought here but what is my own, it is my property, I bought it in Ratcliff-highway of a man who brought it about in a cart.</p>

The Prisoner pleaded in his Defence, that he did not take the said Goods with a Felonious Intent, to wrong his Master of them, but being in Debt was very much pressed by his Creditors, and the Expectation he had from his Friends depending upon his being in Business, and having Money to come up from some of them, which was delayed some Month; longer than he expected, did make bold to pawn his Master's Goods, with Intent when he received his Money to have redeemed them again, and have carried them again to his Master's Shop. He did indeed call several Persons he had formerly served, who gave him a very good Character; and some that did confirm what he said of Money that he was to receive out of the Country, which was delayed, and did at last come, but just before his Apprehension; so that his Allegations did appear probable.

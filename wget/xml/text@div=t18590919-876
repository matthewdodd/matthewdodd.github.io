The July rate, 1857, would be audited in May, 1858—the auditor attends on 3d May—I was present—the prisoner did not attend that audit—he was very ill at the time I believe—he sent his books—I did not see by the books what money had been paid in on</p>

               <p>account of the January rate—this is one of the books that was before the auditor, it is the prisoner's private pass-book—in consequence of what I saw in this book, I thought it right to make an examination of the January rate-book—we afterwards ascertained the amount that had been received on account of the January rate, and in consequence of the small amount that had been paid in to the January rate, we determined to take away the books from the prisoner and inspect them—we did so—after we had ascertained the amount of the deficiency I saw the prisoner—it was on 8th May, at his house, in company with Mr. Marsden, the vestry clerk—I asked him to explain the deficiencies which appeared in his books—I don't think we stated to him what the deficiency was.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I have your statement made on another charge—was not this what took place?" I saw the prisoner on 8th May—I spoke to him about the deficiency, and asked him how he was prepared to make up that deficiency to the parish?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was something to that effect—he said he had got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in book debts, which he would make over, and the lease of a house in the Kent-road; and he made over those book debts—that was after I had asked him to explain the deficiency—no amount was mentioned—I think he spoke about the book debts and the lease, before he entered into the explanation as to the way in which the deficiency occurred—I never requested him to make out an account of the deficiency—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Metcalfe submitted that the arrangement entered into with the prisoner by the witness was equivalent to a promise not to prosecute, and that anything said by the prisoner upon that was not admissible. The Recorder could not see anything at present to cause the exclusion of the evidence.</hi>)</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Go on and state what took place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner said he had the misfortune to have his cash-box, containing 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., stolen from his office in Glengall-grove, where he then lived—he said it was parish and government money, and was partly in notes and partly in gold, pretty well all gold; he thought it was in the year 1854—he said he did not mention it to any one, without it was his wife, of course, I suppose he meant; but they suspected a servant who had left them, and had got mar<lb></lb>ried, and he spoke to an inspector of police to make inquiries about the character of the husband, and found he was a steady person; that he was afraid to make it public, for fear he should lose his situation, and he hoped to surmount his difficulties—he also said that he had lent money to a Mr. Mawby, to the amount of 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that he gave him 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and Mr. Mawby assigned over the lease of a house and stables, at the back of the Swan public-house, in the old Kent-road—he said it was the parish money; he said he never had any money of his own—he also said that he had lent money to his friends and others, which had all turned out bad debts—he also stated that about three years previous he was deficient with the Govern<lb></lb>ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185909190079"></xptr>
               <p>to the amount of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he borrowed 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of a Mr. Enoch Clark, for the purpose of making good that deficiency—I think it was at this interview that he agreed to transfer his book debts—he carried on business as a tailor—I believe his book debts were transferred, but I cannot say—they amounted to above 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I believe—the amount that has actually been received upon them is 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I only know that from Mr. Mars<lb></lb>den—I do not think the amount of the deficiency was mentioned at that interview, either by me or by the prisoner—at that time there were no sums entered in the January rate-book,' as having been received by the prisoner—this is a receipt and deposit book, in which he should enter all monies he received, and also what he pays into the bankers—we found that he had not entered a single shilling—he was not requested to make up that book; we did it ourselves, I and my brother overseer, Mr. Coombe—these are his figures in the January rate-book; this represents that he has received 1,753<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the January rate—that was made up subsequently (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Metcalfe objected to this evidence, as it related to what took place after the arrangement had been made, and a formal deed entered into upon the subject. An indenture of agreement was handed in by Mr. Marsden, which the Recorder, upon perusing, was of opinion had the effect of rendering what took place subse<lb></lb>quently, inadmissible</hi>)—I had an interview with the prisoner on 8th May—he wrote this letter on 10th May (<hi rend="italic">This was a letter to the Churchwardens and Overseers, stating that he was too ill to attend to his business, and appoint<lb></lb>ing his brother and brother-in-law to go through the rate-books and vouchers, to ascertain the amount he owed to the parish</hi>)—In consequence of that, the accounts were investigated by those two persons and the parish officers—there is no date to the entries made in this book; I am not able to say when they were made; it must have been some little time after 8th May—they were six or seven days going into the account; it must have been done after the agreement was entered into.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Geddes. I saw the plate on the pantry table, about eleven o'clock on the 22d of December, the day the prisoner left the house; I missed him about two o'clock - it was his duty to lay the cloth for dinner at two o'clock; he did not return to the house; I did not see him again till he was at the office: the plate was on the table in the pantry at eleven o'clock - the prisoner was not in the pantry at that time; I never saw the plate after that - I saw him about one o'clock, standing by the kitchen fire, asking the cook what time the lunch would be ready; I then went up stairs, and did not see him go out - I, the cook, and the prisoner were the only servants; I came down stairs again near two o'clock, and then the prisoner was gone.</p>

            . I am cook to Mr. Geddes. I remember the 22d of December, when the prisoner left the house - I saw the plate safe in the pantry, about half-past eleven o'clock that day; the prisoner came to me at one o'clock, and asked what there was for lunch - he went into his pantry, and about half-past one he came into the kitchen, and asked me if I wanted any water; I said No: I never saw him after that, till he was at Bow-street; at two o'clock the housemaid came down stairs, and she missed the plate. After I told the prisoner I did not want any water, I heard the street door shut - I did not see him go out, but after that I never saw him; no living creature came within the doors from that time till the plate was missing; the pantry windows were both fastened, and quite secure, and I found them secure when the plate was missed; every thing portable was taken, but the plate that was large was left behind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which is the way to get out of the house from the pantry? A. He had to come along a passage, and up stairs; there is a lower door: a person must pass the kitchen door to go out at either door; I was in the kitchen all the time - I know he went for water when I heard the street door shut, for he took the pitcher with him; I had told him I did not want any water - I did not see him with the pitcher, but it was gone; he used to fetch water every day, for drink for the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after he asked if you wanted water, did you hear the door shut? A. Directly - he went up stairs directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there any screws or fastenings to the pantry window? A. There are both, and they were fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not one window always open in the pantry, to see when anybody came to the front door? A. Occasionally we opened it to look out, but it was never kept open.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you went into the pantry, after missing the plate, was the window open? A. Both the windows were fastened quite safe; the pantry window looks into the area; there are no steps to the area - it is a high area; there is neither door nor steps to it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are there not two ways out of the house? A. There is an area, but no door to it; the windows look into the area - they are not so high as the street: there is no way out of the house except at the street door; the prisoner took all his clothes with him, except an old shirt, some old stockings, and two or three collars; all he had was a suit of old clothes, and his livery, which he had on, and that he took with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take the clothes? A. No - I did not see you go out.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Would your having the key prevent anybody being let out? A. No.</p>
               <p>MRS. GEDDES. Mrs. Broadfoot came to see me that day; I let nobody in or out myself - when she went away I rang the bell for the prisoner to open the door; I walked down from the drawing-room, expecting the prisoner to open the door, but Hughes opened it - it was near two o'clock; there are two centinals placed nearly opposite our house, who must see anybody go in or out.</p>

On the Monday before Christmas-day I saw the prisoner, between one and two o'clock, with the water-pitcher in his hand; he put it at the right-hand entrance at the gate - I told him he had set the pitcher in an awkward situation: he made me no answer, but made all the haste he could into the Park, going in a direction from Stafford-row; he walked fast, and left the pitcher behind him - I took it from the gateway, and put it under the paling of the gateway, for security; it was afterwards taken to Mr. Geddes' - the place he used to get the water from, is down the stable yard, by the gate; he left it not many yards from the pump - the prosecutor's house is only five or six doors from the gate; I did not observe that he had any thing else.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I apprehended the prisoner at Southwell, Nottinghamshire, on the 2d of February; I asked him what made him leave Mr. Geddes' situation - he made no reply; I asked him who gave him a character to get Mr. Geddes' situation - he replied that he got acquainted with some person in London, who persuaded him to get a written character, which he sent to his mother at Haverill, near Chesterfield (I neither threatened nor promised him), and his mother sent to Mr. Geddes; I asked what he had done with the clothes he took away from Mr. Geddes' house - he replied that he had sold them; he said he thought he should be hanged if he were taken up for this robbery (there is a charge of horse stealing against him) - he afterwards said, as he came along on the coach, that he should be twisted; a horse was found in his possession, which he acknowledged he had stolen, that he might not be tried for this robbery, for if he were tried for this robbery he should certainly be hanged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At the time you took him at Southwell, did you find a horse in his possession? A. No - he had been detained there through a letter which I had sent down there: I brought him to town afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I tell you I had a written character from my mother? A. Yes, you did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I tell you I had stolen a horse, to save me from coming to be tried in London? A. He told me he acknowledged to stealing a horse, that he should not be tried for Mr. Geddes' robbery, for if he were he should certainly be hung - he did not say he had stolen it, but that he had acknowledged to stealing it; I told him what I took him for.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he mean by his saying he thought he should be hung if he were taken for this robbery? A. He had been detained at Southwell, and a horse found in his possession; I found him in prison, and brought him to town - I am quite sure I did not make him any threat or promise; I told him not to say any thing to criminate himself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - on the 22d of December I received a letter from Nottingham, stating my wife was dangerously ill, and I must come down immediately, if I wished to see her; Mrs. Geddes had charged me with being intoxicated the day before, and told me I might look out for another situation as soon as I had cleaned myself - I cleaned myself, and left the house about a quarter-past one o'clock; I took out the pitcher for water, and put it down at the corner of the yard where I usually fetched water from; I went to a friend, and told him I was going down to my wife, and I intended to go back to Mr. Geddes', but my friend advised me to go down to Nottingham immediately, which I did.</p>
               <p>MRS. GEDDES. I did not discharge him; I told him I did not discharge him, but I thought it likely Mr. Geddes would, as, with a drunken servant, we were so very much afraid of fire, and I said, "If you behave well in our house I will do the best I can for you," to which he added, "I shall behave, no ways ill;" I did not specify any time for his going.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not order me to go out as soon as I was cleaned, to look for a situation, and that you would do the same, as you were going round to the shops to order them to send you a servant? A. I did not; he distinctly told me he was not married.</p>

               Recommended to Mercy by the Prosecutor, on account of the great aversion he had to take away human life, except for murder and treason - and believing, from inquiries he had made, that the prisoner had very bad parents

                  </hi>. I am a travelling musician—I am married—I have have no fixed abode; I am always travelling—I came up from Brighton on Monday—I have known the prisoner two or three months—I became acquainted with him by stopping at his coffee-house in Oakley Street about half a dozen times—my wife does not travel with me; she does not live with me—I am 22 years of age—on 3rd July at 2 a.m. I was sitting in the coffee-shop humming a song; I had been to a race meeting, and came in that night—the prisoner had unpleasant words with his mother and she went to bed; he then came into my box, and sat on the opposite seat; I Was looking at a hole in the ceiling, and asked him what it was—he said it was a ventilator, and then leaning forward said "Would not this place burn well? I will pay you well if you will set tire to it, for I am well insured"—I said "Oh, would you?"—some one came in, he was called away, and I want to bed; later on in the day he went and bought a glass oil lamp—I did not see him buy it, but I was in my room and heard his sister ask him why he had not bought a 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. one, a small one—I did not catch the answer—I was at the top of the street that evening, and saw the prisoner helping to move the furniture out at the front window—I went to the station, gave informa<lb></lb>tion of what I heard, and took Sergeant Elton back with me; but before that, at 2 o'clock I was standing opposite, and saw the prisoner going to an oil shop in Oakley Street with a bottle—he said he was going to get paraffin and order coals—before that he said he said he would move the best of this furniture, as he did not wish the best destroyed; that was Thursday night—I went to bed at 1.55 by his clock, which I don't think was right—he gave me a glass oil lamp to take upstairs, and I went up without saying anything—I was sitting in the shop all the evening according to my orders; I went to my room, he followed me soon after, and went down again and brought</p>

               <p>up a pint bottle of paraffin; the same bottle I saw him with the day before—he began saturating the carpet in front of the bed with paraffin; then lie said "It is time now," and he set light to the mattress with the lamp; previous to that he had tried to break the glass of the lamp, but could not, so he took the globe off, and said "I shan't throw it down, as it will make too much noise"—he put it under the carpet, and tried to break it with his fist, but did not succeed—he then set fire to the mattress, and upset the lamp on the floor, and pushed the whole of it under the bed—he told me to stay two or three minutes, and see it well alight—I said nothing, but rushed and gave the alarm to the detectives who were in the street—they sent me for the fire-engine—to the best of my belief on that Saturday morning at 2 o'clock his mother and sister were in the house, and a man Dick who lodged there—I did not see them go to bed; they had rooms at this end—no one occupied the room over me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been a travelling musician about six years, since I came out of prison—I was in prison seven years ago for stealing coats, and had six months for it—I sing and play the guitar at seaside places—I am living nowhere; I slept at a coffee-house last night—I separated from my wife a month ago; it was not at her desire, but at mine; I could not agree—it is not a fact that she separated from me because I would not support her—she has lived with me since I left prison—I won a bit of money at Epsom races, and then she came to live with me; that is not why she came—I was always earning money, but she would not stop at home—I have known the prisoner two months—I just sleep there; sometimes I stop and take my meals—I may have been there eight or nine times—the sister was not in the shop when the prisoner had the altercation with his mother, nor was Dick there—when he said he would pay me well to set fire to the house, he had been drinking; his eyes were sparkling, he seemed agitated, and he smelt strongly—I don't think he had drunk too much, but the little he had had got into his head; he seemed to know what he was about—I did not tell him I should inform any one—I went to bed and stayed there till a quarter to two next day—it was then I heard the conver<lb></lb>sation about the lamp; it was in the shop, and my window was open—they burnt candles before that—I think he spoke of the furniture more than once—while I was there his mother in his absence had a notice from the parish authorities to clear out—that was on Friday morning at 11.30—the furniture was being moved when I gave information to the police—I had not informed any one of what I heard him say on Thursday morning, because I could not get up and open the door or walk out—I did not know that the furniture was taken to Brook Street—the prisoner said on Friday evening, "The fire will take place about 2 o'clock, so as the neighbours will be asleep"—we had had no preliminary conversation—he also said "I will run the water off, so that the young, fellow if he gets up shall not be able to get a pail to put it out"—I have not said this before; I told the Magistrate about running the water off I am quite certain of that—I heard my depositions read over, but they read them very quickly—I know now that there was no water found in the tank when the firemen came, and I mentioned that to the Magistrate—I remained in the shop on the Friday evening after that conversation, to hear all I could, but I went out to inform the detectives between 10 and 11 o'clock—the prisoner's mother, I think, went to bed at the same time that I did—I do not know whether his sister had gone to bed</p>

               <p>or where she slept—I do not know whether Dick's name is really Charley Colerick—I have slept with him several times, but I did not sleep with him on the Thursday night before the fire—I slept by myself, I am sure, and on the Wednesday night I do not think I was in London—I did not sleep with him when I went to bed at 2 o'clock on Thursday morning—I am certain he was not sleeping in the room over me on the Friday nighty because I know his bed-room is not on that side of the house—I know his bed-room, because I have slept with him—he was in the house that night to the best of my belief—I did not tell him that the prisoner was going to set fire to the place, nor did I tell the mother or the sister—I had only been in my room a few minutes when the prisoner came in with a bottle of oil—it was a dark-brown wine bottle—I got a reward two days afterwards for com<lb></lb>municating the fact of the fire.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant L</hi>). On 3rd June, shortly after 10 p.m., Shepherd made a communication to me outside Kennington Road Police-station—I went to Oakley Street, and saw a van standing outside No. 118, a coffee-house, and a bedstead, bedding, drawers, boxes, and bundles being placed in the van, and some were being brought out at the first-floor window—I saw it removed to, I believe, 52, Brook Street, Kennington Road, not above 300 yards off—I have since seen it in some rooms there—I saw Shepherd again next morning between 9 and 10 o'clock, and gave him certain directions—he came again that evening about 10 o'clock and made another communica<lb></lb>tion—I told my inspector, and then obtained Inspector Chamberlain's assistance, and he and I, and another inspector and a constable, remained in Westminster Bridge Road and watched the house—I saw Shepherd run out a few minutes to 2, shouting, "Fire! He has set the place on fire," or "set the room on fire"—I told him to call the fire-escape man, and told the constable to spring his rattle—we then went to No. 118—the door was open; we shouted, and ran up the staircase, and saw a, light under the door of the first-floor back room—on opening the door we saw a bed, the foot of which was facing us; the left side was against the wall, the right side was flaming, and there was fire underneath—I heard a voice downstairs, and saw the prisoner's sister in her nightdress, with a blanket on her—she said, "Where is my mother? Save my mother"—she directed us to another staircase—Chamberlain and I went together, and found the prisoner dragging his mother out of a room—we took her downstairs, and I asked him if there was any one else in the house—he said, "Yes, there is a lodger upstairs," pointing to No. 118—we went to the second-floor back, over the room Which was on fire, where I found a man asleep in bed—I believe his name is Charles Colerick—we came down, and I asked the prisoner if there was any one else in bed—he said "No"—I told him I should take him in custody for setting the house on fire—he said, "I know nothing of it"—he had his arms full of clothing; he was dressed, except his boots—I took him to the station, and ran back to the house, and with the fire-escape man, and water-jugs and tea-leaves, we extinguished the fire—I found this parcel under the bed—it is common drugget; it was wet, saturated with paraffin oil—I also found there this top of a paraffin lamp, and in the shop I found a bundle of bread, butter, cheese, bacon, and ham—the cupboard doors were open, and old papers were all over the floor—I charged the prisoner at the station, and found 13 or 14 keys for all the doors, two or three pounds in gold, between seven and eight pounds in silver, nearly 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in bronze, and a deposit note for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which had been deposited in the London and Westminster Bank the previous day, and also some brass taps—he gave me a key to open the door of 52, Brook Street, where I saw the furniture which I had seen removed, and in a box I found these two policies. (<hi rend="italic">These were both dated 21st February, 1879, one for </hi>600<hi rend="italic">l., and the other for </hi>300<hi rend="italic">l., on the furniture, wearing apparel, and stock-in-trade of William Best.</hi>) I also found there this covenant of a lease—this board (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is part of the floor under the bed just where I took the lamp from—I saw what remained of the furniture of the coffee-house, a few old bedsteads with mattresses and sheet coverings—I should say that all the furniture in the bedrooms would not fetch 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if sold—the furniture at Brook Street was better.</p>

I have lived at this coffee-house four years—I remember Shepherd coming to lodge there on the Thursday night before the fire—he slept me with that night in the room where the fire occurred—that was not because the house was full, for there was no one there—I slept on the Friday night in the other house—I was in bed when I heard of the fire, and they came and got me out—I heard the prisoner calling out—I had not had a conversation with Shepherd before that; he had said nothing about fire—I had no knowledge that it was going to happen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On the Friday night Shepherd only was in the part of the house where the fire occurred—the prisoner was not on that side of the house that night—I was with him till 1 o'clock—I did not see him go to bed; I left him and his mother downstairs.</p>

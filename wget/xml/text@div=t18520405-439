Curtis's premises at Stratford—two other persons, named Langshire, were employed to cart the deals—the deals were at West Abbey-wharf—none of them were sold, or were to be taken to any private person at all—we never do so; we bring them from the wharf to the premises, and send them to the buildings—we never sell them, or very seldom.</p>

Curtis's—I went down Ham-lane to the Abbey, and then turned to the right; supposing a person came from the wharf, he would go half way down Ham-lane and turn to the left—I saw this cart with a load of deals near Costigan's houses—there is no thoroughfare there, it only goes down to the marshes—I saw it come back again empty in five or ten minutes—the same man was with it.</p>

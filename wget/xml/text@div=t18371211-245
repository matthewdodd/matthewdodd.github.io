                  </hi>. I reside at No. 11, Exmouth-street, Commercial. road, and am a nautical and mathematical instrument maker. On the 20th of September Flesch called on me—I had seen him before—he introduced himself by saying he had lived opposite me five months—he said he had received a letter from Mr. Brandis, of King-street, Liverpool, and he understood by the letter that Mr. Brandis wanted mathematical, optical, and nautical instruments—I let him have three telescopes—I did not make any agreement with regard to the payment at that moment—he did not pay for them—he kept them six days, and returned them again, and said that he had received a letter from Mr. Brandis, saying that he was highly satisfied with them, but wished to have my name put upon them—he then wished me to let him have something more—I then let him have a handled quadrant and compound microscope—he said I should be sure of the money in a week's time—in three days after he called again, and pulled out a two-penny-post letter, and said he had received that from Mr. Brandis—that he was highly satisfied with the articles he had received, (the telescope had been sent back, and the quadrant, and microscope, with my name on them,) and that Mr. Brandis would call on the following Thurs day or Friday, and pay me for those goods, and give me a large order—he never called—I saw Flesch again on Tuesday morning, the 10th of October—he said that he had been in company with Captain Jackson at "a free-and easy," in Rosemary-lane, on Monday evening, and that none but foreign captains used the house—he wished me to let him have a sextant, which he had previously seen, to show to Captain Jackson—he said he lived some where near Newgate—I objected to it, saying, I had not received any money for the first, and the instrument was a delicate instrument, I was afraid of letting it out, but he might have the quadrant to show the gentleman as a specimen of the workmanship—he then took the quadrant, and promised to return it in two hours, which he did, and asked me if I should have any objection to bring the sextant and quadrant to his house in the afternoon, as he lived opposite—I agreed to do it—he came over about four o'clock, seemingly in a great hurry, and said, "Make me out an in voice"—he said Jackson supposed he was gone to the back room of the house to get the invoice—I was taken off my guard—he said, "Just receipt it," and I put "Settled" to it—he asked me to bring over the sextant and quadrant in a quarter of an hour, which I did—(they are here now)—I found the three prisoners smoking, and drinking rum and water—I placed the two instruments on the table—they all looked at them, and Jackson said it was a very fine instrument, and Henochoberg said it was a very fine instrument—Flesch said that he wanted 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—Jackson objected, and said he would give 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he was going to let Flesch have a gold watch and a lot of other things—Jackson then said he had no objection to give the price, but Flesch must go with him to</p>

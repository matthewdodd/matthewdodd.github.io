I am a lodger at 19, North-street, St. George's-in-the East—on 6th February, about 10 o'clock, I went to bed in a room on the ground floor, which is the parlour of the house—Thomas Eldridge is the landlord—the window and shutters were closed when I went to bed—the window looks out on the street—about a quarter to 4 I was roused up by a noise in the room—I said, "Who is there?"—somebody said, "Nothing, d—it"—with that he threw the shutters open, and, taking a bundle, jumped out at the window—I was after him in no time—I never lost sight</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Eldridge, who is the landlord of 19, North-street, St. George's-in-the-East—the last witness was a lodger in my house—in the room in which he slept there was a chest of drawers, in which was a pair of trousers belonging to my husband, and a pair belong<lb></lb>ing to my little boy—about 4 o'clock ia the morning, I was called up, and found all the things turned out of the drawers on to the floor, with the exception of what the man took away—these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) belong to me—they were in the drawers in the room where Ludgate slept—they were gone—they were brought to me by the policeman Brewer.</p>

About a quarter to 4 in the morning I was on duty opposite North-street, St. George's-in-the-East—I heard a noise, and saw the prisoner jump out of a parlour window of No. 19, with this bundle in his possession—he ran towards me, and when he saw me he threw down the bundle—I pursued him, and picked up the bundle—he ran into Backchurch-lane, and turned up a court where there was no thoroughfare—he had the waistcoat on, and the comforter round him—he lay down beside some palings there, and pretended to be asleep—I spoke to him, and said, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "Me sleeping"—I said, "Sleeping or not you will have to come with me"—I took him back—he was very much excited—he shook his head, and said he was sleeping—the woman identified the property—I saw him throw the bundle away.</p>

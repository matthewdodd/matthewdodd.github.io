            . I am horse-keeper to Mr. George Turner - on the 3d of February I was at his house, and saw the prisoner pulling some rope towards him, to get it on his back - he had no business to be there - I asked what he wanted with the rope - he said, "To go down with the barge" - I let him go out, thinking it was all right.</p>

            . I am a carman - I met the prisoner in the stable with some rope on his back - I said nothing to him, nor he to me - we had no barge going down that day - he was taken the same night, quite intoxicated - he had some cash in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw a man who told me to go and get a coil of rope - he said Joseph Baum was there, and he would give it to me - I went - he was there with a light - I took the rope to the bargeman, and he gave me a pot of beer.</p>

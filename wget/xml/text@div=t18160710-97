            . I am a cabinet-maker; I live in Upper Rathbone-place. On the morning that this took place, I was directed by my employers to be in Newman-street, to assist in putting a coffin into a house. I went for that purpose, and I observed Dycke standing by Mr. Semple's yard. After that, I saw him come out of the yard with a piece of mahogany on his shoulder; I heard him say to the other prisoner, that he would call and pay for it at nine o'clock the next morning. I went after Dycke, and secured him, and brought him back to the prosecutor's house.</p>

            . Re-examined. Coysh had not any authority to sell any goods until the clerk came. The clerk has power to sell. Coysh said that this was to be paid for the next morning at nine o'clock. I sent for an officer; the prisoners were taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLONER. Dycke had dealt with us before; he was a slab merchant.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH BERRY. Dycke had never been a customer to the house for a whole piece of mahogany like this.</p>

               <p>Goysh's Defence. I was coming to work, and I met this man in Wardour-street, and he said, he was going to our yard; I told him the clerk was not come; he said, he had an order for a pillar and claw table to be finished in a hurry. He asked me could not I let him have a piece, for he wanted to send it to the turner's immediately; I told him that was almost more than I dare do; but I would let him have it, and he must come and pay for it the next morning at nine o'clock, which he said, he would.</p>

               <p>Dycke's Defence. This man said he would let me have this piece of mahogany; I told him I had an order for a pillar and claw table to be finished immediately. I told him I wanted to send the piece for the pillar to the turner's that morning; so he let me have it, and I intended to come the next morning, as I had promised.</p>

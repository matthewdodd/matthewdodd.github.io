             was the only man that returned after eight o'clock; the watch was there at nine, my servant took it in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How early had you seen the prisoner in your house in the morning? - A. Between six and seven, I let him in in the morning myself; upon my missing the watch about ten o'clock, I made no enquiry about it at that time; sometimes my wife takes it down stairs herself; I went into the City upon business; returning home about one o'clock, I made enquiry about it.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your enquiry about it, did you afterwards find your watch? - A. I saw my watch between eleven and twelve o'clock at night; it was brought to me by Mr. Miller, the prisoner's master.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner having taken your watch of your own knowledge? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever speak to the prisoner about it? - A. I did, as I was asking my wife about it, when I returned to my business out of the City; I asked my wife if she had brought the watch down stairs; she said, no; I immediately ran up stairs, and looked for the watch; I said, it is not there; I went and fetched the constable, and had him taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to the prisoner when you brought the constable? - A. I told him that he had got my watch; he declared he knew nothing of it; I asked him several times, and he denied that he had got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him it would be better for him to tell you? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then we must not hear what he said - Do you know any thing more of this business? - A. I asked the servant-maid, in the prisoner's hearing, if he had been up stairs; she said he had</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to that? - A. He did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of this watch? - A. Nine pounds; it was a metal watch capped and jewelled, it cost me nine guineas, exclusive of the seal; the seal cost me two pounds eighteen shillings, and the key cost me either half a guinea, or twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a gold seal? - A. It was, with my own initials.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watch was brought you back, have you kept it ever since? - A. No, I give it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say, in the morning there were two men at work - were you gone out before they went to breakfast? - A. No, and I know there was only this one man come back.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that the other man went to breakfast? - A. About eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner, you say, went up stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was his business to go up stairs? - A. Yes; that was when the other man was with him, before breakfast, it was not afterwards; it was finished at the top of the house when the other man went away.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The whole house was painted? - A. No, only a little of the back part of the house, in a gutter at the top of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house was this watch left? - A. In the two pair of stairs</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Was the two pair of stairs painted at all? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the gutter was finished before the other man went away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - Q. Are you a servant of Mr. Andrews? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen your master's watch the day it was taken? - A. Yes, at a little after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it when you saw it last? - A. It hung on my master's curtains in his bed-room, as it usually did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at your house painting? - A. Yes, he came between six and seven o'clock in the morning along with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at any time of the day in the two pair of stairs room? - A. No, I did not see him in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him up on the two pair of stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was that? - A.A little after ten o'clock I saw him on the two pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180080"></xptr>stairs; he told me he went up to finish the skylight; I saw him go up the first flight of stairs; he took some stuff out of the garden, and told me he wanted to finish the sky-light that looks down on the stairs going into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where he was going up, could he get at that sky-light? - A. He could not, without getting out into the yard, and getting on the top of the house, and that he had no business to do; it was finished before breakfast; he asked me if he might have the steps in the garden; I told him he might have them; I was then coming out of the little parlour; he told me somebody called me before he went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body want you at that time? - A.No, my mistress and master were both in the shop; I told him, nobody called me, after I had been to see; he then said he heard somebody call me two or three times; he was then stuffing some putty in the holes of the cupboard before he painted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what time he came down stairs? - A. Yes, he was not up stairs three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether he went as high as the two pair of stairs? - A. I did not watch him, I had not the least suspicion when he told me and insisted that somebody called me; I told him there was not; he went up stairs, and came down again, and finished painting of the yard-door.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that your master went up stairs after the prisoner had been up stairs? - A. Yes; and in the mean time my master went up stairs the prisoner left his work; he took up his painting-pot, and left the house; I asked him whether he had finished; he said he had not, he was going with his painting-pot, and should return again; that was while my master went up stairs to clean himself. I never saw him afterwards till he returned at dinner-time, and my master came in at the time; he missed his watch, and my master charged my mistress with having the watch; she said she had not got it; he asked me whether I had seen the watch; I told my master I had no occasion to go up that morning after nine o'clock. My master then sent for a constable, and the prisoner made a good many oaths that he had never seen the watch in any part of the house, nor had he passed the door of the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have been talking a good deal of sky-lights, I am told that there was no sky-light, only the trap-door - might not he go up to paint the trap-door? - A. No, that was finished; I know it was finished, because the old man said it was finished when he went away to breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not go to fasten the trap-door? - A. There was no occasion for that.</p>
               <p>Q. When he returned he went to work in the yard, and continued till about eleven or twelve o'clock? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master then returned, and he went away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been out of the house before that? - A. Yes, he went home with his painting-pot about ten o'clock, while my master was gone up to clean himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come from breakfast? - A. At nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that was it before he went home with his painting-pot when your master went up stairs? - A. Between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had been an hour and a half in the house - he might have gone away before your master returned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not another man return after breakfast? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told the other man returned with the painting-pot? - A. No, he did not; the other man did not return all the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the other man return to fetch a pot of colour from your house? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know as well as I do that he came, and certainly did bring a pot of colour with him? - A. He did not.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Were you the employer of this prisoner? - A. Yes: On Thursday, the 11th of July, I sent this man with another man to Mr. Andrews's to paint some trunks at the back part of the house; in the morning I sent two men, because it was an awkward part to get at at the top part of the house; when that was done, there was no necessity for any more than one man. These men remained there till eight o'clock; the other man came to the shop, and I sent this man back to finish the lower part of the house, which he could do himself. I never saw nor heard any thing of him till half after ten o'clock; then he rung the shop-bell; I went down, and let him in; he brought two paint-pots in with him: I said, Joseph, have you done; he said, yes, Sir, I have done all but the trunk that runs along the skylight, Mr. Andrews wishes to have it painted, but it is very full of dirt and wet. He took his paint-pots up stairs, and brought a ladder, and he left the shop-door open; I was surprised to see the shop-door left open; I went into the accompting-house, I did not say any thing to him; in about a quarter of an hour I saw him come out of the privy, and he went out. I never heard any more about this business till after twelve: Mr. Andrews came and said, your man has stole my watch; good God, says I, is it possible; he said he had. Mr. Andrews's shop-door is constructed in this kind of way: there is no private door at all to the house; every person must go through the shop to go into the house. Mr. Andrews said, I wish you would come down and hold him in conversation while I go for a constable; I went, and the prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180081"></xptr>coming through the parlour; I kept him in conversation; he told me he had finished, and just as I was making him a reply, Mr. Andrews came in with the constable. When they came into the parlour, I said, Mr. Andrews accuses you of stealing his watch; me! says he, I know nothing at all of the watch. They took him to Marlborough-street, I did not attend that day; I should have gone to Marlborough-street, but I had not done with the Grand Jury, and that day I did not return home till ten o'clock at night. During the time the prisoner came in with the paint-pots at my house, I was called to another part of the house; when I came back again I met this man coming out of the privy which is made for the men of the shop; it struck me, when I came home at night, that it might be concealed in this privy; I found the watch in the privy where I saw the prisoner come out; I should not have had suspicion to have looked there, had not I have seen him come out when he came from Mr. Andrews's with the paint-pots. When I found the watch I took it down to Mr. Andrews's between eleven and twelve o'clock at night; I gave it to Mr. Andrews, and he gave it to the constable himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have a character with this man? - A. In my profession we cannot take characters, it is not like a servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Several hours afterwards the watch was found in your privy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All your men have access to that place? - A. They could not before the next day, they could not return home till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. They might have gone if they had been in the shop - am I to understand you that none of your men were at home? - A. Yes; there were none there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that none of them were at home? - A. There were two men came home at dinner-time, I was with them; they did not go into the privy; I was at home till half after four o'clock, and there was no man came home till after their day's work was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Your men came home in the evening? - A. Yes, then there were some of my family in the way.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out at half after four o'clock, and staid till ten? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Your men came home in the evening - they might or might not have gone unknown to you? - A. Not unknown to my family.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say you sent only two men, of which the prisoner was one - the other person returned to you before nine o'clock, and never went afterwards? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And after nine o'clock the prisoner was the only person employed in painting this house? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>- HAWTHORN sworn. - I am a constable of St. Ann's, Soho; I took the prisoner into custody, and at night, between eleven and twelve, the watch was brought to me; I have had it ever since, I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor) What parish is your house in? - A. St. Ann's, Soho</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that watch, seal, and key, are they all your's? - A.They are.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

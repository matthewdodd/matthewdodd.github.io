See pages</hi> 341 and 342)—these speeches were received by the mob with applanse—I saw Vernon there—I cannot say that he was present when Williams spoke—my impression leads me to believe that he came into the van about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards—I did not see him before that time—I cannot say whether it was before or during the time of M'Carthy's speech—Vernon was in the van; I am not positive whether he was there during M'Carthy's speech or not—I should not like to be positive that he was present at any of the speeches—I know he was there, but at what period I am not positive—I think he must have been there during Fussell's speech, but I am not positive—Williams then said: "Now my friends, fall into marching order, four a breast"—they did so, and in that order marched of the Green, down Aylesbury-street, into St. John-street—I went down Wilder<lb></lb>ness-row, and met them again at the corner of Old-street—they went down Old-street, down the City-road, into Finsbury-square—I noticed Williams at every point where I noticed the procession; he was at the head of them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, G</hi> 15.) On Monday evening, 29th May, I was at Clerkenwell-green—I recollect the procession leaving there—I was afterwards at Finsbury-square, and saw Vernon there, arm-in-arm with two persons walking in the procession round the square—I had seen Vernon before last April—I did not see him again that evening till I saw him on the leads at the first-floor window of a coffee-shop in Redcross-street—I know Williams—I did not see him in Finsbury-square; I saw him on Clerkenwell<lb></lb>green, and I saw him at the head of the procession in Compton-street, and in Redcross-street on the leads of the coffee-shop, with Vernon—I know M'Car<lb></lb>iiy—I did not see him on Clerkenwell-green; I first saw him in Redcross-street, about half-past eleven o'clock—the procession had halted in the street, in front of the coffee-shop, where I saw Williams and Vernon—Williams made a speech to them from the leads, and said that they had now had a meeting to show <hi rend="italic">Finality Jack</hi> whether they wanted reform or no—he said, "He would not let us have a meeting on the 10th of April; we have now bad one without his leave, and we will continue to meet every night on Clerkenwell-green and Stepney-green, until we hear such news from our. Irish brethren as our damnable press will not give us; I mean when our Irish brethren will want us to assist them in obtaining their liberties;" that is all I remember of what he said—Vernon then spoke—he commenced with saying, "Myrmidons! myrmidons! for that is now your name;" and then he said something about how they got that name, but I do not recollect exactly how he explained it; and he said this night had cheered his drooping spirits—he should not speak much, he was now resolved only to act—he said, "You will go home quiet to-night;" and to that the mob began saying, "No, to-night! to-night! Come down among us, and lead us, and we will do it to-night?"—I do not think he said any more, but from the noise of the mob I could not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030054"></xptr>
               <p>hear—I think the influence of the mob prevented his saying more—M'O—then said, as if in answer to what the mob was saying, "No, not to-night but to-morrow night, and bring your guns and pistols with you;" that was all M'Carthy said—Vernon was still there—there was a great noise <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> and M'Carthy was obliged to repeat what he said several times—I could distinctly hear what Vernon said—I should think he could hear what M'Carthy said he was about a yard from him—M'Carthy was at the window, and Venton on the leads outside—M'Carthy spoke from behind Vernon—I was about twenty yards from the window—the City police then came up, and dispersed the assembly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he at that time really walking in the procession, or walking as others, casually or idly present, might be walking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You see, that would be a difficult thing to say—he was walking round, and I was walking round with Mr. Potter—he might have been walking, for aught I know, for the same purpose—the procession was going round and round—they were not in order then—there were sometimes three or four, or eight rows, straggling.</p>

               <p>as nearly as I recollect they went into a public-house; at all events, about that time I lost sight of them—when the procession moved off the Green, Vernon remained at the wheel for some few moments—he did not move off in the procession, he went in a contrary direction; he went to the right, down Red Lion-street, and the procession moved straight on through Aylesbury-street—the van was placed in the middle of the Green—I never lost sight of Vernon after he left the Green till he went into the public-house as I supposed—I met the procession again at the corner of Wilderness-row, and Old-street-road, I think in Goswell-street, but I am not very well acquainted with the the neighbourhood, so I cannot speak as to the streets—the procession was going by at the time—I saw nothing of Vernon then—I accompanied the procession as far as Finsbury-square, where I again saw Vernon and his friends—I believe he was then walking with the same two friends that he was with before—he was walking there—my impression is, that at one time he was at the bead of the procession, but I really cannot say; I am not clear enough to swear to the fact—the persons remained some time in Finsbnry<lb></lb>square. they walked round and round—I followed them some time after that, as far as the Chartist Assembly-rooms, in Dean-street—I saw Vernon two or three times in Holborn after leaving Finsbury-square—I wanted to speak to him, but at the time I got through the crowd I missed him again—I wanted information about the objects of the body, for I was tired of following the procession so long—in Finsbury-square the mob were all together, four abreast, in the same order as they left Clerkenwell-green—I do not know where Vernon lives—I have been subpoenaed here, or I should not have been. here—I was not subpoenaed by the prosecution.</p>

On the night of 29th May, I went to the meeting; at Clerkes-well<lb></lb>green—I got there a few minutes after seven o'clock—I saw Vernonthere, on the van—I saw the whole of the meeting fall into procession, and march from the Green towards Finsbury-square—I saw Vernon get out of the van, on the back side, immediately after the conclusion of the meeting, when they began to fall in—he did not take any part in the meeting afterwards—I did not notice him forming part of the procession—I afterwards saw him in Old-street-road, walking in the road with a gentleman, 400 or 500 yards behind the stragglers of the procession—I spoke to him, and walked with him some part of the way down the City-road—a gentleman of the name of Dalrymple was with me—we went on towards Finsbury-square—I saw Vernon walking towards the square, some distance behind the stragglers of the procession—after walking with him some distance, I returned to Dal<lb></lb>rymple—I saw Mr. Vernon, after the procession had formed apparently, ci rather had walked round Finsbury-square, and at the time Vernon must have reached it it appeared to me they had gone round the square more than once—I saw the procession go round before I reached the square, and I saw Vernon pass through the procession, and go to the iron railing and walk with a gentleman, by the enclosure as it were forming the inner circle, but in no way connected with the procession, which was marching out<lb></lb>side Mr. Vernon—there is a pavement round the circle of the square—the procession walked round the square, leaving a space of eight or ten fee! between them and the iron railing, and in that space Vernon walked without identifying himself with the procession—I observed that particularly—I did not see him in the procession at all at the time—having had some oppor<lb></lb>tunity of seeing Mr. Vernon, I crossed through the procession, and went and asked him what was the object of the procession, and asked him to leave that place, and come with me, which he did—I then took hold of bis arm, and took him to a public-house, in Chiswell-street, where we had some re<lb></lb>freshment—I should think we staid there a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I cannot say whether the procession went on, while we were absent, but it was walking when I left the square, and it was walking afterwards when I returned to the corner of Chiswell-street—I separated from Mr. Vernon there.</p>

               <p>the same way that I had left it—it appeared to have gone on; it had not passed the public-house, it was going round the square; it had not left the square—I returned with Vernon towards the square, and at the corner of Chiswell-street, we got separated by the crowd of stragglers—he appeared to go towards Moorgate-street—I heard the procession was going on to Smith<lb></lb>field—I then went considerably ahead of the procession, and waited inside the pens until the whole of the procession passed me, with an intention of seeing if Mr. Vernon was there—I wanted to know the object of the procession—I did tot see Vernon—I was looking for the purpose of seeing him—I feel certain that if be bad been there, I must have seen him—I followed the procession on the footpath through the various streets, till it reached the top of Holbom, when understanding that they were going towards Leicester-square, or Charing<lb></lb>cross, I went down the short streets and courts; and when I got to Leicester<lb></lb>square, I found myself at the head of the procession—I turned through, the square to the corner of Princes-street and Coventry-street, and saw the whole procession pass up Princes-street again, where I parted with it—Vernon was not then in the procession—I stood there, on purpose to see—I have no idea where be lives.</p>

Other person, because I found there was no person that did know the object—I went to Leicester-square to see the procession pass, to see if there was any one I knew—Dalrymple invited me to attend the meeting—I understand there was a placard, but I did not see it—no placard was exhibited at the meeting—I heard Williams speak—I cannot say that I heard the whole of his speech, I heard some part of it—I saw Vernon in the van, when I got to the meeting—I heard several persons speak whose names I do not know—there is some difference between Vernon and me upon Chartism—we have never agreed yet on that point, as to the extension of the suffrage, and the payment of members—I know Cartwright's coffee-house, by having been there occasionally—I have not been there for twelve months—I do not know who keeps it—I believe it is a house that Chartists resort to—I know nothing of my own knowledge of the parties who go there—I never went but once—I know nothing about it from Vernon—I know the Chartist-rooms, in Dean-street, I have been there—I do not recollect that I was there on 26th May—the last time I went, it was so unpleasantly crowded, that I thought I would never go any more—I did not see or hear Vernon there.</p>

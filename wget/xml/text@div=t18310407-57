On the 14th of March I was behind my counter, in my shop, and heard a person say,"Here is a man taking your printed cottons;" I ran out, and saw the prisoner about four yards from my door, with a piece of print in his hand, training on the ground - he said the man has run up this street; a voice behind said,"No, that is the man, I saw him take it;" I detained the prisoner till the officer came and took him - I then discovered that another piece had been stolen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was he not raising it from the ground? A. He had one part in his hand, and the other on the ground - he was trying to take it up; he said the man was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said a man came into his shop and told him of it. Witness. No, he only came on the step, and then I ran out.</p>

            . I was passing the prosecutor's door; I saw the prisoner and another man at his door - I went on to Palmer-street; the person I wanted to see there was not at home - I returned, and again saw the prisoner near the prosecutor's door, looking into the shop, as though he was looking to see if any one was there - he then turned, and spoke to the other man who was at the door; I passed them, turned, and went back - I then saw the prisoner take hold of one piece, which was blue, and he seemed feeling the quality of it; I then turned again, and went towards the prisoner and the other man - I saw the prisoner take the blue piece, snatch it down, and give it to the other man, who wore a white apron; he said to him, "Go along, go along;" I said, "Mr. Thompson, here are two men taking your prints;" the prisoner took hold of this other piece, but part of it was on the ground, and he could not get away from it, till Mr. Thompson came and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he was stooping, as though he was taking it clear from the ground? A. Yes - I live in Park-street, Limehouse; I did not say I lived at the West India-docks, I said near the West India-docks - I did not give an address where I could not be found; I said I must go home, but Mr. Thompson said, "I must beg the favour of you to go to the office," which I did that night - I told the Magistrate, I was a foreman at the West India-docks, and that I lived at the place I have now stated; I did not say I was not certain the prisoner was the man -I saw him do it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. While he was going to the shop he must have lost sight of the person - two men ran up the street, and I was taking up the print to give to the prosecutor, and the witness said, "I think you are the man - yes, I am sure you are;" I was then detained.</p>

On the 25th of March, at eleven o'clock in the morning, I observed that the lock was perfectly secure; I had heard chambers attempted before, which made me particular in examining the lock. I went out, came home about six o'clock, and left my chambers about a quarter past six, I had left my outer door open, any person could get at the lock of it. On shutting it, I observed the screws had been moved, I immediately sent a porter for a locksmith to repair it. I returned in about five minutes; the stair-case is a spiral one. My chambers are on the second floor; I remained outside the door about a minute, then heard footsteps coming up stairs, it turned out to be the prisoners, when they faced my door they appeared confused at seeing me, and made a pause; I asked who they were, and what they came for, they told me their real names; and said they were coming to Mr. Johnson, Hare-court-buildings, which my chambers join - no such person lived there. I asked them who sent them, they said they were standing at their father's door in the Strand, and a gentleman going by, told them to go to Mr. Johnson, Hare-court-buildings, and see if he was at home; this rose my suspicion. I fetched Hitchin to search them, leaving them in custody of Mr. Bohen's clerk and Hebden. I saw a large hammer found on George, also a pair of pincers, and a piece of paper, he said he found the paper in Temple-lane as he came down; I asked him how his own name came written on it? he paused some time, and then said he would tell the truth, he wrote it himself. The outer door had been open the greater part of the day. The nuts of the lock were found at the bottom of the stairs three or four days after.</p>

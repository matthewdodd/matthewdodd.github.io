                  </hi>. I am a tailor and outfitter, and live in Three Colt-street, Limehouse. On Tuesday, the 9th of August, the prisoner, who is a stranger, came into my shop, looked round, and said, "I think I have got in to the wrong shop"—I asked what he wanted—he said, "A suit of clothes"—I said I could make them as cheap as any other person, and they would be 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—he looked at some things at the door, and said he wanted a pilot-coat, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my foreman mea<lb></lb>sured him for the cloth—he turned round and asked me to lend him some money, as he had just come home—I lent him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he had come home in the <hi rend="italic">Calcutta</hi> ship, and had been a long trading voyage—he came again between eight and nine o'clock at night, and wanted more money—I said I could not give him any till I made inquiry—he pulled a paper out of his pocket, and said, "I have given my captain your card,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184108230164"></xptr>
               <p>and he is going to send four or five more men to supply with clothes—he asked for a black silk handkerchief, which I gave him, and then a cotton one—I said I should send down to his captain next morning, in the West India Dock, to make inquiry; and my young man did go—this is the paper which the prisoner produced to me—I furnished him with two handker<lb></lb>chiefs, a silk and a cotton one, on the credit of that paper, believing it at the time to be true—I said, "Why, you told me you belonged to the <hi rend="italic">Calcutta,</hi> and this says the <hi rend="italic">Mary Jane"</hi>—he said, "Oh, no, I am bound to Calcutta on a trading voyage"—(<hi rend="italic">paper read</hi>)—"Ship <hi rend="italic">Mary Jane.</hi> Mr. Jackson,—Please let the bearer have clothes what he wants—for Cook, William Johnson—William Nargot, Captain; owner, Mr. Red<lb></lb>man."—he was dressed as if he had just come off a voyage.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. What are you? - A. A broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed by Mr. Mead? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Mead.) Q. There was a sale at your house the day after this happened? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any carpeting given to any of the porters, for the purpose of beating? - A. No, this carpeting did not belong to the sale at all; they had attempted to set up that as an excuse, but it was not so.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you swear to it, from the pattern? - A.From the use of it, and the pattern; I have the same patterns at home now.</p>

On the 8th of November I wrote a letter to Mr. Eddrup, near Euston-square - the purport of it was to borrow 35l. of him; I gave the note to the prisoner, and told him to take it the next morning, and deliver it to Mr. Eddrup, to whom it was directed on the outside - it was wafered; he was to bring back what answer he received - I said,"Be back as near twelve o'clock as you can, and we will dine together;" he did not return - I went to his lodging on the night of the 10th of November; I did not find him there, and did not find him again till the 31st of January - I received this letter from him, which I know is his writing - I had read the note to him, and told him to bring the answer directly back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been an attorney? A. I was admitted last Michaelmas term - I did not instruct my counsel to open that the prisoner was an attorney; I employed the prisoner in a confidential way, to call on my friends, and to see if he could make any arrangements, as I had lost a great deal of money in a Chancery suit - we dined together almost daily at my house; I should think he has pawned goods for me to the amount of 70l. or 80l., but I think nothing later than October - none since I became an attorney; he removed some furniture for me - I cannot tell to what amount; it might be about 50l. - I did not desire him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160069"></xptr>remove it; I desired him to pawn, because I wanted money - he pawned four watches; I had five, one was my wife's - he pawned some gold chains and gold keys; he desired to remove my furniture, and I consented to it - he said I was not in the house, and he did it for security; he took just what pleased himself, and left the remainder - I did not owe any thing to my landlord; I owed several accommodation-bill debts - I know he removed a four-post bedstead and some furniture, which he said he was afraid thieves would take; he did not leave me a bed to lay on in that house - I was not obliged to ask him for a bed for me and my wife; I ordered him to bring them - this note is my writing, (read.)</p>
               <p>DEAR LEWIS, - I have been much inconvenienced, as well as Mrs. Myles, by your not letting me have the bed and things, as you promised - the fact is we must sit up all this night, as we have no bed to lay on; the moment you receive this come with as many of the things I want, as you can bring in a coach, if you can get no better conveyance; but above all the two small mattresses, the bed, pillows, and bedding - I also want the portmanteau and boxes, as I have no change of linen.</p>
               <p>Witness. The linen I alluded to was to be washed - he did not take all my linen, but it was locked up in his house; I sent it to his house, because I thought fit - I am not bound to tell the Jury or you my motives.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Cannot you give a reason for this, which appears very extraordinary conduct? A. The fact is I locked up my linen, packed up my dirty linen, and took none with me; he at first stated he removed the furniture on account of thieves, and then he stated that the water came in - I sent for the bed and the mattresses to come to Waterloo-road, where I had taken apartments; I was within a short time of completing my articles, and there was an accommodation-bill, on which judgment had gone by default, and execution had issued - I would not have let them get into my house for that, if I could have helped it by keeping my door shut; I was not aware, when I removed, that the execution was out against me, but I removed as a matter of precaution - I had no other house at that time; I had chambers in Great St. Helen's - I do not know that I was afraid of any property being taken from there; I gave orders for my furniture to be removed, that it might be altogether at Battle-bridge, where he had a house - I took a room of him at 3s. a week as a warehouse.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many watches did he pawn for you? A. I cannot tell - he did not pawn at his own discretion; I had four gold watches and one gilt - I had had one of them about four years; I gave forty-two guineas for it - another I gave 30l. for; another I took for a debt of 17l. odd, the fourth cost eighteen guineas, and the other was a gilt watch which I gave about 9l. for - they were all regularly paid for; I have three of them now - the other two are sold; I pawned one of them myself; he had no commission for pledging - I gave him a dinner every day, and bed and bedding; I did not tell him my reason for removing my property was that I wanted to have it down to Chelmsford - this note is my writing: Chelmsford.</p>

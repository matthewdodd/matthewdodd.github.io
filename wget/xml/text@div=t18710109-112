                  <hi rend="italic">Ramsay. Q.</hi> How long have you known me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between six and seven years; it is more than four years, for I had you in custody five years ago for breaking into Kensington Workhouse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Ramsay.</hi> That is only two yearn ago? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That was the second time you broke in—you have just come from Paris—you went there with another man, who has been shot.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Brown's Defence.</hi> I was not with these prisoners at all. I did not speak to them. I was with Jack Swift, and when the house was closed I went home. I did not like to wake my mother up, and slept on the stairs, and Prenderville said "It is no use going to bed now; I have a job for you in the morning." He took me to Co vent Garden at 3 o'clock, and when he came back he went into Cumberland Street and had some ale; he said nothing about the fourpenny-piece. Does it stand to reason that if I had stolen the money I should have taken it to the house to change it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prenderville's Defence.</hi> I was drinking on the night in question, with Ramsay, having some half-pence saved up for Christmas, and got drunk. I asked Brown to go to Covent Garden with me, and we were going there when the constable met us. I had no money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ramsay's Defence.</hi> I was drinking with Prenderville, and when the house closed we separated, and I went home. I was not with them after 1 o'clock, and know nothing about the affair.</p>

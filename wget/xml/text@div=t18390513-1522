                  </hi>. I am single. On the 16th of April, about a quarter-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was in the Strand, near Somerset-house—I had hold of my cousin's right arm—I was inside, nearest to the houses, but we were on the outside of the pavement—I had my purse in my pocket—I know I had it safe a few minutes before, when I got out of an omnibus and paid my fare—it contained one sovereign and about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 's-worth of silver—there were crowns and half-crowns, and silver of every description—I found the prisoner with his hand in my pocket, or on it—he passed by my side, and went on the same way as we did—I said, "I have lost my purse," and my cousin fixed his eye on the prisoner—I made further search, and missed my purse—we detajned the prisoner—he entreated that we would not expose him, nor call the police—my cousin took him into something of a court, and attempted to search his pockets—he found nothing—I proposed that he should undergo a further search, as the search of his waistcoat pockets would not satisfy me—he entreated us not to call a policeman—he said he held a very responsible office, and exposure in that way might be a great injury, and might perhaps ruin him—he named an individual's where he said he would go and be searched privately—he took us to the door; then he turned round and entreated us not to expose him—he then proposed to go to his lodgings—I said I could not think of going, the distance was so great—he offered to pay for a conveyance—I said my lodgings were not far, and if he would go there and be searched I should be satisfied—he agreed to go, and went on as far as Temple-bar; he then ran down an alley, and my cousin pursued him—I waited till a policeman came and told me to go to the station-house—the purse has not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's cousin. When we were opposite Somerset-house she stopped, and exclaimed she had lost her purse—I saw the prisoner at her side—she said she had felt his hand at her pocket—I kept my eye on him, and requested her to be careful about her loss, and on her assuring me that he had it, I followed him as he turned into ft court on the right—I then charged him with taking the lady's purse—he said, "You certainly must be mistaken, you may search me if you please, I am a respectable man"—I just felt the pockets of his waistcoat, and trowsers, and coat, but not being satisfied with that, I requested that he would go into some respectable house, that we might have a further search—he begged hard that we would not call a policeman, as be held a respectable situation, and being exposed in the street, would injure him very much—he then proposed that we should go to a coffee-house, near St. Clement's Church—we went to the door—he then turned round and said, "Pray, don't expose me"—he had before spoken of his lodging, but we refused to go there—my cousin proposed that he should go to her lodging, and be searched—he agreed to that, and walked on my side to Temple-bar—he then darted up a court on my left—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him crying, "Stop thief"—he passed, one policeman who tried to catch him, but missed him—I was close at his heels—he turned into another court—I came up with him in two or three seconds, and found him on. custody of another policeman.</p>

                  </hi>M.D. I live in Curzon-street, May Fair. On the 3rd of December, I read this advertisement in the "Times" newspaper—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—in consequence of which I proceeded to the stables in Welbeck-street, and saw a stable boy—I then saw a man named Jem, who was dressed as a groom in mourning, all in black—I asked to look at the horse which was advertised in the "Times" of that morning, the bay gelding by Waterloo—he showed me the horse—I asked its age—he said he was six years old, that it was the property of Mrs. Brown, the widow of the late J. Brown, who resided at the Crescent, Leamington—the prisoner was not present at this conversation—I saw him very shortly after—I asked the price of the horse, and Jem pointed to Mowatt, who was close at hand, and said, "This is the man who is commissioned to sell the horse"—Mowatt said a gentleman had offered him 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it that morning, but that was too low a price, he could not let it go at that—that forty gui<lb></lb>neas was the lowest he would take for it—that he had received a note from the gentleman who offered the 35/. the day before, that morning, to say he would give 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he bad a note in his hand, which he said the gentleman had written to him, and he showed it to me—I looked at it, but did not read it—he said be could not let it go for 40<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, but if I liked to give forty guineas I might have it—I looked at the horse and said, "I do not altogether dislike the look of the horse, but I must try him, " and asked to see him out—I saw him out, and then asked leave to ride him to try him—Mowatt said I could not ride him that day, nor could he keep him for me till the next day without my giving a deposit—I said, "What deposit did he want, and that I had not got much money about me"—I left 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, and he gave me a receipt for it, which I read—it was a memorandum—I gave it back to Mowatt the following morning—it was "Received of Dr. Brown, the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, a deposit for the horse to be kept for trial to-morrow"—I believe those were the words—I went next day at eleven o'clock to try the horse by agreement—I found <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>and the prisoner there—I sent my saddle and bridle there, and in a few minutes the horse was saddled, and I got on—before that, Mowatt gave me back the 5<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, and I gave him back the memorandum—he said, "Are you prepared to deposit the price of the horse? "—I said, "Yes, and you must give me a receipt</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184001060103"></xptr>
               <p>for it"—I gave him four 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and two sovereigns, and he gave me this receipt—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note he returned to me was the same I had given him—(<hi rend="italic">receipt read</hi>)—"London, 4th of December, 1839. Re<lb></lb>ceived of Dr. C. B Brown, the sum of 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a bay gelding, warranted sound, free from vice, and a good hunter; if not approved of in two days to be returned"—(<hi rend="italic">signed by the prisoner</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did any thing further pass than what he said that you were to deposit that sum before you could try the horse? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No—<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>was pre<lb></lb>sent, and he said it was the favourite horse of his old master, J. Brown, of Leamington, and that Mowatt had brought it into harness, and if it could get into good hands, he had no objection to part with it at the low price of forty guineas, and he hoped it would have a good situation—I said, "Yes it would, it was going into the neighbourhood of Northampton"—he said, "Oh, very well, it would be near its own place of living"—I had given him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the day before, as he had said in the prisoner's presence, that he was going back to his mistress that night, and as he was sure I should like the horse and would purchase it, he hoped I would give him some money—upon which I gave him the 6<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>, and he said he would give it back if I did not buy the horse, and he said to Mowatt, "Of course you will give Dr. Brown the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back if he does not purchase the horse"—Mowatt said, "Of course I will"—I got on the horse, and shortly after I began to ride, I found he pulled so hard I could hardly hold him—I took him into Hyde-Park, and the first thing he did was to kick violently—I kept him out better than an hour—I then returned to the stable and saw <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>—I do not recollect seeing Mowatt at that time—in consequence of what <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>said I was induced to go there again the same day, at two o'clock, to try the horse again—I went, and again tried it—I found it more vicious than before, and more difficult to ride—after having shown him to one or two people, I returned to the stable a little before four o'clock, and found <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>and Mowatt there—Mowatt was showing a horse to a gentle<lb></lb>man—I said, "The horse won't suit me at all; it does not answer the description; it is much older than you say it is, and I won't have any thing more to do with it"—"Oh, " said Mowatt, "I don't wish you to keep the horse if you don't like it; I will give you back your money"—I said, "Very well then, give it to me"—he said, " I have not got it here; it is at my banker's"—I said, "Give me back my money, and I will give you the shilling for the stamp receipt"—he said, "Never mind the stamp"—he said the money was at his banker's, and he would go and get it—I said, "Very well, I will go with you"—upon this <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>came up, and begged I would write a note to Mrs. Brown to say I had tried the horse, or she would think Mowatt had not taken any pains to sell it—I told him I had no paper—he took me up a small staircase to where he got paper, pen, and ink—I wrote a note, which he did not approve of, and at his dictation I wrote another, and gave it to him—I then looked out for Mowatt, but he was gone—I made inquiry of <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>about him—I never saw him again for some time—he never came to my house at all—I went to the stable the first thing on the morning of the 5th—I only found a stable-man there—neither <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, Mowatt, nor the horse—on the 11th I saw another advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, in consequence of which I proceeded with Hooker the officer to a stable in Thomas-street, Brook-street, Gros<lb></lb>venor-square, and saw Mowatt come out—he did not see me at first—I got behind a cart—directly he saw me, he turned into the stable he came</p>

               <p>out of, and slammed the door—the officer came up—he was obliged to force the door, and took him in the loft—Mowatt said to me, "You have got the receipt."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you at any time give the prisoner your address? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes, the first day, on a card—I am sure of that—the first time I rode the horse in the Park and I tried it in the road—I rode it to the house of a roan named Holliday, a dealer in horses, and another man, named Webb, a dealer in horses—they told me the horse was much older than I had been told—<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>and Mowatt both said it was six years old—if I had looked in its mouth I could satisfy myself of that, which I did—I took it on the word of <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>as to the age, without exami<lb></lb>nation—it was in the last ride I went to the two horse-dealers—I have not bought a horse of either of them since—my brother has bought one—I was looking out a horse for him, and he came to town and bought one—I did not buy it of either of those persons, but of a man in the Edgeware-road.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. When you took this horse, did you buy it? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No, certainly not—I never said I did—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—this is my writing—it is what I wrote at the dictation of <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>—I did not write what was untrue at the dictation of any body—it is true I wrote that paper, but I wrote it under peculiar circumstances, because I saw I was being robbed at the time—I did not buy the horse on trial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you expect to have that very identical money back again? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. The same as I expected, and did receive the very 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I expected he would not part with the notes, just the same as if I had given him a cheque I should expect he would not have received it—there was no agreement that he should return to me the very notes and sovereigns—I should know my marks on those notes—I do not know their numbers—neither of the notes were found by the officer—I should have taken other money, if he had given me forty guineas at the banker's—I would have taken any money—if the horse had suited me I should not have asked for any money back—I am sure the horse was not of the age they said, from my own observation, but I did not look at it till after I took it out, not in the mouth—I took the age on <hi rend="italic">Jem's</hi>word.</p>

                  </hi>I am a policeman. On Monday, the 9th of De<lb></lb>cember, I received a warrant to apprehend Mowatt and another person—on Wednesday, the 11th, I went to a stable at No. 14, Thomas-street, Brook-street, Grosvenor-square, with Dr. Brown—I passed the stable<lb></lb>door before Dr. Brown, and saw persons about—I intimated to Dr. Brown what I had seen, and he went forward—in consequence of what I learnt from him, I went to the stable, No. 14, and tried the door—it was fast—I knocked three times, but nobody answered—I said, "If nobody opens it, I must break it open"—I broke it open, went up stairs to a loft, and saw the prisoner—I said, "I have a warrant against you for felony, and you must go with me"—he said, "I should like you to read the warrant" I read it—he said, " How can that be? how can they make a felony of it; has not he got the receipt? "—I said he must go to the station<lb></lb>house, and just before we left I asked him where the horse was—he said he knew nothing" about it—I searched him, and found two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, two sovereigns and a half, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I also found a banker's book, according to which the last deposit appears to be 114<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, on the 10th of October.</p>

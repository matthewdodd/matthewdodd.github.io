                  </hi>. I am a teacher, living at York-street, Newington—on the morning of 15th September, about 3 o'clock, I heard a noise as of shutting a window—I and my wife went down stairs—as I passed through the back room I distinctly heard two persons talking in the school-room—I unlocked the door and went into the room, and saw two persons in the room at a cupboard—I recognise Donovan as one of them, and one was very much like Taylor—he had a cap on then—one was standing on a chair, and one on a stool—I called to them, asking what they did there—they both jumped down; one ran towards me and threw me down on the floor—Donovan was the first that came to me—the other said, "Hold him down"—Donovan severely assaulted me—the police-constable afterwards came and took him, and he severely assaulted him—by great exertion I made my escape from them, and went in and shut the door on them; I went to the front door</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186109230170"></xptr>
               <p>afterwards, and found one of them bad made his escape by that door—the other I saw coming out from the window, and I caught him—I was in the school-room at a quarter past 12—they were all shut up then, all the windows were—there was a rope that fastened that window; I found that that had been cut—it was all safe the night before—there were three passes put of glass also broken—my desk was not broken open, it had not been looked—the lock of the cupboard was broken—there was nothing taken out of the house but a box of things and a piece of cloth; the things were strewed about the room—I saw Donovan at the station drop a skein of thread, which was mine—I found a cap on the Sunday morning at the place when I was thrown down—I took it to the station-house.</p>

I am the prosecutor's wife—on the morning of 15th September I heard a noise—I followed my husband down stain—I did not enter the room with him, hearing two; I rushed out at the private entrance to scream for assistance—I afterwards found a lot of things scattered about the room—I saw a man precisely like the prisoner Taylor run away without a cap on his head—I could not see his face, but I am fally persuaded be is the man.</p>

               <p>some marks there—I tried them in the mould, beside a foot-print—I found the marks generally correspond—this left boot was worn very much at the heel, and this side had sunk further into the ground than the other side, because his weight bore more on that side—I was improved with the idea that those boots corresponded altogether with the marks I saw.</p>

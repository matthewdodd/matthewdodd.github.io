             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect on May the 10th meeting with the prisoner? - I believe it was the 11th. I believe it was past twelve o'clock. I had rather taken a glass too much; still I had my recollection, but I did not attend to the hour. I had been at Munday's coffee-house, in Round Court, to meet a gentleman who did not come. When I left the coffee-house, in my way through the court to Chandos-street, the prisoner accosted me. I desired her to go about her business; that I did not wish to see her; that I was not a fit person for her, and so forth. She told me a great many stories, and so far insinuated herself as to demand my attention. She told me she was exceedingly poor. Seeing me to be an officer, she said she had been at Gibraltar a considerable time, and had known some persons in the 58th regiment. She begged me to hear her story; that I would go to a place called the Key tavern, just by there. She, I believe, rung at the door, and a man opened it. I went just within the door. I do not know whether I called for drink or she did. The man said there was none to be had. I went out directly. I said, poor creature, go about you business, here is half a crown in charity, and she went away. Immediately after she was gone I missed my handkerchief, and said, I believe in the hearing of the waiter, that she had picked my pocket. I had no suspicion then of any thing else, and went home to Wood's Hotel, where I lay. When I had got into bed I felt, as I always make it a rule, to know if I had my pocket book; sometimes I have things of value in it. It being gone I was a good deal alarmed. I got up, put on my clothes, and took my servant with me, and went to see after her. I went to the place where I first met with her, but could see nothing of her. Two patroles came up, and, seeing a woman, ran up to her, and brought her down to me. When she came I knew so little of her, upon my word, I could not recollect her face; but, upon her speaking, I perfectly well knew the voice, and she immediately owned she was the person that had been with me. I forgot to observe that I told the patrole I had been robbed by her. I asked her how she could be guilty of such an infamous thing as robbing me. She denied it. The patrole carried her to the Key tavern; when we came there she persisted in denying the robbery. I went to search her pocket. The patrole said it was his province to search her. She then put her hand into her pocket, and pulled out this pocket book. (Producing it) I said, that is my pocket book. She pulled out a memorandum book, and then my handkerchief, which I have not here. I had that night a 50 l. note.</p>
               <p>How long before you met her had you seen the notes in the pocket-book? - I saw the notes in the pocket-book that day, and I had the pocket-book at Medley's. I had a 50 l. note I got in change of a 100 l. note at Biddulph and Cock's, and four 20 l. notes, which I had in part of payment of a draft from Mr. Ballard, upon Biddulph and Cock's. I had them in my pocket-book at the time it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190024"></xptr> was taken out of my pocket. I asked her where the notes were; she persisted in denying them; I went into a room to persuade her to give my property up; I told her I would not prosecute her; I said a good deal to her upon the occasion; I said if she did things of this kind she must come to an untimely end some time or other. She still persisted that she had them not. She would not give them up. As we were carrying her from thence to St. Martin's watchhouse she produced the four 20 l. notes, and gave them to one of the patroles, who immediately gave them to me; I opened them and found there were only the four 20 l. notes. I said there was a 50 l. note, where is that? she said she had it not; I told her she certainly must have it, and when she went to the round-house she should be stripped and examined, which accordingly she was; the note was not found upon her; the person who examined her wished to know if he should examine farther than he did, (your Lordship knows what I mean, I do not mention it out of delicacy). Hearing some people had connexion with her, the constable went to see if they could find it. She lay in the round-house that night. As these prosecutions are disagreeable, and the world censures them, I had not an inclination to bring the thing on, and the woman was consequently discharged. That very day, a friend of mine asked me if I had the number of the 50 l. note; I said I had not, but could get it at Biddulph and Cocks's; he went with me and we got the number of the note, and went to the Bank on Wednesday morning, and stopped the payment of it. She was taken up in consequence of my understanding that note was paid to a Mr. Bride, by three women. The part of the pocket-book my notes were in has a clasp. She did not know the manner of it, and had forced it open to get the notes out.</p>
               <p>What pocket had you the book in? - My left hand waistcoat pocket. My handkerchief was in my coat pocket. I have but three of the notes here; I have paid one away. The notes I received of Messrs. Biddulph and Cocks, and a 50 l. note, were the notes in my pocket, these are the notes, the prisoner gave me; she said they were my property.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you positively recollect that you had the pocket-book when you met the girl? - Positively. I had it in Munday's coffee-house. I saw nobody but the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole. On the 11th of May at about a quarter or half after two in the morning, when I was standing in Vine-street, just by the gateway that leads from Chandos-street, I saw two men coming down. Captain Barry came up to me and said a woman had done a very wicked thing somewhere thereabout. He said if I could tell where she lived, or apprehend her, he would give me 20 l. I said to him, to pretend to put one's hand on such a person here I might as well pretend to put my hand on a needle in a bottle of hay. I said has she robbed you; he said she had, of four 20 l. notes and a 50 l. note. I stopped and saw a woman coming; I said, is this her; I went and took her by the arm and asked her if she was the person; she owned it immediately to me, and said she had the pocket-book which I charged her with, I took her to Captain Barry, and asked him if he knew her; he said no, he did not know her face;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190025"></xptr> upon her speaking, he said he knew her voice, that she was the woman's upon that she owned she had the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>How far was you from Captain Barry when you took her? - It might be about fifteen yards I believe. I put my hand in her left hand-pocket, and found one of the pocket-books. I put my hand in her right hand pocket, and found the other with clasps; he went to take it, and would have let her go, but I said no, you shall go to the watch-house and see that you have your property. We took the prisoner to the Key Bagnio, and the prosecutor desired to go into a room to speak to her; we went into the room all together; the prisoner desired we might go out of the room; we went out, but though I was out of the room I could hear all that passed; he talked to her of the had consequences of it; after a long persuading, she would not produce the notes; I then went in and said if he talked to her ever so long she would never produce the notes, and insisted upon her going to the watch-house, upon which we all came out, and as we were going along, I said if she did not produce the notes she would be hanged. When we were near Chandos-street, she turned about and said, I will own the truth now; she pulled a bundle of notes out of her bosom, and said here are the notes. I gave him the notes, and he desired to go back to the bagnio; we did; he looked at the notes; there were only the four 20 l. notes; he said there was a 50 l. note. She persisted in denying that, but owned she took the other four from him. I searched her pockets, and found half a crown, which she said the gentleman gave her, and two shillings and a sixpence, and the gentleman's pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any further conversation between her and Mr. Barry in the room? - Yes; he said, did not I meet you by mere accident in the street, seeing me an officer, you told me you knew a person in the regiment I was in, a relation of yours, and out of charity because you knew him, I gave you half a crown; how could you do such a wicked thing to rob me?</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Barry. At the time she took your pocket-book did you know of her taking it? - No; I did not miss it till I got to bed.</p>

               <p>I did not know that my trial would come on so soon; I have no witnesses; he said to me he had not lost his pocket-book, and that he had been with another woman.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Barry. Did she deny having the pocket-book, when you first saw her, or only the Bank notes? - I cannot say.</p>

                  </hi>. I have one partner; we are auctioneers, in Piccadilly. On 29th July I conducted a sale of some bankrupt's property, at No. 180, Whitecross Street—the prisoner appeared there, and bid for some lots—the first lot he bought was some barley—I asked for his name in the usual way, and he handed up a printed card, which was destroyed—I have made search for it, but have not been able to find it—what was on it was, "Wilcox, meat salesman, Newgate Market"—I did not ask for any deposit—the prisoner bought various lots, amounting to 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—one lot was a phaeton, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and some second hand harness—he also bought barley and oats—he came the next day for his account, and I handed it to him—he said would go and get the money—he went, and came back, and handed my clerk this cheque for 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

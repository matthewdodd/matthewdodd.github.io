            . I went out of the Half-moon tavern, Cheapside, about two in the morning, on the 16th of February. When in Red Lion street, Whitechapel, I heard several people behind me, making a great noise. I immediately stopped and let them pass me. They went down <placeName id="t17700425-41-crimeloc256">Colchester-street</placeName>

I passed the corner of the street; they followed me. One of them made a blow at me, and struck me on the shoulder; being behind me, I did not see who struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of them?</p>
               <p>Langfor. There were three of them. I turned about, and asked, what they meant by that? One of them immediately replied, D - n his blood, down with him. I thought it time to prepare myself. One of them advancing, I knocked him down with an oak stick which I had in my hand. The prisoner then immediately collared me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Langfor. I did not. In the struggle we both fell down. While I was down they got my money and watch from me; I cannot tell whether the prisoner or the other took them. Then they immediately made off, and I saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Langfor. I was sober; it was a light morning, and there were several lamps near me. The next morning I went to Sir

            , and advertised the watch, and described the prisoner, in company with two others. In consequence of that, I received intelligence from justice Sherwood, to come, in order to see if I could know any of the prisoners there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This might be a fortnight or three weeks after. I picked the prisoner out from several others; I am very sure he is the man.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250034"></xptr> I was wrestling with him three or four minutes, and there were lamps over our heads. I saw his face plain. I do not think I could know either of the others.</p>

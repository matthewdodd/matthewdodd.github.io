               <p>Q. Had she a blanket, two pillows, and curtains, as part of the furniture that she hired of you. - A. Yes, she was to pay four shillings and sixpence a week for it. She first came with another woman's husband, about the latter end of March, I let the lodgings to them both at first, the man left the lodging, and then she had it, and agreed to pay me four shillings and sixpence a week for it, she paid me regular for a time, there were five weeks due when she left me, she went away without giving me any notice whatever, but sent me a letter. I knew of the blanket being gone at that time. She came again, and left me without notice. There were two genteel women that she brought into my house about August, and when I accused her of taking my things, she said she had taken them through distress, I said that could not be, because she had been tipsey. She left my lodging on the 1st October, I found her the next day in Market Lane, and the duplicates was found upon her.</p>

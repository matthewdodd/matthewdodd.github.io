                  </hi>. I am going on for thirteen years of age—I am in the employment of Mr. Dean, wholesale stationer, of 32, Great Carter-lane, Doctor's Commons—William Freeman was also in his employment—on 9th December Freeman and I were engaged in wheeling a baud truck along the Old Bailey, towards Skinner-street, it contained ten reams of paper—I was on the left-hand side of the truck, the side next the kerb, and Freeman was on the other side—there is a cross-bar at the end of the handle, so that each could pull—we were scraping the kerb as we pulled it along—a cart was standing at the other side of the road, against the kerb, at the London coffee-house, with the horse's head towards Ludgate-hill—when we got abreast of that cart I saw the prisoner driving a two-horse van, laden with goods—he was five or six yards off when I first noticed him—deceased and I called out, "Stop!"loudly, because there was danger; if we could have got by we could have gone into Lavington's, the carrier's gateway—there was not room for the van to go by when we were abreast of the cart—the prisoner kept driving on, he was going at a moderate, quiet pace, walking; the fore wheel of the van struck the iron part of the wheel of the truck; we called out again, "Stop a minute, and we will back, "and we reversed the truck a little, and then the front wheel of the van struck it again—the effect of that was to throw Freeman under the hind wheel of the van, with his head towards Ludgate-hill, and the cross-bar of the truck across his legs—it also threw me on the pavement—I got up and took the handle of the truck off Freeman; the hind wheel of the van had passed over him—the prisoner went on five or six yards further, he then pulled up and got off his van—a man named Seymour came and picked Freeman up; some policemen came up, and he was taken to the hospital—I ran home and told my master—our truck was scraping the kerb when this happened—the cart on the other side remained standing all the time—the pace of the van was not slackened at all from the time I first saw it.</p>

On 9th December I was on duty in the Old Bailey, standing opposite Lavington's gateway, which is on the left-hand side coming from Ludgate hill—I saw the truck coming along close to the kerb—one of Pickford's vans, driven by the prisoner, was going down the Old Bailey, the reverse way, towards Lndgate-hill—there was a cart opposite the door leading to the offices of the London Coffee-house, seven or eight yards from Lavington's, opposite it—the van was going very slowly along; it met the truck opposite the cart, and the off fore wheel of the van struck the wheel of the truck—the deceased and the last witness who was with him called out something, I could not say what, and they commenced moving the truck fay pushing it back—the driver paid no atten<lb></lb>tion whatever but still kept on, and the wheel a second time struck the wheel of the truck, and turned the handle off; it came round and knocked the deceased under the hind wheel of the van, which passed over his right leg, just by the knee—the driver went on several yards before he pulled up—the deceased called out very loudly as the wheel passed over his leg—before I could get to him Seymour had got to him, and assisted to get him away—I took him in a cab to the hospital—the prisoner got off his van and came back and asked me whether the man wan hurt—I said I did not know—he said, "He was a foolish man, he might have kept out of the way"—until the van stopped after the occurrence, the prisoner did not at all alter the pace at which he was going, or stop at all—at the time the van wheel struck the truck, it was as close to the kerb as it possibly could get—the cart was also close to the kerb on the other side, and standing still—I was 'about eight or ten yards off when I saw this, on the same side as the cart, in front of the cart and at the back part of the van, nearer Skinner-street.</p>

I live at 10, Manor-street, Old Kent-road—I am a cab driver and proprietor—on 9th December, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the Old Bailey, driving a four-wheeled cab behind a Pickford's van, which the prisoner was driving—it was going slowly, steadily along, and I was following it—there was a cart on the near side, and a truck coming up on the right-hand side—a man was drawing it—as the van got to the truck, the truck stopped, just by Lavington's yard, and before the van had got quite by, the man pulled and twisted the truck to get it out-of the gutter, and twisted the neck of the truck between the hind wheel of the van; by so doing he fell down, and was run over—I called out to the man to stop, and he stopped instantly, just as it went over him, in about two and a half yards—I did not bear any body call out from the truck—I have been a driver of cabs and omnibuses all my life—in my judgment, the prisoner could not have prevented what occurred—it was very slippery under foot that day—I called out about half a second after the wheel went over the man, not before—the man was down and the wheel over him in a second—if the deceased had stood still and not endeavoured to get his truck forward, the van would not have touched him, it would have been able to pass by.</p>

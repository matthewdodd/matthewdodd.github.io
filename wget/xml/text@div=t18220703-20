As I was walking in the road, Chimes took my red silk turban off, and ran with it into the prisoner Sapple's room. I followed her into the room; there was a light there; Chimes put it out. All four prisoners were in the room. Collesa took me and threw me on the bed. I knew it was him by his voice; I knew him, and he knew me. Tindle then came up to me, and put his hand into my pocket and took my money out. I knew both their voices; they both came here in the same ship with me. He took coin, value fifteen rupees, one half-crown, six shillings, and three penny-pieces. I am sure he took them away. The women did not touch me. Sapple put the candle out. I took hold of one of the men by the hand, and they directly caught me by the pocket. I hallooed out, and Tindle took a knife and threatened me if I made a noise; and when I found they would not let me out, I took Tindle by the arms and dragged him down stairs into the street. A watchman came, and I gave him into custody. I then gave Sapple and Collosa in charge; but Chimes ran away. They were taken to the watch-house. I am certain that they took my money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SAPPLE. Q. Did you see me put the candle out - A. Yes. I did not strike Tindle. It was Sapple, and not Chimes, that put it out.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 3d of June there was a noise in the street between the prosecutor and the prisoner Chimes. The prosecutor said he had been robbed. I asked Chimes what he was talking about, she said that he said he had been robbed, but it was false. The people who stood by said something; I then went into Sapple's room, and brought the male prisoners down; I did not see either of them with a knife. I went in again, and brought Sapple out of her room. Chimes had gone away before I came down. I put them in the watch-house. No knife was found in the room. The house is in Cornwall-street, St. George in the East.</p>
               <p>COURT to CARDER. Q. How do you know that Tindle had a knife - A. He had it in his jacket pocket; it was such a knife as sailors use. I took hold of his arm, and could feel that he had it.</p>
               <p>CHIMES'S Defence. I can prove he gave me the turban to take care of, and in five minutes he asked me for it again. I gave it him, and afterwards went to Sapple's room. He came up, and beat these men about dreadfully. They did nothing to him. Sapple called for assistance, and the landlord came up and turned him out, and he said he was robbed of 3 l.; he said I had better go home, for he would have all three that night.</p>
               <p>TINDLE'S Defence. I was in the room; he followed Collosa up, and struck me; he endeavoured to get from him; he was very much in liquor, and said he was robbed. I had pawned my jacket a few days before to lend him money, and how could he have all this money?</p>

            . I am landlady of the house. This man came into Sapple's room; I had heard her go up ten minutes before. I heard a noise; went to the bottom of the stairs, and said I would have no piece of work. She said a man had come up, and she could not get him down. Shortly after I went up myself, and told him to go down stairs, for I would have no fighting there. Sapple said he wanted to fight the other man; he came into the passage, and waited there; I suppose he wanted the other man to come down, but I could not understand what he said. I had heard Sapple crying out to take him down, or he would commit murder. He never said he was robbed till he got out of doors. I went up to Sapple's room after he was gone to the watch-house, and blew her candle out.</p>

He took us and gave us a glass of gin each; and as he came out of the door, he took his turban off and gave it to her. This was about half-past eight o'clock, at the Angel, forty or fifty yards from the house.</p>

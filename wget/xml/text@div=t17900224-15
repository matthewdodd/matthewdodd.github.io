               <p>Court. How came you to miss your handkerchief, and not your neck-cloth? - I do not know how that was, but she gave me my handkerchief: I went and drank with them all at the publick-house; the girl and I was talking together five or six minutes together, from the other two; then I missed my handkerchief; then we went to the publick-house door, and she went in and brought some gin to the door; I gave her the money to pay for it.</p>

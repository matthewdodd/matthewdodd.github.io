               <p>I lived in Stocker's house. I saw the prisoners and Stocker go out together on a Wednesday about six weeks before Christmas: they brought a bullock home upon their shoulders about two o'clock in the morning; they put it into the cellar, and skinned it: I stood upon the stairs and saw them. Some of it was salted, and put into barrels in the shed: the skin and horns were hid in a hole in the gravel-pits.</p>

               <p>The two prisoners took a room at my house a few days after Michaelmas. I had some gravel to rake: they went to work with me. While we were at work, we complained a good deal about poverty. I had a fa mily of six children. They said, if I was agreeable, they would be d - n'd if they would not have a kill-me-crome. I asked them, what they meant by that? They said, a sheep. I told them I was not agreeable to any such thing. We worked hard all day; at night we went to a public-house, and drank pretty much: the liquor overtook me; then I agreed to go with them; and we went and got a sheep near Sunbury.</p>

               <p>Court. Confine your evidence to this bullock.</p>

               <p>Hodges had been to Hampton-Wick. He told us, he had seen a fine chance; which, if we succeeded, would serve us all the Christmas. This was about a month before Christmas. I asked him, what it was? He said, it was a lame bullock. We went into Bushy-park at about twelve o'clock at night: we saw the bullock; it was very lame, and very poor: we drove it to Teddington-gate, which is always open: we drove it out, and round the park-wall till we came to my house. There is a gentleman's house adjoining where I live, in which Mr. Miniship did live; that house was empty: we opened the gates, and drove the bullock into the yard: the key of the stable-door lay in the window; we unlocked the stable-door, and drove the bullock in; then we got an old axe, and knocked it on the head; then we skinned it as well as we could, and cut it into quarters. There was a back-door from that yard opened into my house, directly against the cellar-stairs. We opened the door, and carried it down into my cellar by quarters; then we carried down the skin and sat into the cellar. We sunk a hole in the middle of the cellar, and buried them. Then we washed the stairs very clean. We gave the sow the guts, and she ate them. The next night we went to Sunbury, and got some casks which were standing in the street. We took the heads out of the casks, and cut the beef up, and salted it: we put it into the casks, and put the heads in as well as we could. The next day we sunk a hole in my shed, and buried the casks, and they lay there till about a week after Christmas; for there was a great disturbance about the bullock, and we were afraid to meddle with it. After I moved from the house, I asked Hodges and Frazier to move the skin and horns: they told me afterwards they had moved them to a hole in the gravel-pits.</p>

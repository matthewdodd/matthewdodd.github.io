Wontner, which I did—the prisoner referred me to his brother, who seemed very much alarmed, and said that he had been deceived himself; that he had given the value for the bill, and that if I did not return it to him at once it would prevent him from obtaining redress, and he begged of me to give up the bill, and promised he would give me another—I said, "No," I wanted the money beforehand—I saw them again in a few days, after Messrs. Wontnor had written on the subject—I told them I had reason to believe they were scoundrels, and the prisoner said he would not allow his brother to treat me like that, and it was agreed that they should give me another bill and part cash—they then gave me a bill on J.

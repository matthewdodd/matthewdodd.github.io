                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250095"></xptr>What do you mean? - I was going from No. 4 in the Cloisters, moving my lodging; I was going to No. 5, Red Lion-court, Catherine-street, in the Strand; I had the trunk under one arm, and the child in the other; the prisoner overtook me a little beyond St. Andrew's Church, Holborn; he said I must be very much tired, and desired me to let him carry the trunk a little way; I said I would not deliver my trunk to any body, that I did not know, there were such accidents happened in London; he walked with me to Middle-row, Holborn; and I went through Staple's-inn, I was going to call at my brother's; when I came to the Inn, I says, Sir, I will thank you, if you will give me my box; he then said, I was not afraid to trust the child with him, and he took the child from me by force; I told him I did not like to let the child go; then he carried the child a little way, and I suppose he must pinch the child, I will not swear that; the child cried violently; I took the child from him, and then he took the box from me by force.</p>
               <p>Did you give him the trunk to carry when you took the child from him? - No I did not indeed.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes; when I come to the passage that leads to my brother's at No. 5, in Bell-yard, I desired him to give me my box; he said he would not before I got something to drink; he said I must be in want of something to drink; says I, Sir if you want any thing to drink, you can get it at this inn, I believe; he said no, we will go to the public-house a little way below here; I really do not know the name of the inn, it is in <placeName id="t17890225-77-crimeloc354">Chancery-lane</placeName>

               <p>Where had you put the trunk when he took it up? - In side the public-house, just by the door in the tap-room; all this was in the tap-room, there are witnesses to prove it.</p>
               <p>What public-house was this you went into? - I think it is the Mitre in Chancery-lane, I did not know the public-house, I never went into a public-house with a strange man before in my life; I went out with the glass in my hand, and said O Lord! O Lord! my box is gone; I went as hard as I could run, and called out stop thief, as loud as I could, and he was stopped by the patrol at the bottom of Chancery-lane, near Fleet-street; I have spoke nothing but the truth, he had the trunk when he was stopped by the patrol.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Mrs. Russell, you had not been acquainted with the man before, he was quite a stranger to you? - Quite a stranger, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>And you was going from St. Andrew's Church to Middle-row? - I was going from No. 4 in the Cloysters, Newgate-street, to No. 5 in Red Lion-court, Catherine-street, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>You went into the house with the man who was quite a stranger to you? - I went in to follow my trunk.</p>
               <p>Then when he had paid for the liquor, he took up the trunk, in the presence of all the people, and went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were several people there? - Yes, I do not know how many, I was quite ashamed.</p>
               <p>Do you know any woman of the name of Ewitt or Ewen? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you do not? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>How long has your name been Russell? - About a year and a half.</p>
               <p>You have been married as long as that; where was you married? - I am not come to swear that.</p>

            's own in the trunk? - There was a shirt and neck handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I ask you the plain question; upon your oath, is not your own name Ewitt, or Ewen? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>How long has your name been Ewitt or Ewen? - It never was.</p>
               <p>What was your maiden-name? - Elizabeth Gurnsey.</p>
               <p>That was your maiden-name? - Yes, I never went by the name of Ewitt or Ewen, I never went by that name in my life.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that positively? - I do.</p>
               <p>Where was you married? I do not ask you whether you are married.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was you married? - If the Judge requires me to say it I will.</p>
               <p>Court. Yes. That is not an improper question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What church or chapel was you married in, I fancy the child could answer it as well as you? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you mean you have forgot it? - The prisoner said he would be d - d if he did not make my husband fly the country.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If it is understood that is all I mean: do you remember saying before the Lord Mayor, that you had never been in that house with the prisoner at all? - No, I never said it, I spoke before the Alderman as I speak here.</p>
               <p>You are positive you never said so? - Yes, I can swear that.</p>
               <p>Did not you say before the magistrate that you did not know he was the man? - The prisoner's brother came, and drew out two of my brothers, I swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Did you say before the magistrate, that you did not know that this was the man? - I never did; after I swore, and kissed the book.</p>
               <p>Did you before you kissed, say that you did not know whether this was the man or not, at any time or at any place? - I am not come to answer that.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time or at any place say, that you did not know whether this was the man or not? - I swear to the man, and I swear the truth.</p>
               <p>Nay, more, did not you say he was not the man? - I said at first as the prisoner's brother ordered me, and I swore to the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever say he was not the man to any body? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Never to any body? - I said before I swore, but I swore to the truth.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you ever say that he was not the man? - I never said that he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Court. You never said to any body that he was not the man; you are sure of that? - I cannot say whether I did say so at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>What magistrate was it that you was examined before? - It was that Alderman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you recollect his name; the Alderman is in this house, now at this time; upon your oath, did not you say distinctly, before the Alderman, that this was not the man that had the trunk? - No, I did not say that.</p>
               <p>What did you say? - I said I rested the box at the door, and that with the fright the man run away with it; I did say that I could not swear rightly to the man, but then there were evidence that could speak the truth, and they made me kiss the bible.</p>
               <p>Did not you say before the magistrate that this was not the man? - I am not to answer, I cannot answer it.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, before you was sworn before the magistrate, that this was not the man? - I said I could not swear to the man, but after I took my oath I spoke the truth.</p>
               <p>Then you did say before the magistrate that you could not tell which was the man? - They made me say it.</p>
               <p>What was the price that made you say that? - I never took any thing myself.</p>
               <p>Who did; who was your trustee on this occasion? - My husband got into a public-house, and they made him drunk; they offered seven guineas, he took three; and afterwards he offered it back, and they would not take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250097"></xptr>Was you present then? - No, they said it afterward, I was not present.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that; was not you in the room when he took it? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Nor in the house? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell told you he had got three guineas? - That I should not speak the truth till I was made to be put to my oath.</p>
               <p>So you took three guineas to tell a lye, resolving at the same time to tell the truth; the prisoner was in custody, I take it for granted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is not that since you was before the magistrate? - No, it was before I went to the Justice; it was the Sunday following after the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not you tell the Justice, that you had not been into any public-house at all? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that positively? - Yes, I will swear that positively, I will indeed, not after I had taken my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you before you took the oath? - I said I was standing at the door.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell the Justice that you had drank no liquor with him, and had not been into any public-house? - I did not say those words; I am not able to stand.</p>
               <p>Well then let her sit down; do you mean to swear that you did not tell the Justice, that you had not been in any house? - I told the Justice at first that I had rested my box at the door, and there was a man took the box, but I could not swear to the man, that I called out stop thief, but could not swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Did you say distinctly upon being asked the question by the Court? - I was not asked that question by the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Nor by any body else? - I was not asked that question by any body else; I said nothing before the witnesses was sworn.</p>
               <p>Before or after, or at any other time, did you or not say, that you had not been into any other house? - I did not say it.</p>
               <p>How far is this Mitre ale-house from the bottom of Chancery-lane, Fleet-street? - It is by Serjeant's-inn, Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Next door to a very convenient house, where there is a lamp in the window? - I never was with a strange man in a public-house.</p>
               <p>Is not it opposite Serjeant's-inn coffee-house? - I cannot say, I never was in the public-house before, it was in the evening before dark.</p>
               <p>You did not go to your brother before you went to the ale-house? - He would not let me have my box, I was obliged to go.</p>
               <p>Why did not you complain when you went into the public-house, and tell them that this man had robbed you; you chose gin, did not you Mrs. Russell? - I did not Sir.</p>
               <p>Was not gin ordered by your own desire; was not it the liquor of your own chusing? - I cannot say but it was; I must have my box.</p>
               <p>Do you remember saying before the magistrate that you did not believe the man, whoever he was, intended to take your box away, but that you was in a flurry, and cried out stop thief? - I am quite sure I never said that.</p>

               <p>On Saturday evening between six and seven, I was at the Mitre in Chancery-lane, and while I was drinking part of a pint of beer, the woman and the prisoner came in there, and he asked the woman what she wished to drink; she said gin; he desired the landlord to give him the best gin, the landlord gave it him, and he drank the first glass; while the woman was drinking the second glass, he took up the trunk, and out of the door he went; the woman went after him.</p>
               <p>Who brought in the trunk? - The woman, I am sure of that; she went after him as soon as ever she could turn herself round with the child, and called out stop thief; and I likewise called out stop thief; he was taken at the bottom of Chancery-lane with the trunk upon him, I was not nigh enough to see him; I saw him with the trunk afterwards, the trunk was left in a butcher's shop, and he was brought to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250098"></xptr>the publick-house where he took it out of; he said his name was Mendoza.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This publick-house is very near the end of Chancery-lane? - I believe it is opposite Serjeants' Inn Coffee-house.</p>
               <p>The woman came in pretty freely? - The woman came in first with the trunk, and the child and he after her as soon as he could; I was before the magistrate, I cannot remember what she said there.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear her say before the magistrate, that she did not know the man that took her trunk? - That she would not swear to the man?</p>
               <p>Did not she say that she did not know him? - I cannot rightly say that.</p>
               <p>Try, try? - I cannot indeed.</p>
               <p>Will you swear she did not? - I cannot rightly say that.</p>
               <p>Will you swear she did not, Sir, in your hearing? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Look across and try, pray Mr. Fitch, what are you? - Sir, what am I; a poor man.</p>
               <p>What way of life are you in, look at those gentlemen now, and speak out, take your own time to consider what way of life you are, and then give us an answer. - She told the Alderman.</p>
               <p>She did not tell the Alderman what way of life you was in, that is my present question; what way of life are you in? - I get my bread going on board of ships, or waiting on the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>How do you mean? - On board the Indiamen, and since then I have got into the India-house.</p>
               <p>Which of the warehouses are you in? - I am down at Botolph-wharf now at present.</p>
               <p>At that time you was what they call a cadee out of work? - I was not quite out of work.</p>
               <p>Did not she say distinctly in your hearing, in the presence of the magistrate, that she did not know the man that took her trunk? - She said she would not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Did not she say she did not know him? Try your hand, now, Mr. Fitch. - Yes, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Did not she say, that she stood at the door, and did not go into the publick-house with her trunk? - I cannot recollect, indeed.</p>
               <p>Will you swear she did not? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that she did not in your hearing say so? - I will not swear that, because I am sure if I was to swear it I should swear a falsity.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Mr. Russell made the bargain for three guineas? - I was not.</p>
               <p>You have not had any? - I have not, nor ever desired any.</p>
               <p>You are to have part of that, I take it for granted.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to swear that you are a porter in one of the East India warehouses at this time? - I am down at Botolph's wharf; I have 12 s. a week.</p>
               <p>That manner of answering will not do, you must answer it directly? - I am at the compting-house down at Botolph's wharf, and I have 12 s. a week.</p>
               <p>I ask you a direct plain question, to which I will have a direct plain answer. - I am at the compting-house down at Botolph's wharf; there is no warehouse there, I go at six in the morning, and I light a fire for the clerks, and I stay there all day for Mr. Dominicas.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in his employ? - Last Saturday was a week.</p>
               <p>What was you before that? - I used to go on board ship to wait on the gentlemen, as I had been in the Company's employ, and have lost my leg.</p>
               <p>Why were you so shy of telling what your way of life was at first? - I did not understand the gentleman's meaning.</p>

               <p>JAMES WILLIAMS. The prisoner was in my employ for about six weeks; I employed him till he could get anything better - he was detected, on the 8th of July, leaving my house with a pair of boots, one of them in his trowsers, and one in his hat - they were mine - he was employed to clean boots and shoes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TOZER. I am a servant to Mr. Williams. On the 8th of July I went into the cellar, and saw a pair of boots there, concealed beneath a blind, which was not the place for them; I gave information of it in the house; this was about eight o'clock - the prisoner was in the shop at the time; he went down afterwards, and when he came up again he was stopped, and the boots found concealed, one in his hat, and the other in his trowsers; the boots were men's boots, they were new.</p>

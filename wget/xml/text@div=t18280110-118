            . I am a constable of the Thames Police. On the 12th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners turn out of Whitechapel into Petticoat-lane - one had a bag, and the other something heavy in a leather apron; I went up to Callarn, and asked what he had got; he said tools - White was close by, and he also said tools; I felt, and said, "It is lead, where did you get it?" White then said, "I am master, that is my man - it is some lead I have been working with at Mr. Duff's, at Poplar, and am taking it home;" I took them into a public-house, and then before a Magistrate; Callarn there said he worked for Mr. Fulham, at Clerkenwell, and that White was the journeyman and he labourer; White had about forty pounds of lead, and Callarn twenty-eight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. In what way were they carrying it? A. On their shoulders; White afterwards said he lived in Golden-lane, and mentioned several persons whom he knew there; he said, at the office, that he was not a master - and I did not go to Golden-lane; it is not sheet-lead, but lumps.</p>

            . I am foreman to Joseph Thomas Fulham, a smith, who lives at Clerkenwell; the prisoners were in his employ. On the 12th of December I saw this lead at the Thames Police-office, and know it by marks on it, corresponding with marks of the chisel, and with another piece, which I have brought; the prisoners wished for more lead for their work at Mr. Duff's iron-railing - I gave them 2 cwt. - it was in their care; I told Callarn to fetch it from the cellar - I think it was on the 8th; it was lead of this description.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Point out the marks? A. Here is the mark where it has been broken with a chisel - other people may use a chisel, but this fits our chisel; I know this lead from the corresponding pieces, which I produce; I know it from the chisel marks, and from its substance and quality, being the same as some left behind.</p>

            . I live at Poplar. The prisoner were employed by Mr. Fulham, to fasten some railings of mine with lead; I did not notice the lead - they had a place in my yard to put it into. The officer came to me the day after they were taken, and the lead in the tool-house appeared diminished in quantity.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot be positive any was gone? A. It was my opinion that some was.</p>

            . I was with Fogg; we were standing at the end of Petticoat-lane; the prisoners came by with each a load; we followed, and asked what they had got; they said tools: Fogg said it felt like lead - White said "We have brought it from Poplar, where we have been fitting up iron-rails," and that they were going to Golden-lane - we took them to a public-house; White said he had been working at Duff's, and the other was his man, and had been with him about six months; Fogg asked where he got it - he at first said he bought it at an old iron-shop. I stated that to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the man give his address? A. One took out his pocket-book to give Fogg his address - whether he did so I do not know.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were they going towards Golden-lane? A. Yes, but Brick-lane would have been their nearest way from Poplar.</p>

            . They should have left the lead at Mr. Duff's, if they did not want it, as there was a good deal more work to do; Callarn was in the service before I came - I have been there six months.</p>

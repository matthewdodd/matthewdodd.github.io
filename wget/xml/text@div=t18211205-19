            . I live in the parish of Wilsden. On the 25th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went out and left nobody in the house - I took the key with me, and returned at four o'clock, and found the casement window taken out of the back of the house, the coulter of a plough laid by the window, and the shutters open - I tried the key to the front door, and found it was bolted; I had come out at the front door, and locked it - the inside shutters were forced open; I saw marks of the coulter on them, the window is about one yard from the ground, they got into the house through the window, I had left it secure, the casement is lead and nailed in. The coulter belongs to Mr. Denow's plough. On going in I missed a great coat, a close bodied coat, a pair of breeches, and other articles, besides 13 s. 6 d., in money - there was marks of a man's foot about the house, I could not distinguish them to be more than the marks of one person. On Monday the 29th, I caught the prisoner with my coat on at Paddington, opposite the Coach and Horses, public-house, I followed him into the King and Queen, public-house, and got Humphries to take him - he took the coat off when he got into the public-house, it was worth 9 s.; it cost me 18 s., all the things together are worth 3 l.</p>
               <p>(Coat produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you say you found the coat on me - A. He was wearing it, but when the officer took him it was in the room - he said at the office he bought it of a Jew for 7 s.; when I charged him with it, he took it off and gave it to another man, who took it into the stable, but afterwards gave it us back.</p>

            . I am an officer. White applied to me to take the prisoner at the King and Queen, public-house, at Paddington - I asked him where the coat was, he said "What coat, I know nothing about a coat;" I said you must come with me, I took him down the stable yard, and found the coat on a man's arm, who said in his presence that he gave it him to sell, the prisoner heard him, but made no answer - I asked if that was the coat he had on, he said it was, afterwards he told me he bought it in Oxford-street of a Jew - this was twenty minutes after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You told the young man he ought to be taken in custody himself - A. Yes.</p>

            . I live at Wilsden. I know Wight's house, and I know Mr. Denow's. On the 25th of October, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner sitting on the beam of his plough - I am sure he is the man, he was knocking the wedges out of the coulter, as if he wanted to get the coulter out; the plough was about forty yards from Wight's house - I did not speak to him, I am sure of his person; I saw him in custody on the Wednesday following. He was about ten yards from me.</p>

            . I was going out of my door, and driving two cows out of my neighbour's garden, about half-past three o'clock on Thursday, and as I came back, I saw the prisoner go away with the clothes on his arm - he was coming across a small field in a direction from Wight's house, he turned round and looked at me now and then - I have no doubt of his person, he had them all wrapped up together, and a white coat on the top of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said at Marlborough-street that you was one hundred yards off and would not swear to me - A. I did not say I could not swear to him - I said he was about his height, I was about one hundred yards from him.</p>

I go on the canal with a boat, and about ten o'clock on Saturday night our boats were at Pickford's wharf, I went to see for my sister who lives at the Red Lion, public-house, and at the Coach and Horses, public-house, a young man was there with the coat on, we went to the King and Queen, public-house, he told me to put the coat on - I pulled it off in the room, and gave it him.</p>

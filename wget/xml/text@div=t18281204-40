On the 13th of November I lost a quadrant from a glass-case, about five yards within my door; I was ill, lying on a sofa - the butcher's boy cried out, "They have stolen a sextant:" I went to the shop, and missed it. I have seen the prisoners in the road together - I received the quadrant about half an hour afterwards.</p>

            . On the day the quadrant was taken I saw the two prisoners near the prosecutor's, looking in at the window - I saw them together about three minutes; I was on the other side of the street: I did not see either of them do any thing, but in a few minutes I saw another lad come out of the shop with something under his jacket; the wind blew up the jacket, and I saw the bright brass of some instrument; I did not see the three together at that time, but I had before - when I looked at them Brown came to our shop, and wanted half a pound of beef-sleaks; I pushed him out of the shop, and called my master: I then called to the prosecutor, "They have taken a sextant;" the two prisoners then called out "Brush," and the other one ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did these two lads run away? A. No, they came for the steaks; they both cried "Brush" -I never said they came for the steaks before he took the instrument, he was crossing the road at the time, and he ran off.</p>

About 3 o'clock on Wednesday night, 2nd August, I was on duty in Essex Street, near the bridge over the Regent's Canal—I heard a splashing noise in the water and a moaning which attracted my attention—I looked into the water and saw the figure of a female; I then sprang my rattle and went on to the towing-path; the woman was about sinking—I jumped into the water and succeeded in bringing her to the side of the canal—a gentleman came to my assistance and helped me lift her out of the water—she was insensible—I sent for a doctor, and with help she was carried to his surgery—she recovered in about three quarters of an hour—I asked her how she came into the water—she said it was through trouble, no one knew her troubles but herself—she said her husband had deserted her—I got a cab and took her to the workhouse at Highgate—she afterwards made this statement before the Magistrate. (<hi rend="italic">Read: "</hi> I did it because I was sick of my life. My husband deserted me and I have been in misery and suffered so much that I would rather die than go through the same again.")</p>

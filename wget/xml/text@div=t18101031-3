            . Q. Do you know the two prisoners at the bar - A. Yes, very well. I was in the habit of frequently seeing them between the months of March and August. I have heard Cope complain that he has not had his blanks to finish, I have frequently seen blanks given to him to be finished, they required colouring; colouring gives them the appearance of silver. I saw him on the 22d of August, and I saw him on the Saturday night, his hands were of a green cast. I also know Mrs. Slater, she lived with Cope as his wife, and I have heard her complain of Butts not letting her have blanks to go on with; and that she was obliged to work harder sometimes than others. I saw her on that Saturday afternoon in Banner-street, and at the City of Chester, her hands were in the same state as his</p>

               <p>Q. During the time that they have been there were you annoyed by any smell - A. I was annoyed by a smell I could not ascertain from where it came, I have seen them go up stairs, and heard the door locked after they got in the room; that was the usual practice. On the Saturday before they were taken up they were at home fighting in the evening, I called Mrs. Quin, to come to them; Mrs. Quin, went up stairs, she could not get in for a few minutes, at last she was let in.</p>

            . On the 22d of August, I went to the lodgings of Cope, at Mrs. Quin's house with Mason, Vickrey and my son. I went to the front garret they were not at home, the door was locked, and finding nobody answered, we clapped our feet against it and opened it. I saw Vickrey take some money out of the drawer; he delivered it to me. This is one sixpence that was in paper that was given me by Vickrey, I have kept ever since. I am sure that is one that was found at Cope's, this is the one that I tried with the cutter, I searched him when he was apprehended, I found nothing but good money on him. We took them up at the corner of the Lying-in-hospital, Old-street-road, then I took them home to that room, and took them in there with Mrs. Quin, she called them by the name of Williams.</p>

            . Q. You went to Cope's lodgings - A. I did. In a chest of drawers I found the money which I gave to Armstrong in a tub in the same room, was a number of cloths stained green, I have no doubt they had been used to clean the money; I have no doubt it was aquafortis, and on the floor were a number of filings; in the same room was a table, and on it the same sort of green marks as the cloths; in a crevise of the table there was some white stuff; I took my knife and took some out and tasted it, I have no doubt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310006"></xptr>it was cream of tartar, there is some silver, and them plates were found in the room. The aquafortis and cream of tartar are to bring the silver upon the surface of the metal, the colour is produced by the application of them things; I have apprehended persons of of this description before, and I have found the same sort of things. I was in company with the officers at the time they apprehended Cope; Slater parted from Cope; and went the other side of the way; I brought her back; she put her hands behind her against the wall, I took from her this bag, here are stains of green which I have no doubt were produced by her wet hands; this bag contains two hundred and thirteen counterfeit sixpences, they have all been coloured; there may be an exception of one that is not fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that sixpence at Cope's - A. It is impossible to say I found it; I can only say what money I found I gave to Armstrong.</p>

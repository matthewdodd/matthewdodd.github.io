                  </hi>. I am a farmer, at En field. The prisoner is a straw carter, and lives about three quarters of a mile from me—on Sunday evening the 23rd of April, between the hours of eight and eleven o'clock I missed some hay from the stack which had been cut up—I had a man watching all night—the next morning I observed some marks—there was nearly two trusses and a half of hay missing—I traced footmarks across my field towards Turkey-street, where the prisoner lived—I traced them up to the back of his premises—the hay was carried, across four or five fields, and over two or three hedges—I traced the hay where he had pot it over the hedges, and the constables found some hay—it is very like ours—I cannot swear to it—it agrees with mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Coell. On Sunday night, the 23rd of April, I had cut the hay and left it there—it was not tied in trusses—it was on the stump of the stack—there were five cuts began, and my master told me to watch it—I came down in the evening, between seven and eight o'clock, and then my master told me I might go back till half-past ten o'clock, as he should not be in bed before eleven o'clock—I came back a few minutes before eleven o'clock—I looked at the stack, and saw the hay was gone off—I went through the gate, and could not see any hay about the ground—I went and told Mr. Coell—he came with me, and found it was gone—I remained there the rest of the night—in the morning, about five o'clock, I traced it down the lane, from the stack to the first little gate, and across four fields, where there was no footpath—I came back and called Mr. Coell—he went with me, and saw where it had been carried, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> over the gate—he sent me for the constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many houses are there near the prisoner's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are above twenty houses in Turkey-street; between twenty and forty—there is a sample of hay here—I am a farmer's man—it is a com<lb></lb>mon hay about the country—there were the footsteps of two different persons—the prisoner's father does not live far distant—the stable where the horse stands, I believe, belongs to his father.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. I was sent for on Monday morning, the 24th—I and Watkins traced the hay over the fence, out of the stack-yard,</p>

               <p>a little way down the road, then over a gate across some fields, direct away to the prisoner's back door—I found three parts of a truss in the prisoner's cart-shed—I believe it is—I never knew to the contrary—his cart and horse were there—I have been constable of Enfield about eighteen years—I know of his occupying this stable—I traced some foot<lb></lb>marks from out of the road across the fields—when I took the prisoner, he wanted to change his shoes—I took them when he pulled them off his feet, and I fitted them to the marks in the fields, in thirty or forty places—they tallied in all respects—they are rights and lefts—the right-footed shoe has got half the tip off on one side, and the left is whole—these are the marks I traced, and they corresponded in all respects in fifty places, I may say—I compared the hay with that in the stack—my opinion is that it came from the stack.</p>

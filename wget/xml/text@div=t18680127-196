                  </hi>. I live at 4, Hot Water Court, Golden Lane—I am the wife of Edward Phelps—on Sunday, 12th January, between twelve and two in the morning, as I was in bed with my three children, I heard knocking at the door—I got up and opened it—two men were there, who said they wanted lodgings—I said I had only lodging enough for myself and children—Michael Ryan struck me on the jaw, which almost made me senseless—I was so startled I couldn't see what he had in his hand—William Ryan stabbed me with a knife in the chest, and said he meant to do for some of us that night—I was not dressed—the wound bled very much, and I went to a doctor, who dressed it—some people came up, and the prisoners were removed—I went to bed again—a short time after I heard another noise, and the door was burst in—I slipped my frock on again, got out at the other door, and cried, "Police!" "Murder!" an officer came and took William Ryan into custody.</p>

On the 8th of December I missed a silk handkerchief, and on the following Saturday I missed two more - I charged my son with taking them, and in consequence of what he said I went to the prisoner's house; I told her my boy had informed me he had brought her three silk handkerchiefs, which she had purchased at different times, and given him to the amount of 4s. for - she said,"Not me, I am sure;" I said the boy had informed me she had, and they were not mine - I must have to pay for them if I could not get them; she then said she had sold them to somestrange young men, whom she never saw before, and I could not have them - I went away, and inquired for Mr. Bright; the prisoner followed me, and said, "This is where my father lives;" she asked Mr. Bright if he remembered the handkerchief she had sold to the strange young man; he said he remembered nothing of it - I told him I had lost the handkerchief; he said he knew nothing at all of them: I then took my son to the prisoner's house - she said she had purchased them of him, given him 4s. for them, and he had told her he had found them; I took the boy to the officer, and the prisoner was taken: the handkerchiefs are here - the marks have been picked out of two of them, and the other, I think, is marked G. S. E.; I lost such a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How old is your son? A.

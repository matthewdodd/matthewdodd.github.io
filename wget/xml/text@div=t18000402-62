I staid up later than usual on account of a suspicious noise that I had heard in the house; I had seen all the doors and windows fastened, I heard no noise after I went to bed, I was not the first up in the morning. I saw the yard and premises at twelve o'clock for the last time, while in the yard I heard St. Paul's clock strike twelve; I looked into the back shop and saw leather lying in various directions at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the back shop a part of your house? - A. No; I also saw a blue coat hanging on a nail; I shut the shop-door, looked at the back-door, which opens into Alfred-buildings, it was locked and barred with iron, and stapled in; I then came in, and went into the kitchen for a few minutes, and then into the parlour, we have a communication from that parlour to the back shop; while I was in the parlour, I heard a noise, which appeared to me to he either in the back shop, or the yard, which is altogether; the back shop opens into the yard and into the parlour too; for the moment I was much alarmed, and immediately went to the kitchen; as soon as I came into the kitchen, I observed a man looking down the kitchen area, in the front of the Row, it is a very private place; I expressed my alarm to the maid servant, and immediately locked myself in the kitchen, and staid there till near two o'clock; at length I saw no person in front of the Row, I went up stairs into my own bed-room, and looked out at the window which looks over the back yard and premises, hoping I might discover what the alarm had been, I did not observe any body; then I looked at Mr. Ellis's watch, it was ten minutes past two; I went to take my own watch to wind up; I looked out at the window, and heard voices distinctly, in low conversation, it appeared to me to he in Alfred-buildings, which is at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020059"></xptr>back of our premises; after listening for some time I thought they were gone, and I went to bed.</p>

               <p>Q.This shop is a continuation of buildings? - A. It is, from the front to the back, it leaves room for a passage and stair-case, it is enclosed at the end of the premises chiefly by buildings, and a wall ten feet high.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there an immediate communication between your back shop and the house? - A.Immediately from the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q.Is there a communication between the front and the back shop? - A. Yes, through the parlour; there is a glass light between, with a door, but the door is never opened; it is all inclosed with a brick wall, and buildings, which incloses the whole; there is a door out of the back shop into the yard; I shut that door, and latched it, but I cannot say that I locked it; the door that leads into Alfred-buildings was locked and barred with iron.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you think you had got a good bargain? - A.

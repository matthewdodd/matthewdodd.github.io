On 24th Sept., about 11 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in the police-galley, off Woolwich—the ship <hi rend="italic">Sophia</hi> was lying alongside the Dock-yard—I saw the prisoner getting over the side of the ship, into a barge—he had one leg over the side, and I saw two lumps of tobacco under his arm—I was about ten or twelve yards from the vessel—my men rowed towards the ship, and when the prisoner saw us he took his leg off the gunwale, and ran back into the forecastle—he belonged to the barge which was alongside—I sent Young and Atherway down into the forecastle—Atherway brought up some tobacco—I then went down, and found the prisoner there—I asked him where he had got the tobacco from, and he said one of the seamen gave it him—the <hi rend="italic">Sophia</hi> had just returned from the Expedition in search of Sir John Franklin, and this tobacco was part of the stores, which the prisoner had been employed to take to Deptford Victualling-yard—I asked the prisoner who the sailor was, who had given it to him—he said he could not tell—I afterwards saw a box of tobacco in the hold, the lid of which had been broken, and a portion taken out—I took the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames policeman,</hi> 82). I was on duty with inspector Hull, and saw the prisoner, with one leg over the side of the <hi rend="italic">Sophia,</hi> getting into a barge alongside—he had a quantity of tobacco under his arm, and when he saw us he dropped it into a bucket on the deck, and took the bucket with him down to the forecastle—before he went, he took up another bucket, and pretended to be drawing some water into it, but he left that one on deck—we were about twelve yards from the side of the vessel at the time; he could see us coming—I went on board, went into the forecastle, and saw the prisoner sitting on one of the seamen's chests—there was also one seaman, named Gordon—there were other sailors, but not on that part of the ship—I asked the prisoner for the tobacco I had seen under his arm while on deck—he said he had not had any—I asked him where his chest was, thinking him to be a seaman of the ship—he said he had no chest; he belonged to the barge alongside—I asked him to get off the chest he was sitting on—he did so, and in a bed-berth immediately behind him I found these two pieces of tobacco (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they weigh rather more than 13lbs.—I told him that was the tobacco I had seen under his arm while on deck—he said nothing to that—Gordon said he had seen him fetch it down in a bucket, and throw it into the bed-berth—the prisoner said nothing to that—I saw Atherway search the prisoner, and saw him find this small bundle of tobacco between his shirt and skin—he said one of the seamen had given it him—about three yards from where he was sitting there was a box of tobacco, covered over with a loose cloth—a piece of canvas had been nailed over it, and that was cut—the tobacco there was Cavendish, the same kind as this.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames policeman,</hi> 24). I have heard the statement of the two last witnesses—it is correct—the <hi rend="italic">Shipey</hi> Government barge was alongside, she was taking in the returned stores of the <hi rend="italic">Sophia</hi>—the prisoner has belonged to that barge nine years—the captain of the barge was on the <hi rend="italic">Sophia,</hi> and there were two men and a lad on the barge.</p>

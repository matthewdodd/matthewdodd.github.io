                  </hi>. I am a fishing tackle maker—I live in Oxford-street, and have another shop—the prisoner was in my service as errand-boy for about twelve months. On the evening of the 13th of Nov., from information, I spoke to the prisoner—I told him I was fearful he had been robbing me for some time—I told him if he had, it would be better to tell me, for I was determined to find it out—I did not at all tell him it would be better for him to tell me, only that I was determined to find it out—he denied it very strongly for a length of time, and at last, in consequence of my telling him I was determined to find it out, he told me that all he had taken from me I should find at his mother's—I called in a policeman, and gave him into custody—I went with the policeman to Ryder's-court, Leicester-square, where the prisoner's mother lives, and found a quantity of fishing-tackle in a box there—this is it—it is my property—these two pocket-books have my name and address in them, and the shop mark has been torn away—it is not at all likely that I bad sold these, and the prisoner told me ho had taken them.</p>

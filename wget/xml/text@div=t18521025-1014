About six weeks ago I gave my daughter two half sovereigns, and five sovereigns—I weighed the half sovereigns before I gave them to her—they were good—on the 7th Oct. I was called into my shop—my daughter gave me what appeared a half sovereign—I found it was bad—I got a policeman, and went to the Wagon and Horses—I saw the prisoner there, and two men—they were all three taken in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). I am entirely innocent, and by a careful investigation of the witnesses it will be fully proved; Ellen Bond stated at the Police-court, on being cross-examined, that the half sovereign now produced might have been the same that she gave to the prisoner in change, and she did not see the prisoner change the one she gave her; she had the two half sovereigns by her a month or upwards, and where she deposited them any person in the house could have changed them, as she never kept her drawers locked, and when her father gave her the two half sovereigns she never examined them, and cannot say whether they were good or bad; Mr. Bond stated the two half sovereigns he gave his daughter were both good; he gave them to her about four or five weeks ago, and his daughter's drawers and boxes were always kept locked, and no one in the house could have any access to them; this statement of Mr. Bond differs entirely with the last witness, his daughter, who stated that her drawers where she kept her money were not locked, and any one in the house could have gained an easy access to them; it is plain and evident that the whole of the case rests upon the evidence of Mr. Bond, and his statement is nothing more than suppo<lb></lb>sition; it is impossible for him to swear the half sovereign now produced was changed by the prisoner for one of those he gave his daughter four or five weeks back, as he was not in the shop at the time, and saw nothing that transpired between the prisoner and his daughter, and Ellen Bond likewise says she did not see the prisoner change the half sovereign she gave her, but acknowledged at the Police-court that there was a bad half sovereign in the shop in a box where they keep their scales behind the counter, and the other witnesses, Miss Goldsburgh and the policeman, saw nothing of the occurrence; I certainly did not know the half sovereign was a bad one, and should have taken it bad not the witness Ellen Bond offered me another one, while she was examining it on the counter.</p>

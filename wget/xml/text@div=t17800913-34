On the 1st of July I met Mr. Hart in Cheapside and asked him to go with me to the Swan-with-two-necks. I said I had some money to receive from an aunt of mine from Norwich; he went with me; we were going up the yard; there lay several bags on the ground; I had like to have tumbled over them. I said to Hart there is something lies here; I picked it up immediately and gave it him into his hand. He said it belonged to one of the coaches he supposed; he would go and carry them to the book-house; the coachman laid hold of him as he was going up the yard.</p>
               <p>Did he call any body? - No; he went straight up, and the coachman laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>When you went into the yard did you call out to any body or any coach? - No; I was going to the book-house.</p>

               <p>You had business there, why did not you call out for any body? - I asked for the coachman; they said I could not see him that night, I must call the next day, that was after the prisoner was laid hold of.</p>
               <p>To Brown. Can you be certain whether in carrying out a number of things to the coach you might not have carried out these bags and dropped them in the yard? - I had not carried any thing out of the warehouse at that time.</p>
               <p>To Gray. You went to receive money, how much? - Two guineas; my cousin came the next week and brought it.</p>

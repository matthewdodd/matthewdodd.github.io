               <persName id="t18060917-93-person846">Barnard</persName>
             the room, when he came out of the room he said shall I leave this parcel here, I said he might, he laid it on a table and came out; I locked the door and put the key in my pocket; Davis not coming to the time to look at the room, I forgot the parcel; in the evening the prisoner and his wife came, asked for a lodging, a great many people were in my shop, I opened the door, gave him the bundle, and came away; I knew the parcel was there when he and the woman went in.</p>
               <p>Davis. On the following day after I had delivered the knives and forks to Barnard, I went into the Spread Eagle, I saw the prisoner at the bar there with a handkerchief that I well knew, I asked him to let me look at it, as I thought I knew the handkerchief, he told me he would not let me look at it, nor no one else, he had just bought it and gave half a crown for it; I called the landlord, I asked him it he ever saw that handkerchief, I told him that was the handkerchief I had delivered into his hands at three o'clock in the morning, till I found Barnard; he knew it directly, he said that was the handkerchief; I got away the handkerchief from the prisoner, it contained ten knives and eleven forks, I am sure they are my property; I had him apprehended, on the following day.</p>

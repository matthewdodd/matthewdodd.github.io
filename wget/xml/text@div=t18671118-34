Morley, ware-housemen, of Cheapside—on 1st November, about a quarter to ten o'clock, I was at a fire at Bishopsgate Street—the prisoner stood on my left hand—I felt my chain being pulled, I put down my hand, and caught the prisoner by the wrist; he was just withdrawing his hand from my waist<lb></lb>coat with my chain in it—my watch was gone—I saw it at the station—I said to my friend, "This man has my watch n—the prisoner said, "I have not got it, that man over there has it"—I looked to my right and saw a man going through the crowd who looked at me several times—my watch was quite separate from my chain when I saw part of my chain in the prisoner's hand—my watch was worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

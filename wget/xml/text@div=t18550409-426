               <p>On Friday, 26th March, the prisoner came with four or five others—he had a military great coat on—they had something to drink—the prisoner paid me a sixpence—I saw it was bad—I did not tell him so—I bent it up and put it into the fire—he did not see that, for it was after he was gone—I had given him change and thought it was good—he had not crossed the road before I found it was bad—I am sure the sixpence was bad—it all run to dross on the ashes.</p>

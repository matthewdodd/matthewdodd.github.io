Henry Clarke was in my service in July last - I know Samuel, and he knew Henry was in my employ. In consequence of information, on the 7th of July, I got Chamberlain, the constable, to go with a warrant to Wild-street, where Henry Clarke lodged; I saw his wife, whom I knew - I then went to his father's house, to make inquiries; Samuel is a <rs id="t18260914-274-deflabel1559" type="occupation">twister</rs>

I was shewn some silk and some worsted, dyed; there were two hundred and fifty-seven bobbins of silk; I cannot tell the weight of silk on them, but 45l. is the value, speaking under the mark - there were thirty-three bobbins with silk and worsted, and one hundred and seventy-four empty bobbins, worth, perhaps, 10s. - there is my stamp on them, but a number of the marks are defaced<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140119"></xptr>- Samuel Clarke was in the house during the time I examined the property - he did not give any account of it, nor say any thing about it; neither his father, nor any part of his family had the means of being lawfully possessed of these goods.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. The house you searched was the father's? A. Yes; Samuel lives and works there; I will not swear the silk was mine; they have learned the weaving trade, and must use such sort of silk as this; his father have had silk of me; he might have been in possession of my bobbins, and wound other people's silk on them; if I had found empty bobbins I should not have ventured to affirm they were stolen. The father has not bought twelve bobbins of silk of me in twelve months; the silk I die is peculiarly fine, Italian tram, not usually kept; there may be then or twelve houses in London where it might be bought.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Does Samuel lodge in that house? A. I believe he does; his father never dealt with me in my life, to a tenth part of the extent of this property - I believe, from the nature of it, it is mine, and that I had not sold it to the father.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there any thing to convince you that this silk had not been sold off your premises? A. I know I have lost property. I was not present when the young man said he could not account for it in the absence of his father. I have sold to Henry, but not more than once in twelve months - that was what is called gut coarse worsted or yarn.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Have you ever sold to Henry, for himself, or for Samuel, or for the father, such property as you found? A. He has bought silk, but never such a quantity as we found there. I have sold silk to Henry, for the father, but very little.</p>

            . I went to Wild-court, to the house where the father lives - I found Samuel Clarke up stairs, his mother and the children; I told him I had a warrant to search his premises - he said, very well, I was very welcome; he went up stairs, through a trap-door, to a very long workshop; Mr. Robertson went first, Samuel Clarke followed him, and I went behind; I turned on my right hand, and in the corner of the window I found bobbins, with cotton or worsted on them; they had Mr. Morris' name on them; they were not concealed, but quite open. Mr. Robertson identified them; Mr. Morris was not there - Mr. Robertson said, "Who has got the key of this desk?" Samuel said, "I have;" in that desk several bobbins of silk were found; Mr. Robertson said, "How came you by these;" he said he did not know - we then went to the other end of the room, and found some bobbins of cotton in a basket, which was behind a butter-flat- we collected together all the property which Mr. Robertson thought he came to search for; some was found up stairs and some below - the desk was on the right-hand in the work-shop; we came down to a little room on the first floor - Samuel unlocked it - I suppose he got the key out of his pocket; we found some of the property in some drawers, and all that Mr. Robertson identified as Mr. Morris' property was put into a bag - before we had done searching the little room Mr. Morris came - he said, in the presence of Samuel, that it was his property - I cannot say whether Samuel made any answer; Edward, another brother, came while I was there; he asked if I had been below - I said No; he said, "I dare say there is a cart load below - it is a bad job;" Samuel did not say any thing to this. Samuel was then taken to the watch-house - Henry was there before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know the father is a weaver and twister? A. I do not know it. The property was in the work-shop and store-room; Samuel said he did not know how it came there - he was not at work - he was at dinner. I said at Bow-street that Edward said it was a bad job - he did not say we were all wrong.</p>
               <p>The witness's deposition being read, stated, "Edward Clarke said it was all wrong, and there was a cart load down stairs."</p>

            . I was in the employ of Mr. Morris, and know his mark - I left his employ about two years and three months ago. I accompanied the officer in this search, and picked out what property I supposed to be Mr. Morris' - I should think the value is 8l. or 10l. Edward Clarke came in, and he said it was a bad job, and if we went down stairs we should find a cart load - that was in the hearing of Samuel - the silk is in such a state as it would be if it had been sold, but the worsted is not; we find that bobbins do sometimes change hands, and the property of A may become the property of B, but it is not usual to erase the mark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you find some of these bobbins marked I K? A. Yes; I do not know how many; there are some of other persons'; I did not take every bit of silk round a bobbin of Mr. Morris's, to be Mr. Morris's silk, because I knew the prisoner had bought silk of Mr. Morris; I could not distinguish which, but the officer took away that which had his mark on it; I know his father is a twister, and has had his sons taught weaving; I have employed them myself; the goods there found were such as weavers would use.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said the silk was mostly in the state it would be if it was sold? A. Yes; but some of it has been used; here is one which had not been sold, because it has the winder's note on the top - but it is ready to be sold; I should think, from finding other letters on a bobbin, it was merely to obliterate the former letters - but if a person of that name had bought these bobbins, and chose to keep them, he might put his I. K. upon them, and then they might pass to other hands.</p>

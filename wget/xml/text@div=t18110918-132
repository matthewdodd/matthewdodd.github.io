               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. A working woman, as far as I know, she lodged in the same house. On Monday the 16th instant, about twenty minutes past four o'clock I went out leaving the prisoner in my room; I returned at six, and finding my door locked, and as she said she had been unwell, I thinking that she had gone to get something for herself I waited with impatience betwixt hope and dispair; the prisoner not returning I sent for a smith, he

               <p>Q. What had gone with your key - A. The keys of my door and my trunk were found upon the prisoner. On my opening the trunk, I found my property was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any property found upon her. - A. All my property was found upon her except my cloak and my shoes.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180052"></xptr>office. On the 16th, about one o'clock at night, I was standing near the Broad-way, Westminster; the prisoner came by with a bundle under her arm, I asked her what she had got there, she said it was nothing to me; I told her I was an officer and I insisted upon seeing. I took her to the watchhouse, I searched her pocket, found these spoons, and a cream jug; two silver table-spoons, and three silver tea-spoons, a nutmeg-grater, two keys and a thread-case; a one pound note, two dollars, four shillings and some halfpence. I opened the bundle and found all these things, she said it was her own; she had taken them out of pawn, in Compton-street, Soho. I asked her what she did down at that part at that late hour of the night; she said she had been to see a cousen, at Pimlico. I told her I was not satisfied, I should lock her up for the night. I took her before the Magistrate, he desired that I would give the pound note and the dollars to the prisoner; I told the Magistrate one of the dollars was marked, some person might claim it. I gave her the note back, four shillings and the halfpence. I kept the two dollars. She stated to the Magistrate that she bought the dimity at a shop at the corner of Bow-street. I advertised it in the paper, and the prosecutrix came forward and owned all the property. I found this hat and gown on her person when the prosecutrix came forward.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The spoons are mine, and the milk-pot. This is the key of my trunk, and this is the key of my padlock, every thing here is mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witness to her character.</p>

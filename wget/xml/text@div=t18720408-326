I am single, and live at 37, St. "Paul's Road, Camden Town—on 22nd February, I fastened up the house as usual—I was in the garden after 12 o'clock, and I fastened the house up when I came in—I was afterwards disturbed by a noise in my bedroom—I heard something drop—I concluded it was some lodgers in the house—I sat up in bed listening for sometime, and heard no more—when I got up in the morning I found the house had been entered and was in confusion—I found a bar of the pantry window was wrenched off where the entrance had been made—one was removed, and then a person could get in—the glass of the window was not broken; the window had been thrown up—three drawers had been emptied on the dining table, and I missed a great many small articles—this is my dress—I missed that—my purse was in the pocket—my keys were taken out, and left behind—this chain, eye-glass, and photograph are mine—I missed them.</p>

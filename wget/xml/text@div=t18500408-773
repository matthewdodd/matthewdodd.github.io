                  </hi>. I live at 2, Duckett-street, Stepney, and was in charge of Mr. Methven's house, in Stepney-square—I left it safe on 12th March, between eight and nine o'clock—I locked the door behind me, and took the key in my pocket, I returned at half-past one, unlocked the door, and found the chain up—I got my head in, and saw the prisoners come down-stairs, undo the back door, and go into the yard—I went round to the back of the house, into Whitehorse-lane, and saw both prisoners come over the wall—I ran after Griffiths, and sent the policeman after him, who brought him back to me—he is the man—I went back, and found a bag of clothing in Mr. Methven's bedroom, ready to be taken away.</p>

Boody pointed out Griffiths to me—I ran after him to the top of Louisa-street, Mile-end-road, about a quarter of a mile—I caught him sitting down in a timber-yard there—I searched him, and found this double skeleton key in his pocket—he tried to prevent my taking it out, and said, "Take me to some private place"—I took him to Mr. Dixon's, who said he had had these things <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> over his wall (<hi rend="italic">producing some clothes tools, and a bag</hi>)—I there took this skeleton key from Griffiths' pocket—it opens Mr. Methven's door.</p>

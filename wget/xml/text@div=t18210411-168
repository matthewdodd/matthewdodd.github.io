            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On Monday, the 12th of March, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in Tottenham-court-road, with Davis, and saw the prisoners together, near Howland-street - Rushton appeared to have something under his jacket; I spoke to Davis to follow them, he did so; when I came up I found them in his custody; he gave me this cock. I shewed it to Patterson, who claimed it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in company with Smith, and followed the prisoners - it was about three hundred yards from Patterson's. I followed them down Howland-street, they turned down John-street, I got close to them, and laid hold of one with each hand - Ewing then had the cock under his jacket - he dropped it, and said he would never do so any more. I gave the cock to Smith. Rushton said he was employed by the other to go with him to the Cock, in Brook-street, and that the cock was laid in the area, so that they could reach it, and he was to have part when it was sold. Rushton afterwards stated that Ewing had lived at the Cock a few days previous, and he had put it there. I took them both into custody.</p>

             re-examined. I do not swear to the cock. I missed one about the size of this - I did not miss it till the officer brought it; I had used it a long time before; when the officers came I went into the cellar, and missed one. I had not seen it there for fourteen or fifteen weeks - I had not been down there. Ewing had been with me for a day or two.</p>

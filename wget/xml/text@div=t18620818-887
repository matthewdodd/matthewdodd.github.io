I am a shoemaker, living at 36, Queen-street, St. Luke's, Chelsea—on 25th July I closed my house at a few minutes past 10—I was awoke next morning about 5 or two or three minutes past, and when I came down, the back and front doors were both open—I missed five pairs of boots from the shop—these five pairs of boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were shown to me in, I should say, about twenty minutes afterwards—they are my property—the two prisoners and the boots were all brought to my shop within about twenty minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, at 14, Queen-street, Chelsea, nearly opposite the last witness—on the morning of 26th July I was up early, and my attention was attracted about five minutes before 5—I heard Byles's door unbolted, and saw Ennis come out—Williams was standing on the pavement about five yards away from the door—I said, "That is not right," and as I spoke, both prisoners ran away, and I ran after them—they turned the corner of the street, and I turned the other way to meet them in the next street, and they were coming full butt into my arms, and would have done so, but they ran into Swan Wharf, seeing me, and I saw them caught there—they were carrying boots when they were running—Ennis had, I think, three pairs, and Williams the others.</p>

I examined Mr. Byles's premises on the morning of 26th July, and found that the back kitchen-window had been forced open—the persons had gone through that window into the kitchen, up the kitchen-stairs, and broken the lock off the parlour-door, which was the shop-door, where the boots were taken from, and let them<lb></lb>selves out at the front-door—they had broken the box off the front-door.</p>

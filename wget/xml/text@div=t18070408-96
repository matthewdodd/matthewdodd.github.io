               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to your shop. - A. I do, on the 11th of February, between eight and nine in the morning; she came into the shop alone, as she had frequently done before; there was a girl waiting outside of the shop. I had frequently turned the prisoner away for bringing of bad money. She came that morning for a quarter of an ounce of thread, which came to a penny, I gave it her, she produced the sixpence which I have here; I gave her five pennyworth of halfpence in change; she then went out of the shop. In a few minutes after, the girl that was with her came into the shop, she produced a fellow sixpence to the one that I had taken; she wanted a quarter of an ounce of thread; I told her I thought the sixpence was bad, I returned her the sixpence she gave me, keeping the other. She went away. After shewing both the sixpences to one of the partners, I went out of the shop on purpose to follow them. I saw Mr. Browning, an assistant in the shop, he went in pursuit of them; I have had it ever since (producing it).</p>
               <p>- BROWNING. Q. You also assist in this shop of Messrs. Wells and Fisher. - A. I do; I pursued the prisoner, I had seen the girl in the shop, I afterwards saw the girl join in company with the prisoner. I followed them down Fetter-lane till they came to Hatton-garden; the girl went into a shop and offered a bad sixpence; I went for an officer, and while I was gone the girl made her escape. When I came back the officer took the prisoner in custody.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner. I asked her what she had got in her left hand, she said nothing; I unclenched her hand; in it I found this sixpence, which I produce; she had eight pence in her pocket, and four or five small quantities of thread; she denied knowing the girl, and ever having been in prison before.</p>

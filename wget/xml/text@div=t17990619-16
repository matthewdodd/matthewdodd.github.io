Last Saturday, the 15th of June, I went out about ten o'clock among my customers, and I told one of my servants to pour off six hundred weight of tin bar; upon which, when I came home, the man said, he was short; the prisoner was not by; the man said, there was six pounds missing; I asked, where is Longstaffe? says he, he is just gone out; I sent after him, and he was brought back from where he was, and he came into the yard; I said to him, Longstaffe, I have suspected you a long time, I miss some metal, and I think you have got it; I missed about five pounds and a half of tin bar; upon which he was walking off again, I followed him just round the accompting-house; he wore a pair of trowsers and an apron;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190017"></xptr>says I, stop, I will see whether you have got it about you; he took up his apron, says he, I have got the metal; upon which, I saw the end of this bar sticking out of his breeches, wrapped up in brown paper, upon which, I sent for an officer, who took them out; he wanted to take them out himself, but I told him to stop; it is poured in a mould; it weighed five pounds and a half, what was taken from him; it costs ninety-seven shillings a hundred, about ten-pence halfpenny a pound; I value it at four shillings, and I am satisfied it was mine.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You can take upon yourself to swear it was your property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear it, from the circumstance that but few persons had such metal as you had? - A. Not above three make it.</p>
               <p>Q. If there are two or three in the trade who make such sort of property, and cast it in moulds, I should like to know how you can distinguish that to be your's? - A. Every man's moulds differ.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear, that round about this great town there may not be moulds of the same dimensions? - A. There are not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that? - A. Yes, positively.</p>
               <p>Q. However, two or three persons might have such bars as these? - A. No, no person.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying there were two or three persons having such moulds? - A. There might be persons having bar moulds, but mine is smaller than their's.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other people who make tin bars? - A. I believe there are two or three more.</p>
               <p>Q. They may have such moulds, may they not? - A. I don't think there are such moulds in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear they may not have such? - A. There are not, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there are not? - A. I have not their moulds into my moulds; that is all I know of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. But we are to try whether you are right? - A. I don't come here with any evil design; I have a number of men about me, and I am bound to do this.</p>
               <p>Q. If other persons, three or four in the trade, deal in the article you deal in, they may have moulds that you have not seen, though you may swear they are your's - I want you to satisfy the Jury, why you are enabled to swear to this particular mould? - A. There is not another mould in the trade that this bar would sit.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the other moulds in order to form that conclusion; because there are but few in number, have you seen their moulds in order so to judge, whether they are different from your's? - A. We have only one mould maker, and I had mine made in a particular manner.</p>
               <p>Q.Does he make moulds for other people? - A. He may.</p>
               <p>Q.Don't you know he works for other persons? - A. I can say it was poured into my mould, and that is enough.</p>
               <p>Q. You shall give an answer whether he is employed by other persons? - A. I am not certain whether they were not made under my own roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear they were? - A. I believe they were cast by Mr. Horseley, somewhere at Hoxton; if I made a pattern, and sent it to Mr. Horseley, and said, make me a mould to that pattern, he would do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see another pattern of the same sort and dimensions? - A. No, I never did; they are cast a great deal larger.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that other persons, having occasion for light moulds, may not have had them cast? - A. If I was to talk till to-morrow morning, I can only say this was cast in my mould; and I have been a great sufferer.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Is there any mark upon your tin bar, your private mark? - A. No, there is no private mark; because, perhaps, in the course of a day, we pour three or four ton of bar.</p>
               <p>Q. He was off the premisses when he was stopped, and came back with the metal upon him? - A. He said, to me, I have got the metal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try the metal you took from him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the moulds in Court? - A. No; they are very heavy.</p>
               <p>Q.After you found this metal, did you fit it to the mould? - A. I did not; here is a salt-cellar that I can swear to be mine, it is cast in a mould that I have; he had it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not in the indictment.</p>

             sworn. - I know no more than this, that I run the metal and went to dinner, and when I came back again I was short five or six pounds, it was on a Saturday; I cannot say I should know the bars if I saw them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Do you or not know your own moulds-the size of them-don't you know the size of them? - A.No, I don't know the size of the moulds, we pour in the bars; the moulds hold about twelve bars.</p>
               <p>Q. From the size of the moulds can you not speak to the bars? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You weighed the whole six hundred weight, did you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned back, can you swear that this, which is said to be found on him, is the same metal you had weighed? - A. I cannot tell,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190018"></xptr>I did not see him take it out of the scale, I cannot say; it is the same sort of metal.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever seen such metal before? - A. Yes, in one other place.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not particular to your master to have such metal as that - any other person may have such metal as that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The same size? - A. Rather larger than this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see metal bars of the same size any where else? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those bars cast three or four together? - A.Every bar is cast separate.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was servant to Mr. Yates, to make regulus: Mr. Yates some time ago desired me to put some of this kind of tin into my composition, to make it better; last Saturday that ever was I went to work, Mr. Yates had very bad coals, I got one pot of doubles, but it turned out very bad, I could not get on very well, but I did get on single upon this tin; Mr. Yates told me to take any of this tin to put into the metal to bring it to a proper bearing, as I told you before; he told me to take it out of the shop when I wanted it; I took it with me because I would not leave it in my shop, for fear it should be taken away.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Yates.) Q. Did you give him leave? - A. My Lord it is not true; regulus consists of antimony and tin cuttings.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you give him any authority? - A. No; he had no business in the shop where it was, he worked in a separate building; a month or two ago, he said, I will take a little bit of tin, and put into the regulus, which he did, and says he it does better; I cannot say whether he put it in or not; however, he had no authority from me to take this.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Walker, a porter, of Newman-passage, Newman-street, Oxford-street; we have a truck which we let out for hire. On Monday evening, the 20th of March, I went to a beer-shop in Newman-passage, and saw Mortlock—I heard him ask somebody if there was a person of the name of Walker, who let out trucks—a person who stood by the side of me said, "Mrs. Walker you are wanted"—I turned round, and said, "What do you want?"—Mortlock said he wanted the hire of a truck—I told him my name was Walker, and asked what sort of a truck he wanted—he said, "Merely a small one"—I told him to go with me to where my trucks stood, in Rathbone-place—he went with me—I put my hand on a little green truck, and said, "Will this do!"-he said, "I think that will do"—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said, to carry a light bed—I asked where he was going to take it—he said, "To Mr. Line, No. 7, Rathbone-place"—nothing was said about what he was to give for it—there is a regular price, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour—he took it away with him—I never saw it again till the 18th of April, when it was at the station—I should not sell it for less than 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is my husband's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live in Bowling-street, Clerkenwell. I have known Williams five or six years—about the 14th or 15th of March he hired part of a cellar of me, in Twister's-alley, Bunhill-row—on the morning of the 21st of March I found a track in my yard, with two oil-jars alongside of it—I went up to breakfast, and about nine o'clock Williams came to me to take the truck and jars to the cellar—he told me he had brought the truck there—my wife told me something, and I saw him take it away—oil-jars are heavy things, and require a truck—I said it was a nice, handy, light truck, just such a one as I was in want of in my business—he said he be-lieved it was for sale—I asked to whom it belonged, and how much was wanted for it—he said it belonged to a party who had helped him down with the oil-jars—I asked what the party wanted for it—he said, "About 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "I shall see the party in Bunhill-row, to whom it belongs"—he asked me to accompany him, and also a man named Cox, to drag the track, which was in pieces at that time—we put it together, and went to Bunhill-row—he there pointed out a man, who I believe to be Mortlock, as the man who owned the truck—he went and spoke to him on the other side of the way, then came back to me, and Mortlock told me the truck was for sale—I asked him how much he wanted for it—he said, 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put the truck and jars into Wil-</p>

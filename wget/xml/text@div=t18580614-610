                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Mr. Bishop, of Highwood Hill, Hendon. On Sunday morning, 16th May, I counted my master's ewes and lambs; there were forty-seven ewes and fifty-eight lambs—I saw a lamb produced on Monday afternoon, covered with mud; Heavens pointed it out to me—it was my master's, and had been safe in the field the previous morning—there was no footpath in the field where the sheep were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Piggott. On Sunday, 16th May, I was in one of his fields; there was a field and two hedges between them and Mr. Bishop's field, in which there were some sheep and lambs—in the afternoon I saw two persons going up the field—I only know them by their dresses; Barrett has the same dress on, a velveteen coat, but I cannot swear to him—I saw Mr. Bishop's boy come running to them, they were then reaching under the hedge, but were not carrying anything—I did not notice what they did when the boy came to them, but some time after the boy was gone I saw the same two coming down with a lamb; one had hold of the fore and the other of the hind legs; they got over the hedge into Mr. Cox's field, and then into another, and when they came to a hedge the tallest was carrying the lamb in his arms, and when he saw me he threw it into a ditch—Barrett appears to be dressed the same—I saw him again on the same day.</p>

               <p>Theophile Negre. (<hi rend="italic">Through an Interpreter</hi>). I am a wine grower and dealer in wines and brandies, at 6, Cour de Chapeau rouge, Bordeaux—a customer of mine named Doussou acted as my clerk at Bordeaux—I know M. Bessome, the father of Challier's wife; he lives at Paris—through those two persons I was introduced to Challier by correspondence, and I appointed him by letter my agent in London for the whole of my wines—I was to pay him 10 per cent, on the sales—I received these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are in Challier's writing. (<hi rend="italic">These were partly translated by the Interpreter, and were orders to send wines of the first and second qualities to Challier</hi>) I afterwards sent him ninety-nine cases of wine and one of brandy by the English steamer <hi rend="italic">Lumley</hi>—this is a copy of the invoice for 1,038 francs. (<hi rend="italic">Other letters containing orders from Challier, and bills of lading relating to them, were here put in and translated in part</hi>). After that I sent 100 hogsheads of wine by the steamer <hi rend="italic">Henry Balker</hi>, and this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill of lading—I think the order for 100 cases of Medoc, amounting to 900 francs 50 centimes, was sent from Paris—this is a copy of the bill of lading—the letter is in Challier's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated London</hi>, 14<hi rend="italic">th January</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">signed by Challier, forwarding another order, and complaining that he did not like to sell thirty cases out of</hi> 100 <hi rend="italic">already sent, as the wine oozed out at the corks, and that in every bottle a piece of wood or straw was found.</hi>) This is the bill of lading, and this is the invoice (<hi rend="italic">For</hi> 977 <hi rend="italic">francs</hi>)—it was upon Guyot's orders that I sent goods to Challier—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Guyot's writing, but before I received that I had an interview with Challier at Bordeaux—an order was given to Doussou to send fifty-six hogsheads of wine to Guyot—that order was transferred to me, and I had a conversation with Challier about it, but I cannot recollect where—I had a conversation with I him at Bordeaux after the goods were sent, but not before—before that it was by correspondence. (<hi rend="italic">Several other letters and invoices and bills of lading in French were here put in.</hi>) I saw Challier in Bordeaux and also in London in March—I came to London, I think, in the second half of March, and saw him at Mr. Lechevin's office, and also at Guyot's office—I saw Challier and Guyot together every day while I was in London, and they both came to reside at my hotel at Charing Cross—I saw Lechevin there—when I came to London in March I had these two bills of exchange with me for 261<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 364<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The first was dated Bordeaux, 11th January</hi>, 1875. <hi rend="italic">It had three endorsements, and was accepted by A. Guyot. The second was dated 25th December</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">to M. Lechevin, and was endorsed "Bills renewed by other drafts.</hi>") The first of those bills represented 3,000 francs, being one quarter of the invoice, and the one for 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the other three-fourths of the invoice—the bill for 251<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 65. was the only form of payment for the fifty-one hogsheads sent to Guyot—that bill was current at the time of my visit to London in March—I had negotiated it while it was current, and it was subsequently returned to me unpaid—the two bills, the one I brought with me and this one, represented the total amount of wine sent over to Guyot, and while in London I came to an arrangement for those two bills to be given up, and other bills being in their place—the endorsement on Lechevin's bill is quite correct, it is my writing; the four bills mentioned there are what were substituted in place of the two others—they were all returned to me unpaid—I only received 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—Challier told me in March, that all the goods I had sent had been sold, and he asked me to send him as many as possible—Lechevin told me he had a law suit about some cement he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187508160065"></xptr>
               <p>forwarded to Calais and Caen, which would be terminated at the end of the month, and then he should be in possession of plenty of money, and then he would pay—he told me that he had no longer an office, on account of that law suit—I believed that he was then carrying on business, and I believed the representations made in the letters by Challier, as to Lechevin's position—I Bent the goods to Lechevin, relying on the contents of Challier's letters, and I dispatched the goods to Guyot on the references I received from Challier and Doussou; I mean the letters, and also the verbal re<lb></lb>ference which I received at Bordeaux, and also from Doussou when he came back from travelling—I came to London again in May, after Guyot's bill was dishonoured, or it may have been June—I met all the three prisoners accidentally in Cannon Street, and they took me to the office of Webber &amp; <hi rend="italic">Co.</hi>, Martin Street, where they told me that at. that time they had no <hi rend="italic">money to</hi> pay me, but that if I would serve them by giving some references, that would put them in a position to do business; and that after having robbed a few Englishmen they would pay me, and upon that I went to a solicitor—I went over to Bordeaux, and came back to this country while the prisoners were in custody—on the day before I gave evidence at the Mansion House, I went with the officers to different warehouses and saw some goods—I recognised the marks on the cases and hogsheads, and am able to swear that they were my property—I pointed them out to the officer, who made notes at the time—the actual amount of wine I have seen amounts to about 22,000 francs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. I have been in business as a wine mer<lb></lb>chant eighteen months at Bordeaux—I was not in business before that—I have been an insurance broker, But that is not called a business—I was an insurance agent, representing a company—they paid me a salary, and I had private means of my own—I started as a wine merchant with capital—I bought for ready money and never on credit at that time; but I did after<lb></lb>wards—I always paid ready money, or I paid when the time arrived, that payment should take place by our agreement—I have carried on business at the Cour Chapeau Rouge, for two years—I was eighteen months a wine merchant at Bordeaux, and ten years an insurance agent—I am still carrying on both—I had another business there which I carried on six smonths, and gave it up to go into the town—I had an agent in Paris, M. Besson—he is not a relation of mine; he is Challier's father-in-law—he represented my house, selling wines on commission—I did not know him before—my traveller, M. Doussou, appointed him as my agent in Paris—Doussou, is my cousin—I have known him ever since I was born, but I have ceased to be on good terms with him since I made the complaint in this case—I was on very intimate terms with him—I never saw him in Paris—I have seen him in Bordeaux, at ray office, not at my house—he wrote letters for me and assisted me in my business—I had great confi<lb></lb>dence in him—he was my agent for a year—I paid him a salary—I did not see him for ten years before he was my agent—it was after the introduction of Bessou, that Challier was introduced to me—Doussou sent me some orders which he had obtained for wine from customers in Paris, and I sent much wine on his representation—I have been paid for it by bills which are all paid to the amount of about 12,000 francs—Doussou was in the habit of making inquiries for me about the solvency of customers—Challier wrote a letter to Doussou, which Doussou sent to me from Berne, in July, 1874—I think I first saw Challier in October or November, in Bordeaux—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187508160066"></xptr>
               <p>Doussou introduced him personally and represented him as a man who would be likely to be a good agent for me in London, and I had no reason to doubt it—I came to London in March—I did not see Challier in Paris after<lb></lb>wards—Doussou appointed him my agent in October—Challier remained, four, five, or six days at Bordeaux—he was a visitor at my house, but he did not live with me in October—he came to my office—he tasted my wine and talked to me at great length on business matters—I knew that he had been in London, and was returning back, but on what business I did not know—after he had been in London, I got the first order from him I think in the beginning of November—I received this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had not at that time sent the wine to Lechevin &amp; Co.—I received that letter at the 15th or 16th, and I did not send the wine for a month afterwards, perhaps move, because I was waiting for some confirmation by Lechevin, of what Challier had told me—I sent Doussou to London, to make inquiries, and he was absent a month, but he wrote to me sometimes—I have not got his letters here—if they have not been given to my atcorney they must be in Bordeaux—Doussou confirmed to me all the information which Challier had given me about Lechevin, in all its particulars—I sent the wine in consequence of what the one or the other had said—nobody has even advised me to say that it was in consequence partly of what Challier told me, and partly what Doussou told me that I sent the goods off—if Doussou had told me not to send them I would not have done so—I had perfect confidence in Doussou at that time; he had my power of attorney and I would have sent wine to any customer he alone represented to be a good one, and perhaps I should have sent it if he had been the only person who recommended-Lechevin &amp; Co.—when I started from Bordeaux the Bill of Exchange was not due, but it fell due while I was in London—while I was in London a letter from Sauge, was sent after me from Bordeaux—before I came to London I had not received more than one letter from Challier on that subject—he wrote to me after I had started for London—he asked me by letter to let him see Sauge's letter—he wrote to me seven or eight times upon that subject to Bordeaux after I came to London in March, but not before—I received this letter from Challier. (<hi rend="italic">This being translated, was dated April 22nd to the witness, acknowledging his letter containing</hi> 750 <hi rend="italic">francs in notes, and staled, "I am still expecting with patience the letter in which certain persons are mentioned, Sauge. I will return it by the next post</hi>") I received several letters from him of a similar kind at Bordeaux, asking for Sauge's letter, but have not sent it—Sauge was a customer to whom I have sent wine on Challier's recommendation, to the amount of, about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen him twice, and he paid for the goods after the bill had been protested—it was paid by Mr. Gillian, at Messrs. Ransom's—I have not got my books here—the customers which Challier introduced to me are entered in them—I sent several. small orders to them—Le Gros is one—some of the customers paid me and some Challier—I did not receive all the money—I have seen a customer named Bigot twice—I may have sent him wine amounting to about 1,200 francs, part of "which was paid and I took back part of the goods—I don't know Lechevin's father or brother, but I know their names—what I said at the police-court was that I had made some inquiries and got information about them, and found they were satisfactory—I sold one hogshead of wine to each of them through Doussou—I think I sent wine to Le Gros, Guyot, Bigot, and Le Compte before Lechevin's transactions—I drew on Challier on each occasion that I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187508160067"></xptr>
               <p>sent the goods—I—was not compelled to draw upon him in order that I might meet other bills which were due—I may have said at the Mansion House "I continually drew bills on Chattier, I was compelled to do so to meet my bills"—I said "Every bill was paid with money I sent him, and partly from money he received from me here"—all the bills were not paid with money which I sent him—I frequently sent more money than the bills represented—I had received information respecting Guyot from Doussou before I sent him any wine, and the information he gave me was satisfactory—it was Doussou who sent the wine—I did not occupy myself with it—when I sent the goods I did not know that Guyot was trading under the name of Webber &amp; Co.—I discovered it when Challier wrote to me, and when I came to London in March—I have received about 3,000 francs from Guyot, and I sent him wine for more than 12,000 francs—I have bills of of Guyot or Webber &amp; Co.—they are here—they fell due before he was given in custody—complaints were not made to me in reference to the quality of the wine I sent over—I always received compliments about my wine—I recollect once at Guoyot's house a bottle of wine being shown to me—there were a few cases which were muddy; perhaps twenty-five or thirty, and Challier had complained of it to me verbally—I do not re<lb></lb>member asking Doussou to accept accommodation bills for me—I said at the Mansion House "I have drawn for two bills on Besson, part of those bills were drawn for my own use"—that was in order to meet some bills which were due in Paris—the amount of wine sent to London, at the agency of Challier, was some 30,000 francs, and the amount altogether from Challier, and all the other customers which I received in cash, was about 7,000 or 8,000 francs by bills, which were paid—that is all that has been paid—I have had bills for the remainder and they are here—the value of the wine I have received back and which is at the wharfingers, is not more than 17,000 francs—the first order I executed for Lechevin was 12,000 francs out of the 30,000; perhaps 100 francs more or less—Sauge's bills were paid after protest—he owes me nothing—I can't say whether Le Gros, Guyot and the others' bills were paid, but Challier no doubt got the money for them—I got some of them—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Doussou's writing, my clerk—it was possible that it was written by my authority—it is signed Doussou, but written in my name, on one of my printed letter heads—Doussou some times wrote letters at my office—I did know of this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This being translated, was dated</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th February</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">enclosing a bill of lading for 200 cases of wine, and another for</hi> 50 <hi rend="italic">hogsheads, embarked on the steamer</hi> Era, <hi rend="italic">and stated "I don't know what to think of all my expeditions to London, and it seems to come from a sure source that the major part of my wines sent to Lechevin are put on warrants into the docks as soon as they arrive, all this seems to increase my fears, particularly in considering the refusal of the bankers to negotiate these securities, and therefore I am compelled to wait for the maturity of these bills in London before I can think to send some, although it is painful to say so</hi>") The bankers refused to discount Lechevin's bills—I don't recollect whether that was while Doussou was at Bordeaux—Challier has not paid me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Le Gros—he very likely told me that he had received it, but I never received it—I never received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Bigot, from Challier—I am looking at a memorandum—I have never received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Le Compte—I can say that Challier received it, but not I—I have received 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Delaman; 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from West, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Grelliot—I have not received 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in two sums from Bigot—I only received 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in</p>

               <p>cash and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods were returned—I have supplied altogether wine to the amount of 800 or 900 francs in two shipments to Bigot—the first time I came over here I brought my books—this bill for 2,000 francs. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is accepted by Challier—I sent to meet it 1,715<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 70<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—no doubt Challier paid the remainder out of the proceeds of more than 3,000 francs worth of goods which I had sent him—Challier has accepted six bills. for me in the same way, amounting to 9,750 francs—only one has been. paid when presented—they were drawn on Challier and accepted by him—they were all overdue at the time he was taken, except one, which was due on the 30th June—the one paid was for 2,000 francs—it was paid by Challier, with' money that I sent him—this is another (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), also for 2,000 francs—Challier paid nothing on the other; it was dishonoured—he sent me 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash for the other, that was the amount of it—the two 2,000 franc bills were discounted at my bankers—the bill was presented in London, dishonoured and returned to me at Bordeaux—Challier then sent me I think a bill for 2,003 francs for money which I had sent him in April, and so he actually returned me my own money which I had sent him for the very purpose of paying this very bill—there is a long account between me and him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of it. (<hi rend="italic">Found on Challier</hi>)—it is in Losey's, my accountant's, writing—I sent Challier these papers I think in the beginning of June—out of the six bills I mentioned, none of them were accommodation bills—I had sent more money than the bills represented, also the goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I ceased to have confidence in Doussou at my last journey to London in June—I have seen a letter which contains the writing of Doussou, the contents of which I was not aware of—this side of the letter was suggested by me, but it did not contain this postscript when it left my office—I have read the part of this letter marked E, which refers to Lechevin—Doussou had confirmed the contents of that letter before I sent the goods to Lechevin—this letter (<hi rend="italic">found on Guyot, dated Bordeaux, 14th April</hi>, 1875) is in my writing—I sent it to Challier—this letter (<hi rend="italic">dated London, 6th February</hi>, 1875) is in Challier's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated "Mr. Lechevin has</hi> 150,000 <hi rend="italic">kilos. of cement, on which has been paid</hi> 5,000 <hi rend="italic">francs; but, as the cement is worth</hi> 11,000 <hi rend="italic">francs, if you can pay the 5,000 francs cash, the</hi> 11,000 <hi rend="italic">barrels will be sent to you immediately.</hi>") 4,115 francs 70 cents was sent to Challier for the purpose of taking up bills, and the amount of goods consigned to him, independent of customers, was 5,496 francs 80 centimes.</p>

I am a wine and spirit broker and auctioneer, trading under the style of Scott, Wright &amp; Co., Great Tower Street—I knew Guyot by the name of Webber—on 15th May I saw him with reference to some hogsheads of wine—I had a sale fixed for 21st May, and a sample of wine was brought to me—I made an advance on fifty hogsheads of 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not got my cheques; I left them at the Mansion House—forty-six of the hogsheads were sold on 31st May—they realised about 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—two of the other hogsheads have been sold since for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the two, and the other two are on hand at Gun and Shot Wharf, where Mr. Romaine is the manager</p>

               <p>—I had the mark in my catalogue—I did not see Challier in reference to the matter, only Guyot—I had another transaction on 1st June with Guyot, and advanced 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on fifty hogsheads—at that time the warrants were in Mr. Layland's possession—I have not sold them; I am going to sell them to-day at 1 o'clock—I am not aware that I have been told not to do so—there are at Gun and Shot Wharf ex <hi rend="italic">Ernest</hi>, from Bordeaux.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never saw Challier—Guyot was introduced to me by a person named Pignell, whom I have known for five or six years—he has introduced several purchasers and sellers to me—I had perfect confidence in Pignell, and nothing has diminished that confidence—he did not intro<lb></lb>duce Guyot as Guyot, but as the principal in Webber &amp; Co.'s house—it is not unusual for people to trade under other names than their own—men who have had partners, the same as myself, still retain the partner's name—that is in the case of an old firm—Pignell represented Guyot as a large merchant and importer of goods, which I believed, relying on his recom<lb></lb>mendation—I had sold other wine before for Webber—we had four transac<lb></lb>tions—the 10th May was the first time I ever saw him—we then sold 500 or 600 cases of champagne for him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now out of business—I was a wine merchant at Bristol in September and October—Mr. Holt, of Great St. Helens, was my agent—I had at that time three cargoes of cement, one at Caen, in Normandy, and two warehoused at Bristol—Lechevin was introduced to me by Losey, and I made a contract-with him in reference to the cement—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have a translation here, signed by Lechevin—I have also got a document of 27th September, commencing "Bought of Mr. Isaacs—it is not dated; it is signed by Lechevin—he had it in French, and I had it in English—I gave him 74<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as he asked me for a cheque to pay the charges on the cargo at Caen—the cheque, which was given on the following day, is dated 17th October—I gave authority to the gentleman whose name is to the cheque, to pay the amount; that is Mr. Cockburn—Lechevin said he was a general merchant, dealer in potatoes, grain, cement, oil, and a variety of articles—he said he was going to Caen. for the special purpose of paying those charges and receiving the cement—I subsequently sent another cargo of cement under that contract to Calais, value 269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some few shillings; I don't recollect the date—the third cargo mentioned in the contract was never delivered, because I found out that he was a swindler—I never received any money in respect of the cargoes or any money back for any cheque—he gave me some bills, the first of which was due just before Christmas, and before the first bill was matured he made a proposal to my agent, but I was not present—Lechevin after<lb></lb>wards told me that the ship put into Plymouth damaged, and that imme<lb></lb>diately on her arrival in London he would give me seventy hogsheads of wine to secure the payment of the bill—I had parted with the second cargo at that time—he gave me no charge on the seventy hogsheads of wine; I saw the hogsheads—the man who introduced Lechevin went to the wharf in Thames Street, in December, and tasted some wine, and I saw a number of casks and the names and marks—the bill has not been paid at all—when this conversation took place I met Lechevin in Thames Street—I did not see him afterwards—I neither got any wine or any money—I saw</p>

               <p>Challier and another Frenchman at Mr. Hall's office, in Great St. Helen's, the latter end of November or early in December—that was after the cheque had been given and after the cargo was sent to Calais—nothing was said in Challier's presence about the business between Lechevin and me, but Lechevin said, when Challier had left, "That is Mr. Challier, from whom I am to have the wine."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am informed by the detective and by the solicitor that the cargo at Caen is confiscated, and left a loss of 200 or 300 francs—the cargoes at Bristol are still there—they did not get into the possession of the men, but the other did—one cargo was sent from Bristol to Calais; it was sold; and they brought me in a difference of 900 and odd francs—I got a bill from Lechevin for that—the bill was passed on, and he was sued upon it by my solicitor, who got judgment in the English Court, and subsequently in the French Court on the production of the English judgment—that was the Caen bill—one cargo remained at Bristol, and the one at Caen was sold to pay the dues—the one at Calais was sold under a judgment, and no portion of it came into Lechevin's pos<lb></lb>session, at least I suppose not—I have known Losey since September or October last—he is a very respectable man in appearance—I met him and saw him at the office of Mr. Hall, my agent, when Mr. Hall was out, and when he returned he said "I see you two gentlemen are in conversation I need not introduce you"—Mr. Hall said he had known Mr. Losey fifteen years, had several transactions with him, and believed him to be a poor but respectable man—I believed that, and afterwards Losey introduced Lechevin to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant of 2, Leadenhall Street—in September last I was about taking an office at Great St. Helen's—I know Losey, he introduced Lechevin to me at the end of August, and said that he was going into business, and wished his name to be up, and he would pay me so much per annum to receive letters for Mr. Losey to do any busi<lb></lb>ness there for him—that was in October, and for a month I objected, but on 16th November, Challier and Lechevin came together, and it was finally arranged that he was to pay 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and they gave instruc<lb></lb>tions in my presence to have the name put up immediately, one was act<lb></lb>ing quite as much as the other—on the 20th a man named Passmore came and "Lechevin Aine" &amp; Co." was painted on the glass tablets, and on the landing, and on the general office door, both Challier and Lechevin were present when the painting was being done, and Challier wished to have the chalk marks rubbed off that it might look older, he asked me to get the housekeeper to do it—Lechevin came there about nine times in November, and about the same number in December, and when the bill of Mr. Isaacs became due in December he disappeared altogether—he paid nothing for the rooms—I never saw two Englishmen connected with them—there were no ledgers, day-books, or cash-books, but Losey ordered some headed paper—I did not know Lechevin by any other name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Losey about fifteen years—I believe he calls himself a wine merchant—he purchases small parcels of wine and re-sells them—I believe him to be respectable—the date of the first con<lb></lb>tract with Lechevin for cement is 24th September—he had not taken a room at my place then; I think he was brought there the same day—when</p>

               <p>I came in I found them there—I refused to have Lechevin at first, because I did not want to have any other name up—that was in October, subse<lb></lb>quent to the first contract—Losey repeated the application some time after<lb></lb>wards, he said "You may as well have it, it will be no trouble to you"—he told me that Lechevin was a very rich man, a dealer in potatoes and grain who had depots every ten miles all the way from Calais to Paris—I saw Losey on Monday, I don't know where he is now—I saw Challier in Novem<lb></lb>ber—the bills for the cement bad been given the and then cheque also—it was all settled about the cement as far as Mr. Isaacs and I were concerned when I first saw Challier—I am not aware that Lechevin subsequently re<lb></lb>ferred to me as to his respectability, or at any time—Challier said in the dock at the Mansion House that he never saw me in his life—the name was painted up on 20th February about mid-day—my clerks were there—none of them are here—I have dissolved partnership; the firm was "J. B. Howell, Hall &amp; Co.'—I am not in partnership now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When the ship arrived about 23rd December, I had a con<lb></lb>versation with Lechevin, who said that he would give security to Mr. Israel for the seventy hogsheads of wine, and that he might be allowed to sell them, and hand the proceeds to Mr. Isaacs—I could not see him after 23rd December.</p>

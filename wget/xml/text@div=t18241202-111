On the 4th of November, between four and five o'clock, the prisoners came into the shop, together; Perkins wanted some childs' socks - I asked them to walk to the end of the shop, gave them seats, and fetched some socks, which I showed to Perkins; they were not the right size, and while I was gone for another paper I looked towards them, and saw Watson knock a piece of sarsnet off the counter, with her hand; I took no notice, but shewed them more socks, which did not suit, and I got a third paper, and shewed to Perkins. I then saw Watson stoop down, and put the silk under her petticoats. Perkins bought a pair of socks, which came to 6 d., and they were walking out when Mr. Limbert desired them to walk into a back room, and as they walked along I heard the silk fall from Watson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl. On 28th March, between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner with a girl, in a room at No. 11, Farmer's-folly, where I live—I was alone in another room—I heard a noise, and went out of my room to see what the noise was—the prisoner</p>

               <p>was making a bother in the house with the female, quarrelling—I was then in the passage, outside the room—I shut the door on the inside—the prisoner forced it open, came after me, pulled me outside the door by my dress, and took a knife out of his pocket—he then threw his jacket, which was on his arm, over my head, and stabbed through my clothes into my thigh with the knife which was in his right hand—I had not said or done anything to him, I only shut the door—he was not drunk—I was taken to the London Hospital.</p>

On 28th March, between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, the prisoner came there with a young female—he made a great bother inside—he had not been in three or four minutes when he went to strike the female—I said that he should not do so, and he pulled off his jacket to strike me—I went to put him away, and he struck me with his left hand—the last witness came out of her room in No. 10 (which I rent as well, and three females live there)—she was just at the door as I put him from me—he had his coat on his arm outside the street door—she said, "Go away from the door"—he threw his jacket over her head, and struck her with a knife on the thigh—that was in the street, ten or twelve yards from the street door—he then ran, and a young seafaring man, who is not here, ran after him—he was quite sober—the prosecutrix was taken to the hospital.</p>

I am house surgeon at the London Hospital Early on the morning of March 29th, the prosecutrix was brought there with a punctured wound on the upper part of the left thigh—it was a dangerous wound, about an inch and a half deep and an inch broad—it was on the front of the thigh, a little external to the medium line—it healed very kindly indeed, but she must feel the effects of it for some time, some of the nerves being injured—she was about a month in the hospital.</p>

On 23rd July the prisoner and another came to my shop about a quarter-past 11 o'clock at night—he asked me if I would oblige him with a light—I said, "There is the gas, take one"—he seemed rather intoxicated, and I twisted a bit of paper for him—he then asked the price of saveloys, and bought two, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered me a half-crown; it fell into a tin dish, containing some gravy—I put it into the till—the prisoner and the other man had some more articles, for which they paid, and left—there was no other half-crown in the till—I detected it was a spurious one, went for a constable, gave him the half-crown, and went with him, and saw the prisoner going into a public-house—I called him, and charged him with offering a bad half-crown—he said, "What the b—y h—d do you mean? I don't know you nor your shop"—he was very violent—the policeman persuaded him to come back—he still denied it—I wished him to give me another half-crown, or the change which I had given him—he sat on the counter a long time, and then took some halfpence out of his pocket, and another half-crown, which I saw was bad—he at last put down two shillings and the halfpence which I gave him, and the policeman took him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, G</hi> 210). Carver spoke to me, we went to a public-house, called the prisoner, and spoke to him about bad money—he said, "What the b—y h—l? I am not going to be done in that manner; I don't know your shop, nor you either"—I took him back to the shop, and while there he dropped a half-crown on the floor—I said, "You had better pick it up yourself, or you will accuse me of ringing the changes"—he picked it up—I took him, and found on him these six other half-crowns produced.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint. This half-crown that was uttered is counterfeit—two of these other six are of George III., 1819, they are from the same mould, and are counterfeit—the other four are counterfeits of Victoria, and of the same mould, but neither of them are from the mould of the one that was uttered.</p>

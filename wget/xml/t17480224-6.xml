             (servant to Mr. Davis .) On the twentieth of last month I was going home about ten o'clock at night, I saw the Prisoner, and another man not yet taken, hovering about the house; about half an hour afterwards some of them came and knocked at the door, and asked if there were any pork stakes, I said no.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you see?</p>
               <p>Budge. Two. Leadley was taken behind a door belonging to Mr. Chisholm. I saw Watts on the top of the door, and pulled him down; I asked him what he did there, he said he did no harm there, and so I took him to the round-house .</p>

            . I was in company with the Prisoners that night, Watts and Leadley, otherwise Randall; they asked me to go with them a little farther, and I went to the corner of Little St. Martin's Lane, (I think it is a chandler's shop ) and Leadley helped Watts up upon the place on the top of the shop.</p>

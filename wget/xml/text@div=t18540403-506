                  </hi>. I live in Aldersgate-street. On Wednesday, 29th March, I was coming up Aldersgate-street, and near Palm-street I saw a crowd—as I was trying to get by the crowd, I heard my watch <hi rend="italic">go click</hi>—I immediately perceived the guard of my watch hanging without the watch—the prisoner Kelly was close to me, and I saw him with the watch in his hand, and pass it immediately away, so quickly that I had no chance what-ever of recovering it, and I immediately secured him; Donovan imme<lb></lb>diately began to endeavour to rescue him from me, saying, "That is not him, you have the wrong one"—I said, "I will keep possession of him at all events," and then a struggle commenced with the other parties—Donovan took part in the struggle—I struggled with Kelly down Aldersgate-street, thinking that a police officer would come up, and I got him into the middle of the street, when he cut my left eye open, and struck me a violent blow on the forehead, when the other part of the gang gave me another black eye, and cut my nose and mouth open—I bled profusely; they then jumped upon my left arm, by which I held Kelly, forced me to the ground, and then jumped upon me, and kicked me while I was upon the ground—it is impossible for me to calculate exactly how many of them there were; but I should think</p>

I recollect seeing Mr. Davis in Aldersgate-street on this day—I know Kelly by sight—I saw him that day among the mob, standing by the side of Mr. Davis—I did not see him take the watch, but I saw him throw it down behind him—another man, who was among them, picked it up—Mr. Davis turned round and was going to run after him; he held the watch behind him—Mr. Davis took hold of him, and took him to Aldersgate-street—he wanted to go to Old-street station—Mr. Davis would not take him there; about half a dozen of them came and fell upon Mr. Davis's arm—I could not swear who struck him—I ran after the officer—I did not see Donovan there.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee shop, in Fleet-lane. I saw Mr. Davis that day, just after he was robbed; there was a crowd of persons—he had hold of Kelly, and dragged him—Mr. Davis said, "You are the one that robbed me?—some of the parties with him said, "No, he is not the one;" he said, "But he is the one, I swear, and I will keep hold of him till I see an officer;" he got him from the pavement into the middle of the street—Kelly there began to lay hold of his collar, and to strike him in the face with his other hand; his comrades then came right round, and no one could touch them—in the struggle Mr. Davis fell down, and Kelly went away from him, but I called out to stop him; and as he went to the corner of Carthusian-street I laid hold of him—I never lost sight of him—I did not see Donovan in the crowd.</p>

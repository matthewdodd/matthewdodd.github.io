                  </hi>. I am a master shipwright, in the Dockyard, at Greenwich; the prisoner had been in my service five months; he had been in my wife's service previously. On Saturday morning, 28th Oct., I missed a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note from my writing desk—I had seen it on the Monday—finding I had lost my note, my suspicion was on my servants—I sent to Mr. Booth on 3rd Nov., and the box and drawer of the prisoner were searched in my presence—three dinner napkins, a D'Oyley, and piece of music were found; and on his person a pocket handkerchief—these were my property; and in his drawer were eight sovereigns and a half, and two half sovereigns in a purse—a bunch of keys was on his person, one of which opened my writing desk, where the note was kept.</p>

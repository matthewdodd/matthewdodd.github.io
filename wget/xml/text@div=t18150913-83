            . I recollect taking a letter to Mr. Munton, but I don't know when; I got that letter from that man, (pointing to the prisoner,) he is a stranger to me; he said, will you go on an errand for me? I said, yes. He then gave me the letter, and shewed me the place where I was to deliver it; it was at an office in Downing-street. He told me to ask for Mr. Munton, and if I did not see him, I was to enquire after him. He said I was to bring the answer to him opposite Downing-street, where he would wait. I carried the letter, and saw Mr. Munton, who came back with me to the place where the prisoner said he would wait; but he was not there. I never saw him before I saw him in the Westminster-road, but I am quite sure it is him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Now, you know this man is trying for his life. This which you state was what happened three months ago. Can you say on what day it was - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say it was on the 10th of June - A. I don't recollect that I did. I talked to some one here in the yard; and I believe it was on a Friday in May. I think I said so to the justice at Bow-street; I think it was about Friday, the 14th of May.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know when it was - A. It was on a Friday. I gave it to Mr. Munton on the same day, and I believe I told the justice at Bow-street that it was on a Friday in May. I am quite sure the prisoner at the bar is the man who sent me with it. I saw him in Prison.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Now when you saw him in Prison, are you sure you were not told that the man you would see, was the man who gave the letter to you, and therefore you believed so when you saw him - A. No; nobody told me so. The prisoner walked over Westminster-bridge with me, and pointed out the place in Downing-street where I was to deliver the letter.</p>

I remember the last witness bringing me a letter on the 17th of June, between the hours of three and four in the afternoon; the boy told me he had been there before when I was not there, and returned to the person who sent him, and came back to me a second time with the letter. That letter enclosed a draft to me upon Hammersley and Co. for ten pounds, which draft was signed Williams. I went with the boy to where he said the the prisoner was to wait, but he was not there; it was just by Whitehall, opposite to the Treasury; nobody was there. The note enclosing this draft was signed Allen. I know a person of that name who belongs to the Excise office. The prisoner knew Mr. Allen. When I first saw the note I really thought it was Allen's hand-writing, but afterwards I was confident it was not, when I compared it to Allen's hand-writing. That draft appears to have been drawn by a Mr. Williams in favour of one Thomson, neither of whom I know.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ALLEN. I am in the Excise office, and am on terms of friendship with the last witness, Mr. Munton. I have known the prisoner Elmes six years. (Letter put into the hands of the witness.) Looking at this letter, it is not my hand-writing, nor signed by me; it has a very strong resemblance to my hand-writing. I never saw this draft until it was shewn to me by Mr. Munton.</p>

             had kept cash there, and closed his accounts with us about a week before this draft was presented.

I had received two notes previous to this, purporting to be from Mr. Allen, but which were not, and by them three pounds had been obtained from me. So close was the imitation of the hand-writing of Allen on each of those, that I could have sworn to it; one of them was dated from Westminster Hall, requesting one pound, which was sent. On the morning I appointed to meet him, and in answer to the letter I had sent, this letter enclosing the draft was returned to me, by the boy I had sent three pounds to him in similar requests in writing, by two different persons.</p>

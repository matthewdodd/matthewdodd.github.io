                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live in Eccleston Place. On 19th Sept., about 10 o'clock in the evening, I was passing St. Martin's Place; I saw the prisoner and several others, I cannot tell how many—they were in the act of passing me—they closed upon me, and struck me—I had three blows on my right arm, and Nolan immediately snatched my watch—I called out, "I have lost my watch, stop thief!"—he knocked me down—I got up, and he had not got so far as from me to you before he was stopped—I had been drinking, but I knew what was taking place.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Whitefriars Street. On 19th Sept. I was in St. Martin's Place—I saw Mr. Murdock a little intoxicated—I saw the prisoner and two other men in company; the prisoner was in the middle—there was a little bit of a scuffle between them, and the prosecutor called out, "I have lost my watch, "—the prisoner turned and knocked the prosecutor down, and I saw something pass from his hand to another man—with assistance I detained the prisoner—the other men were had up, and I was brought to swear to them, but I could not.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 11, Page-street, Westminster, and am employed in the Royal Engineering department. On Sunday morning, 16th April, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in Regent-street, west<lb></lb>minster, which is to the west of the Abbey—I had just got to the corner of Vincent-street when I heard a slight cry, like a female <hi rend="italic">screeching</hi>—I went down Vincent-street, in the direction of the scream—I passed down on the right hand side, with my right hand to the houses—when I arrived at the centre of the street I saw a figure at the further end, which was very dark—I proceeded towards it—when I crossed to the other side I lost the figure—it turned out to be the prisoner—the first I saw was the figure of a female lying on the ground—I could not tell whether the other figure I saw was a male or female, but I judge it to be the figure of the prisoner—it was standing at the farthest end of the street—I went on towards that figure, and on going towards it I found the woman on the way—she was lying near the kerb, on the horse-road, with her feet towards the foot-path—she was lying on her front, with her face buried in the ground—her bonnet was on the ground, and her face under it—the prisoner was standing about two or three yards from her—he was standing between a gateway leading to a court and a post—there was no one there but him—I asked him what he had been doing to her—he made no answer—the woman was lying on the ground at that time—I asked the prisoner whether she was his wife, and why he did not go and assist her, or something to that effect—after a little while he want over towards her, then turned round and said to me, "I have stabbed her; I have killed her with this knife;"at the same time exhibiting a knife to me—before he said that to me, as he passed over to go towards her, I heard him say, "Maria!"—I am not certain whether he said" Get up," but he men<lb></lb>tioned her name distinctly; and while I was speaking to him previous to that, she raised herself on her arms a few inches, and dropped again instantly into the same position—I looked round for assistance, but could not see any one—I did mot go to the woman at all—my first impression was to go to her assistance, and my next was to take care of myself—I wished to keep myself from being implicated in it, as there was nobody there but the prisoner and I—there was but one lamp in the street—I got the prisoner towards that—it was on the opposite side—I moved towards it, and he came with me—I then saw his face—I did not take hold of him—I asked him again what he had done to her, and he again said he had killed her, he had stabbed her with that knife—I then went to the corner of Regent-street, gave as alarm, and returned with the police and others to the place where I had left the female lying—she was still lying there—she never moved afterwards—I cannot tell whether she was alive or not—the prisoner was gone.</p>

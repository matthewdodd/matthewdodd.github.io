                  </hi> I am a surgeon in the regiment of Horse Guards (Blue), and was so in 1843—I was then well acquainted with Mr. Munro, the prisoner—he was then a lieutenant in the same regiment—I had known him very intimately—in June, 1843, the regiment was quartered at the Regent's-park barracks—on Saturday morning, the 1st of July, between four and five o'clock, I was called up by Mr. Munro—he came onto my bedroom,</p>

               <p>awoke me, and said he wanted me to go with him, that he had to settle an affair with Colonel Fawcett—that was while I was still in bed—I objected to go at first, but he pressed me, and said I might be of use to him, and so I went—he had previously spoken to me of some misunderstanding about the sale of a house—that Colonel Fawcett had intrusted him with the sale of a house, and that he had obtained more for it than Colonel Fawcett either de<lb></lb>manded or expected, and that Colonel Fawcett, so far from showing any kind<lb></lb>ness on account of the trouble he had taken in his behalf, had behaved in an unkindly manner, instead of being grateful to him for what he had done—he did not tell me that a quarrel had been the consequence, he merely mentioned it in the way that any person would mention a family disagreement—I was aware that Colonel Fawcett and Mr. Munro had married two sisters—I do not remember whether Mr. Munro remained with me while I was dressing—we went together in his carriage to the Brecknock-arms, near Copenhagen-house, in the north of London—I do not know whether it is Kentish-town or Camden-town—we arrived there about half-past five or six o'clock—I do not think we found any one there when we arrived—some one drove up afterwards, I think it was Colonel Fawcett, but I am not certain—I saw Colonel Fawcett afterwards in a field, near the Brecknock-arms, with Mr. Munro, and two other gentlemen with him—one was Mr. Grant—I knew him—the other one I have been since told was Major Cuddy—I did not know him at the time—Mr. Grant either had been, or was then, in the army—I know he was a lieutenant at one time, whether he was then or not I do not know—Mr. Munro did not tell me what Mr. Grant was there for, he told me nothing about it—when these gentlemen were in the field I went out of the field, and left them there—I was going down the Tottenham-road—the field I left adjoins the road—they went into a field further away from the road, next but one to the road—I saw nothing done there—Mr. Munro called me into the field—I had heard nothing before that—that was before there was any shot—he shouted to me, and asked me to come into the field, and said something to the effect that I might be of use to him—I thought they were going to settle it—I got over the paling into the field to them—they seemed to be standing all together—I cannot say that I saw them all four—I saw three or four—I had no conversation with Mr. Munro on that occasion—I went up to them, and they retired from me, and then I turned my back to them, I thought they were at conference—they did not go out of that field—they went a little farther away in the same field, and in about a minute, as near as I can recollect, I heard a report as of a pistol—I only heard one re<lb></lb>port—there was immediately a shout for me—it was either "Gulliver," or "Doctor," or some such shout—I turned round, and saw Colonel Fawcett down on the grass—Mr. Munro was standing by him saying something—Mr. Cuddy was there—Mr. Munro said something to the effect that Colonel Faw<lb></lb>cett had been levelling at him, I forget the words—Colonel Fawcett said he had not, and he afterwards said it was an accident—I think that was said to the policeman—that was half an hour after at least—after Colonel Fawcett said he had not, he and Mr. Munro shook hands, and Mr. Munro went away—I did not see him drive off in his carriage—I do not know whether any one went with him, of course Mr. Grant went away—I lost sight of him—Mr. Cuddy remained with Colonel Fawcett—I found Colonel Fawcett was likely to die—he was wounded on the right side of the chest, under the arm—I raised him up, he rallied a little after that, and then Mr. Cuddy went to get some assistance, and came with a board for the purpose of taking him away—he</p>

               <p>was taken to the Brecknock-arms first—Mr. Cuddy took a note for me directed to Sir Benjamin Brodie, or Mr. Liston—they refused to take him in at the Brecknock-arms, and he was taken to the Camden-arms, and re<lb></lb>mained there till his death, I believe, but I speak of that from hearsay—I was present when Mr. Liston and Mr. Sands saw him—we saw him together—I think it was the day after, I am not quite certain—I think I saw him both days—Mr. Liston and I helped to move him on the Sunday, to shift his position—I saw him also with Sir Benjamin Brodie.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you still surgeon of the Blues? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have been in the regiment more than ten years—Mr. Munro was lieutenant and adjutant in the regiment when I joined it—I was indicted here on this subject—the Attorney-General entered a <hi rend="italic">noli prosequi</hi> in my favour, and examined me as a witness—I was called as a witness on the trail of Mr. Cuddy—the Jury pronounced him <hi rend="smallCaps">"NOT GUILTY"</hi>—I was also present at the trail of Mr. Grant—the Jury pronounced him also "<hi rend="italic">Not Guilty"</hi>—he was Mr. Munro's second—the expression Mr. Munro used was, "You were <hi rend="italic">covering me"</hi>—that means deliberately leveling—that was the complaint of Mr. Munro at the moment; that Colonel Fawcett had been deliberately aiming at him—the colonel recovered when he was put into a better position so as to relieve him—he had recovered from the immediate shock, when he told the policeman it was an accident—when Colonel Fawcett and Mr. Munro shook hands, I heard Mr. Munro say, "God bless you, Fawcett, I forgive you;" or words to that effect—I examined the wound that Colonel Fawcett had received—it was in such a position as to show that the arm must have been upraised, or he could not have received it—the skin was withdrawn from its natural position by the uplifting of the arm—the hole in the skin would have been lower down if the arm had not been up<lb></lb>lifted—it was very early in the morning when I was aroused by Mr. Munro—the regiment was about to march that morning, in consequence of which he slept where he did, and I slept where I did—that had been arranged long before any quarrel took place—it was not the result of any arrangement between us—when he awoke me, and I refused to go, he implored me to go with him in his extremity, and said he had been very harshly treated, or words to that effect—he was in a state of the greatest possible anxiety and despondency—he did not appear to me like a man who was pursuing an object of his own with vindictiveness, but, on the contrary, he appeared determined to avoid it—when he said I might be of use to him, he did not explain how in particular, but he said that the slightest shadow of an apology would be satisfactory to him; that he had been very grossly insulted in the presence of a servant—I have known him upwards of ten years—a more kind man never existed—that was his character throughout the whole regiment, and everywhere else, by everybody who knew him—he was the last man to injure any person, the last man in the world to seek a quarrel—he was not at all quarrelsome—as far as I could judge from his conversation, as well as from his conduct, he appeared to be a man who would, on almost any terms, have avoided a quarrel—he told me, in express terms, that he hoped it would not come to any mischief at all, and that he wished it settled—his father was an officer in the army, and rose (I merely speak from hearsay,) from the ranks on account of his bravery, I have repeatedly heard that he was with the "forlorn hope" at the storming of Seringapatam—Mr. Munro is not a man of fortune—he rose entirely by his own merits—he has universally the repu<lb></lb>tation of being a distinguished officer, and a humane, mild, forbearing gentle<lb></lb>man, and he certainly is a most humane, kindly, and benevolent person—no</p>

                  </hi> I have known Mr. Munro since I was ap<lb></lb>pointed Colonel of the Royal Horse Guards, about six or seven years—I have had full opportunities of ascertaining the character which he has sus<lb></lb>tained as an officer in that regiment—it is my duty to inquire into the con<lb></lb>duct of all the officers belonging to that regiment—I found this gentle<lb></lb>man adjutant of the regiment, having entered it as a private, he ob<lb></lb>tained all his steps by the excellence of his conduct, until finally he became adjutant—as adjutant, he was respected and esteemed by all the officers of it, and he was beloved and respected, and full confidence was placed in him by all the men under his command—he conducted himself throughout as well as it was possible that a man could do.</p>

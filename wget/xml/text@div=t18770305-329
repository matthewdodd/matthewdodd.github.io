I am barman at the King John's Head, Bermondsey Square—on 31st January, about 11.15 p.m., I served the prisoner with 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy—he put a half-sovereign on the engine, and I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he then said "Was it a half-sovereign I gave you? I thought it was a sixpence"—I said "If you don't require the silver I will give you the gold back"—he said "Very likely the small change will be more handy to you, and the gold will be handy to me"—I had put the half-sovereign on the counter, and he put down the change, putting a shilling instead of the 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then said "Perhaps you will not object to give me a sovereign for it"—I asked my master for a sovereign; he gave me one out of his pocket, which I gave to the prisoner, and took up the silver and the half-sovereign—the prisoner went out, and I informed the police—on 16th February 1 went to the station, and picked the prisoner out from seven or eight others—he said "Mind you don't make a mistake, because it is a very serious.</p>

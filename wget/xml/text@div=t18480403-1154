                  </hi> I am apprentice to William Topley, a grocer and cheesemonger. On 4th March, between nine and ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came and asked for a pound of soap—I missed a piece of pork—it was proposed that all present should be searched—the prisoner kept her shawl close—I pulled her away from the counter, and saw the pork behind her, partly concealed by her shawl, held up by her hand—it was about two steps from where it had been before.</p>

I am foreman of the Government Drainage Works—on Wednesday, 28th January, I was in the Hainault Arms public-house, Rom<lb></lb>ford Road, about 12 o'clock; it was a frosty day, and we could not go to work—I had come from Bedfordshire about three weeks before to look for work—at about 11 p.m. I was in the tap-room, where I saw both the prisoners—I knew Harding before; I paid for some beer for them—there was another with them, and I paid for some ginger-beer for him; I had a little over 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me in silver in a small bag—I am not sure whether I took the money for the beer from the bag; I left the public-house a little befor 11 o'clock—Fenton and the other man left a little before me, and Harding came out after me—when I had got about a quarter of a mile some one came behind me, and pushed, or knocked me into the hedge—one man held me down, while another took my watch and guard and money—my watch was a double cased silver, and the guard was silver, with a seal and swivel to it—I had two keys in my pocket; one belonging to a box, and one to a padlock; they were on a ring in my bag with the silver; they ran away in the direction of Chigwell Road, towards the public-house again—next morning I went to the police-station, and told them what had happened—on the 30th I was shown Fenton amongst a number of others, and picked him out; about a day after Harding was shown to me; I picked him out—I have no doubt about the prisoners being the men—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); here are my initials on it; the swivel is broken off—I described it to the police.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) In March last the prisoner was in my service, and in consequence of what I heard I went to his lodging, accompanied by a policeman named Fletcher, who is gone into the country, and a witness—they searched his lodging before me—they searched a trunk, and found a great deal of property—five shirts, two waistcoats, six or seven pairs of silk stockings, dirty, but when I lost them they were new—two or three pairs I had never worn, but the others I had worn some time—they were all dirty when I found them—I also found a pair of boots and two pairs of shoes—I found some other articles which I had given him—there were two books—the first visit I paid I brought away a pair of boots and a book—the others I did not take away because they were dirty, but I told the policeman they belonged to me—I found an officer's sash in his trunk—I had never given him that nor the stockings, nor boots—I found a good many things which I had given him—I said, "These I gave you, but the others you took from me"—every thing in the trunk belonged to me, but some I had given him—(<hi rend="italic">examining some articles</hi>)—here is one of the books—I never gave him that—he had no authority to take it to his lodging—here is another book belonging to me—and these boots I had only worn once—here is a dressing-gown which was new when he took it, and these silk stockings—I had never given any of these articles to him—I found a letter at the prisoner's the second time I went, which was about three weeks ago—I bought some land in Sicily—it is from that I derive my title in Italy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How then do you come to be a Count of the kingdom of Sicily? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I am a Sicilian, the land is in Sicily, and there my family are—</p>

               <p>two persons accompanied me on the second occasion to the prisoner's, the policeman Cooper, and a gentleman—I then found the articles produced, but not the quantity which I saw the first time—the other things were removed after the first time—the first time I went, the prisoner swore he had nothing else belonging to me in the trunk, but the second time I found a letter in the room he lodged in, hid in a hat-box—the prisoner had sum<lb></lb>moned me for his wages.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he go by your desire, to take care of another person abroad? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He went by my desire, but the prisoner had more desire than I had—as I was going to Paris, he said he would go with the lady—I desired him to do so—I did not give him one of these books to make himself acquainted with the French language—I looked for that book a good many times, and asked him for it—he was in my confidence in some things—the confidence of a servant—my name, Di Nuovo, has nothing to do with the name of my estate—these things must have been taken a long while before the pri<lb></lb>soner went to Paris with the lady—I know nothing about obtaining the lady's passport—I saw the prisoner in Paris about five months after I left this country—he did not ask me for any money for wages at that time, but he owed me thirty shillings before he went away—I took him into my ser<lb></lb>vice again when he came into this country—I told a friend that if he came over I would take him again—I did not then know any thing about my property being gone—I found out afterwards that he had pawned my plate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before he went to Paris, did not you accuse him of stealing a silver fork and spoon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A fork—I did not find it, but before the prison<lb></lb>er went away, he said he dare say I should find it down stain—I looked for it, but a servant in the house said she did not find it—I did not charge him with stealing a spoon—I have property which I derive from my land, and the banks of London and Paris—I told the prisoner when I got another apartment I should want a servant, and if he was there I would take him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell him you could not take him, as you were living in the house of a Dutchess? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told him that, and besides that if I had not another servant, I would take him—I told him to lodge at Mr. Belzoni's till I had a room to accommodate him—it was there I went and found the property—I did not tear up a number of his papers when I went there—I tore up one paper which had my direction on, where I lived in Italy—it was in my own hand-writing—I never told Belzoni I would employ all the counsel in England, and did not care if it cost me thousands of pounds, to be revenged on him—Belzoni told me that my servant was a thief—I told him the prisoner had robbed me of a great many things, and I would have him punished—Belzoni said, "You have got all possible reason now you see he is a thief, and you are in the right"—I have witnesses to prove that—I had the prisoner taken into custody directly after he summoned me to the Court of Requests for wages, in consequence of what the Commissioner said—I had been intimate with the lady I desired him to take to Paris for a year and a half—the prisoner was in my employ five or six days the second time, when I searched his lodging.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's lodging, with a search warrant—I searched his boxes—the prisoner was not there, he was in custody—I found property which the prosecutor claimed, among other things, these silk stockings, and other things—I went with the prosecutor—nobody could have opened the box but in my presence—I found it open when I got there—I had the key of it, which I got from the prisoner—I tried the lock, and it belonged to it—I found a letter in a hat-box.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 17, Duke-street, St. James's-square. The prisoner lodged in my attic—there is no back attic, but two front ones—he was in custody when the policeman came—it was his portmanteau the policeman opened—I was not at home when the policeman came—they were going away when I came in—I know they searched the portmanteau belonging to the prisoner.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you, by the prosecutor's desire, write to the prisoner at Paris, to say he might come over into his service again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he said, "I see the young man is looking for a situation, he applied to me for a character, I acknowledge he served me to my satisfaction, and write to say I am ready to take him in preference to another, he must come within fourteen days, I have no apartment at present—I am living with a Dutchess, tell him I am very vexed with that third person, and the way she left, and he will know who it is."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he tell you he would employ all the counsel in England, and would not care if it cost him three or four thousand to punish him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—on the Friday night I met him, and spoke to him—I said, "Sir, if you found the letters I am sorry for it, because the prisoner told me he never had such a letter, but the other things I have nothing to do with"—he said, "No matter what it is, I will employ all the lawyers in England, if it cost me three or four thousand, to have revenge on him"—he spoke in Italian.</p>

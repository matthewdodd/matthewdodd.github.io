On Wednesday, the 17th of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in, and asked for a bason of soup, which I gave him; it came to 1 s.; he asked to be trusted. When he came out he paid me for it; the shopwoman ran in to see if the spoon was there, and said it was gone. I instantly ran after him, caught him, and desired him to give me the spoon, which he did immediately, and I gave him in charge of a constable, who took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What spoon did he give you - A. A table and a teaspoon; the tea-spoon laid on a table in the room, and he had the table-spoon to eat his soup with.</p>

            . I am servant to the last witness; the prisoner came into the shop, and had a bason of soup. About ten minutes after that he asked for trust; I went into the back parlour, and asked Mrs. Anderton to trust him, as he said he knew her. She went into the soup-room, said she did not know him, and waited till he came out of the room; he then said he had found 1 s. to pay for it. As I came out of the parlour I saw him take the tablespoon, and immediately told Mrs. Anderton, who ran after him, and asked him for it. He gave it to her, and Plaistowe took him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and found the prosecutrix with the prisoner in Billiter-lane, close by the shop; she had the spoons, and gave them to me. I took him to the shop, and searched him, but found nothing on him. She gave me three spoons that he had given to her - two of them were her's.</p>

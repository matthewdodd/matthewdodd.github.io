These things were safe on my premises, on the 17th of January, and on the 6th of February, on looking through a crevice, I saw them on the prisoner's premises, which are next to mine; he <rs id="t18240218-108-deflabel608" type="occupation">calls himself a corn and coal dealer</rs>

I got a search-warrant on the 7th, and found them there - I know them by my mark, and one is an apple tree felly, which is very uncommon, and another has a number on it. We found the prisoner concealed up stairs, behind the bed curtains - he said he had bought them at Hounslow. My yard has a fence eight feet high, but there was a ladder on his premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. They were found in his yard - A. Yes; in his pig-sty; his house is about twenty yards from his yard. I had seen him on the premises after I missed them, which was on the 26th; there were about forty on a pile, which was all pulled down. I had not sold them, as I kept them for my own use. I never had an apple one before.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Collins, and know the fellies; I always sort them out, and put them on the piles, and on the 18th of January, I found the piles taken down - here is one made of crab apple tree; it is a very singular one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the prisoner's yard - A. Yes; they were found concealed in the pig-sty, and two boards put before the sty; he had not let the yard. I have seen him there since the 17th of January.</p>

            . I am a constable. Collins brought me a search-warrant. I found the prisoner concealed behind the bed, and found fourteen fellies and twenty spokes in the sty. He said he had bought them at Pidder's, at Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been to Hounslow - A. No. I know nothing of Pidder. I went into the bedroom once, without finding the prisoner - he was concealed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have not been on the premises for two months, and did not know that they were there.</p>

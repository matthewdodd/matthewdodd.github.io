            . I have known the prisoner four or five years. On the 4th of March, about ten at night, I was drinking at the Cock alehouse, and hearing a noise in the street, went out; I saw there the deceased, whom I knew very well, the prisoner and he went for man and wife. I saw him use her very ill; he struck her two or three times, and knocked her up against a window shutter by striking her on the side of the head, I be-believe, as hard as he could, as it seemed to me by her falling about. After that she said, If you strike me again I'll stab you. He made another blow at her, and immediately cried out, I am a dead man.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to them at this time?</p>
               <p>Eagle. I was very near them. He went into the Cock alehouse, I followed him, and clapped my hand over the wound till the surgeon came to dress it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live after this?</p>
               <p>Eagle. He lived about 14 or 15 days.</p>

The deceased came and asked her to go home; she said she would not, and he then struck her on the side of her head. He asked her the same again, and she said she would not; he then struck her again.

            . I am a surgeon, and dressed the deceased after he was in the infirmary at Westminster. The next morning after he had received the wound he bled a good deal, and the wound seemed to be deep. We opened it farther, and it bled more; we tied it up, and he did not bleed till the next day, when he bled through all his dressings, and then ceased bleeding for about ten days. After that time he bled often during two days, and as we could not stop the bleeding he died, I believe, on the 21st day of that month.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was the occasion of his death ?</p>
               <p>Curtise. To be sure this wound was. He was in a very bad habit of body before; for he did not look well at all.</p>

               <p>We had been at supper, and had no words till we came to this door, where he struck me and knocked me down. I know nothing at all of it, and had never a knife about me.</p>

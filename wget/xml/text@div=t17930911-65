             sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner at the bar, he was formerly a drayman to my brewery, he lives in Conway-street, he is what they call a <rs id="t17930911-65-deflabel355" type="occupation">firkin man, he buys beer of the brewers and retails it to his customers</rs>

I had long suspected Scott of being dishonest, of stealing casks, in consequence of the suspicion I went to his premises on Saturday, the 31st of August, I found a large quantity of our casks, they were of different sizes, I saw six kilderkins there, they have the mark of Kirkman on them, the property of the gentlemen carrying on the brewhouse now; the names are mentioned in the indictment, when I found the casks, some were empty, and some were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that beer, the beer from your house? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt they are the property of that firm? - I am perfectly satisfied that they are the property of the firm.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he dealt at the brewhouse for beer lately? - Not lately,</p>
               <p>Q. Is any of the beer found in those casks, beer that come from your brewhouse? - I think not, if it was it was not by the knowledge of the proprietors, I never see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any knowledge at all in the manner in which such property could be taken from the brewhouse? - Either from the brewhouse or from the drays in the street; I believe they were taken from the drays, I found abundance of casks on the man's premises with the names chopt out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. They were found on this man's premises, I believe any body going by might see them? - Some were concealed and some were not, they were piled up.</p>
               <p>Q Do not you pile up your own casks? - When they are washed we pile them up.</p>
               <p>Q. This man dealt with you after he left your service on to the 23d of April? - I cannot say, he dealt with us so long as we chose to serve him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that? - I really don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know it was down to the end of April last?</p>
               <p>Court. Might not these be casks not returned? - We never sold him any beer in casks of this sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How do you know that? - I know from the mode of booking the casks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you superintend the booking of your own casks; - Sometimes I do, and sometimes I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to say that no agent in your house has delivered him casks of this size, might they not be out to people his customers, and afterwards returned, if you had made the enquiry?</p>
               <p>Court. Pray did you ever miss these casks? - No, surely I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you swear to these identical casks being on your premises since April? - No, I cannot.</p>

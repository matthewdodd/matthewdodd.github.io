Barnetts are out"—I did not unload the goods, but sent the van to deliver goods elsewhere, with instructions to come back—while the cart was away the prisoner came in—he seemed rather annoyed, and said, "Why were the goods not un loaded?" or something to that effect—he came straight in to me—I said, "Because I had instructions not to leave them without the money," and presented the invoice to him and left it with him—this is a copy of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not put that two and a half per cent on in the invoice—I also delivered this delivery order (<hi rend="italic">produced—Invoice read</hi>:—"London, November 8th, 1866, Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. James Hunter Tuck, who has a garden in Sloane-street; the prisoner was in his employ. On 6th July, about one o'clock in the day, in consequence of what Mr. Tuck had said to me, I told the prisoner I would go home with him and see those plants, which he said he had bought, whether they were Mr. Tuck's or not—he said</p>

               <p>he was willing for me to do so—I had not missed any plants—I went home with him, and on the copper in the washhouse found two verbenas, one fuschia, and one geranium, in pots—I knew them immediately—they, are Mr. Tuck's—he said he could assure me he had bought them—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner, and know Mr. Tuck's garden, in Sloane-street. On 6th July, about a quarter before seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at work there—I saw him again a little after nine—he asked me if I had seen any plants in the horse-radish, as he had some given him last night to take to Eaton-square, and instead of taking them, he had put them in the horse-radish, and took them at breakfast-time—I had seen them there about eight that morning—three of these produced were there—they had no business there—I went at half-past eight, and they were gone.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you lose. - A. A leaden weight on the 29th of August; about nine o'clock in the morning these men came into my house, they were there about an hour and a half, then they went away; I went out and was gone about an hour, when I returned I missed the clock weight; I found the weight at an iron shop in Wheeler street, I had every reason to suppose they had taken the weight.</p>
               <p>- BARNARD sworn. I live in Wheeler street, I keep an old iron shop; two brothers brought the weight, named Grant; being neighbours' children, I did not know but it was safe my buying it, I do not know Harris, I gave them two pence a-pound for it; having no money in the house I went out and sold it to Mrs. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Grant is the man that brought it to your house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. Q. You keep an old iron shop too. - A. Yes, in Purl street, Spital Fields; I purchased the weight of Mrs. Barnard.</p>
               <p>JOHN RAY sworn. On the 29th of August the prosecutor said that the two Grants had been to his house with Harris, and had stole the clock weight from him; he saw them as he was coming down Wheeler street, they ran away from him; I went to Mrs. Barnard, I asked her if the Grants had been there with a clock weight, she said they had, she had not money enough to pay for the weight, she sold it; I produce the weight.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have every reason to believe it is mine.</p>
               <p>Grant's Defence. Mrs. Barnard swore at the office that this weight weighed fourteen or fifteen pounds, and now she says she gave two pence a-pound for it; at the office she said she gave three pence. God knows, I did not sell it.</p>
               <p>Harris's Defence. These men and I drank two pots of beer together, I never saw them afterwards till I was taken up; I am as innocent as any body that stands round here.</p>

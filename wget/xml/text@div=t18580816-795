                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Linnett, and keep a chandler's-shop at 83, Cromer-street, Gray's-inn-road—on Thursday, the 8th of July, my house was broken into—I went to bed at 12 o'clock at night, after shutting up—the back-parlour window was quite safe and fastened—the servant woke me up at 6 o'clock in the morning—when I went down, I saw that the window had been broken open—I missed the cash-box, which had contained 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and some coppers; there were three halfpence on a shelf, which I had taken the day before and put up there, because they were three remarkable half<lb></lb>pence—on the table there were two plates, two knives, two glasses, and a jug; I had left the table quite clear of all those things when I went to bed—some small beer had teen drawn out of a cask in the shop; there was a cherry-pie, that was every bit gone; a cushion of bacon had been picked and the bone laid down on the floor—the three coppers I could swear to; I told the police so: they are now before me: one has a hole in it, it is not a round hole, nor yet a square one; another has D. F. upon it.</p>

At a quarter past 5 on the morning of the 9th July, I saw the prisoners crossing the New-road near King's-cross; on looking at them their eyes dropped and they appeared to be very fidgetty—in consequence of what a constable in St. Pancras-road said I went after them, and in Weston-place I saw something pass from one to the other—Smith ran away, and I after him through several streets; in the course of the running I heard the jingling of copper, and I followed him into a coffee-shop in Wilsted-street—I asked him for the coppers in his pocket, he said he had none; I searched him, and in his trowsers pocket I found a sovereign, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a penny in copper—when I took the sovereign he said, "Mind the <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>, do not lose that."—I took off his boots and there were the marks of garden-soil on his feet—I asked where he got the money, and he said by selling fruit in Holbora; and he was going to Somers-town—I directed another constable to take him to the police<lb></lb>station, and when I came back through the Brill I found the other prisoner in custody—they were charged at the Clerkenwell police-court with having stolen money in their possession, and remanded—constable Brown after<lb></lb>wards reported at the station the robbery at Mrs. Linnett's—I went to her house, and she identified the coppers that were taken from Smith.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you swear to the property? - A. One shilling I noticed very particularly; the officer then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120054"></xptr>went to his bed-room, and returned in a short time with the note.</p>

             sworn - I am an officer in the parish of St. George, Hackney; the prosecutor told me, on the 30th, that his house had been robbed on the preceding evening; I went home and told my daughter; she told me she saw the prisoner at the bar on the preceding evening, lurking about the house; in consequence of that, we went to the prisoner's lodgings, and told him we had suspicion of him, and if he was innocent, he could have no objection to being searched; he took the silver out of his pocket and threw it down; the prosecutor looked over it, and said he could swear to one shilling, which was in the money he had lost; I went up into his bed-room, and after some little searching I found this note I now produce, under the carpet by his bed side. I then took him into custody. (The money and notes produced.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Can you swear to that note? - A. I can swear to the endorsing at the back of the note, it is the only one I received that day; and this shilling, there is a little nick on the side of it; there was all the money found on him but one shilling.</p>

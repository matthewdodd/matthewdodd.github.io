                  </hi>. I am a hardware man, and live at No. 10, Sandys'<lb></lb>row, Bishopsgate-street. On Saturday night, 9th Feb., I was going along Norton Folgate with Mrs. Cohen, about half past 9 o'clock, I had a small parcel in each hand—when I got opposite the City Theatre I saw the prisoner in company with another man who has been tried to-day—I saw them together when I saw them first—it was where there are two shoemaker's shops close together, and the light was so brilliant, it was as light as it is now—their appearance was so suspicious that I said to my wife, "Is your purse safe I"—they walked away together, talking—I walked on with my wife—when we came to the corner of Spital-square the same two men were together, front<lb></lb>ing me—the other one was closer to me than the prisoner was—I parted with my wife, as there is a lamp post which is, not quite at the kerb—I passed at the road side, and my wife at the inner side, and at that very moment the shortest of the two men stooped his head and struck me in the stomach—I stopped at the moment, and he immediately snatched my gold spectacles from my nose—they were worth from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—immediately he did so he made a start, and he said to the prisoner, "It is all right," and he crossed the road towards Primrose-street—I threw my two parcels at the feet of my wife and went after him—the prisoner immediately seized me, and said, "That is not the man that has got your spectacles, the man that has got them has gone that way," pointing with his finger towards London Bridge—I said, "I know the man who has got my spectacles, but you were with him, and I shall detain you"—he had his arm half round my body—I</p>

On Saturday evening, 9th Feb., I was walking with him in Norton Folgate, about half past 9 o'clock—as we passed the City Theatre I saw the prisoner and another person with him—my husband said to me, "Sarah, is your purse all right?"—I said, "Yes, I have it in my bosom"—we walked on towards Spital<lb></lb>square, and at the corner we changed, I was inside, and my husband out<lb></lb>side—the two men were in the road, speaking together—when we came to Spital-square I saw the other young man make a snatch at my husband—my husband threw down the parcels, and the other one laid, "It is all right"—I stooped on the pavement and picked up the parcels—my husband immediately ran after the other—this prisoner ran towards my husband, and seized him—I kept my eye on them, and. there was a desperate struggle—my husband called out "Police!"—and I called "Police!"—there was a great crowd about—the policeman came and took the prisoner—I have seen the other man since—I saw him last Saturday in Newgate—that man and this man were together.</p>

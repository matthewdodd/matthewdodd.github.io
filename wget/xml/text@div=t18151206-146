            , who lives in the house himself; the prisoner lodged in the same room with me. On the day in the indictment, he was sitting in the cold, in the room, and would not move, for several days, he had not left the appartment. I told him he had better take a run round the square, but that he declined, saying, that he had some halfpence, and if I would lend him two or three, he would be able to get half a peck of coals. I went to get change of a one pound note, and when I came back, I could not get the halfpence out of my pocket, and put my pocket-book down on the bench, while I got them out. I forgot to put my pocket-book into my pocket again, and then went up to work again. In about two or three hours, I put my hand in my pocket, and missed my pocket-book. Filled with terror, I ran down frightened, and looked upon the bench, where I remembered I had left it, but it was gone; and the prisoner was gone too. There was a most excellent fire in the room, and plenty of victuals, and I am sure the prisoner would not have quit them, unless it was for something better. He came home about eleven o'clock that night, drunk; and I know he had no money to buy liquor. I sent for an officer, and had him taken into custody; but we found nothing on him.</p>

            . I am an officer, and I went up with Hutchins, the landlord, to where the prisoner was, but knew nothing of it until then. The landlord pulled him out of bed; and I asked him what he had done with the pocket-book? and he asked me what pocket-book? and I told him the pocketbook with the three notes in; and he said if he had it, he would keep it.</p>

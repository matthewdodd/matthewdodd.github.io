               <p>Q. Where did you lose these?</p>
               <p>Bruton. In my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that part of your dwelling-house ,</p>
               <p>Bruton. Yes , it is part of my dwelling house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you lose them?</p>
               <p>Bruton. Between five and six at night, the Prisoner came to my house about four o clock, and asked for one Mrs. Gardner, who did live in Queen Street; I used to frequent the shop when she lived there, and used to see the Prisoner there, and as one was Shropshire, and the other Herefordshire , we used to call one another country folk; when he came in, he asked to sit down; I had some mutton chops for dinner, and I thought he would have gone; he said he had good news to tell Mrs. Gardner, for he had an estate of 90 l. a year left him, which was to come to him at Christmas, and then he said he should want a watch. I said I had got a watch that I must dispose of; he desired to see it; I gave it him into his hand, and he seemed to like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver it into his hand?</p>
               <p>Bruton. Yes, but he delivered it to me again, and desired I would keep it till Lady-day, and he would have it; I said I would lock it up, and keep it till Lady-day, and it should not see sun or moon till that time, and I locked it up in a chest of drawers that I have in the shop; then I went to broil the stakes, and he went into the little back room where I broiled them; the Prisoner sat still, but I expected him to go; said I, you plead a good deal of poverty, if you will stay and eat a stake you are welcome; said I, I have no beer in the house, and I asked him to go for a mug of beer; he said that he was so well known, that he did not care to be seen: He came out of the little room, and said it is time to go for the beer, for your stakes will be burnt; I went out to bespeak it, and left him in the room, not thinking the fellow would rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the same room when you came back?</p>
               <p>Bruton. Yes , but he had been very busy while I was gone; then he went out, as I thought he might do , upon a necessary occasion .</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go into any yard of yours, or into the street?</p>
               <p>Bruton. I do not know whether he went out of the shop; I thought he staid longer than he had need to do, but he did not return; I folded up my things, mended the fire, and went into the shop,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801150023"></xptr> when, to my great surprize, I found these gloves rolled up as they are now in the shop; I turned to the place where my watch was, and found my watch was gone, and several other things, which were in the drawer; then I went to another drawer that was unlocked, and found that all my linen was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the drawer where you put the watch locked?</p>
               <p>Bruton. I am positively sure that the drawer, where the watch was, was locked. I did not know what to do, or how to find this man, for he never was in my house before, only as I knew him at Mrs. Gardner's ; I went to Mrs. Gardner's to inquire after him, and she said he used some houses, which I went to.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take him?</p>
               <p>Bruton. I took him at the George in St. Martin's Legrand, the Wednesday night after, I take it to be the 23d of December; I had been to seek for a constable, but could not get one; there were several gentlemen there, and I desired they would assist me to take a thief; I spoke loud, for I speak pretty loud sometimes. The Prisoner dropped the watch under the bench, but I did not see him drop it; he asked me what I wanted with him, I said my silver watch; he wanted to go home to my house, and he said he would make me sensible that he had not robbed me; said I, Will not you run away from me? he said he would not; so I went out with him, and got him to a gentleman's house by Honey-Lane market, and had him secured. I asked him where the watch was, he said it was under the bench at the

             ; I went there, and the watch was taken up; they had got a constable to take the watch up, and he delivered it into the hands of the woman of the house. The Prisoner owned the fact before several people.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this that you carried him to?</p>
               <p>Bruton . To Mr. Bird's , by Honey-Lane market. We went to demand the , watch, and the woman at the George would not show it us. I said to the Prisoner, You rogue , you have robbed me of my watch , and all my linen. The Prisoner lodged in Dove-Court , and his landlady said, if I would not do him any harm she would bring some of the things to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your things again?</p>
               <p>Bruton . I have them in part.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the rest ?</p>
               <p>Bruton . He said he was obliged to sell them, for he had been out of business a great while, and was poverty struck, and could not help doing what he did .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry him before a Magistrate?</p>
               <p>Bruton. I carried him before the Sitting-Alderman on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess any thing else?</p>
               <p>Bruton. He said it was my watch, that he had taken the string off it, and put another on.</p>
               <p>The watch was produced, and Mrs. Bruton swore it to be her property ; there were two seals to it, but one was not hers .</p>

            . I am a constable in the liberty of St. Martin's Legrand ; I was sent for to the George in St. Martin's Legrand, the 23d of December, about four o'clock I believe: When I came in, there was a watch lay upon the ground between the bench and the table; they desired me to take it up, which I did, and delivered it to the woman of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never shewn it to Mrs. Bruton since?</p>
               <p>Francis. Yes, before the Alderman, and she knew it presently. This is the watch I found under the table, and the Prisoner said that this was Mrs. Bruton's watch, and that he had taken the string off, and put another on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said she did not, and could not know it till I owned it.</p>

             . One Wednesday night I heard the Prisoner say the watch was Mrs. Bruton's, and that he dropped it at the sign of the George; I went with the Prosecutrix and Mr. Bird there, and the landlady would not shew it, but when we came before the Alderman, she produced it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been forty years in service, and never had any thing laid to my charge. Mrs. Bruton said, if I would eat a pound of stakes, she would treat me; I said I could not stay, but I did; she said she had no small beer in the house, so I went for a pot of beer, but the stakes were not come, and Moll Best was the girl that fetched the stakes, for Mrs. Bruton never went out of the house. I cannot say that I honestly bought the watch and paid for it, but I honestly agreed with her for it, and shewed it to a watchmaker, and he said it was not worth thirty shillings : I was to pay her so much a week, or the whole at the quarter's end, and I was to give her 5 l. 10 s. for it; she gave me four or five quarterns of gin, and I was drunk that night and lost my hat and wig; she often wanted me to come and see her when she lived in Cannon-Street , for she kept a shop there . I have no friends here. I lived seven years with Dr. Collins of Walthamstow as a footman, and in many other good places.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachmaker, and superintendent of the carriage department of the London and Birmingham Railway—one of my factories is in Gough-street, St. Pancras. The prisoner has been in my employ sixteen years—he was foreman of the wheelwright department—when I purchased timber he had to examine it, and give it to the men to make up, and when the wheels were done he had to pass them for payment—when coaches came in from different places and inns, he had to examine the wheels, and see if they were fit to go out—if so, they were washed, and sent out; if not, they were taken off, and other wheels put on—the old ones were put by to be repaired or sold—if customers came for them they were referred to the prisoner, he having the charge of the stock of wheels—it was for him to put the value on these, and, having agreed with the parties, he was to take them to the counting-house, to pay the money before the wheels left the premises—he was never to sell off the premises—I never allowed any old wheels or old metals to be sold on credit—on the 25th of Sept., from information I had received, I questioned my workmen, and I had an interview with Stocker in the counting-house—from information he gave me, I sent for the prisoner—Stocker was in an inner part of the counting-house, behind a screen—he was not seen by the prisoner—I asked the prisoner about a set of blue wheels—he said he did not recollect where these blue wheels went—he denied any knowledge of them—I then turned to Stocker, and said, "You took the wheels, did not you?"—then the prisoner said he did recollect they went to Hood's—I asked what he had done with the money—he was confused, and said he had not paid it in—he at first said, when Mr. Hood had any wheels he paid the money into the counting-house, but for these particular wheels he had not paid it in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there no instance of second<lb></lb>hand wheels being sold without the money being paid for them before they left the premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not with my sanction—I do not know that it has often taken place—I have forbidden it—I did not on a former occasion say if the prisoner brought the money to me I never should have prosecuted him—. If he had brought the parties who purchased them, and paid over the money, it would have been all right—he had a perfect right to see what wheels were fit to be worked, and to sell those that were not—I never knew that Hood had bought wheels of me—I am not aware that Hood's name is in my books—I have not looked to see—I keep people to look to my books—I know these wheels were sent by one of my men, in the middle of the day, to Hood's—my business is very large—I have known instances in which money has been Paid at the counting-house about which I have inquired of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not charge him with receiving 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for twenty wheels, and then find the account had been paid, and that it did not appear on your books?, <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that was a subject of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not charge him with having taken it—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184610260028"></xptr>
               <p>do not remember whether the book was searched to see if we could find the money for these wheels—Stocker was concealed behind a curtain by my suggestion—he was the man who carried these wheels to Hood's—the pri<lb></lb>soner did not recollect who the wheels went to, but he recollected they were gone, and when Stocker was brought out he said, "I recollect I did send them to Hood"—I sent Mr. Collison down to Maidstone about the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILDE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are aware that the prisoner sent out one of yoir own men in the day-time with these four wheels? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was part of his business to send out men with wheels, for my various coaches at different esta<lb></lb>blishments—if the men were sent out in open day it created no suspicion—formerly I had a great number of coaches came in at different offices in Lon<lb></lb>don—wheels were taken out in my own service—my sons manage my busi<lb></lb>ness—I do not know the present Mr. Hood—I never saw him before—his father I have sold many a wheel to—if wheels have been sold on credit, it has been entirely against my rules.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Wright, and have been for twelve years—the prisoner was foreman of the wheelwright department—I rememer in July taking a set of blue wheels to Hood's—they came off the Dorking coach—the prisoner gave directions to me to take them—it was part of my duty to obey his orders.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>years—the prisoner was superintendent of the wheelwright department—the parties requiring old wheels came to the premises and saw the prisoner, who was the foreman—they dealt with him, and paid him the money generally in the yard—it was his duty to bring the money into the counting-house to me, and it was my duty to enter it in the cash-book—I recollect an inquiry about four blue wheels off the Dorking coach, on the 25th of Sept.—the prisoner stated he sent away the wheels and received the money, and he had not brought the money into the counting-house, as be ought to have done—the book was produced to see what sums for wheels had been received for some time back—the prisoner said he had sold the wheels, and I understood him to say Mr. Hood had received them, and that he had received the money, and not accounted for it.</p>

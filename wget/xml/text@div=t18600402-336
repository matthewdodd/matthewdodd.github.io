I was in wa✗ts's shop that evening—I heard the prisoner ask for six cigars, and he offered the sovereign; he put on the cigar case—when Mr. Watts took it up, he said it was bad and gave it to I me—it appeared to me to be too light to be good—I am sure the prisoner is the person; I knew him before from working in the neighbourhood.</p>

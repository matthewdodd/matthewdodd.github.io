               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you insulted before you attacked me or not? A. I did not attack him; nobody insulted me, but him and the other man.</p>

            , JUN. I live in Pear-tree-court, Clerkenwell - my father is a porter at the Castle and Falcon; I am fifteen years old. I saw the prisoner, and the other man, attack Price, and begin to fight with him; the prisoner hit him in the mouth; he had not spoken to them; he was knocked down, and both kept kicking him while he was down, and hitting him; when he got up his hat was gone; nobody was near enough to take it, but these two - the prisoner was secured before he got out of sight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not run after me, and take my cap off my head, and call me names? A. No, quite the reverse; he called me bad names; he had taken my cap, and I asked him for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Price interfere on your account? A. Why, he says he saw my cap taken, but he did not interfere till he was attacked himself; I was following them to get my cap when Price was attacked.</p>

            . I live in Bishop's-court, Aylesbury-street, and work at a glass-cutter's. I was with Baxenden.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150041"></xptr>I saw the prisoner, and another young man in a long-tailed blue coat; one ran before, and the other behind Price, and began whapping him; he fell down, and they were both on the top of him; they kept fighting in order to get from him; he had not touched them; he held them till a man came by with a load, and then let one go, but held the prisoner; nobody but them were near enough to take his hat; it was not found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not Price catch hold of my shirt, before I touched him? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down John's-row; three lads stood by the wall, a young man took off one of their caps; they followed, and abused me - Price caught hold of me while I was intending to hit them, for saying I stole their cap; he said, at Worship-street, that the other man took his hat.</p>
               <p>T. PRICE re-examined. The man who came up with the laths, helped me to secure the prisoner; I had seen the tallest man snatch a cap off one of these boys' heads; but I did not interfere.</p>

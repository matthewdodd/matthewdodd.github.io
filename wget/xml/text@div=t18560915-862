                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police inspector</hi>). On the evening of 2nd Sept., a few minutes before 9 o'clock, I was in a galley on the river, near the Custom House—I know Banks as a waterman—I saw him there in a boat—he went to a barge that was lying afloat off the Custom House—I afterwards ascertained that barge to be the <hi rend="italic">Lord Clarendon</hi>—whilst he was proceeding there, I heard a whistle; it appeared to come from the direction of the barge—Banks then rowed his boat to the barge—I heard some one stumble from off the barge's cabin bead into the boat—Banks then rowed his boat ashore to the East Custom House-stairs—I saw that there was then a second person in it—when the boat got to the stain, that person jumped from the boat, and ran towards the steps leading to the street—that man was Bryant—he was stopped, and brought back—he smelt very strongly of rum—he had been drinking, but was not affected by it—he appeared to be quite conscious of what he was doing—he ran very nimbly from the boat, much more so than a drunken man could have done, for about fifteen yards—I asked Banks whom he had brought ashore—he said, "I don't know; I plied him as a fare from the stairs"—I said, "I know better, for I saw where you rowed your boat from, and you know all about it"—he said, no, he did not—he had not rowed from the stairs, but from between the two stairs, about the centre of the Custom House—I told him so—he then said, "Well, I know I did for I was waiting for him"—I then sent the constable, Dell, off to the <hi rend="italic">Lord Clarendon</hi> barge, and afterwards went myself; I saw Sholl there—he was the Custom House officer in charge of the barge—Dell said to me, in his hearing, "Mr. Thomas, there is a white bundle in the hold"—I asked Sholl who he was—he said, "I am the officer; is there anything <hi rend="italic">up</hi>?"—I said, "Yes; I have every reason to believe there has been a felony committed from the barge"—he said, Oh, impossible, it cannot be; there has been no one here but myself, and no one could get here without my knowing it"—I then asked him what the barge had in it—he said, "Tobacco leaves"—I said that I had two parties in custody on suspicion of stealing—I first showed him Bryant—he said, "I don know anything of him"—I then showed him Banks—he said, "Yes, I know him</p>

               <p>as a waterman, and that is all I know of him"—he appeared quite sober; he did not smell at all of liquor—I found no rum, or smell of turn, on board—I then proceeded to search the barge, in Sholl's presence—I found the hatches closed, the tarpaulins over the hatches, and the hatch bars over them, all apparently secure—I then went down into the cabin—I found the door leading from the cabin into the hold—the hatches being fast, that was the only way by which anybody could get into the hold—I found sprinkled on the steps of the cabin a quantity of small, broken tobacco leaf, and the same on the cabin floor, towards the door leading into the hold, and also from the door leading to the case containing tobacco—in the hold, and between the case and the door, about four feet within the door, I found a quantity of tobacco tied up in a white apron—I called Sholl's attention to these appearances—he said, "Well, it certainly does look very suspicious, very queer indeed; nobody could come here without my seeing them; I have been here by myself, as I told you before"—he then became very excited indeed—he was then in the hold along with me—I pointed out the bundle to him—he said he knew nothing at all about it; that was the first he had seen of it—I examined the cases in the hold—one was unsound, and broken—a piece of the case was broken off, and lying down on the barge's ceiling; the head of the case was partly raised, and there was a vacant space in the tobacco inside, of about six inches in depth; I judge that would be about 30lbs.—the case was about three feet six, square—I then took Bryant and Banks to the station, and in about an hour and a half returned to the barge—I found Sholl in the cabin—the cabin floor had then been swept, or rather the particles of leaves I had left, were all gone, and I said to him, "Why, the cabin floor has been swept since I have been away; have you swept it?"—he said, "No; it is not my place to sweep cabin floors"—I then walked into the hold, and saw the case, and said, "This case is not as I left it"—when I left it the piece was lying on the bottom of the barge's ceiling, and when I came back it was put on in its original place, as far as the nails would admit, and the tobacco in the case was lightened up, so as to give the case the appearance of being full—I said to him, "This case is not as I left it"—he said, "How can that be, when there has been nobody here but myself? you are a d—scoundrel, sir, for insinuating such a thing; I see what you want plainly; you want to get a case up against me"—I took a sample of the tobacco in the case, and afterwards compared it with some tobacco found on Bryant—it exactly corresponded—6 1/2 lbs. was found on Bryant—there was about 4lbs. in the apron—I reported to my superintendent, Mr. Evans, what had transpired, and, in consequence of his directions, I went two days afterwards to Sholl's resi<lb></lb>dence—I found him there, and told him that he must consider himself in custody—he said, "You don't mean that, do you?"—I said, "Yes"—he asked me whose authority, and what authority I had—I told him, "As a police inspector"—he said, "Where is your authority?"—I showed him my warrant card—he said, "I don't mean that; I want to know who sent you here?"—I said, "Superintendent Evans"—I told him I took him into cus<lb></lb>tody for being concerned, with two others in custody, in stealing 10lbs. of tobacco from a case in the barge <hi rend="italic">Lord Clarendon</hi>—he said, "It is a bad job; all I know about it is I was asleep"—I had seen him on the previous morning, Wednesday, standing at the corner of Water-lane, Thames-street he bade me "Good morning," and asked how I was getting on with the case—I said I was going before the Lord Mayor with the two prisoners—he said, "Well, it is a bad job; unfortunately I was asleep, but I don't like to</p>

               <p>tell the Board that"—that was the first he said about being asleep—I found nobody on board the barge but him at first, except Dell, the constable, whom I had sent there—the barge will carry from sixty-five to seventy tons; it is nearly as long as this Court; it is a river barge, with a cabin at one end, rather raised above the deck—you enter it by a little scuttle, or hatchway—his place would be in the cabin, or on deck, I suppose.</p>

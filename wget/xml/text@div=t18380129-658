                  </hi>. I am a leatherseller, and live at No. 187, Union-street, Borough. The prisoner was in my service—he was formerly in, my warehouse, but last year he ceased to be in my warehouse, and became my collector—he had authority to receive money on my account—it was his duty to keep a book to enter accounts of what he received—the monies he received were to be entered the evening of the same day, if he was home before the warehouse closed, if not, the first thing next morning—he left me about three months since of his own accord, being in some difficulty at that time—I was not aware that there was any deficiency in his accounts—I had a customer of the name of Hartley—he never accounted to me for the sum of 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., received from Mr. Hartley on the 24th of May, nor for 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., received from the same gentleman on the 7th of June—I had a cus<lb></lb>tomer of the name of Thomas Sale—the prisoner did not account for the receipt of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., received from him on the 2nd of June—he accounted for 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was he paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Within the last eight or nine months, at his own request, I have allowed him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, on all sums he col<lb></lb>lected, in the room of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, which I allowed him previously.</p>

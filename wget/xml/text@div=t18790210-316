'—he is a marine-store dealer, and has a shop in Wellington Street, Deptford—he said "It is no use going there; why, they would not bring coffee to me; they would take it to the coffee roaster's"—I said "As you deny buying it I shall have to take you into custody for receiving it"—he said "Let me speak to the old man"—he went into the house and had some conversation with Green, and then came out and said "The old man has bought it; he let two men leave it there when I was out"—we then proceeded to go to the shop in Wellington Street, Deptford—when at Blackheath Hill Jones called me on one side and said "Are you going to lock me up?" I said "We shall see"—he pulled two sovereigns out of his pocket and said "Take this"—we then went on to Wellington Street, and in the shop I told Green I should take him into custody—he said "I did not buy it it; I let two men leave it there"—I would not be sure whether he said "When Jones was out" or "When the governor was out; they asked me to let them leave it there"—at the station, on his seeing Sisson and Robinson, he said "I cannot say that they are the men, but they are very much like them"—I said "They are the two men who are charged with stealing the coffee"—I should say 74, New Street, is about 500 or 600 yards from Watergate, and 96, Watergate Street, would be about 1,000 yards, and the shop in Wellington Street would be about a quarter of a mile—I received a piece of pork from each of the women, Kirby, Podbury, and Lill.</p>

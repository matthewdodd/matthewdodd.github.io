                  </hi>. I am now residing with my father at 1, Brunswick-street, Hackney-road—I was fifteen years old on 27th of last March—I remember going to the Garrick Theatre last Whitsun Tuesday by permission of my father—I left the Garrick Theatre about half-past 11—I saw the prisoner, about twenty minutes to 12—I was then with a young man who had taken me to the theatre—I asked him whether he would excuse me for a few minutes—the prisoner was not capable of hearing what I said to my friend—I then left him, went to the prisoner, and went home with him to 7, Hatfield-street—he is a married man, and has two children—I remained with the prisoner a fortnight—during that time we were living as man and wife—his wife was not living at Hatfield-street then—after that time I went home to my parents—my father met with me, and took me home—I afterwards went back to the prisoner, and my father took me home again—I had not met the prisoner by arrangement—he had asked me to live with him before I went with him that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter at Hackney—the last witness is my daughter; she was fifteen on the 27th of last March—up to the time of this occurrence she had lived with me and her mother—the prisoner was a visitor at my house—he used to bring his wife to my house—Both of them were visitors frequently—I gave my daughter permission to go with Mr. Holding to the Garrick Theatre—I never consented that she should go away with the prisoner—I have always forbidden it, and he knows it—I sat up for my daughter on the night she went with Mr. Holding till after 1 o'clock—I know a public-house which the prisoner was in the habit of frequenting—I used to frequent it myself at one time till the landlord left—I went to that public-house from day to day to find him, from the Wednesday up to the Saturday—I saw him every night, and he denied all knowledge of the child until I threatened to put it into the hands of the police; then he came round to my house on the Sunday afternoon, and told me that he had seen the party where she was residing, and had made arrangements for me to see her at half-past 8 on Sunday night, opposite St. Luke's Church; I went and saw her and took her home to my house, but she went off again when I left' the room a short time, and J never saw her again till the following Sunday, at a lodging—first I saw Culmer at the King John, and gave him in charge—the second time I found her she was at the prisoner's lodging in Hat field-street.</p>

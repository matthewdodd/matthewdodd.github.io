                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Margaret-terrace, Westminster—about one o'clock on the morning of the 8th of Nov. I was returning from my sister-in-law's in William-place, William-street, Pitt-street, Old Kent-road, with my wife, my sister-in-law, and cousin Archibald Penny-cook—I saw a mob at the end of William-street fighting—we had to pass them, and could not do so without touching them—Pennycook was walking a-head of me, and was struck on the hat, I believe by Carrington, but I am not posi<lb></lb>tive—I came up within a foot of him—Appleton asked me what I wanted—I said I wanted to pass—I received a blow from him on the left side of the chest and fell—I rose again, and he struck me, and at the same time caught my watch-guard, which was hanging from my waistcoat-pocket, and ran away with it, watch and all—as I was pursuing him, I believe Carrington gave me a blow or a shove, and I went up against the wall—I did not fall down, but ran again, and was surrounded by the mob—I called "Police!" and "Stop thief!" as bard as I could—the policeman came—I told him I had been robbed of my watch and guard—I could not see Appleton at that time, but I saw Carrington, who was one of the party that shoved me as I was pur<lb></lb>suing Appleton, and I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coach-maker, and live in St. Margaret's-terrace, Westminster. I was in the company of the prosecutor and his wife, going along the corner of William-street, about a quarter to one o'clock—there was a mob—when we got up to the people I heard some words, "<hi rend="italic">Go it, Scotty,</hi>" or something—I made a halt, because I could not pass without interfering—Appleton came and asked what I wanted—I said I wanted nothing—"Then," said he, "do you want to fight?"—I said, "No"—"What do you want?" said he—I said, "I want nothing but to pass"—he then left me on the left, and I received a blow on my hat, and, turning round, I observed Nicholls with his hand up, and down again on my hat, and so on followed the rest that were round me; as many as could get round me struck my hat—Phillips roared out "Police," and ran off calling "Police"—I leaped out from among them, and ran after him—I stopped at the head of the street—a policeman came up—Phillips told him he had had his watch taken from him—Carrington came and inquired what was the matter, and was given in charge—Appleton then came forward and made the same inquiry, and he was taken.</p>

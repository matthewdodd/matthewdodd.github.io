            . I am a harness-maker, and live in Northampton-street, Clerkenwell. I bought three bridles and a pair of reins, of the prisoner, for 13 s., on Tuesday, the 10th of April - another man came with him. I had bought of him before, and knew he had lived at Sadler's Repository, I exposed them at my door for sale, and

I asked the prisoner how he came by them - he said, honestly - that they did belong to Captain Robinson, who had absconded, and his family had them to sell.</p>

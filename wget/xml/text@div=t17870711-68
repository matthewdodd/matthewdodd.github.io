               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did I hear you correctly say, that you saw him drop the handkerchiefs? - Yes, withoutside the shop.</p>
               <p>I will tell you why I ask you that question? - I cannot be confounded if you ask me a reasonable question.</p>
               <p>Did you say all this before the magistrate? - Partly.</p>
               <p>Say what part you did say, and what part you did not say? - I really cannot recollect what I did say.</p>
               <p>But pray do recollect particularly? - I said something to the same purpose.</p>
               <p>Did you say one syllable before the magistrate about this man's dropping any thing? - That I swear positively, I mentioned that Miss Caps had a suspicion of of him.</p>
               <p>You are sure however, you particularly told the Magistrate, that you saw the handkerchiefs drop from him? - I did mention it to the magistrate.</p>

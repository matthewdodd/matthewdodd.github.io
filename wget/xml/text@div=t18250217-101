I frequently missed silk. On Monday, the 17th of January, I missed one skein of silk, from a nail in the dye-house, where I had put it a few days before. I had all the workmen searched that night. Mr. Newton took two skiens of silk from him: they fell from his small-clothes as he was searching him. The prisoner said at first, it was not him. I then sent Thomas for an officer. He desired to speak to me alone: I told him to speak before all the people; he then said, it was the first time, and it was a d - d b - h of a woman who persuaded him to do it. The watchman afterwards found some silk in the street, and the officer found more in his coat pocket.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Sodo &amp; Co., and was present when the prisoner was searched - I found no silk on any other person. There were about fifty workmen. The prisoner took off his shirt, and having put it on again, I desired him to let down his trowsers, which he did; and, in the act of putting them up again, I found a skein of silk at his feet, and another fell from his person. He said, it was his first offence, and implored forgiveness.</p>

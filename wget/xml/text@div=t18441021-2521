                  </hi>. I live with my mother, who keeps the King's Head, Ux<lb></lb>bridge-road. On Saturday evening, the 12th of Oct, the prisoner came and asked for half a pint of beer, which came to a penny—I watched him—he gave me a sixpence—my mother gave me a groat and a penny to give him change, which I did, and he went away—directly after he had gone my mother called my attention to the sixpence—I wrapped it up in a piece of paper, separate from other coin, and went out after the prisoner, accompanied by Bunce—I overtook him at the Red Lion, at Southall, about a mile or a mile and a half from our house—he was just taking some change from the bar at the Red Lion—I let him pass me, and spoke to the bar<lb></lb>woman—he was after<lb></lb>wards stopped by the police—I came up and asked him if he recollected having half a pint of beer down at the parish of Hayes—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Did you have a fourpenny-piece and a penny in change?"—he said, "Yes"—he was then given in charge—I saw his left hand go to his pocket, and drop some coin by his side, which Bunce picked up.</p>

               <p>My house was broke open; the cellar and the rest of the house were fast; it was about twelve when I went to bed, and at half past one the flap of the window was found moved out of its place; I found the prisoner Evans laying on the top of the butt; one of the watchmen and myself brought him down, and brought him into the tap-room, and tied his hands; I asked him what he did there, he made no answer; we took him to the compter; I said to Burdett, how came you to do this thing? and he fell a crying.</p>
               <p>Were these lads drunk or sober? - Sober, and very decent.</p>
               <p>How was the flap of the cellar window fastened? - With a smallish dog.</p>
               <p>How was that dog fastened? - I believe it was not much fastened, they might lift it up on the outside.</p>
               <p>How were the doors fastened? - Locked and bolted, and all very safe; and we came down stairs and unbolted them; there was but one dog, and that they some how or another got up.</p>
               <p>It was but badly fastened? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Will you describe a little more particularly the nature of this flap, does it project from the street, or is it flat on the pavement? - Flat on the pavement.</p>
               <p>Then upon this flap there are two doors I suppose? - No, only one.</p>
               <p>Then there is this put which you call a dog on the pavement; is there any communication from the cellar to your dwelling house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How lately before had that been opened to let down any liquor? - Upwards of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190085"></xptr> three weeks; I have been examined before Sir

            , and the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Then do you recollect telling my Lord Mayor that you really could not tell whether the brewer might not have left the door open? - I am sure it was fast, because I took hold of the bar to see, for we had been alarmed the night before.</p>
               <p>When you found these lads they were quite clean? - Yes, and very sober; I believe he had the same coat on he has now, and clean and decent; I found no implement of house breaking at all, nothing but a key atop of the cellar stairs; there is a door in the tap-room which we fasten at nights; therefore in order to get at any thing valuable in the house they must break through that door, except going into the cellar; the cellar windows are very shallow, not above four or five feet.</p>
               <p>When you saw Burdett, you said, I am astonished you should get into scrapes so near home? - His father keeps a public house close to me.</p>
               <p>I may venture to ask this, which is an odd question to ask of a prosecutor, what is his character? - I heard them say he was a very bad boy; an idle boy.</p>
               <p>But an honest one? - I never heard much of his honesty; his father said, I am sorry to meet you on this occasion; I shall be very glad to send him abroad.</p>

               <p>Describe how you found him? - He was laying along upon three or four butts; I asked him what he did there; then my partner came down and we took him up stairs.</p>
               <p>What account did he give of his being there? - He said he fell into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Was he in liquor? - I did not perceive him in liquor at all.</p>
               <p>Where did you find the other prisoner? - I found the other prisoner between the butt and the wall in the cellar; when I asked who was there twice, he did not answer; then says I, I will strike you with my staff; I told him, it was him I wanted, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Jury. How did you find the flap of the window? - Over the curb, about six or nine inches, I will not say to an inch or two; finding it in that manner we supposed somebody to be in the cellar.</p>

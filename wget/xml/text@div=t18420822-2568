I am the wife of William Maugban, and live in Bennondsey-street—Alexander was in my service till three weeks ago—I then discharged her, and on the Friday afterwards I missed some towels—I sent to Alexander, and she brought me back one towel—I after<lb></lb>wards missed two table-cloths, nineteen napkins, one dozen and seven cambric handkerchiefs, four habit-shirts, some stockings, some house cloths, dusters, four shifts, and a great many other things—I went the same day to Alexander, who was in Boardman's room—I asked her where the habit-shirts and other things were—at first she denied it—I said, "How ungrateful you have been to me, who have sent bread to your child"—she said, "You have been kind, but I hare taken nothing"—I was coming away, but she gave me this habit-shirt, and then gave me some daplicates from her pocket, and said, if I would forgive her she would tell me where all my other things were—I said that would not do—I would not promise to forgive her, as she had been so ungrateful—she then turned to Board man, and told her to give me the ticket of the table-clath—Boardman said, she had no such thing—'Alexander said, "Yes, you know you have"—Boardman then said they had sold the table-doth—I after<lb></lb>wards got a policeman and went with him to their room again—we found them both sitting together by the fire—they bad cut the tops of my stock<lb></lb>ings off, and put them on the fire, and the feet and legs of the stockings were on the floor—we found two of my handkerchiefs, which they were burning—the officer took possession of them—here are the tops of the stockings, and the mark on them, and here are the legs and feet of them.</p>

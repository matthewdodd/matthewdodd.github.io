               <p>On the 4th of October I went to the house of a woman I had met with one day before, who said she dealt in tea, and had given me a direction; I went for some tea; when I came there the prisoner who was in the house went out; she told me she believed her child had the small pox and desired me to go up stairs and look at it; I went up; I had not been up five minutes before the prisoner came in, and fell upon me and beat me; I asked him what right he had to use me in that manner ; he pulled my watch out of my pocket and put it in his own, and beat me again; I got down into the yard and cried out murder; some of the neighbours broke the door open ; I kept hold of him, and said I would have my watch, that he had taken from me; at this time one of justice Sherwood's men came, and I desired him to take charge of the man, for he had almost killed me and got my watch.</p>
               <p>'On his Cross Examination he said, that this</p>
               <p>'was about twelv e o'clock in the day; that</p>

               <p>I went out in the morning: on my return between eleven and twelve, I heard my wife cry murder; the yard door was shut and the outer door on the spring lock ; I shoved up the sash, and got in at the window; I found Dixon in the action with my wife ; I laid hold of him by the collar and said, I would kick him down stairs; he said he did not know it was my wife; I threw him on the floor, and he put up his breeches; I bid him go down stairs; he said give me my watch, it was lying on the bed; I told him to give me his name and place of abode, and I would bring him his watch, or he should go before a justice; I was pulling him along and Farrell shoved me into a public-house, and I delivered him the watch; he said before the justice I licked him with an Irish stick.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

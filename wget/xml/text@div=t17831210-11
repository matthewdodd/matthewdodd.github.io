            . Under this difficulty there is nothing else involved but that flowered gown and coat, which were pawned at two times, and therefore the gown might be taken one day, and the coat another; and where it comes to such a nicety as that, perhaps you will think yourselves at liberty to suppose in favour of life, that nothing was taken at any one time to the value of forty shillings, and you will then save the lives of these people; it will then remain for you to consider which of them you will charge with simple felony: Now you find that every one of them has pawned something, there is no evidence against any one of them, but what arises from the act of pledging these goods, but that is an act sufficient to put the party upon giving an account how they came by them; for at first view it is a dishonest thing to have your goods or mine in another person's custody, they having nothing to do with them; now they have given no account how they came by these goods; and if it was to relieve then in an instant necessity, they could not want to take such a number of things, especially for five months together: If you suppose that they really intended to plunder the house, and that the fact really was that they were surprized by the sudden return of Mrs. Read, and flattered themselves with the expectation of this month's notice, which would have given them time to have accommodated matters, either for their excuse or for facilitating their escape, then to be sure you will suppose that they did take them with a dishonest purpose; and with respect to the discrimination of the different persons, Moody was the person intrusted with the care of the house, she is the only person that lived in the house, therefore it is to be presumed that she was having pawned some of these things, that she was the hand that took all the goods; and there are these two strong circumstances against her more than against the rest, that of making her escape in the morning, and when she was taken being found with the key of Mrs. Read's box in her pocket; that key Mrs. Read swears was up stairs in a drawer in the garret, when she went out of town, therefore it is impossible, that she could have any business with that key; another circumstance is, that she had the possession of the duplicates, not only of the things that were pawned in her name, but as the constable says, some in the name of Price, some in the name of Parker, some in the name of Moody. All of them were in her possession; that imports very strongly that they were pledged for her benefit, at last in common with the rest. With respect to the two Parkers, they are relations to her, and they did pledge at several different times part of this property; if you are of opinion that they were concerned in taking these things, and that they knew they were not Moody's property, but the property of Lady Teynham, and were also instruments of pawning them, you will connect them with Moody, so as to include them in the same guilt; if on the other hand, you only think them guilty in the light of receivers, then that is a different species of offence, with which they are not now charged, but which may hereafter subject them to other punishments; but if you suppose them principals in the fact, then they are equally guilty, and that involves the case of Price also, because she pledged several of these things in the name of Ann instead of Bridget; she however has this peculiarly attending her case, which speaks strongly in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100038"></xptr> ster favourish that she was taken up upon this suspicion and let go, and she came voluntarily again: As for

               <p>"He is gone." I looked at the window, missed the scarf, went out, but found nobody. I had not seen the prisoner in the shop, but I saw his brother; they live in Barrett's court. On Tuesday, the prisoner came to pawn a coat - I said he had stolen the scarf - he denied it - I said I could take him to a person who had seen him do it - he seemed willing to go. As I took him to Hughes, who said he was the person, I said I would take him to the watch-house - he said if I would not, he would take me to where it was. He took me to Gee's-court, and said he took it about half-past ten o'clock, and hid it under a water-but, and shewed us the place, but it was gone.</p>

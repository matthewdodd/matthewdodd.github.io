                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and lodge on the second-floor at 62, Baldwin's-gardens. On 3d Jan. I returned home, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, went into my room, and found the prisoner, her daughter, two or three other females, a cabman, and another man there—their conduct was not very proper—I took no notice, but sat down quietly—after about an hour the prisoner began insulting and abusing me, and speaking disrespectful of my character—I had not said anything to them—after a few minutes I stood up, and said, "Who do you mean?"—she said, "You, you vagabond"—I said, "You <hi rend="italic">virago</hi>, what do you mean?"—the daughter then said to a female who was there, "Mary, this is all through you; they have formed an idea that you get your living by night-walking"—I said, "No, it is no such thing; but Mary has informed a person in the house that you have had a child"—the daughter then took up a cup of boiling water, or cocoa, and threw it over me, and then took some cups and saucers, and plates, and a tea-pot, and threw them at me—I took up a loaf to defend my face—the prisoner then took up a pan, which they keep bread in, emptied some water out of it on the floor, and struck me with it on the crown of the head—it stunned me, broke the pan, and cut my head, which bled very much—I had not touched the prisoner at that time—after she struck me I tried to catch the two, but some women interfered, and took them out of the room—I went and got a policeman, and gave them in charge—I afterwards went to the hospital, and had my head dressed there twice.</p>

               <p>Lawler came in—we were having our tea—the prisoner's daughter said Lawler had said she was getting her living by being on the town, and the prisoner began to abuse him, and said, "You vagabond, you ought to beashamed of yourself; you get your living among women"—Lawler said nothing to them—the daughter took up a cup of cocoa, and threw it at him, and then the saucers, and plates, and whatever she could get—the prisoner then took up the tea-pot, and struck him with it—he took up the loaf—she then took up the great bread-pan, threw the water on the floor, and struck him with the pan on the skull, and bled him like a bullock—it was a very violent blow indeed; I thought the man was dead—the pan broke on hit skull—Lawler had not laid a finger on her—I tried to get her into the bedroom, and she bit me in the arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Gray's—inn-road Hospital. Lawler came there on 3d Jan., between six and seven o'clock in the evening—he had an incised wound on the crown of his head, about an inch long, and going to the bone, you could put your finger in—it was bleeding—I did not consider it a dangerous would; it might have been—it might have been caused by the sharp edge of this pan.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Any wound may be dangerous, may it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may—this wound healed very easily—the sharp edge of a tea-pot might have done it, or any sharp edge; but it was most probably done by the pan—he only came to me twice—I dressed the wound with a little lint steeped in cold water, and next day it was quite well—I do not think the round rim of the pan would cause such a wound—the convex portion might have come first against his head, and broken the pan, and then the broken part might have inflicted the wound—I do not think that would necessarily have caused contusions.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 6, Oxford-terrace, Clapham-road; I am a banker's clerk. On Wednesday, 29th Oct., about a quarter past one in the morning, I was in High-street, Borough—I was on the left hand side of the way, going towards the Elephant and Castle, on the same side as St. George's Church—when I got to Stone's End, I saw the prisoner Hunter come out of a court—he bent his head down underneath the gas lamp and looked at me, and I did the same, and did not like his appearance—he was alone—I attempted to step into the road to pass him, when I felt a spring from behind, and was immediately seized by the throat from behind, before I could get into the road—I was walking very fast at the time, and when I was seized I had got within arm's length of Hunter—he was walking across me—he stopped when I was seized, and he immediately seized me by the right arm—another seized me by the left—I had a loose coat on at the time with a pocket at the side, and he seized my pipe case from it—I believe Hunter must have done that, he being on that side of me—I received a bruise at the time from the violence—he seized me by the arm, and seized the pipe case out of my pocket—I was then held by the arm after being seized by the hand by a third man—I struggled with them, and they held up my over coat, and put their hands in my wowsers; I do not wear braces, so they could not get their hands into my pockets, but they undid all the buttons, and pulled out my shirt, and after that they said "Quick"—I could not say which of them it was that said that; some of them did—they looked round and cried out "Quick," and then I saw the prisoner Murty for the first time—they tore open my over coat while he tried to unbutton the under one, which was closely buttoned up—I kicked him as hard as I could on the legs—they then said, "Squeeze him tighter," and that was the last I recollect—they all opened away from me when I kicked—the man behind still had hold of my throat at that time—I was calling out as well as I could, but of course I could not call out, I was only gurgling in my throat—I tried to throw the man behind—I could hardly move while I was held by the three, but I kicked the fourth one when he came to unbutton my under coat, and that startled them—after they said, "Squeeze him tighter," I became insensible—I scrambled up as well as I could, and I saw the policeman running after three, and I ran as well—I felt very unwell, and went home—I had been in bed about half an hour, when the policeman came to fetch me, and I gave him a description of Hunter in the hall, and I also gave a description of two other men—Murty is one of them—Hunter was brought to me, I should think, within an hour; it might have been an hour and a half—all the property I lost was my pipe case—I was very much hurt—I have a lump in my throat at the present time—my stomach was almost beaten to a jelly from the way in which they used me, and I have a large bruise on my left breast—I have had a great dizziness in my head ever since.</p>

I opened the door to them"—I took him to Tower-*treet station, and there he said, "There are others ought to be apprehended as well as me"—Mr. Mason was sent for—I was not there when he came—previous to taking Murty I went with Mr. Mason to different public houses on one or two occasions to seek for certain parties.</p>

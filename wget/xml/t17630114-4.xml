I saw Mr. Hillatt's sheep running about the field, which is near my garden; I went and saw the prisoner standing against the fence, and a sheep between his legs: Mr. Floy was with me; I said, what is that man doing? he ran away directly, there was only a ditch between us, we pursued, and in about half a mile overtook him; we took him to Mr. Rogers's, who looks after the marshes, and left-him there, and went to the sheep; it was lying in the skin, which was taken off, and the head was in the ditch. Mr. Hillatt swore to the sheep: he had taken the sheep out of Mr. Hillatt's ground into a field next to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Floy confirmed the account given.</p>

Mr. Rogers came to me the day before Christmas-day, and told me what had happened; I went to his house the next day, and found the skin to be a skin of one of my sheep; I took that and the sheep home, and took the prisoner before the justice; there he said he was drove to it by necessity; that he had a man with him who told him, if he would go along with him he would shew him where he should have mutton enough; that they went to my field and catched one and killed it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the sheep worth?</p>
               <p>Hillatt. It cost me 18 s. I lost very little by it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gascoyne. Did you see any body with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Gascoyne. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Floy answered the same.</p>

               <p>I was coming from Deptford, crossing the river there is a foot way going to Poplar; I saw a man in the field, I asked him if that was the way to Poplar; when I was at the gate the man made away, I staid there about a quarter of an hour, then these 2 men came to me, I went from the place; and they catched me.</p>

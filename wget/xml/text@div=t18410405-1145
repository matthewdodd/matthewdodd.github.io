I was crossing the road, and saw the prisoner's hand in Mr. Stuttle's pocket—I followed him, and spoke to the prosecutor when he turned round—I saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief three parts of the way out of Mr. Stuttle's pocket, and then a person came up and intercepted me—I could not see it quite drawn out—the prisoner dropped it by his side.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner with you at the same time? - A. Yes; he was paid at the same time; he asked me if I would go as far as the Bell, and have a pot of beer; I told him I did not care if I did; it was scarcely above a quarter of a mile; we had a pound of mutton and two pots of beer for our supper, at the Bell; I told him, when we had had the two pots of beer, I should go to my lodgings; I said to him, I will not have any more, I have had plenty; then we had about a quarter of a mile to go; we came very steady.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out of the Bell together? - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go? - A. About a quarter of a mile; we lodged in a barn at Mr. Ives's; he was in one barn and I in another; he is an Irishman, and the Irishmen live in one barn and the English live in the other; there are two houses of Mr. Ives's, a dwelling-house, and a farm-house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040009"></xptr>besides, and between those two houses he knocked me down with his fist, and he flung his body on me; I asked him what he was going to do with me; he said, d - n your old blood, I'll have your life and your money both; he said, if you speak another word, I'll have your life this very moment; when he had abused me, and got my money, he ran away; I was five minutes before I could get up.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it he took? - A. My purse, a seven-shilling bit, two shillings in silver, and three shillings and a penny in penny bits and halfpence, in all twelve shillings and one penny; the seven-shilling bit was wrapped up in a bit of white paper, with a red binding round it; there was some reading on it, but I am no scholar; I cannot read, but it was wrapped up in that.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of purse was it? - A. I do not know; it was not canvas; it was made of some sort of linen cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him after he took the money? - A. He ran away from me before I got up; where he went to I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Your purse and money were found the next day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Instead of two pots we had five pots, and the publican denied drawing us any more.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. We had no more than two pots; I came home as sober as a judge; as sober as I went.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prosecutor.) Q. Are you certain that you were not in liquor? - A. I am very certain I was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Prosecutor.) I neither struck you nor took your money in Hendon; my prosecutor had so much liquor the publican refused to draw us any more; said he, as you and I are going to London, here is my money, take care of it for me; I did not want his money; I said take your money.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you desire him to take care of your money? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you that night, after you were robbed? - A. I went to my lodgings in the barn, and this man was taken in the morning before I went to London; I staid at my lodgings till six o'clock; he was in custody at Hampstead before that time, and the gentleman that stands behind me took him into custody himself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you meet with the prisoner at the bar there any time on Sunday? - A. About seven o'clock, as I was coming out of my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time? - A. Just after seven o'clock on Sunday last, the prisoner at the bar passed me; I looked very hard at him, and when I went a little higher in town a countryman came and told me of a robbery; I went and stopped him at the King's Head, the corner of Church-lane, Hampstead; I searched him, and took all his money from him; I took from him 7 s. 6 d. in silver, and 2 s. and a penny farthing in penny-pieces and halfpence, and that purse.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in that purse? - A. A seven-shilling piece, wrapped up in that piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it tied up with any thing - he said it was tied up with a piece of red binding? - A. No binding at all; the border on the paper he calls a binding; there were more half-pence in his pocket, but I gave him five-pence halfpenny to pay for the liquor he had drank. (The money and purse produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To prosecutor.) Look at that purse? - A. (Looks at it.) I will take my oath to this purse; I have had it seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper? - A. That is the paper I wrapped it up with.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the binding? - A. This piece of red I call the binding.</p>
               <p>Court. That is the border.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been working for Mr. Cloud for a month; on Tuesday last week this man was <rs id="t18040704-7-viclabel37" type="occupation">employed at hay-making</rs>

I do not suppose this here gentleman is any acquaintance of my prosecutor's; I deny knocking him down or tumbling upon him; if I had threatened or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040010"></xptr>tumbled upon him he would have some marks upon him; I had nothing on me but an old smock frock; there was a Jew with this old man; he said to him, if we can condemn him it will be the best hay-harvest we ever had; I have sailed all the last war in his Majesty's service with Captain Rodney, and I have sailed with Sir Hyde Parker, and I never came to disgrace, so much as the lash of a cat; if you wish to send to Mr. Cloud, you will find I never had a miss word from him.</p>

I am the wife of James Wyatt, and live at 7, Warner-street—on 12th December, I was living at 39, Sussex-street—the last witness was living with me—at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the washhouse—Mr. and Mrs. Vincent and another man and woman came there—Mrs. Vincent came on one side of me, and Mr. Vincent the other—they both began abusing me dreadfully, calling me names—Mr. Vincent put his fist in my face—I took up a jug of water and said, "If you strike me, or repeat that language, I will throw this water over you"—in a few minutes the washhouse was cleared, leaving Mr. Vincent there—he kicked a jug of water out of my right-hand, and at that minute he thrust a knife at me, and I received a cut on my finger—I was then taken to the hospital.</p>

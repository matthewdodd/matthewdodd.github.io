                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No</hi>. 370.) On the 26th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw a wagon, loaded with coals, standing at the top of Gough-square—I did not look at the name that was on it—Parker was the driver of it—I saw Parker take a sack of coals from the wagon, and carry them down a court to Fletcher's premises—he shot them in Fletcher's presence—Parker then came out with the sack in his hand—I was standing by the side of the door—he pushed me back, and said, "Halloa, you long-sided policeman, what do you do there?"—he then went up King's Head-court, and Fletcher called, "George," who I understand is his son, and said, "Have you done your tea? make haste, and away with these coals"—the boy then came up into the shop, held up a bag, and Fletcher filled it with coals, but did not weigh them, and the boy carried the bag down to Shoe-lane—as I was going on my beat I met the boy coming back, and he asked if I had seen that man bring any more coals there—I said, "No, only that one sack," and he shot them—I was then going round my beat, and saw Parker with another sack of coals on his back, going in the same direction that he did before, but I did not see where he took them—I went on, and saw the other man taking coals out of the wagon to Mr. M'Dowall's premises—I do not know how many he took in there—after they were all shot, they were going home with the empty wagon, and Parker stopped me and said, "How are you? have you got any money?"—I said, "No"—he said, "We will have a drop of gin, but I suppose you don't dare drink?"—I said it was against our rules—he sent his mate for a quartern of gin, and I drank with them—he said, "You and I shall see one another another day; it is no use for such fellows as you and I to kick one another's shins, unless some one sets us on"—when I first saw the wagon it appeared to be full.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath did you not state before the Magistrate that he said "Weigh the coals?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, sir; he said, "Away with them"—I knew Fletcher before, as I passed his shop daily, that was all—I never used to sit and smoke a pipe in the corner of his coal-shed—upon my oath, I have not been in the habit of sitting there and smoking a short pipe—when the gin was brought, 1 suspected there was some roguery—I did not look at the wagon to see to whom it belonged—when Parker was taking a sack from behind the wagon, Cummins was shooting a sack of coals in Mr. M'Dowall's premises—I told my sergeant of this the next day—I went to the station at nine o'clock the same evening, but I did not say a word about it then, as I was not sure whether there was a robbery or not, and I wished to get every evidence—MR. M'Dowall is not here—I went with him and my sergeant to Fletcher's house to turn the coals over to see if we could find any which could be identified as Mr. Barraud's—that was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184012140021"></xptr>
               <p>on Friday—I only went once—we did not take the prisoners into custody till Tuesday—I never had any misunderstanding with either of the pri<lb></lb>soners—I had spoken to Fletcher—I staid at his house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour on Friday, turning the coals over, but I did not take him into custody—I left it to my sergeant—I should have taken the men at first, if I had been satisfied any thing was wrong—I did not know what sort of coals were to be delivered at Mr. M'Dowall's—I know they were of a peculiar sort—I shovelled over the coals at Fletcher's by the direction of my sergeant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say to any body that when your sergeant told you to shovel over the coals, it put you in such a fever you did not know how to contain yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not say that, nor anything like that, to any body—I did not borrow 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of any body—I know a beer shop kept by Johnson—I have been in there in my time, but I was not in there that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go to Fletcher's house that night, after you had had the gin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he called me, and I went just inside, the shop-door—I did not beckon any body out, and did not go with any body to New-street-hill—I will swear that—I did go to New-street-hill, and I there met the boy who went out of Fletcher's shop—he had then got an empty bag—there were other persons passing, but I met no one in particular—I met my sergeant in Gough-square, but I did not say any thing till the next day—I never was found by Fletcher in his coal-shed smoking a short pipe when I was on duty—I have not been on intimate terms with his son George—I have just spoken to him as I have been going about—I dare say we have been in public-houses together, but not that night—I think I have once or twice been in public-houses drinking with him in my time—I really do not know where the public-houses were—the first time is a good two months ago—it was between six and seven o'clock when the coals were taken to Flet<lb></lb>cher's—I did not ask Parker what he was going to do with them, as Fletcher has coals brought there, I did not know but they were for him—I know I should have gone to Mr. M'Dowall's and ascertained it.</p>

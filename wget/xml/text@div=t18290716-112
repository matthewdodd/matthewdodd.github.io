On the morning of the 12th of April, I got up at four o'clock, and found a pannel had been taken out of the counting-house door by some instrument - the pannel is here; these two holes were in it, and the marks at the side - I saw corresponding marks in the door; I missed this property; I think I should know the tumblers again - one of the same pattern was left behind; I had been in the habit of washing them - one of them had two small marks at the bottom; one of the marks was larger than the other; the tumblers were used the day before - my fellow-servant put them away that night; I fastened the street door, and my fellow-servant fastened the others - this tumbler (looking at it) is one that was left behind - I had seen the spoons the day before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is your master here? A. No: I know he has no other Christian name; I have seen two tumblers produced - they are a very common pattern (looking at one produced by David James) this is the same pattern; I certainly do not wish to swear to it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Look at the one you say is marked? A. Here are two marks at the bottom - they had similar marks to these, but I should not like to swear to them - one is a brown mark.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it not common to find these marks in glass? A. Yes; there is a brown mark, and an air bubble - they are like the marks.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH CANNON. I am cook to Mr. Galilee. On the night before the robbery, I fastened all the doors and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160047"></xptr>windows except the street-door and garden-gate; at four o'clock in the morning, the watchman rang the bell - I informed master, and came down with him; the pannel was taken out of the counting-house door, and stood outside - these circular marks were on the end of it then; the articles stated were missing; I had been in the habit of washing the tumblers - I put them on the side board in the parlour that afternoon; there are two marks on this tumbler by which I know it - one is a bubble in the glass, and the other a brown spot; I had noticed these marks, and it is the same pattern exactly: I cannot swear it is the same tumbler - the place under the sideboard was broken open, and the sugar basin, tongs, and spoons taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What business is your master? A. A rope manufacturer, and resides in a house on the ground - the counting-house is in his dwelling-house; these are common cheap tumblers.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How long have you been in the habit of washing the tumblers? A. I have been there a year and a half, and was there some time before - this tumbler was there all that time; only two were left out of a dozen- only one in the dozen had these marks.</p>

            .

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You do not know whether any body else slept there? A. No; it is a lodging-house; when I returned - she said it did not signify their being pawned in my name; she did not tell me to conceal it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 27th of May, I apprehended Brown at a lodging-house in George-street; I do not know who keeps it - both the prisoners were in the same room; I had seen them both in bed together in that room about a month before - I have seen them in the house several times, but do not think I have seen them in that room together above twice; I always considered that Brown lived there- I found two duplicates on the mantel-piece, which I gave up to the witness - when I took Brown he was nearly undressed, sitting by the fire; the female prisoner was in the room; I found this small chisel in a table drawer in the room - I went next day to the prosecutor's, and compared it with two holes in the pannel of the counting-house, and one hole which had been made in the street door - it fitted that hole, and fits the two holes in this pannel - I did not take the female prisoner for two or three days after - she was then in the same room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you believe that pannel has been extracted by means of a centre-bit? A. No; it has been marked with a centre-bit all round the edge, but I consider that an instrument has been used to pull it out after it was worked with the centre-bit; I do not swear the holes have been made with the chisel - the female prisoner is an unfortunate girl.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How often has the chisel been tried to these holes? A. About half a dozen times; Miller, our chief officer, who has been a carpenter, was sent for to give his opinion on it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it uncommon to find strangers with the female prisoner? A. No; I have been over the house before - there may be two or three persons living there; I have seen the male prisoner in her company a good many times - I have been to the house five or six times, and always found her there, but only found the man there once, except when I apprehended him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did other girls live in this house? A. One or two girls of the town - I do not think there are more than three or four rooms in the house; I returned to the room immediately I had locked the man up- the woman was still there.</p>

On my return in the morning of the 26th, she told me that the house had been robbed, and that she had called in the watchman; she related to me the various articles that had been taking away; I observed no violence any where to the house; I did not examine the house myself to see what was missing, I was in hopes I should discover it; I did not suspect her. In consequence of false charges coming in for articles that I never had, I discharged her. On the 4th of February, she left a band box behind her; in that box I found the duplicate of four sheets, and two tablecloths; I went to the pawnbroker where the duplicate mentioned, and took the property out; I knew them to be mine. These are them.</p>

On Thursday, 11th Aug., about 11 o'clock at night, I was in the bar; Cooper came in, and asked for four sixpences for two shillings—I opened the till, took out four sixpences, and said, "Where is your two shillings?"—he said, "I don't want two shillings, I want four bottles of Davis's soda water"—I went to get it, and Hewitt came in with another man, and appeared to be drunk—one had half a quartern of gin and cloves, and the other half a pint of beer—I drew the beer, and said, "You have not paid me;" they both said, "No, but I will do it"—the one who is not here paid for it—I then went to Cooper, and said, "Here are four bottles of soda water"—(there is a partition in the shop; Cooper was on one side, and Hewitt on the other)—he said, "It is not the right sort, it will not do"—I said, "We have not got any more;"—he said, "Then give me my two shillings;" I said, "I have not had your two shillings;" nor had I—he swore a good deal, and conducted himself violently; and I was frightened, and opened the till, and put two shillings on the counter—I did that through fear—my master came, the two shillings were still lying there, and he put his fingers on them, and said to Cooper, "Is this your money?"—he said, "Yes"—my master said, "You had better go, for we do not keep Davis's soda water"—(I had not told my master)—Hewitt and the other man stood at the partition, smoking—Mr. Scott said, "We do not allow smoking at this part of the counter, just go into the other partition"—I told Mr. Scott the trick Cooper had played; he went out after him, and Cooper came back in custody—there was no one assisting me in the bar at the time, and I should not have given the money if I had not been frightened.</p>

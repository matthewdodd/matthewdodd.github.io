                  </hi>. I am landlord of the "Shakespeare" tavern, Allen Road, Stoke Newington—on the 8th September the prisoner came to my house and I served her with twopennyworth of ginger brandy—she gave me a shilling, and I gave her change, and she left directly—I then looked at the shilling and found it was bad—I called the barmaid in, and ran out and tried to find the prisoner—I could not find her, and I wrapped the shilling up in a piece of paper, marked it outside with the date, and locked it up in a box—the prisoner came again on the 3rd October—I re-cognised her the moment she entered the door—I served her with three-halfpennyworth of gin and peppermint, and she gave me a bad shilling—I said, "This is the second time you have been here, and now I shall lock you up"—she said she had not been there before, she was an honest woman—I ran over and got a policeman, and told the people in the bar not to let her go—I gave her in custody, with the bad money.</p>

               <p>1 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Dean-street, Soho, and saw the prisoner walking towards me; he had a parcel—I asked him what he had got; he said a parcel which a man gave him to take to the Hamp-stead-road—he spoke good English—I took him to the station, and found on him four other pieces of cloth; two at the back of his coat, one in his coat, and one in his trowsers—I found the key of his room, and three other keys—one of the keys opens the prosecutor's iron box.</p>

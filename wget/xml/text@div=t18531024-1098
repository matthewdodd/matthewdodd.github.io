                  </hi>. I am assistant to William Sent, hosier, of the Royal Exchange. On 17th Oct., about 8 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came, and asked to be shown some black silk cravats—I showed him some; he did not approve of any of them—he spoke English—he described another sort, which we had not got; and in describing them, he leaned over the counter and motioned with his hand, as to the kind of border to it—while he was doing so, I saw his other hand go to his pocket—I looked and saw part of a cravat, projecting from his pocket—he asked if I could get what he wanted—I said yes, if he liked to call again—he asked me for a card—I should have had to turn round to get one—I said there was no occasion for that, as every one knew the Royal Exchange—he left the shop, and I followed him and overtook him; I walked close to him till I saw a policeman, and then gave him in charge—he was taken back to the shop, and these cravats (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were taken from him—they have my own private mark on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I ask you whether I could have a sample of these neck handkerchiefs to show? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; you said if he did not call in, be would send some one else—when you went out of the shop, I did not call you at all; I tapped you on the shoulder—you stopped—when you came back to the shop, you did not take the cravats and give them to me—you did not speak a word.</p>

               <p>positively say; I saw them come out of his pocket—he did not ask me to let him have some to show as a sample; I never give samples—I did not give him these particular ones as a sample—I did not see him take them openly—one hand was lying on the cravats while he was leaning over; as he was doing so I saw them.</p>

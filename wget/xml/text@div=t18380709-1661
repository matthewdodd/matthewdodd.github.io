               <p>"My Lord—It was not until yesterday that I knew, beyond all doubt, that the person who called at No. 4, Agar-street, Strand, upon two occa<lb></lb>sions, and branded me as a liar and a coward, threatening to horse whip me, and break all the bones in my body, was your lordship, under the assumed name of that despicable fellow, Lord Marcus Hill. Without further alluding to the generous and honourable feeling such conduct de<lb></lb>notes, I will at once acknowledge that, compared to the conduct pursued towards me by yonr father and uncles, it is meritorious in the extreme;—for you only seek to exterminate me by a sudden and positive death, and not to torture and rack me by cruelties unparalleled in the history of aris<lb></lb>tocratic villanies. In order to show your lordship that your threats cannot intimidate me, whatever effect they may have bad upon the weak parties whose agencies I had employed to dispose of my pamphlets, I beg to inform your lordship that I shall shortly open a shop, where I sahll in person superintend the sale of my pamphlets; when the spot is decided upon, your lordship shall have the earliest intimation of it; when the world shall see who has the most courage—your lordship in attempting to carry your threats into execution, or I in resisting them. But should your lordship-thirst for immediate revenge, your wishes can be gratified. If your lordship will send a line to the above address, appointing a place and hour where and when, I shall be happy to attend your lordship's com<lb></lb>mands. The enclosed handbills will convey to your lordship something of my intention, the completion of which has only been delayed by the difficulty I have experienced in finding an eligible public situation for vending the pamphlets. In conclusion, I reiterate what, upon every occasion I have alluded to in my communication with your father, viz. that I seek but for justice; and until I have it I will pursue every legal means within the compass of my ability to attain it.</p>

If your lordship would consent to ray discharge from Tothill-fields, (as I have a wife and one child depending entirely upon support from me,) I would be the means of suppressing the libel immediately.

               <p>April or May in the same year, that I was introduced to the defendant Reitterhoffer—I made arrangements with him to publish the work, and received twelve dozen of the "Downshire," and publicly exposed them in the window of my shop, in Holborn—I attached to them the name of Franklin, as I did to several other works—my motive was, on account of being greatly in debt, and I did not wish to be harassed for money which it was out of my power to pay—previous to that period I printed by the name of Ward, and as soon as my proper name was found out, I was obliged to go by the name of Franklin—I now go by my proper name—about July or August I was indicted by the Society for the Suppression of Vice, on smost scandalous and unfounded charge, and so convinced were they of its being unfounded, that they abandoned the prosecution against me—I gave up my shop at that period, and removed to my preaent resedence, No. 19, New-street-square, where I have been residing ever since—the next shop I took was of Mr. Ricketts, No. 4, Agar-street, Strand, where I assumed the trade of bookseller for about a fortnight, in conjunction with Miller, one of the witnesses here to-day, who received half the profits of that establishment; and from that period up to last May, I had nothing at all to do with Reitterhoffer, Teuten, or any other person, directly or indirectly, or with any works brought forward against the Down—shire family, nor have I seen Reitterhoffer or Teuten but once or twice, nor was I ever there when these bills were printed—on the day in question, the 11th of March, I was called on by Teuten, who asked if I could get aim two men—I replied I did not kpow—he said, "As you are poor, and much in want of a shilling, you may as well earn it as any one else"—I went out and got two board-men—he went into a public-house to have some beer, got some paste, and pasted the bills on the board himself—he gave me the bag to hold—when apprehended I was in company with Teuton, and that was the way the bag came into my possession—in fact I received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. along with Daly, who is here, and the other man, at the same time—with respect to the letter I sent, I considered I was in duty bound (although a great many remarks have been made about it) to send the letter on account of what Mr. Dyer, the Magistrate, alluded to—it was quite unknown to me that any thing of the kind was being carried on between Reitterhoffer and Teuten, but when I understood there was another work coming out, I sent for the Marquis of Downshire's solicitor—or any<lb></lb>body, to come to me at Tothill-fields-prison—a Mr. Thompson, I believe, came—he asked me how I could suppress it—I said by his assistance in apprehending Reitterhoffer, and that is all.</p>

This gentleman, Mr. Teuten, employed me, and gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to take the board out from about one o'clock till five, and told me to go about George-street and Hanover-square, and that direction; and when I came round towards George-street, a gentleman came up to me, and asked me for the board—I told him, if he would give me his name and address I would give it to him—I was paid for carrying it—he said he wanted the board, and he took from me—I said, if I was doing wrong I was sorry—I did not want to go away, and I stopped till the policeman came—the policeman asked me who employed me—I could not tell the names—"Would you know the men who employed you?" says he—I said "Yes," and I saw them standing at the corner of George-street—I described their dress to him—he said, "Are those them?"—I said, "I think they are; go nearer, and I shall know better"—we walked towards them, and they ran away, and we after them</p>

               <p>—the policeman ran before me, and I after him, and walked on before him to the station-house—I was not aware of any thing wrong.</p>

I have not any thing to say, only I was taken in Belgrave-square the first time, and the gentleman who employed me Mr. Teuten, asked me, "Would you know the gentleman who gave yon in charge?"—I said, "Yes, if I saw him again"—he said there was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. re<lb></lb>ward offered in the papers to find out the gentleman who gave me in charge, and next day he said there was a different bill on the board—I can prove I cannot read or write, and did not understand what was on the bill on the board.</p>

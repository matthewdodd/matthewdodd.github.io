They landed their kegs, and went up with them, and we after them: we came up to the hinder men, and some threw down their kegs, and the rest turned back, and some of them struck me. The prisoner struck me with a large bludgeon on the head, and I was covered with blood, I had my leg smashed all to pieces, the bones were obliged to be taken out: I had known this man, the prisoner, some years, he had been employed as a porter, and I am quite certain he is one of the persons.</p>

               <p>I was the waterman that brought over all the smugglers, the prisoner was one, he was provided with a bludgeon the same as the rest. After they went up with the kegs, the officers pursued them; I stood by Mr. Kingsford, they took hold of some of the kegs, and some went up James-street, and some round Highland House. I heard Mr. Kingsford cry out, my leg is broke; and afterwards I heard some of them say, we will murder some of you. I went then towards home after that: I am sure Salisbury was there, I saw him the next day about ten o'clock, and he advised me to go home with him, and said, if in case I was taken up they would allow me subsistence, and I went with them to Guernsey.</p>

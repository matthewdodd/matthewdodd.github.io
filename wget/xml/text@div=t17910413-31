               <p>I know the prisoner Cardwell; on the 18th of March we received information that the warehouse had been robbed, upon enquiry, and found at the prisoner's lodgings, in Red Lion-court, Watling-street (I was was present the whole time), and we found the property mentioned in the indictment in a secret drawer, in a chest of drawers The prisoner was not there, he was in custody at the time.</p>
               <p>JOHN PENNANT sworn.</p>
               <p>I was not up stairs when the two first pieces were found; they were given to me by Charlton, and have been in my possession ever since; (Produced.) They are never sold but upon foreign orders; I have no doubt but they were stolen; and the prisoner confessed it in my presence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would be glad to know if the gentlemen can say any thing against my character? - We always looked upon him as an honest man, and he was countenanced by the whole house.</p>

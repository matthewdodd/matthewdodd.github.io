               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had not the prisoner told you of his receiving this 28l? A. No; on the 2d of November, I would not take a cheque for the 28l., because the 11s. was deducted from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you might have had it with the 11s. short? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Then you returned that? A. Yes, the prisoner was with me on the 2d, when he offered me the payment with the 11s. deducted, and the next day he received ten sovereigns and the 5l. draft.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The first transaction was between Mr. Somers and you? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not always in the prisoner's hands a floating balance left? A. No, not on any occasion.</p>

            , JUN. I am the son of James Somers, of Oxford-street. I saw 15l. paid to the prisoner on the 3d of November - there were some sovereigns and a draft of 5l. - I paid it to him on his master's account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been always as positive of this? A. Yes; I stated before the Magistrate, that there was some part paid in sovereigns, but I could not tell what; I said I had paid 10l. in cash, but I could not say what number of sovereigns; I am positive I paid some sovereigns.</p>

             re-examined. Q. How long was it before you found he had received the money? A. Not till the 30th of November; I had asked him about it two or three times a week, and he said he had not paid him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in the habit of serving Mr. Somers a good while, and Mr. Godfrey had never done any business with him before I went there; I was in his shop on the 2d of November, and Mr. Somers, the el<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080065"></xptr>der, gave me a cheque for the goods; I had sold him for 28l., and told me if I called again he would give me the rest. I went and gave Mr. Godfrey the cheque, as he was in the cart at the door; he said "I shall not take it without the 11s., unless you make it good;" I went back, and said"Mr. Godfrey will not take it without the 11s. and I cannot lose money every time;" he said "Call again and I will pay you;" I called several times and he would not pay it, on account of the 11s. Mr. Godfrey has said that he brought this case forward merely because he understood I was going to leave him, and set up in opposition to him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GODFREY re-examined. Q. Did you ever say you brought forward this case in revenge? A. No, I never heard he was going to set up in opposition.</p>

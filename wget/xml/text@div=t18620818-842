                  </hi>. I am a butcher, at Kingston, in Surrey—on Thursday, 10th July, I went to Bengo's slaughter-house, in Coomb-lane, Kingston, and found the defendant, Neville, there—there was a red cow lying there, and he told me to dress it, and I dressed it—all the inside was taken out before I began to do anything to it; lungs, heart, and all—I dressed it in the same way that I have been in the habit of dressing all beasts—I took the head off, and dressed it as well as I knew how—I could tell it had the lung disease, by where the lung had adhered to the side—after I had dressed it I saw Neville again—the sides were hung up in the slaughter-house at the time he came in—he said he had a waggon come for it, and it was going away—Bengo was not present—he asked me to quarter it off—I waited till the waggon came, and then quartered it off—the waggon was driven by a man named Sandy—Sandy and I put the four quarters into the waggon—Mr. Neville told us to do so—he had a letter in his hand—after it was quartered off and loaded I went round to a beershop, at the corner of the lane; we had a pot of beer, and I left them there with the waggon—after I locked the gates up I took the keys to Bengo, and told him the cow was gone away; and he said, "All right"—nothing more passed between me and Bengo—he said he had stuck the cow, and it bled well—he had come in the slaughter-house with his horse and cart; he left the cart and took the horse away—that was before I had commenced taking the head off the cow—he remained a few minutes—I did not see any other cow there, besides the red one which I dressed—Mr. Neville paid me for my work.</p>

               <p>which I followed it into the shop and examined it—I found that it was the four quarters of a cow that had evidently died from disease—the blood was in the tissues of the meat, and had not been taken from it; the lining of the lungs and the belly was very much inflamed—the lungs themselves were not there, but I could tell from the cavity of the chest—it was alto<lb></lb>gether in such a state as to be unfit for human food—if four quarters of beef were put in a cart, covered with a cloth, and with live calves under<lb></lb>neath, the meat would not have presented the appearance which this did, even if it had been there five nights; it may have made it bad but not diseased—I can tell the difference between putrid meat and the meat of an animal that has died from disease—in my judgment the indications that I saw existed the previous day—there is a large quantity of meat sold at Mr. Nicklinson's shop every day—I, and the other inspectors inspect that place every day as part of Newgate-market—I went down to Bengo's at Kingston that same day and found him washing his cart in his slaughter-house—I told him I was an officer, and had come down from London concerning a body of beef that I had seized that morning, that bad been brought that morning by Sandy, who had told me that he brought it from Bengo's place, it Kingston—Bengo said be was wrong, he had not had any beef on his premises for four or five weeks—I asked him if any one else had dressed a cow on his premises—he said, "No"—I asked him if any one had borrowed his cart to fetch a cow in—he said, "No, he had nothing at all to do with any beef, but that there was another Bengo in the town who might possibly have sent it—on his making that statement I left him—Bridges, the policeman, and Fisher were with me at the time—on the 17th I went to look after Neville, and found him in Kingston market-place—I told him I had got a summons for him to appear at the Guildhall police-court, London, concering four quarters of a cow that he had sent to Mr. Nicklinson of Newgate-market—he said it surprised him as he knew nothing about it—Fisher was with me then.</p>

               <p>the slaughter-house—I have always understood that place to be Newgate-market—Mr. Nicklinson is more likely to know than I—it is part of my duty to visit that shop every day—I think, when I went to Kingston, I told Neville that I, and the person who accompanied me, were officers of the City of London; I did not ask him any questions—I believe that before he said anything, I said, "We are officers of the City of London."</p>

                  </hi>. On the morning of 11th July last, at about half-past 5, Newman called my attention to four quarters of a cow at Mr. Nicklinson's—I examined the carcase—it was unfit for human food—it had the appearence of a cow that had died from lung disease—that was quite apparent to any one at all familiar with meat—I should think it would have presented the same appearance on the previous day—it was fresh, not tainted by the weather—I went with Mr. Newman and a police officer that afternoon, and saw Bengo—we told him who we were, and asked him if be knew anything of a cow that had been sent to Newgate-market that morning, or rather the day before—he said he did not know anything at all about it—he knew nothing about a cow—we asked him several times if he had had a cow on his premises that day—he said he had not; and, in fact, had not had a cow on his premises for some weeks—he was then asked if he had lent his cart to any one to fetch such a thing—he said no he had not, and knew nothing about it—this conversation took place in Bengo's place, which is in a lane close in Kingston—on Thursday, the 17th, I went again to Kingston with Newman, and saw Neville in the market-place there, and told him we were officers from the City, and had come down there respecting a cow, which it was stated he had sent to Mr. Nicklinson's at Newgate market—he said he knew nothing at all about it—it was the first he had heard of it—we asked, did not he know anything about a cow that came from Mr. Wallace's, of Ham<lb></lb>common—he said, "I know nothing about it; this is the first I have heard of it; I never heard it mentioned before"—I do not think anything was said about where the cow was put into the cart—he denied it altogether, and we served him with a summons and left him.</p>

               <p>about 1 o'clock, I went with constables Austin and Goodwin to Goff's house, in Trafalgar Road, East Greenwich—he keeps a second-hand shop for the sale of unredeemed pledges—I told him I had come for some sail-cloth that he had bought of Terdre, who was then in custody—he said yes, he had bought some—I accompanied him down stairs, and he gave me this sail-cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked if he had another—he said "No"—I told him I should take him into custody, and charge him with the unlawful posses<lb></lb>sion of this one—I then searched his place, and found this other sail-cloth behind the counter; he told me there was another, and produced it himself—I told him he had other property in his possession, some boots, and a gun, and he said he had not—I then took him to the station, returned, and searched the kitchen, and found these two pairs of water-boots, and a pair of trowsers, and after a time the gun was brought down from a room where Mrs. Goff was confined—it was given to me by a woman who was nursing her—these two saws were given to me by Goff—I took the gun to the station, and showed it to Goff', and he said yes, it was being paid off of—he gave me the key of his strong-room, which the constables used afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is not a very large shop; it is very full of all sorts of things—sail-cloths as good as these are not common in Greenwich—these have been cut away from the masts, not worn—there are three large ones and two small ones.</p>

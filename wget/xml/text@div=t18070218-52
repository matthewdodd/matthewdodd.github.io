               <p>Q. That person presented the draft to you from Mr. Lowndes for payment. - A. He did; the moment he put the draft into my hands, it struck me that it was not the hand writing of Mr. Lowndes. I then asked him who he came from, he referred me to Mr. Bray's, No. 3, Water lane. I shewed the draft to Mr: Clark, a gentleman in the office, who went into one of the partners.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon that what happened. - A. Mr. Pybus gave it to another gentleman; it was taken into another gentleman, Mr. Hammersley, I believe; upon its being returned into the shop, Mr. Pybus asked me if I would go along with him to Mr. Lowndes, I told him I would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Lowndes. - A. Yes, and Mr. Lowndes denied its being his hand writing. Mr. Lowndes said I must be taken in custody, unless I could give a good account who I had it from. I told him I did not know the man's name; I had heard his name several times, but I could not recollect it at that moment. I described the person, and that he was waiting near the banking house, or the palace gates. We went to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you. - A. Mr. Steel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come up to the prisoner there. - A. Yes, the prisoner said he did not know it was a bad note; he found it in a letter in Grovesnor square. Then the prisoner was taken to Bow street.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Alley. Can you read or write. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had put no mark on this check before you went to the bankers. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot say whether it is the same check or no. - A. I have not the least doubt but what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180045"></xptr> it is, I had read it before I delivered it.</p>

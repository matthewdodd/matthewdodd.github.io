On the 18th of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I went to bed, and left every thing safe, I believe; I am generally the last person up, and believe I was so that night - I came down at six o'clock in the morning, and found the back-door wide open; I am certain it was fastened the night before: I found the back-kitchen door perforated by some instrument, and a piece taken out - it is an inner door; there was a similar apperture in the windowshutter, and the window thrown open - I found all the closet-doors of the parlour open, and missed a plated ink-stand, a tea-caddy, and a variety of property, worth 10l. at a moderate calculation: I went up stairs, and called my family up, then went to the post-office, and on my return gave information at Worship-street.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Neal's house with him on the morning of the 19th, and observed some footmarks in the garden - I could only discover the footmarks of one person distinctly; they extended about twenty yards from the back of the house: I laid a board over them, to prevent their being destroyed by rain. The prisoners were both brought to the office on the 30th of September; I took these shoes off the male prisoner's feet, and went with them to Neal's garden, on the 1st of October - I found the board as I had left it; the footmark was still visible, and the right shoe corresponded with the right footmark, which was more visible than the other, as it was made in the mould, but on the gravel the impression was lost.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Luke's. On the 30th of September, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the City-road, and saw the two prisoners crossing from Featherstone-street; the woman had a bundle in her lap - I went up and laid hold of the man; I then opened the woman's lap, and saw something which looked like silver - I said, "How did you get this?" they both said, "It was given to us;" I took them into Preston's shop, at the corner of Featherstone-street, and in the woman's lap found a pair of bottle-stands and ink-stand - I asked where she got them; she said they were given to her: the man said he knew nothing about it - that he had just met her in Featherstone-street; I took them in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HURLEY. He never asked me about the property till he got into the shop. Witness. When I first met him I asked him about it.</p>

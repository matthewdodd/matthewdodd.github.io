            . On the 10th of September I lived with Mr. Laing, who keeps the receiving-house in Princes-street. The letters that day were sent to the General Post-office in the usual course.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Does any one assist you in the shop - A. Sometimes, but I am a great deal alone. The paid letters are put in a desk with the money - it is left open; it is fixed in the window - it is open to my master, myself, and another shopman. The paid bag goes away by itself. It appears by a memorandum, which I have in my own writing, that there were fifteen paid letters that day, two of which were 18 d. each. This is kept as a check between my master and the office; the entry is two for 3 s., which is 18 d. each. The double postage to Stonham is 18 d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The postman who comes with the bell has a bag which is locked, and has a slit in it for paid and unpaid letters - A. Yes, he receives them at five o'clock; those that come after go by a messenger. I make the letters up in a bag, and put the paid by themselves - a messenger calls for them, and takes them to the Post-office. I believe I sealed the bag that night, as the book is made up by me. I always seal the bag when I enter the letters.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you make any distinction between letters that contain money and other paid letters - A. If I know it contains money, I advise the person to take it to Lombard-street, but I ask no questions about letters.</p>

            . I am one of the Presidents of the Post-office, Lombard-street. The prisoner was a charger of letters, attached to the Norwich division. It was a general practice in the early part of the evening for him to resort to the sorting table for letters, but not late in the evening - he could not do it then.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he do it when the letters came from the receiving-houses - A. Certainly; Little Stonham is in the Ipswich division, which is immediately attached to his division. Unpaid letters come sooner to hand than paid, as they go through a more tedious process; but paid, unpaid, and franked letters, all go to the sorting table, and through his hands; and it frequently happens that letters are mis-sorted, particularly those of the Ipswich division, are more likely to be mixed with the Norwich than any others. The prisoner was on duty on the night of the 10th of September.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. JARVIS. Q. The clerks sit in a long room - A. Yes; the entrance is at the north. My chair is at the other end. Paid letters are brought by a messenger from the receiving houses, in a bag, which is sealed. The paid bags are taken out and given to Mr. Hanson, he opens them, and checks the letters - if there is any irregularity he must report it. Adams, the messenger, takes them to be stamped, they are then put before three or four persons, who sort them at a table some distance from the prisoner, and then put into their respective boxes, and taken to the different divisions, at one of which the prisoner attended. This letter ought to have been put to the Ipswich division, but mistakes often happen.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner sat in a recess - A. There was a partition between him and the Ipswich division. Unless the letters were mis-sorted, I do not think he could get them from the Ipswich division. The messengers carry them in their arms in rows not tied up, they may occasionally drop. nobody but the clerks have access to the sorting table; I believe the prisoner had been twenty years in the office - his salary was 200 l. a year, and about 10 l. in emoluments.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. How was his salary paid - A. Quarterly, by a check on the Bank. He has had 200 l. a year ever since 1814.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Ipswich letters are more likely to be missorted to the Norwich division than any other - A. Yes, because some of the Suffolk letters go to the Norwich division - it takes one man to arrange the mis-sorted letters out of the blind box.</p>

            . I am solicitor to the Post Office. On the 29th of January I saw the prisoner at the the Post Office about half-past eight o'clock in the morning - Frances and Adkins were present. I stated to him that he was suspected of secreting letters containing remitances, and asked him if he had any objection to his apartments being searched? he said No. Adkins was directed by me to proceed with him there. I and Frances went in a coach and met him at the door in Norfolk-street. We were all in the room together, and commenced an examination of his furniture and other things. Adkins looked into his drawers in the bed-room, and I saw him find six or seven parcels of notes. I asked the prisoner where he had received them from? he gave some answer about the first and second parcel. He said one parcel was his salary; in answer to another he hesitated, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have done wrong - I am guilty." More notes were found about the same time; I desired him to take a chair. I cast up the amount of the notes - it was 217 l., and consisted of 10 l., 5 l., and 1 l. notes. He said one parcel was his salary, that was 23 l. I have ascertained that is true. There was a 10 l. note among that 23 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. by MR. JARVIS. Q. You staid till he had done his duty before you told him of your suspicions - A. Yes, he was searched carefully there - we got to his lodgings a little after nine o'clock. I did not repeat the charge there. Frances and Churchill went to his lodgings with me. It is the second floor - there is a back and front room, besides a small room where his bed is. We partly searched the front room first; the prisoner appeared anxious to go into the bed-room, while Adkins was taking the things out of a cupboard - Adkins called him back - he did not go into the bed-room. I was taking a memorandum of what was found, and looking over receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any receipts for plate - A. No, when they went into the bed-room I accompanied them - the prisoner was present, he stood by the door in the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive any notes had been found, before he made the statement you mentioned - A. I am, I was nearer to the prisoner than Adkins; he said that he received one parcel of notes from a friend.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had notice to produce the plate here - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner on his examination, make any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210029"></xptr>any declaration, or did he deny it - A. He was not asked whether it was true or not.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. On Adkins stating what he said, did the prisoner deny it, or say that Adkins had mistaken him - A. He did not, I am perfectly clear respecting the words he uttered on finding the notes.</p>
               <p>MR. JARVIS. Q. Did he say the words,</p>
               <p>"It is no use" - A. He certainly might have said so; I do not remember the words exactly, but I am perfectly clear about the other words.</p>
               <p>HARRY ADKINS. I am an officer of Bow-street, I was at the Post-office when the prisoner was first accused. Mr. Stow first told him there had been several robberies of letters in his department, containing money; this was repeated by Mr. Parkin, who said, it was necessary he should be inquired of about them; he said he had no objection. He was asked whether he had any objection to be searched? he said No. I searched him minutely. He was then asked if he had any objection to having his lodgings searched? he said No. I was then ordered to accompany him there - we walked. He took me to No. 26, Norfolk-street, Strand - he said nothing in the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from him what his salary was - A. At his lodging Mr. Parkin asked him what it was? I understood him to say 200 l. or guineas. He said he had no other income besides his salary. While I was searching the front room he pretended many times that he wanted something out of the bed-room - he went once or twice into the bedroom; I followed him, and brought him back, and told him that I could not permit him to go there till the other rooms were searched. I found a quantity of glass and furniture in the front room, and a mirror, large chimney-glass, chairs, and sofa. I then searched the middle room, there was a pianoforte, and a large dining-table, which would dine thirty people, and apparently new carpets to fit both rooms; I then searched the bed-room - we all went in together, the prisoner, Mr. Parkin, Francis and myself - neither of them went in before this. I searched two small drawers at the top of a chest, and found a quantity of packs of new cards; the next drawer was opened, which contained linen, table-cloths and sheets - Mr. Parkin assisted me in looking over that. I found six or seven separate parcels of notes in that drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to the prisoner about them - A. Mr. Parkin questioned him about them - the notes were found very near together. After one of the rolls were found, Francis said the prisoner had taken something out of the drawer. I immediately turned round, and said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Jeffcott, what have you got in your hand?" Mr. Parkin and Francis were then in the room. He turned his face towards the door; as I was taking the seals out of his hand he was much agitated, and said in a faint voice,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use, I have done wrong - I am guilty." I am positive these were the words. I continued to search, and found more notes - he appeared more agitated, and Mr. Parkin requested him to take a chair. I found more notes in a pen-case - he appeared more agitated, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh dear!" and turned away. I marked the notes that were found - (looks at the 10 l. note,) - this is one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. JARVIS. Q. How long were you searching the rooms before you went into the bed-room - A. I should think it was an hour and a half, if not two hours. Some bills of parcels were found. The prisoner was within a yard or two of me - he could not move without my observing him. He went into the bed-room once or twice, I went with him. Mr. Parkin was writing at the time at some distance - he could not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many parcels of notes were found before he made the declaration you speak of - 
               <persName id="t18190421-54-person674">A. </persName>
            I cannot tell, but I think one was found.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear you found any of the notes before he made the declaration - A. I think Mr. Parkin pointed out the roll before he made the declaration. I will not swear it, but my belief is, that the first were found. I did not attend to it so particularly as Mr. Parkin was there. It was not necessary to force the seals from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner take out of the drawer - A. Two ladies' gold seals, they were separate. I did not see him take them out. His first words,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use," were very faint indeed, as he was turning at the time - his back was towards Mr. Parkin.</p>
               <p>Q. These words were said at the time the seals were taken - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure of these words - A. I have not the least doubt of it.</p>
               <p>JONIAH FRANCIS. I am a clerk in the Post-office. I accampanied Mr. Parkin on the 29th of January to the prisoner's lodgings. I was in the back room at the time the drawer was searched. I observed the prisoner take something out of the drawer, and communicated it to Mr. Parkin and Adkins, who immediately said,</p>
               <p>"You have something in your hand, give it to me;" upon which the prisoner immediately gave him a paper containing two gold seals. Nothing farther transpired relative to that fact. Prior to that, I believe one parcel of notes was found - a second parcel was found afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing at any time - A. On the discovery of the first parcel Mr. Parkin asked him how he came by it? he said one parcel was his salary; but whether that applied to the first or second parcel I cannot say. The same question was asked about the second - his answer was, that it belonged to a friend, or was given him by a friend, I cannot say which. Upon the discovery of the third parcel, Mr. Parkin stood between me and the prisoner - Adkins was at that time continuing his search at the further end of the drawer. A similar question was put to the prisoner, he faultered, was considerably agitated, and apparently at a loss for an answer. He then, in an under tone of voice said,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use - I am guilty," or</p>
               <p>"I confess I am guilty;" but Mr. Parkin standing between me and him, I cannot say which he said. I took an account of the bank notes that were found. The 23 l. received for his salary was distinct. One of them was a 10 l. note, dated the 8th December, 1818 - the salaries are paid on the 5th of January. Among the other notes, there were twelve of 10 l. each. The 10 l. note, No. 3548, dated 11th August, 1818, was in the third parcel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. JARVIS. Q. You saw him take the seals - A. Yes. I was quite near enough to hear any thing he might say at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. He said nothing at that time - A. If he had I certainly must have heard him. I believe one parcel had been found at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any question been asked relative to the notes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210030"></xptr>at that time - A. Certainly; he was asked how he came by them? and gave ready answers. He made the declaration on the discovery of the third parcel. I believe only one parcel was found when the seals were delivered up, I remember the words,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use;" it was part of the sentence; but whether at the conclusion or beginning I cannot say. I do not remember his saying</p>
               <p>"I have done wrong." It is possible that I might not hear the whole of the sentence, but what I have said I am certain he did say.</p>
               <p>Q. When the notes were found in the pen-case, did he turn round and say,</p>
               <p>"Oh dear!" - A. I remember he was very much agitated, and spoke in a low tone.</p>

            . The check is the prisoner's handwriting; also this order paid in January.</p>
               <p>- TAYLOR. I am a clerk in the Bank. On the 11th of January 52 l. 10 s. was paid; Mr. Field posted the notes.</p>
               <p>- FIELD. I am a clerk in the Bank. I posted the notes in payment for the check. The two 10 l. notes - Nos. 18660 and 18661, both dated the 8th December, 1818, and thirty-two 1 l. notes, among which are Nos. 26012 to 26023.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). From what passed at Bow-street, I was prepared to expect Adkins would give the evidence which he has. I do not mean to impute to him an intention of giving false testimony, though I most positively assert that no such words as he swears to ever escaped my lips. I was told I was suspected, and was willing to be searched. I gave all my keys to Mr. Parkin. My apartments were neatly but not expensively furnished. Every thing was pulled about. A small seal was falling, and to prevent its being injured I caught it. Adkins was called; he seized my hand, and asked me what I was concealing. Conscious of my innocence, this quite unmanned me. I left the bed-room, and said," You are to act as you think proper, I am not a guilty man." Those were my words. I had received 23 l. of the money for my salary. With respect to the rest of the evidence, it would apply to any one in the Post-office. The letter would not come into my hands in the regular course. I was employed in the Norwich division only, and it is next to impossible that it should come to me, except by mistake, and then it might pass through the hands of a hundred persons, and there is the greatest similarity between a letter containing an inclosure, and a single one, and five or six thousand pass through the office every evening. I do most confidently hope that you will consider that some time has elapsed between the time the note was stolen, and when it was found in my possession. The seal was a present from a merchant. As to the money, I have had a salary for years of 200 l. - there can be nothing extraordinary in that. The plate was mostly bought with 60 l. given me by the Post-office. The whole of my furniture, including plate, will not realize 200 l. I paid 70 l. for my lodging, for which I was waited upon. Sometime since I was selected to accept the situation of President in the office, which I declined.</p>

            . I am a merchant in the city. I occasionally go abroad. I have known the prisoner twelve years; I have been in town twelve and eighteen months together. I was intimately acquainted with the prisoner, and visited him at his lodgings in Norfolk-street - he has lived there three years. A greater part of his furniture was there when he first came. I remember the mirror, pianoforte, and chimney glass, ever since he has been there. I have seen the necessary plate on the table when I have dined there.</p>

             re-examined. I produce the plate. Here is a silver tea-pot, sugar-bason, cream-jug, two soup-ladles, four gravy-spoons, two of them new, a fish-slice, four sauce-ladles, twenty-four tea-spoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, sugar-sifter, ten salt-spoons, one mustard-spoon, and a punch-ladle, all silver; an opera-glass, telescope, and kaleidoscope. Some of the plate has his initials on it.</p>
               <p>MR. PLAUD re-examined. I have seen plate of this description when I have dined there; I believe I gave him the opera-glass myself, eight or ten years ago. I remember seeing some cut glass at his lodgings ever since he was there; he is a single man. He bore a good character.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. What parties have you dined with at his apartments - A. Only three or four persons; I never saw two soup-ladles, or four gravy-spoons, or twenty-four tea-spoons, nor ten salt-spoons. I was there four or five weeks before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether all the articles found at his lodgings on the 29th of January, were there when you was, I suppose you cannot say - A. No, I only came to England in October.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you dined with him in this particular lodging before you went abroad - A. I believe I had.</p>
               <p>MARY M'BETH. I live in Norfolk-street. The prisoner lodged three years and more with me - his furniture was his own.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think it is worth - A. Not 100 l.; he has had it ever since he came there - he had this plate when he came. He was always very careful of it; he kept it in silver paper, and cleaned it himself.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Do you include the chimney-glass in the 100 l. - A. No, that is worth about 10 l.; the mirror is worth about 3 1/2 guineas. I heard that he bought it at a sale very cheap - he has had it a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the habit of having dinner and supper parties - A. I believe about four times since he came to my house, he has had small parties of six or eight to dinner, and his brother might drop in two or three times a month - he did not have supper or tea parties. I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210031"></xptr>known him eight months at a time, and not a soul with him. He did not stay out at night - my man servant told me so. He never had card parties - I never saw any cards in his apartments - my servant waited on him.</p>
               <p>MR. SEVESTER. I am a jeweller, and live in New Bond-street. I have known the prisoner fourteen years; I am not in the habit of visiting him. The value of the plate in my judgment, on a rough sketch, is not worth above 75, or 80 guineas - it all appears to have been used. The tea-pot is a fashion of about ten years standing. The sugar-bason, cream-pot, or punch-ladles, are by no means modern. The second-hand value is about 20 l. less. The prisoner bore an excellent character.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did he buy any of the plate of you - A. None.</p>
               <p>- TIPPEN. I live in Richmond's-buildings, Dean-street, Soho. I know the prisoner. Here are three seals on a ring among his plate. I made one of them for him sixteen years ago.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. What are the others worth - A. About 2 1/2 guineas each - they are modern jewellery. Here are five more seals, nearly new and modern, worth about 10 l., he bought none of me, except the old fashioned one.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Thomas-street, Brick-lane. On the 12th of January, about eight o'clock in the evening, I heard the noise of a fowl, as if some one was disturbing them—I ran out, and found the door of the place they were kept in open, and the street door open—I went out, and saw two young lads—I laid hold of them, and asked what they were about—they said they were going on an errand—they called, <hi rend="italic">"Bill</hi>," and the prisoner ran over, and said they were his two brothers, what did I want with them—I let them go—I missed this hen from the place where the fowls were kept, in the yard—it had been fastened by a button.</p>

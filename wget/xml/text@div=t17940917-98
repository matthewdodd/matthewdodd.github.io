               <p>Q. Had she two linen sheets? - Yes; she took them away; I saw them at the pawnbroker's; she was absent going on a fortnight, when I found them at the pawnbroker's; she left part of the rent unpaid, and took away the key of the door. I heard she was in Bridewell, and I went to Bridewell to her, and she delivered me the key; I had asked her to give me the key, to see all was safe in the room; she told me no; she had made away with the sheets; I asked her where they were; she told me they were at Mrs. Moore's, the pawnbroker's; she told me there was the ticket of one for eighteen-pence, and the other was at the same place for half a crown, but she had lost the ticket; they were both there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not owe her but one shilling. - She left but one shilling unpaid.</p>

            Does any body in your house know that she had pawned them? - No, not one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lodged with Mrs. Riley six weeks, at three shillings a week; on the 1st of August my week's rent was due, being Saturday. I paid her two shillings on Sunday morning, and promised to pay her one shilling. It so happened, on Saturday night I was out late, and I was committed to Bridewell for twenty-eight days. Mrs. Riley came to me at Bridewell, and I told her what had happened, and told her I would get them out when I came out. When I came out, and would pay her what I owed her, and the week I had had the key, she staid with me some time, and I begged her to have mercy. When my time was out, she came to the door, and said I must go with her; she said, I must pay her twelve shillings for the month's rent, and get the sheets; I told her I would pay the four shillings I owed her, and get the sheets besides; with that she would not let me go any where; she took me to Guildhall, and I was committed to the Compter; she told the Alderman that I had been missing six weeks, where of I had been missing no longer than what I have told you. I could have got them out again, and should have got them out again, if that accident had not happened; I did not do it with an intention to wrong her out of them, far from it. When I had my hearing with the Alderman, she would have made it up with me.</p>
               <p>Jury. The prisoner has said that the prosecutor promised to forgive her on her paying twelve shillings and taking out the sheets.</p>
               <p>Court. That could make no alteration, the prosecutor cannot compound felony. <rs id="t17940917-98-verdict506" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Pallant, I keep a fancy-neeedlework shop, in Halkin-terrace, Belgrave square, in the parish of, St. Luke, Chelsea—John Sleigh came to my shop on 2d Nov., between four and five o'clock—he asked what silk was a pound—I told him—he did not purchase any then—he went away and came about twenty minutes afterwards, brought a skein of silk, and bought another skein—after he was gone I left the shop to go to tea, about twenty minutes after five—I left Mary Bance in the shop—the shop-door leading to the passage was shut—a person coming into the shop must come through that door—there is only one entrance to the house from the street—persons go into the passage, and then go through the shop-door to get into the shop—I went to tea in a little room adjoining the shop—when I came into the shop again, about twenty minutes before six, from fourteen to sixteen pounds of purse-silk was gone, worth about 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound, and a bundle of wool—the value of all I lost was about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this silk is part of what I lost—I swear to it by this tie—I tied it myself and put it in the window, and it got discoloured—the maker's name is with the parcel—I have some more of the same at home which I tied it up with—there is a great variety of silk, and in this parcel there are samples of all I keep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mrs. Pallant. On Friday, 2d Nov., I saw John Sleigh come into the shop, between four and five o'clock—(I saw Charles in the shop in the course of the day of the robbery, or the day pre<lb></lb>vious)—he asked the price of wool—I was told to take his address—we take the address of persons who give an order—he said, "Williams, Sloane-street"—I was proceeding to write it down, and said, "Sloane-street"—he said, "Yes, you had better not put it down, they are waiting"—he then left the shop, and returned in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—he bought a skein of silk, and left the shop—when he left, the door that led into the passage was fastened with a latch—when it is so fastened, it is not possible to open it without ringing the bell—I left the shop at twenty minutes past five, to go into an adjoining room to tea—I heard the bell ring, as I was passing from the shop to the back-room—Sarah Cooper went out—there is a trigger attached to the frame of the door—it is possible for a person to open the door a small distance, and by passing their hand in, to move up the trigger, and prevent the bell ringing—it has been tried, in my presence—Cooper</p>

               <p>went out on an errand, and came back and found the door open—she came and spoke to me—I went into the shop about twenty minutes before six—I missed the silk and the wool, a work-box, and a box of chenille—I cannot say that I can swear to this silk that is produced, but we had a great quantity of silk like this in the shop—I had passed the two prisoners together with two females, about twenty yards from my mistress's house, at half-past eleven that day, standing talking—I noticed them, because there was some remark made—I did not hear the words, but I turned my head round, and they were all looking at me—I returned the same way at twelve, and saw the prisoners and the women still standing in the same place, in Lowndes-street—I noticed them again—they looked at me particularly, and I thought they looked rudely—they had seen me in the shop as a shopwoman.</p>

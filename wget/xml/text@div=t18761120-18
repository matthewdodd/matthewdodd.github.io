                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman L</hi> 70). At 1.30 on the 9th November I was in King William Street in company with Downes in private clothes, where I saw the two prisoners talking together—I had watched them for about ten minutes previously—I saw Mr. Bates standing on the west side of King William Street, near Sherborno Lane—he was looking at the Lord Mayor's procession coming towards him, towards the Bank—I saw Pross place himself at the right hand side of the prosecutor, take hold of his silver chain with his left hand, catch the watch in his right hand, and break it off—Saunders was partly covering Pross and partly the prosecutor—I stood right by the side of Saunders, covering the other half of Pross—I instantly seized Pross's hand and took the watch from his hand—I took him into cus<lb></lb>tody, and Saunders was instantly seized by the other constable close behind me—on going down Sherborne Lane Pross said "Let me go, you don't know that I stole the watch, you don't look like a policeman, you are more like a dustman."</p>

               <p>a line of people right along King William Street from one end to the other, they might have been three deep—I saw all that took place, I am confident—the procession had not passed at that time, it was coming up—I saw them in conversation, as also many others in conversation—I did not hear the conversation—I had been on duty since 10 o'clock that morning—I had. another case before this—I followed the procession round; I saw all that took place—I was touching the prisoners—I took the watch out of Pross' hand—as soon as I heard the click I seized his hand—I watched them for ten minutes.</p>

I was out with Inward on the day in question, and saw the two prisoners talking together—I watched them for about a quarter of an hour—Pross placed himself at the corner of Sher-borne Lane and Saunders went up half behind the prosecutor, and Icward went behind—Pross and I went behind Saunders—Saunders put his right hand on Pross' right shoulder and his left hand underneath Pross' left arm, bringing it immediately under Pross' hand—Pross raised the gentleman's watch then from "his pocket and I heard a click, and Inward immediately seized hold of Pross and I caught hold of Saunders—Saunders said "What do you want with me?"—I said "You will be charged with being concerned with this man in stealing this gentleman's watch "—he said "You have made a great mistake, I shan't go "—I said "You will," and pulled him back into a doorway, and one of the uniform men came to my assistance—I was in private clothes—I said "l am a policeman, and you know I am "—it was only by threats that he would go to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I distinctly saw Saunders put his right hand on Pross' right shoulder—I said before the Magistrate he put his hand round Pross' waist underneath his hands—I have heard many clicks—it is perhaps a source of gratification.</p>

I live at 41, North End, Croydon, and am a stock<lb></lb>broker's clerk—the silver watch and chain were my property on Lord Mayor's Day, when I was wearing them in King William Street—the chain was hanging—I knew nothing of the robbery till my attention was called by the police.</p>

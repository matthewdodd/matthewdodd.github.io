I was about 100 yards distance; the lighter lay on the shore side; it was a coarse bag. I saw a boat go on shore at Storehouse yard, with one

             followed me. I then came back to Bell Wharf; Penprice came there in another boat, and ran up stairs; but I don't know where he came from. He then had such a coat on as the man had that flung the bag into the boat, and by his dress, I believe he was the man; but can't be positive. He went to Storehouse yard, where the bag was put. I follow'd him to an house there, where I saw the bag, marked as before; it was just by the door, which was open before he went to it. He went into the house; the bag stood on its end, he hove it down and took two pieces of ginger out, saying it was of the right sort, and would fetch them about an ounce a piece. He asked then who would stand porter, and

            . I was in one boat the 8th of July, about eleven at noon, and the other witness in another, at Bell Wharf, for the purpose of plying. I observed a boat shove from between the ship and lighter, and saw a large bundle lying in the boat head; it went to Storehouse yard, and I followed it in mine. I saw the man of the boat take a bag on his shoulder, and carry it into Storehouse yard, to a house; the mark I do not know. but I saw No. 3, such a bag as this produced. I did not see him carry it into the house. I shoved my boat stern on shore. After he had taken the bag out of the boat he asked if it was my property; I said no. Penprice was then in a boat along with Robertson; not above a quarter of an hour after he came out of the boat, and asked me what it was. I told him I could not tell, but would go and see. Then I rowed my boat to Bell Wharf, and stoved her, and went to Storehouse yard, and saw the bag standing in a house. He followed us to the house I found to be Clark's. Penprice took it and turned it down, and said, This is the right sort; and asked who would be porter. I said I would not; he then asked Robertson, who said he would. He put it on Robertson's back, and he carried it to some distance, with the mark and number upwards, so he turned it downward. Then he carried it to Penprice's cellar, and put it into one corner, with saw-dust or bran out of a basket upon it.</p>

            . The bag of ginger was brought into Clark's house on the 8th of July, betwixt ten and eleven in the day: it was set down on the right hand side, and had an I. and S. S. with a cross and figure of 3. I was there. Penprice followed it in about 5 minutes, with the 2 witnesses; those two stood at the door. Penprice turned the bag down, and breaking a hole put his finger in and took out some ginger, and said it was of the right sort; then broke a piece and flung it into the window. The numbers were towards the door when first set down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bag of the size of this produced?</p>
               <p>A. Austine. I think it was a little longer and whiter. He asked Herrington to carry it, and he refused it; then he asked Robertson, and he did; but in the middle of the yard, Penprice stopped him and turned the mark of the bag downwards.</p>

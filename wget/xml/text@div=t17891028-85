               <p>When I came from my master's house, about eight o'clock, I went out with a piece of victuals; there were two men at the door, they asked me to take a load for them to such a place, and they would reward me with a shilling? I said, I would; I asked them what it was? they said, it was some lead in a bag; I was to take it into Petticoat-lane, the corner of Cox's-square, to one Thomas's; I was to go through Spittle-square, there the patrols met me; I pitched the lead, and told them; and they took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Court to Lockwood. Did the prisoner tell you at the time you apprehended him, that he was carrying it for two men? - He did not say he was to meet any man; he said, he was carrying lead for two men, and was to deliver it there; after we taxed him with it, he said, he came from an empty house with it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

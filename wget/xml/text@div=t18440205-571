                  </hi>. I was a passenger on board the vessel—before it arrived at Bahia, I had heard both Gibbs and Wilkinson complain to the captain of sickness, Gibbs, from the time he first came on board, and Wilkinson, per<lb></lb>haps</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184402050060"></xptr>
               <p>three weeks or a month before—I saw Gibbs state—my opinion is, had we not touched at Bahia, and got medical advice, he would have died—we arrived at Bahia on the morning of the 3rd I believe—on the vessel coming into port, four of the men came to the captain and requested to go ashore—three of them, Gibbs, Wilkinson, and Clyne, in consequence of ill-health—the captain went ashore with me before he would allow them to go ashore—I did not remain with the captain while he was at the consul's—I met the men with the captain at the chandler's-ship store, and saw him go with the men to the consul—on their return I heard him tell them, "You hear what the consul has said, the doctor will not grant you certificates, you must go on board"—they replied, "No, we will not go on board, it will be cruel for the consul to compel us to go on board in the state we are in"—the captain said, "I shall go to the consul and report you, and of course he will be obliged to take you up as deserters"—the captain left me, to go to the consul—I did not go with him—I saw the captain again a few minutes after—I know Lodine, and Smith, and another man—I consider they were shipped instead of these men—I was with the captain afterwards, looking after other men, and he got these men from the master of the <hi rend="italic">Eschylus</hi>, lying in the harbour—he went to the consul for his papers—I was not with him when he got them, but he shortly afterwards returned, and the vessel sailed—I took the last man on board myself—I went to the consul to do that, but he was not in town—I saw his clerk—the vessel sailed about three hours after that—I gave the witnesses some money—it was not given me by the captain—I did not give them dollars, but what is termed milrees, which is paper money—I have never had that money repaid to me—it was a present from me to the men—I considered it really a cruelty to have sent the men on board the ship, and believe they deserted the vessel in consequence of ill-health, and with the feelings of a sailor I could not allow them to be left destitute in that country, without assistance—I am a sailor myself, and have commanded a merchantman—I swear the money was my own, and it was given them for my own objects.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SHEPHERD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was it you said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought it cruelty to leave them ashore without assistance—I considered them ill—I had pre<lb></lb>scribed them medicine—I thought it cruel the consul should have refused to give them a certificate—that is what I mean—the milrees I gave them, I sup<lb></lb>pose would amount to above 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. English, but the exchange varies—I gave it them entirely from feelings of compassion, and I think any man, under the circumstances, would have done so—the captain dared not give them money as deserters from a ship; and as proof, he did not wish to defraud them of their wnges, he brought them on shore himself to the con<lb></lb>sul, in his own boat, and a doctor with them—he never told me to give them money—I do not know that the consul did not grant them certificates—I was at the store when the captain was talking to them, except for a very few seconds—the consul's office is only four doors from the store—I saw them walking with the captain—the captain could not have had any conversation with them at the store when I was not present, nor at any time—I should say that was not more than two or three hours previous to the vessel sail<lb></lb>ing—I believe I was scarcely ever absent from the captain, except at the time he went to the consul's—he never went from the ship without me.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> While you were at the store, did the captain ever tell them to conceal themselves till the brig had sailed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, nor to keep out of the way of the consul, in my hearing—if that had been said at the store, I should say I must have heard it—I never knew anything of the captain except on this voyage.</p>

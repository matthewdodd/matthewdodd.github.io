               <p>Q. What do you accuse her of? - A. Taking of three pair of stockings, a hat, a pair of shoes, an iron, two cloth caps, and a muslin cap, and a ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave at home? - A. No one; I had the key of my room in my pocket, my husband was in the country a hay-making.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that she had got in? - A. A neighbour in the next room told me; she had fastened the door with this poker, and when I got in, she told me to do my best and my worst, I should find nothing on her; I found her sitting in the room with a piece of my bed-gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your things? - A. They were outside of the door on the landing-place; my neighbour rapped at the door, she would not let her in; I went to my landlord, he got in at the window, and let me in.</p>
               <p>- COOMBES sworn. - On Saturday, the 29th of June, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was fetched to No. 22, Back Church-lane; when I went up stairs, I saw the prisoner in Messenger's room, and this bundle was on the outside of the room on the landing-place; the staple of the door had been drawn out, and it was lying loose on the floor; I took her down stairs, and searched her; she had nothing on her but this ribbon and this thread rolled together down her bosom; she said that the woman that was with her had gone away with the rest of the things; I produce the things that I found - a pair of shoes, a hat, a piece of check cloth, and a ribbon.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. About half past three o'clock, I came from Milk-street with an acquaintance; she said to me, Mrs. Clarke, will you come along with me, and have a cup of tea; I said, no, I thank you; she said, about a quarter of an hour before she went up, she should be obliged to break her door open; I said, I will not come up; she said, you may come up; I went up and sat down, and she took a piece of coarse cloth off the table, and said, I am going to buy two mackerel; she said she would not stay long, for if her husband came up, he would kill me and her; says she, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100065"></xptr>will kick you down stairs; I staid in the room till she got down stairs; there was an alarm made, and they kept me in the room.</p>

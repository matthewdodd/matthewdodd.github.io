Brooksbank and Farn, for my inspection, among other papers named in the schedule for the purpose of the cause—an appointment had been made on 7th Feb. by letter, for the 8th—I called on the 8th, but Mr. Hillyer said he had not looked up the documents, they were not ready, and I made an appointment for the 10th—I demanded a copy of it under the terms of the answer, and a copy was given me by Mr. Hillyer, for which I paid 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have the copy in my pocket.</p>

Brooksbank and Farns in pursuance of an appointment you had made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was—I did not go alone, a person named Boulter accompa<lb></lb>nied me; he is clerk to Mr. Wilkin, the attorney for this prosecution—Boulter was present at the time of the inspection of the documents that were pro<lb></lb>duced to me—I cannot say exactly how long that inspection continued, per<lb></lb>haps we might have been there twenty minutes or half an hour; I should not think more than half an hour; it is impossible for me to swear we were not there an hour; I do not think it was an hour—I will not swear we were not there an hour—there was a variety of documents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the documents handed to you or to Boulter for the purpose of inspection? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were laid on the desk—they were handed to me—he inspected them with me on the desk—these receipts were among the docu<lb></lb>ments that were laid on the desk and inspected by me and Boulter—I do not know whether Boulter had anything in his hand while he was inspecting this particular document—he certainly had something in his hand during the time he was there—he had a pencil in his hand, and copied something from a bill of costs, but I cannot swear whether he had it in his hand at the time of his inspection of the documents or afterwards, when we were copying some bills of costs—a portion of the time I know he had a pencil in his hand—he was making extracts from a bill of costs, whether it was at that time I do not know—I do not remember having the pencil in my hand—I know very little about Mr. Boulter—I have heard it stated that he is a discharged clerk of Mr. Cutts, but I believe it is not so—I have heard that he was formerly in Mr. Cutts' employment, but I do not know it of my own knowledge—he is in the neighbourhood of the Court, outside, I believe—I was in attendance on the Grand Jury but was not called in—Boulter went into the room; he might have been in the Grand-jury room ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—Mr. Wilkin did not attend before the Grand Jury; I believe Boulter attended for him as the attorney—he went into the Grand-jury room alone, unless In<lb></lb>spector Penny went in with him, I will not be positive as to that—he went in before any of the witnesses—I believe he had the indictment in his hand—I wont say whether he had or not; it was either in his hand, or else he had previously handed it to the officer, I am not positive which.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>.

               <p>you were there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever, unless in this way; while I was there I bespoke a copy, and it then went out of my hands into the hands of the clerk of Messrs. Brooksbank and Faro, who I believe is in Court now, and I lost sight of it while the copy was being made.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Boulter was no party to the copy being made. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; no alteration could have been made by him or me at the time—Mr. Wilkin was concerned for the other Salmons in the suit—they were defendants—strictly speaking, I can not say that Boulter attended on that occasion as Mr. Wilkin's clerk—I believe the order was for the production to the plaintiff—Mr. Wilkin was concerned for the other defendants—I should say that two clerks of Messrs. Brooksbank and Farn were in the office the whole time these docu<lb></lb>ments were being inspected—I know by looking at the proceedings, that Mr. Wilkin was solicitor for the other two Salmons, he so appears on the record, as I was informed by one <hi rend="italic">of</hi> our clerks.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The proceedings in Chancery were here put in and read, from which it appeared that Joseph Smith Salmon, a brother of the prosecutor, had filed a bill against Mr. Ctlts, in May</hi>, 1847, <hi rend="italic">praying for the specific performance</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">contract of sale, by which he</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Cutts</hi>) <hi rend="italic">had agreed to become the purchaser of Lot</hi> 8 <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 2,510<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">whilst Edmund Salmon, the prosecutor, filed a bill profit that the contract might be set aside for fraud on the part of Mr. Cutts, he not having complied with the conditions of sale by paying the necessary deposit, in the answers of Mr. Cutts to these bills, and in his own bill he expressed his desire to complete the contract, and alleged that he had paid to Edmund Salmon monies on account of the purchase of Lot</hi> 8, <hi rend="italic">for which he held his receipts, end in a schedule annexed to his last answer, the dates and amounts of these receipts were set out.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and reside at Weathers field in Essex; I and my brothers Joseph and John were entitled, under the will of a Mrs. Smith, to some property in that county; it was an estate called Saville's Farm in Great and Little Bardfield—that estate adjoins considerable landed property belonging to Mr. Cutts—I first became acquainted with Mr. Cutts when he first came to reside at a place called Little Bard field Hall—I <hi rend="smallCaps">WM</hi> married in 1844—I became acquainted with Mr. Cutts about twelve months before that—I married a young lady who formed part of his family—she was the daughter of his housekeeper, and was living in Mr. Cutts' family at the time I became acquainted with him—Mr. Cutts gave her away—I was I minor when I married, under twenty—I was married by license—Mr. Cutts acted as solicitor to the trustees under Mrs. Smith's will—after my marriage I and my brothers were advised by Mr. Cutts to sell the property—I was it that time under age—Mr. Cutts gave no particular reason for advising me to sell before I was of age—he did just as he thought proper, in fact we had so voice in it whatever; he managed it chiefly; whatever he advised we must abide by the consequences—eventually I and my brothers agreed that the property should be sold, and Mr. Franklin was employed as the auctioneer to sell it; we never employed him—he was employed by Mr. Cutts—he was at that time a tenant of Mr. Cutts—he was an auctioneer and farmer—I was it the sale—Mr. Cutts became the purchaser of Lot 8 for 2,510<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had early possession given him of a portion that adjoined his own property—there was a crop on it at the time, which was valued by Mr. Franklin at about 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was. the portion that I was in possession of—he took possession of the whole of Lot 8 at Michaelmas—I have received from Mr. Cutts sums of money since my marriage amounting altogether to 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the first sum was</p>

               <p>50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 5th January, 1847—I received the 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in five different payments; all in 1847—I really am not certain of the dates—I did not receive either of those sums on account of the purchase-money of Lot 8—I never re<lb></lb>ceived the 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the crop—some time after, an application was made to me to give receipts for the money that had been advanced to me by Mr. Cutts—I should imagine it was about December, 1847—it was made by Evans on the part of Mr. Cutts—he came to me and said that Mr. Cutts had asked him whether he had got the receipts, and he told him he had—he said, "You know I have not got them,"and he said, "Will you oblige me by giving those receipts to me"—I had got them in a book, and after some time I said I would not do it for Mr. Cutts, but I would for him, he being my brother-in-law—Evans is a brother of my wife's, and that is why I did it—I had got these sums of money at the time I received them, down in a book—Evans took the receipts down, and wrote the body of the receipt himself, and I signed it—I gave him from the book the dates, and the particulars of the sums I had received—it was at my house—he wrote in my presence part of the paper produced—he wrote the bodies of five receipts, and I put my name to each of them, as it appears there now—the words "o/a lot 8" (<hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> "<hi rend="italic">on account of lot</hi> 8,") were decidedly not there when I signed them; I am posi<lb></lb>tive of it—I believe those additional words to be Evans's writing—I had a pen and ink in the room when he came—in signing these receipts I used the same pen that he did—I believe there was only one pen; at least, I did not see any other; I am certain there was no other in the room—I believe I had received all those five sums from the hands of Evans.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes you believe it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that he has acted for Mr. Williams in that way.</p>
               <p>Sir F. <hi rend="smallCaps">THESIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But has he interfered in any way in these Chancery proceedings in your behalf? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh! yes, he has—I suppose he has to a certain extent interfered in this prosecution—Boulter made the charge against Mr. Cutts at the Police-office—he has conducted this prosecution—he went with me to Messrs. Brooksbank and Farns for the purpose of inspecting this document—I believe that was after he had been with Mr. Tournay—these receipts were exhibited to us—we remained but a short time inspecting them, merely to look at them and come out again immediately—it was not ten minutes; not more than five, I should think—I only saw that "o/a lot 8" was added—that was the first time I ever saw it on the receipts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Cutts at any time advance you a sum altogether of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did; that was before I married—it was in two or three sums, but I believe in three—I believe all that money was given to me by the hands of Mr. Cutts—I never repaid any part of it—I have never paid any interest on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090129"></xptr>
               <p>it—a stage-coach was set on foot by some gentleman at Bardfield, which ran to one of the stations—Mr. Cutts became the owner of that coach, and I purchased it from him afterwards for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never paid him any part of that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was never asked for—all the five sums mentioned in these receipts were given to me by Evans on account of Mr. Cutts—at the time they were given I did not give him any receipts or acknowledgments of any kind; I was never asked—at the time these sums were given me by Evans, the valuation of the crops of lot 8 had been made by Mr. Franklin—I do not know when the contract for that purchase was signed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where were these monies given to you by your brother-in-law Evans? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I believe some at Little Bardfield-hall, others at my own house—I cannot distinguish which of them was given at Little Bardfield-hall and which at my own house—I believe two or three of the first I received at Little Bard<lb></lb>field-hall—that was where Mr. Cutts' office was—I do not know whether they were paid at the office—they were paid at the hall, and I know very well that two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes were paid to me at my own house, which Evans brought over—Mr. Cutts was indebted to me at that time—there was the crop—I considered that I borrowed these monies, a part of them, and part Mr. Cutts owed me—part I considered was money borrowed from Mr. Cutts, and the other put was in part of money that was owing to me from Mr. Cutts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you now speaking of the five sums? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR</hi> F. <hi rend="smallCaps">THESIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is it that Mr. Cutts was indebted to you for that you think part of this money might have been in respect of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, there was the crop—I considered that I borrowed the principal of the money, and I considered I should have to pay interest for it—when I say part was in payment, I mean in payment of the crops of lot 8—they were valued at 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we never had any settlement in any way—it was a mere idea of my own that part of that money was in respect of the crops—I suppose at the time I went to ask for the first 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it was in payment of the crops, very likely—I do not know what the amount was that was paid me in respect of the crops—it was no particular sum.</p>
               <p>

               <p>the money which I applied in my own mind to the crops, and the other which I borrowed—I never mentioned each a thing—I merely asked for the money at I would if I wanted to borrow money of any one else—there were two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, which I recollect perfectly having been paid at my own house—the first 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note I made application for, was at Little Bardfield-hall in respect of the crops—I believe that was paid to me at the hall—the pay<lb></lb>ment at my own house was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in two fifties—it was only one payment in two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes—I said two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes before.</p>

SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear that those three fields were sold in one lot? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was the seventh lot—they were part of lot 8, but I was given to understand it was turned into two lots Mr. Cutts had the whole management of the business, and did just as he thought proper—we had no voice in it whatever—I was a minor at the time—he wished to have the three fields in one lot, but he did not put them in one lot—they were called the Potter hedges fields—I was on very good terms with Mr. Cutts up to Sept., 1847—I and my brothers have expressed dissatisfaction at the bargain—I have expressed dissatisfaction to my brothers, and to others—I have certainly never given notice of my com<lb></lb>plaint to Mr. Cutts, but I was informed it was bought very much under its value—I do not know that very shortly after Mr. Cutts came into possession of lot 8 he expended a great deal of money in improving it—probably he might, but I have not been on the estate since he bought it—I have been by it—I do not know that he has greatly improved it—I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090131"></xptr>
               <p>been informed that he has done some ditching—I never took any particular notice—there did not appear any such great improvements—no doubt money has been expended on it—there might be a slight improvement of a few pounds probably—I have not visited Mr. Letch, the incoming tenant—I have never been into his house since I gave up possession, or since I threshed out my crops—that was after Michaelmas—I cannot state when I finished threshing—I am not at all aware; as soon as I got my corn out—I had the privilege of going to the premises to thresh out any corn before the next Lady-day—I really do not know what time it was—it was in the evening time that Evans came to me for the receipts—we had something to drink both before and after the signing, the same as we had always been in the practice of doing when he came to my house—I cannot say what we had to drink—it was some kind either of liquor or beer—I cannot recollect—I can<lb></lb>not state to an hour what time he came—it was in the evening time—I do not know what time he left; very likely nine, very likely eleven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Evans sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, pretty well, I believe—I was quite well—I am not aware that Evans had been drinking before he came—he was pretty well when he came—how he was before he left, I must leave—I will say he was sober if you like—I should say he was neither drunk nor sober—my wife was ill in bed—the book that I kept my receipts in was kept is my writing-desk, I believe, in the same room—on my oath my wife did not fetch the book on that occasion—Evans went home that night, at least he left my house—at any rate he did not sleep at my house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he first came about the receipts, did he appear to you like a person that had been drinking or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not particularly, oh no—I dare say he had been drinking, but not to take particular notice of—he had not had enough to be labouring under the effects of liquor, decidedly—I should think it was, perhaps, an hour after he came that £ signed the receipts which he wrote, perhaps more; I really cannot say—it was an hour or an hour and a half—I believe there was some drinking between us after he came before the receipts were signed, and we were smoking a pipe together in that same room—we undoubtedly had something to drink, it was very simple what we had—I am pretty well certain we had something before I was asked for the receipts—neither he nor I drank any liquor to make us at all tipsy before the receipts were signed—I do not remember what it was we drank, there was liquor on the table—he staid after the receipts were signed, possibly, about the same time, it might be two hours; I really cannot state—he would have to go between three or four miles home—I cannot say whether he was on foot or on horseback—he was in the habit of coming to my house so often that I did not take any notice—possibly he came in the chaise, most likely on horseback—he went away by the same conveyance that he came by—he came alone, and I think he went away by himself—he was living with Mr. Cutts at that time—he had been living with Mr. Cutts ever since I knew bin—in 1846 a conveyance was tendered to me by Boulter, then Mr. Cutts clerk, which I refused to sign—that was at Little Bardfield-hall—my brothers were there—we all refused to execute it—before Sept. 1847, Mr. Cutts said he would get me a farm of Lord Mornington, professing to be my friend—I think that was in 1846 or 1847—it was often talked about for some time, Mr. Cutts said he would get it for me, and we would manage it between us—the sums of money mentioned in these receipts were handed to me by Evans—I never had any conversation with Mr. Cutts on the subject, or on the advance of money that he had made.</p>
               <p>

               <p>has lent you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; there was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. borrowed before I was of age, and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the coach—I was to have the whole of the 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the crop of corn on the farm that I was thus holding—it was wheat and barley—I was tenant of the firm then—Mr. Cutts bought it, let it to Letch, and then I came out—between Michaelmas and the September following I threshed out my corn—I did not thresh oat any of it in 1848—I began to thresh it imme<lb></lb>diately after harvest—I really cannot say the tine I finished—I got it out as soon as I could—I threshed out as late as Dec. 1848, certainly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you had actually received the 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in these five different pay<lb></lb>ments, how came you to say to Evans that you would not give Mr. Cutts the receipts, bnt you would give them to him (Evans), your brother-in-law? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, because Mr. Cutts had treated me in that way, and I said, "I was never asked to give receipts at the time of receiving the moneys, and I do not see why I should do so now."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you think it was the part of an honest man to refuse the receipts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Cutts had not behaved honest to me—I was never asked at the time to give a receipt, not till some time afterwards—I had not quarrelled with Mr. Cutts at that time, but he had the chance of letting me have a farm, and he would not do it—I did not owe him a grudge for that particularly, only that I had been treated very ill all the way through by him, in every respect—he always promised to get me into a farm, and when he had a chance he would not do it; he professed to be my friend, but he was the greatest enemy I had—when Evans asked me for the receipts, I said, "I will give them to you, but I will not give them to Mr. Cutts," and afterwards I said, "If Mr. Cutts wishes to rob me, I don't wish to rob him, I have received the 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lithographic printer. I have been much employed in the examination of documents, to ascertain the genuineness of handwriting, for upwards of twenty years—I was called upon to examine these receipts—they were then in the possession of a policeman at the police-court—on examining the first receipt, I was struck by observing, through my glass, a pencil-line after the word "Pounds," to write on, I imagine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it through his glass</hi>) I see a broken pencil-mark, the letter "a," the lower part of the "1" in "Lot," the turn of the capital "L," and a pencil-line like the last upstroke of the "8," which is put in ink, and also a pencil-mark with a dash to it—the "a" in ink, representing the word "account," does not cover the "a" in pencil; it is a little below it—the "a" in pencil is still visible—(<hi rend="italic">the Jury here examined the recipts with the witness's glass</hi>)—I see a difference between the former part of the receipt and the latter—the "o/s" in "Lot 8" is not written consecutively following "Received of Mr. Cutts £50"—it is written in closer, with a finer pen, and another coloured ink—it is thrust in—there was plenty of room for writing it conese<lb></lb>cutively as well as the other part—it was written at another time and with another ink—there is no pencil-line under the words Received of Mr. Cutts £50"—I believe the "o/a lot 8," to be the same handwriting, but written with another pen—the person did not write "o/a lot 8," at the same time as "Received of Mr. Cutts"—it is not written with the same freedom—there is the pencil-mark of the "a" remaining decidedly—it is larger than the "a" in ink, a little over it, and a little under it, and intermingled with it, but a perfect "a"—the ampliate of it does not inclose a space double that of the "a" to ink—it occupies about the same space as it would in the other, and very little more—intermingled with the bottom of the capital "L," and crossing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090133"></xptr>
               <p>it, there is a pencil-mark similar to it, as though the "L "was to take that precise space in pencil—by the side of the figure "8" I see what I should call the principal part of an 8 in pencil—it is a little beyond the "8" in ink—I cannot tell whether these pencil-marks were written before or after the writing, because it has been so much rubbed—there is the appearance of its having been rubbed; I mean that portion particularly over "o/a and Lot 8"—India-rubber has been applied there undoubtedly, and not to the rest of the receipt.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a letter or a word has been traced in pencil, and you traverse the same lines with ink, will it not have a different appearance afterwards from the ink on another part of the paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very little indeed, unless the pencil is very thick and greasy; then it would a little, but not where the pencil is light—if the ink covered the pencil, it would be impossible to know which was done first—good ink would cover the pencil entirely—if the pencil came thickly over the ink it would leave a little brown appearance over the ink, and I should know it was done after the ink—I cannot detect it here by this glass—it is all very faint writing—in that particular I would not attempt to form a judgment.</p>

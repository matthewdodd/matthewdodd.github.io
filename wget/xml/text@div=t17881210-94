             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was the commander of the British King revenue cutter? - I was in the service of the excise.</p>
               <p>Was you on board the cutter on the 3d and 4th of April, 1787? - I was.</p>
               <p>Be so good as to tell us what your directions were on the 4th of April? - On the 3d of April, in the evening, I was sitting in a coffee-room at Falmouth. I had some information of two boats coming in, which led me to man my boats. I went off from Dean's Castle, and there I waited with my people till between one and two in the morning. My force was five men and myself. I saw a small cutter boat coming in for harbour: we perceived her standing in: we rowed further into the harbour, close into Falmouth harbour, within the port of Falmouth, over the bars. When we perceived her far enough, we rowed forward, and came up to her. Whenever she perceived us, she stood right for the shore. We overtook her on the rocks, and laid hold of her with the boat-hook. Soon after we hooked her, she struck on the rocks. We told them it was the excise-boat, and to lower their fails. Just as she struck, there was a pretty fresh breeze of wind. I got on board of her. I was surprized to see so many men; I did not expect above four or five; there appeared to me to be ten or twelve people, or perhaps more. They were sitting on the casks when we boarded her: they were casks full of brandy, I suppose about nine gallons each cask.</p>
               <p>What quantity do you imagine were on board the boat? - Twenty-one. When I saw so many men, I was a little alarmed. I told them to go on shore immediately, quietly; or else, if they made any resistance, it would be worse for them. No one spoke, or moved. I had a cutlass in my hand, and I cut all the ropes of the rigging, to lower their sails. There were two or three of my own men, that followed me into the boat; I told them to haul the fails down: at the same time it was pretty dark. Just at this moment I perceived a man put his head between my feet, to throw me overboard; that was one of the people of the smugglers. They were all sitting down, and we were standing up. It was very suddenly. Though I had a cutlass in my hand, I had not time to make use of it. I stooped to lay hold of the man whose head was between my feet; upon which one of the people of the smugglers struck me down with a bludgeon. The boat was so low, and nothing to lay hold of, to prevent me from going over, I did not expect to escape. The mark of it is here; and the man who had his head between my legs shoved me; and with that, and the assistance of the blow, I went over back wards into the water. At last I got upon my feet in the water, and caught hold of the boat's gunnel; and as I got my head above water, I received another blow on the cheek, which swelled very much. I found myself very much stunned by the first blow. I then recovered my footing pretty well, and I kept the cutlass over my head, which was bruised by the bludgeons; for we afterwards secured several of the bludgeons, which were square, like a piece of wood cut out of the rough: there were some for one hand, and some for two; which were of course very dangerous weapons. With one of those bludgeons I had my blows. In point of fact, several blows were aimed at me. I received two very severe blows: I kept a great many off my head with my cutlass: the steel bars of the cutlass were knocked down flat on my hand. It was not a common cutlass; it was a better one, that had very strong steel bars. After this, the affray became general in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100086"></xptr>boat, between my people and the people of the smugglers.</p>
               <p>How did it end, at last? - The man that threw me over, was thrown over by one of my men immediately after: they say it was the prisoner; I do not know him. We at last threw all the smugglers overboard; we then took possession of the boat. When my own people were taking me out of the boat, I received another blow on the breast with a stone. The water was then above my middle, as I stood in the water, and they threw stones from the shore; a great many showers of very large stones. I might be eight or ten yards from the shore. The blow I received was a very large one: my wrist was black, I dare say, for three months; I had not the proper use of it for two months. At last we possessed ourselves of the boat: we found in it one or two and twenty anchors of brandy, I do not recollect which; they contained about nine gallons and a half, or ten gallons. That was the first duty I ever did.</p>
               <p>Were they slung? - Yes; there were ropes tied round them for convenience, to carry them away, or whip them on horseback: that is usual in the smuggling trade; not very common in fair trade; there is no such casks used in fair trade. I tasted the spirits; it was foreign brandy.</p>
               <p>You was a stranger at Plymouth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was not acquainted with the smugglers? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Council. This was between one and two in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No later in the year than April? - No.</p>
               <p>It was last April? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I was a seaman on board the British King excise cutter, on the 4th of April. I was one of the five men that manned the captain's boat in Falmouth Harbour. We saw this smuggling boat, and waited for it; we gave chace to it, and hailed her: we told them we were the excise-boat, and desired them to haul the fails down. They made no reply at first; we hailed them again: one of them made a kind of answer, just to say they would, or something of that; but they never did, till they run the boat on shore; then we run the boat along side of it; Captain Stewart and I came along side of her. When we came on board, we saw the liquors: I believe there were ten men. We boarded her, and ordered all the sail down: they never once hauled the sails down; but one

I said, Solomon, what are you about? I had a hanger in my hand, and I came up with my hanger, and fetched a blow at him: he was gone; whether he fell overboard, or was hit overboard, I do not know.

               <p>Are you sure he was the person that stooped down and threw the captain overboard? - Yes, I am sure of it; and when they hove Captain Stewart overboard, a man came forward in the boat with both his hands to a large stick, and struck him over the forehead; and another, with a large stick, (they had all large sticks) as big as my arm, in the hurry I was knocked down into the boat, and had some blows over my arm: my arm was swelled up; I thought it was broke, it was so swelled. I had some blows after I was down. I lost my senses; I saw nobody came to my assistance; I thought the smugglers would have killed me. We three, only, jumped on board. One

               <p>Could you see who were the persons that threw the stones? - Not in particular: but, by the quickness, they all threw stones; all the smugglers stood on the beach and hove stones.

            , the prisoner, hauled Captain Stewart overboard. He knows me very well, and I him. I have known him fifteen or sixteen years; I have failed with him in the Customs. I believe I have left it off for four or five years. I am sensible he is the person; he put his head between his legs, and turned him backwards; then I took the prisoner directly, and threw him overboard.</p>
               <p>What became of the prisoner after that? - I do not know; he went on shore. After they got on shore, they hove stones as hard as they could heave them. We took possession of the boat; we found in her twenty-one ankers of liquor, gin, brandy, or rum; foreign spirits.</p>
               <p>Was it slung? - I think they were. Captain Stewart was badly hurt by this; he had a cut in his head.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the man you threw overboard was this prisoner? - Oh, that is the very same man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This was between one and two in the morning? - Yes. I had but just got on board this smuggling boat.</p>
               <p>From that time to the present perhaps you have not seen the prisoner? - Oh, yes, I saw him the next morning go into a publick house at Falmouth.</p>
               <p>You took him up, perhaps? - No.</p>
               <p>Never applied for a warrant? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100088"></xptr>Perhaps you appeared at the trial in Cornwall? - Yes, against one man.</p>
               <p>The jury acquitted him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlyes addressed the jury on the part of the defendant.</p>

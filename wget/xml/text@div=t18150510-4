On the 23rd of April last, I was in the Strand, I met the prisoner Smith, I came up to him; it was about a quarter before ten o'clock; at that time, I was at the end of Holywell-street; I never saw him before to my knowledge; he endeavoured to get into some kind of conversation with me; I took no heed of him; I kept on, and he kept on walking with me until we nearly reached Temple Bar; when we came to Star-court, (which is by the side of Temple Bar,) he spoke about turning up Star-court; I did not know for what purpose we were to turn into the court. We walked together within a few yards of Temple Bar; the prisoner, Simons, joined us about four or five yards from Temple Bar, he came as if from the road side; he came close to my right hand. All three of us passed through the Bar together; nothing occurred until we came close to Bell-yard; I turned up Bell-yard; they walked on with me, one on my right hand, and the other on my left, until we came to <placeName id="t18150510-4-crimeloc21">Apollo-court, in Bell-yard</placeName>

The prisoner, Simons was on my right hand, close to me, and at the instant the blow was struck, I felt my watch go from me in an instant; it was in my breeches fob, on the right side; there was a ribbon, and a gilt key, to it, and a valuable seal. The prisoners ran away, immediately I heard them running. I never saw them before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing one to the other - A. They did not say any thing together that I heard, to my knowledge not a word passed from Simons to the other; if they did say any thing after it was done, I did not hear it. I never saw my watch again; the value of the watch is two pounds ten shillings, it cost me five pounds ten shillings. I am perfectly sure I had the watch at the time I was struck, I had felt it a few minutes before, and I likewise felt it drawn out of my pocket as I fell down; I was perfectly sober, I had not been in any public-house. Somebody picked me up. I was going to my own lodgings; this was the nearest way to my lodgings. I called out stop thief as I was laying on the stones; two watchmen came up, and said, had I called out stop thief, they could have secured them; they were not stopped at that time. I went home to my lodgings; and I had a thought that they were then lurking about Temple Bar, and it struck me that I would go out, and see if I could see any thing of them; I then went from my lodgings back again to Temple Bar, with intention to go into Pickett-street, to see if I could see any thing of them lurking about; I had a friend with me at the same time; we passed through the bar, I had scarcely got though it, before the alarm was given of stop thief, by a gentleman of the name of Jones. The prisoner, Simons, had been picking his pocket; the rattles were sprung upon the alarm of stop thief being given and several people were in pursuit; I, and my friend, went among the number, with the watchman, and in turning about from St. Clements, the prisoner, Simons, fell, he was running as if he was making for Essex-street, and in turning down he fell; Simons was then secured, and taken to the watch-house; I knew his person immediately, I was positive to his person, having joined me at Temple Bar, he looks very much like a Jew, that is the one that joined Smith at Temple Bar; he took my watch. The other was not taken then, he was Tuesday evening following; I was Smith was taken, two officers took him Bow-street, the other belonging to when he was at Bow-street, I at to his person; it was on the Monday taken, at his second examination sure of both the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Clements parish. I apprehended the prisoner, Simons, on the 23rd of April, in the evening, he was with Mr. Jones, who accused him of picking his pocket of a pocket-book: Mr. Jones gave charge of him to take him into custody. He was walking by the side of Mr. Jones when he gave him in charge, just by St. Clements pillars.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Jones had laid hold of him before you - A. Yes; when I laid hold of the prisoner, he ran; I called stop thief, I sprang my rattle, and with the assistance of other watchman, and the prosecutor, we took Simons; Eglinton was with me at the time I took the prisoner; the prosecutor, Eglinton, said, he would swear to Simons, was one of the two that knocked him down, and stole his watch. The prisoner said, he was innocent. I asked him what made him run away; he said, what should he stand to be taken for.</p>

            . On the 23rd of April last, about half past ten o'clock, I heard my partner's watchmen calling out stop thief, he sprang his rattle; I immediately ran to his assistance; I saw Simons running in St. Clements, by the end of Essex-street, he had a fall, the watchman and I catched him, and secured him. Eglinton gave charge of him for robbing him of his watch. I have had him several times in custody before for picking pockets, and riots in the street.</p>
               <p>JOHN BEAN. I am a patrole. I know the two prisoners; I saw them together on Sunday, the 23rd of April, in Pickett street, Temple Bar; the first time I saw them was about half past eight o'clock; this was the first time I saw them that night; I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100007"></xptr>then after that, I was watching them from Wych Street to Temple-bar; I watched them till nine o'clock at that time; I watched them up and down Pickett-street, I saw them trying every gentleman's pocket they came nigh. The prisoner Simons get sight of me, he told Smith that he saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you should not say that.</p>
               <p>Bean. Afterwards I turned back, and went into a public house, the public-house is at the end of Wych street the sign of the King's Head the prisoner Smith came into the public-house; he called for a pint of half and half, he gave a three shilling piece to change while he was looking at his change, in come Simons; they drank their liquor and went out, and I saw no more of them, I did not see any thing more of them till I saw Simons at the watch-house. The next morning the prisoner Simmons was taken to Bow-street, I went with Simons on Monday morning to the magistrate. I asked Eglinton if he could swear to the man. On Monday morning at Bow-street he said positively he could; which he did swear to him; I then gave him a description of the other man who was with Simons, and asked if he should know him again, he said he positively should, and that the man I had discribed, was the man. On the Tuesday following, I informed a Bow street officer, Archibald Ruthwin, and on Tuesday evening, Ruthwin and I went in search of Smith, we found him at the Dover Castle Dover street, St. George's Fields. We apprehended him, we began by informing him that he must go with us, he said, he wanted to see one man a bit by himself; and that he was taken on Simons's business. We told him that we took him for felony.</p>

            . I was with Bean at the apprehension of Smith. When I got to him, I told him he must go along with me; he said he wished to speak to a young man in the skettle ground, I told him I had no objection; he sent a person for him, when the young man came, he whispered something to him; the young man said what are you going for, the young man answered in Soley's business, meaning Simons, Simons goes by the name of Soley; I asked what he had said to the young man, he said d - m my eyes, I did not speak.</p>
               <p>Simon's Defence. I went into a house in Holywell-street; my prosecutor and that watchman came in together, I saw my prosecutor, and asked him to have a glass; I see them drink liquor, they both went out together; I drank my porter as to any thing further I do not know, except that I was taken to the watch-house by them.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. About half past eight o'clock, when I was at the King's Head the corner of Pickett street, I called for a pint of half and half; the patrole came in, I asked him to drink, whilst he was drinking Simons came in, I asked him also to drink, I bid Simons go off, and I went down Fleet-street. I am very innocent of the crime that is charged against me.</p>

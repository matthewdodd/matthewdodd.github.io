            . On Friday was sev'n-night, as I was coming cross Thames-street, I met the prisoner with a bag of Spanish wool under his arm, (I am a ticket porter, and work'd at <placeName id="t17570420-56-crimeloc301">Botolph Wharf</placeName>

I asked him where he had it, he said what was that to me. I secured it and him, it weigh'd eleven pounds and a half, bag and all. We carried him before my Lord-mayor the next day, when he said he found it coming up Fresh-wharf gate-way (produced in court ) I can't say this is the same that was taken out of that bag; he fain would have left it with me, if I would have let him go.</p>

               <p>Hickman Thornton. I am the chief person that works all that sort of goods at the key. I missed some Spanish wool out of bags when we returned from dinner that day. This wool I have look'd at, it is of divers sorts, and did not all come out of the bags where I missed some.</p>

               <p>John Clements. I am the person that collar'd the prisoner; he fain would have got away, and ran from me, but I would not let him.</p>

               <p>I was coming up Fresh-wharf gateway and found this bag standing against the wall, on the right hand side, so I took it under my arm.</p>

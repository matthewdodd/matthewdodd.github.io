               <p>When did you first miss them? - On Thursday in the Easter week, the 28th or 29th of March; it made my family very unhappy; we did not know who to suspect. I advertised the lace but did not hear any thing of it. On the Saturday following in the evening, the prisoner went away for a few days to make holiday; she came again five or six days after, and chared as before for two or three days. A lady who lodged at my house lost a pocket book after the prisoner came again. I apprehended the prisoner on suspicion. I took out a warrant at the office in Litchfield-street, and Grubb, an officer, came with me. I took the prisoner into the parlour and charged her with it; the officer advised my wife to go into another room and try to get her to confess, which she did, and then she confessed taking the lace.</p>
               <p>You did not hear that? - No; but I heard her acknowledge it afterwards; she was very much distressed, and owned she had stolen the lace and pawned it.</p>
               <p>Did you make her any promises to induce her to confess? - I promised her if I recovered my lace I would show her all the lenity the law would allow.</p>
               <p>Did your wife make her any promises? - I believe, she did; we found the lace in consequence of her confession. Grubb was present with my wife when she went into the other room.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the parlour with Mrs. Pohl and the prisoner? - I was in the parlour when she made the confession. Mrs. Pohl spoke to me about it, I advised her to take care what promise she made; and not to promise not to prosecute her, but only to show her all the lenity she could in the prosecution.</p>
               <p>What sort of lenity did she promise her? - She said, it was a capital offence, the lace was worth ten or twelve pounds; that she would show her all the lenity that lay in her power, for she would not lay it capitally.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. You said she acknowledged in your presence that she had taken the things and pawned them? - Yes. At Mr. Parker's and at Mr. Freares's; I went there and found the lace.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Freares; the prisoner brought two pieces of lace to our shop, one contained twelve the other seven yards; the twelve yards she brought the 31st of March, the seven yards on the 10th of April.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they were brought by the prisoner? - Yes; I had seen her before. I asked her whose property they were? She said, she brought them for a Mrs. Robinson who kept a house in Marshall-street, Carnaby Market.</p>
               <p>Did you know such a person? - No; she pawned them in the name of Robinson.</p>

               <p>What did she pawn them for? - The twelve yards two guineas, the other piece half a guinea.</p>
               <p>(The lace was produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This piece is very particular. I had but one piece of that sort; it was taken out of the lace box in the mahogany press.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner access to that drawer? - On the Thursday morning I found the press open, so that somebody must have been at it.</p>
               <p>Had it been locked? - I believe it had, but it was carelessly left unbolted. I missed this piece in particular that morning.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing so particular in this piece that you could have sworn to it if she had not confessed? - Yes; from the pattern, the breadth, and the quantity of yards; there was a private mark to the end of it, that is taken away.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the other piece of lace? - Yes. I missed a piece of the same quantity. I know this to be mine; there is a particular joining in it.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark upon it? - No; only the pattern; I cannot positively swear to it.</p>

            . I attend the rotation office at Shadwell. I took the prisoner at a house in Buckle-street, White-chapel. A woman of the town had picked him up, and seeing him pull it out thought he stole it. I asked him how he came by it; he said it was his wife's. I told him I thought he did not look like a person whose wife wore a watch. I took him to the Compter. The next morning he confessed he had robbed his master of four watches; he gave me a direction where to find his master. I went to his master. He said he had sold one at Inglestone, another at Eastham, and the other he had sold to a travelling Jew.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to this watch and the trinkets; they were stolen out of my shop.</p>
               <p>- Moody. I live at Inglestone; my husband keeps the Blue Anchor. On Saturday, I don't remember the day of the month, I bought this watch of the prisoner; I gave him 20 s. for it. I had it valued before I bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dress'd?</p>
               <p>Moody. Much as he is now.</p>

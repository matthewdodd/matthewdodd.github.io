            . I work at Mr. Aker's liverystable, Arlington-street, about a quarter of a mile from Claremont-square, on the 22nd of July. An alarm was given, and the prisoner came by me, as I was washing a chaise - he jumped over a cistern and over a wall into the back of No. 108, St. John's-street; I saw his countenance so as to know him again - I followed him down the garden - he ran through the house, and down the front area steps; he shut the area door - I went to the front kitchen window, and saw him pull the silver spoons out of his pocket, and put them under the mat at the door; I secured him in the area, and gave the spoons to the Policeman.</p>

            . I am a ward-beadle. On the 1st of June, 1812, I found the last witness with a cask of mustard under his arm, and a little boy, about eleven years old, in his custody, who was crying. Rowland said he had stolen the mustard; the child said he had not, and asked me to fetch his father, who was the prisoner, and that he lived in Still-alley. I went there, and found the prisoner standing by the fire. I asked him where his son was, he said he had just sent him out to Mr. Vincent's with a barrel of mustard. I told him the mustard had been stolen within the last half hour; he said that was a lie, for he had had it in his house ever since Monday. I said he must go with me. As we went along, he said he could not think why I had such a spite against him. I told him he knew why; he said,</p>
               <p>"don't you think I am a better judge than to send it out if it was not all right." I took him to my house, where the boy was. The prisoner asked leave to go into the yard; he passed through my back parlour, where the cask was, he took it up, and said if they will swear to this, they will swear to anything. The officer took him away; he afterwards absconded, and was never heard of. I have been looking for him several times, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has not the prisoner been about the town for the last three years - A. I believe he has; when I went to his house he did not appear ill. He had his shoes and hat on.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The charge is entirely false. Davis asked if my boy was at school, I said I hoped he was - I found he was in custody, and told them to let him go, and take me; he told me to attend before the magistrate. A Jew, who owes me a spite, told Davis to do his duty, and take me, as I was indicted; hearing this I surrendered.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Lincoln Terrace, Bow, and am a wine merchant—on Saturday evening, 9th December, I was at the bottom of the steps in New London Street and saw the prisoner and prosecutor straggling together—I said "What are you doing here?—the prosecutor said "This man has got my watch"—the prisoner said "Who has got your watch"—the prosecutor replied "You <hi rend="italic">had</hi>, but you have put it back again"—I fetched constable 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—when I came back the prosecutor was holding the prisoner and they were struggling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I should think I was gone about a minute and a half—I will swear it was not more—neither of you were in liquor—I did not see the watch till the prosecutor took it out of his pocket at the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). At 9 o'clock on the evening in question I was called to the steps in New London Street where I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner struggling—the prosecutor had his left arm round the pri<lb></lb>soner and his right hand had hold of his left wrist—the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge for robbing him of his watch—I heard him call" Police!" and he said "This man has stolen my watch"—the prisoner said that he had not—I said "Where is the watch?" and the prosecutor said "He gave it me back again when he found he could not get away, and I called out' Police!'"—the prosecutor gave me this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the watch in the prosecutor's hand—you said you had not stolen it and "If I had known you meant this I should have been off." (<hi rend="italic">The depositions, being referred to, did not contain this statement.</hi>) You told me you had sent some articles on Thursday, 7th, to the shipping office, and you referred me there for your name, address, and occupation, which, on going there, I found to be correct—this is your certificate of discharge two years since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate.</hi> I had been drinking with the prosecutor, and we left the public-house together. I tumbled down the steps against the prosecutor and he laid hold of me round the body. If I had wanted to go away I could have gone. I am a hard working man and have got testimonials to prove it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> You can see plainly that if I wished to get away or rob the man I could have got away, but I never attempted to rob him. I was drinking for nearly an hour in his company. He asked me if I was a seaman, (having the appearance of a seaman) and I told him I was I told him I had been to America, and he asked me if I had been to the Western Coast of Africa, and I told him I had been to Calabar and other parts of the coast. He asked me how many times I had been to America, and I said "About twenty times, in the mail boats." We had plenty of drink together. I came out to go home, down near the side of these steps, and I tumbled down, having had a little too much to drink, and hurt my shoulder, very near put it out. I tried to steady myself on the next flight but tumbled down that, and <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> hold of the prosecutor to save myself. He turned round and <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> me round the body and called "Police!" He says "You have stolen my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080032"></xptr>
               <p>watch, and I will lock you up." I said "What for?" He said "You are robbing me." I said "If you think I am robbing you I will stand here till the police come." The witness passed by and went for the police. He then says "You stole my watch." I said "It's a lie, I never stole anything in my life." He said "I don't care a d——n, I will lock you up."</p>

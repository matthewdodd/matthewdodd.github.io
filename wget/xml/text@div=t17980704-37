The coffee-pot was brought to Mr. Marchant's house by a gentleman that had hold of Bamber at the same time that I had.</p>

             sworn. - I was at dinner at my master's, in Dean-street, on the 13th of June; I heard a cry of stop thief, I saw the tallest prisoner running, and I ran after him; I saw the other prisoner run down Eagle-street, but I had not a proper fight of him; I pursued him down King's-gate-street across Holborn, towards Queen-street, then he went a little way down Queen-street, I lost sight of him then, but in about a minute or two, he came back into Holborn again, and went up towards St. Giles's; and then I called stop thief again, and ran after him; he was rather winded, and then he was taken.</p>
               <p>RICE EVANS sworn. - I am a patrol of St. James's; I saw the prisoner, Singures, cross the way as fast as he could run, he was quite wearied out with running; he took out this milk-pail and spoon from his coat, and threw it into a baker's shop, three doors from Queen-street; I went into the baker's shop, and picked it up just by the parlour door, and I gave it to the mistress of the baker's shop.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Marchant). How did you get possession of that milk-pail again? - A. A Mr. Hewlett, an opposite neighbour, fetched them from the baker's.</p>
               <p>Evans. I went with Mr. Hewlett to shew him the house; I saw him come out with it in his hand, but there was such a mob round the door, I could hardly get near it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say positively that that is the milk-pail that the prisoner threw into the baker's shop? - A. Yes, I am certain sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Marchant.) What is the value of that coffee-pot, as silver? - A. Above six pounds; the milk pail is worth fourteen shillings, and the spoon is worth one shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lowe). You saw two persons running up Dean-street, are you certain they were the two prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Singures's defence. Going up Holborn, I heard a cry of stop thief, I saw a mob, I turned my head, and this man laid hold of me immediately, and took me back to Mr. Marchant's.</p>
               <p>Bamber's defence. I heard a cry of stop thief, I ran, and they laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Marchant). Is this shop part of your dwelling-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Bamber, called two witnesses, who deposed that he always paid them very honestly.</p>

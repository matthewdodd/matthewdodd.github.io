                  </hi>. I am a French-polisher, of 4, Essex-street, Hoxton—the prisoner is my wife—we have been living separate for some time—on the evening of 24th November she came to the door and knocked—I was called down stairs and as I came down and looked at the door she threw something out of a basin into my face, and I was burnt—I was taken to a doctor's at the top of the street, and from there to the hospital—we had been living apart about two or three months—I had been allowing her weekly money to live upon—I always allowed her a little, sometimes 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, sometimes more, till about a fortnight before this happened, then I lost the business I was at, and was obliged to go journey-work, and I allowed her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—she was not satisfied, and went to the work-house, and I had a maintenance put upon her there of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> All he states is false; he saw me that morning, I went to his shop where he was at work, and he would not allow me one penny—he said if I came to his place again he would blind me—he has been twelve months living with a common prostitute at a brothel in Holywell-lane—he spent his money in nothing but gambling and keeping prostitutes—it was him that threw the vitriol over me, and I dashed it at him to save myself I have been three weeks in the hospital.</p>

               <p>and am a member of the College of Surgeons—on 24th November, the prosecutor came to me—I examined his face—it was very severely burnt all over the left side, and he bad some burns on the left hand—he was in the hospital for a month—he is not under treatment at present, but he will have to be under treatment again—the injury was inflicted by some strong acid; I could not say what.</p>

He is living with a common prostitute now, that is the third woman he has lived with in the last twelve months—he never took out a summons till I went to the workhouse, and said he should keep me if be could keep another woman; when I have asked him for anything he bus kicked me double. Five nights out of seven he is at a house which nobody uses but thieves and gamblers.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYIAND. Q. You yourself know nothing of the removal of the goods on Saturday night? A. I do not; I can swear to all the ribbons - they were all the same pattern as I had lost - three or four patterns of ribbon, and three or four of lace; I swear positively to the eight patterns - the manufacturer supplies other persons; the patterns may be found in many other shops - I did not say at the office I could speak to but one piece, and that by its length: I said I knew all by the patterns - the Magistrate asked how much there might he in one piece; I said two or three yards - I never said I knew it by the length; I never saw it measured - it was held up in the hand, and turned out to be from two to three yards.</p>

Great Castle-street, between nine and ten o'clock; I left them in the passage at the bottom of the stairs - I pulled the door after me. and am certain it shut; I returned in ten minutes, and found the door still shut and latched, as I had left it, but the three boxes were gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you packed the boxes yourself? A. No; I saw the lids put on, and saw the contents - I had seen them put in from the window; I went alone from the shop to the house - the servant let me in; she is not here - the door opens with a latch-key from the outside; I pulled it hard after me - I did not try it, but am sure it fastened; when I returned, I did not miss the goods, as the servant had been in the habit of taking them up stairs - she let me in the second time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Captain Pilkington (retired 85th), of 2, Upper Woburn Street, Euston Square—on Tuesday, 21st May, about 10.45 P.m., I was in the Euston Road with my husband, brother, and his wife, and my little child—while I was saying "Good night" to my brother's wife my husband was crossing the Euston Road, and I heard him cry out "Maggie, I am murdered"—I left my baby and rushed across the road to my husband and saw him on one knee, and Cheesewright had his hand in my husband's breast pocket, pulling out his handkerchief—Wise was standing by—I put my hand down to take Cheesewright's hand from my husband's pocket, and Wise took my thumb and finger, and bit them—Cheesewright took up my husband's hat and ran away—I did not see Burns do anything—Wise ran away as the police were coming across the road, and I missed my cloak and my pocket-handkerchief, in which was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I remained with my hus<lb></lb>band, and Cheesewright was brought back by a policeman about 1 1/2 minutes afterwards—we then went to the station, and shortly after Wise was brought in by a policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I am the wife of Captain Pilkington, and have been married to him about nine years—I can write—I made my mark at the police-court—my finger was stiff—I was excited and didn't want my husband to prosecute—I am sure it was 10.45 when I left my brother's house—I heard Police-constable Taylor give evidence at the police-court—I heard him say it was 12.30, instead of 10.45—I would say he was right—I had a little baby one year and seven months old, and my hus<lb></lb>band was blind, and we passed the time over—I saw Wise for a minute while my finger was in his mouth, and he was biting it—my hand was on my husband's shoulder—I was not so excited that I did not know him. I didn't want to prosecute, because our business was important, and it was the cause of a great loss of money to us to stop in London—I don't re<lb></lb>member saying "The prisoner Wise, who was by, rushed at me and bit the thumb and forefinger of my right hand"—Wise was brought in between two policeman, and I said "Here is the boy who bit my finger"</p>

While Wise was biting my finger I had full opportunity of observing his face, and I am certain he is the boy—there was a gas<lb></lb>lamp near—he nearly broke my finger in two—I have not got the use of it—I have not recovered my cloak, money, or handkerchief.</p>

At 12.30 A.m. on the 22nd May I was on duty in the Euston Road, and saw Captain Pilkington kneeling in the centre of the road, about 30 yards from me, surrounded by the prisoners and about seven others—the captain was in the act of getting up from the ground, and I saw Cheesewright snatch his hat from his head and run—I ran after him for about fifty yards, and I caught him with the hat in his hand—I never lost sight of him—Wise and Burns ran down Duke Street, and I directed a constable to follow them—Burns had been pushing between Captain and Mrs. Pilkington, trying to separate them—I took Cheesewright to the station—on the way he said Mrs. pilkington had knocked her husband's hat off and he picked it up and intended to give it to the captain, but I distinctly saw him take the hat off—we all went to the station together, which is about 10 minutes' walk from the spot where this occurred—in about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes Wise was brought in and identitied by Mrs. Pilkington.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He was in the custody of two constables—it was not necessary in this case to place him amongst others to be picked out—Mrs. Pilkington was greatly excited at the police-station.</p>

                  </hi>. I sell flowers in the streets—I live at 8, Draper's Place—I saw a boy run down the court at about 12.15, and Wise went in the passage opposite for a light and the boy ran in and shut the door and blew the match out of Wise's hand, who was waiting to go up to his brother's room—I don't know anything of the boys—I heard the boy who blew out the light run down a pair of stairs as if he was going to run into the kitchen—I heard him say "The police are after us, "and Wise said, "Police after who?"—he didn't reply, but went down the stairs, and the police went down after him—I had Wise under my notice for a quarter of an hour that evening—he walked up the court with a young girl—he didn't appear to have been running—he said his mother had been "shooting the moon, "and he had been helping her, and he was not going to do any more that night, but was going to his brother's to sleep—I had not known anything of the Wises before—I am a perfect stranger to everybody in Court—I spoke to the night-policeman last night who calls my husband, and he said "If I were you and you know anything of it, I should certainly go down and speak the truth"—I have not been paid for coming here, and I have no desire but to speak the truth.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I saw three constables in the court on the night in question—I don't know their names—Blake is the constable who took Wise—there were two others with him.</p>

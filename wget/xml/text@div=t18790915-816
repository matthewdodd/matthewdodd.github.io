                  </hi>. I am manager to William Chadwick and Sow, Upper Thomas Street, paper makers—on Thursday, 14th August, Jacobs, whom I had known as being with Mr. Eagles, came to our warehouse tod stated that he had bought some paper elsewhere, and wanted some more to make up an order, and he selected some—he said he was a grandson of Mr. Moses, of Moses, Son, and Davis, Cannon Street, and that his grand-father had just died, and some of the money was coming to him and he should have some money on Saturday and would then pay for them—I knew there was such a firm, and I let him have 14 reams of double crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 5 reams double demy at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., value altogether about five guineas—I subsequently received certain information and gave him in custody—he wrote me a letter the day after, stating he was very sorry the property had not been sold, but that he should receive the money; on Tuesday—he did not come on Saturday to pay for the goods—I let him have the paper on the representation that he was the grandson of Mr. Moses—he gave his address 53, Crawford Street, Edgware Road, and I wrote to that address twice and the letters came back through the Dead Letter Office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I should not have let you have the goods but for your representation that you were the grandson of Mr. Mow, and that you had come into property and had houses at Tottenham and the Isle of Wight, and were going to Cheltenham on Monday.</p>

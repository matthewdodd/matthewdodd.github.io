Goodman's, in the Edgeware-road—she said she knew nothing at all about it—I asked her if she had been disposing of any silks, or had any in the house, or if she had any pawn tickets relating to silks—she said that she had none—I told her I should take her to the station—I searched the house, but found nothing—I afterwards fetched Willet, Mr. Barnett's, the pawnbroker's, assistant, to the station, and asked him if he knew either of these females—the other prisoner had been taken by Potter in the same house in my presence, and brought to the station—they were together, and Willet said, "These are the two females that pledged some silk at our place"—they heard that, but made no answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Chatfield, of 9, Newman-street, Portman-market—I did keep a coffee-stall up against Messrs. Goodman's shop, but I have been ill—on the morning of 11th February I was at that stall from 5 o'clock till half-past 8—I saw nobody come out of Messrs. Goodman's private door, till the alarm was sent out of the robbery—if they had, I must have seen them.</p>

I am unmarried, and in the employ of Moss and Goodman—on the morning of 11th February, I was very ill—I was walking about the room early and bad been most of the night—I looked at my watch, and it wanted five minutes to 5—I had my hand on the bedroom door to come down for some hot water, but heard a great rattling of boards as if a board was being broken, and went to bed again—I went down in the morning at a quarter to 7, and found the shop open, the skylight open and the till; and a cheque book lying on the table—the wainscoting was broken away—I told Mr. Goodman.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner was a servant in my employment, and was so on the 1st and 7th of Nov.—it was his duty to collect whatever sums were due on the sale of goods, and to pay it over to me the same evening or the following day, not later—no permission was ever given him to retain any sums of money—I paid him by a commission—I had advanced him money on account, from 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and often more—if he re<lb></lb>ceived from Mr. Bradfield 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 1st of Nov., he did not account to me for it, nor for 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Crouch—on the 8th of Nov. he paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., discount, making 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as received the day before from Mr. Crouch—he did not tell me he had received 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. instead of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have never received the remaining 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he has never disclosed to me the fact of his receiving more than the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I afterwards discovered some defi<lb></lb>ciency in my accounts, and spoke to the prisoner about it—he mentioned the name of another person who had been connected with him, and I had that other person taken into custody—after that person was taken, I made inquiry as to who bad received these particular sums of money, and I then, for the first time, ascertained that the prisoner had received them himself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had he any money allowed him for expenses, or was he to pay his own expenses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was allowed money for expenses, tra<lb></lb>velling money—he was tried on the 13th of Dec., twice for embezzlement, and acquitted, and then for a misdemeanor, and acquitted on that—I had an<lb></lb>other man tried, and the prisoner was examined as a witness for him—I did not call him for me—he was in my employ since May—I had a partner part of the time, named Saunders—the partnership ceased on the 26th of July—I told the prisoner on the 16th of Nov., that he was not to consider himself my agent any longer—I charged him with a misdemeanor for receiving money after that—he has sold to the amount of 546<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in starch—the commission due to him at the present time, is 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as only a portion of the accounts have been paid—if the whole commission was paid without any bad debts, it would amount to 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he has received in cash, 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he would be entitled to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more if all the accounts were received—at the time I told him not to consider himself my servant any longer, a number of the accounts were un<lb></lb>settled—I have advanced him 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

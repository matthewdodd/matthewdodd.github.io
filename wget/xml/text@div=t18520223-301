On 11th Feb. the prisoner came to the house—she asked for a glass of gin, and paid me with a bad shilling—I found it was bad directly she put it down—I asked her whether she had got any more—shesaid, "No"—I said, "Have you got any money to pay for the gin?"—she said, no, it was all the money she had got—she had drunk part of the gin, and while we were talking she put down the rest of it—I asked her where she lived—she said that was her own business—I said I thought that was the third visit she bad paid me, and unless she could pay for the gin I should give her into custody—she was taken, but nothing more was found on her, and she was discharged—they told me to mark the shilling, which I did, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

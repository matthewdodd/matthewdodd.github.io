                  </hi> I am a linendraper, and live in Seymour-place, Camden-town. The prisoner was my apprentice—I received 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with him—he came to me about four months ago—in consequence of something, I sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody—his box was produced an opened—two pairs of silk gloves, two handkerchiefs, and a brooch were found in it; which were my property—he had not the least right to take them—he took hold of my arm, and said, "Forgive me for this offence; it has been the first time, my father will pay for all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> His box was unlocked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and was in a place where there were other boxes; a place that every-body in my employ went to—it was no room; it was a lobby—the policeman asked the prisoner if he had any objection to have his box searched—he made no reply then; he afterward said, "No"—he fetched it after the policeman had asked him two or three times for it—I have three persons in my employ—one has served me as an apprentice, and is with me for another three years—I have three beside the prisoner—I advertised for an apprentice, and his father applied to me in consequence—I have had the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his father made a remark about paying half of it—I wished to have it all, and got it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time the father called on you, had you any reason to suspect the boy's honesty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I had no desire to get rid of him, and found no fault—what gave me a suspicion was his taking glove-boxes out of my shop.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman S</hi> 76.) I was called in, and the prisoner was given into my custody—he brought in his box himself, from a place adjoining the room where we were standing—these are the articles that were found, two pairs of gloves, two handkerchiefs, and a brooch—and a paper of pins was found on his person at the station—when he came to the gloves, Mr. Gear said, "Where did you get these?"—he said he got these on Mon<lb></lb>day last, and this other pair he said his mother gave him—Mr. Gear found his own mark on them—when he came to the brooch, he said it was his master's property—as he was going out of the room to put his hat on, he took hold of his master's arm, and said, "Forgive me, my father will pay for all."</p>

               <p>had no objection, and he brought the box in his own hands to his master? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly so—he opened it, it appeared to be unlocked—he said he got these gloves on the Monday—I do not recollect saying that before—I will not swear whether I said before that he said the other pair was given him by his mother, or he said the brooch was his master's or that he said, "For<lb></lb>give me, my father will pay for all."</p>

On the 6th of April I was at Wandsworth, and in consequence of some charge by a tradesman I went to the house of Mr. Shiell, in Putney, Park-lane, inquired for some<lb></lb>body, and was directed to the stable in consequence of my inquiry—the stable is about 200 yards or more from the dwelling-house—when I came there I saw the prisoner—he answered the ring—I was accompanied by two lads, Speed and Dagnal—on his answering the bell one of them asked him if the coachman was come home—he said, "I am the coach<lb></lb>man"—(he is the coachman of that family I now know)—I was standing a little on one side—I then stepped up to him, and told him I had come to take him into custody on a charge of stealing a pair of black trowsers from Mr. Collingbourn—he said, "Yes, I bought a pair of breeches of Mr. Collingbourn, and I did not pay him for them;" and pulling out his purse, he said, "You can take the money to him"—I said, "No, that has nothing to do with the charge I have come upon"—he said, "Very well, then I will go with you to Wandsworth, and settle with Mr. Collingbourn"—I asked</p>

               <p>him if he would allow me to examine the chaise and the stable, previous to going to Wandsworth, to search for the trowsers—it was a four-wheeled chaise—he said, "Yes"—I and the two lads then walked into the stable-yard—I saw a little boy about ten years old running about, who I have since ascertained is the prisoner's child, called Daniel Good—I desired the elder lad Speed to stay by the prisoner while I examined the chaise and stable—we were then in the stable-yard—I proceeded to search the har<lb></lb>ness-room and the stable—while searching the harness-room the prisoner walked over towards the chaise—he said, "We will go to Wandsworth now and settle it"—at that moment a man, who I have since ascertained is Houghton, the gardener, living on the premises, came into the yard, and asked what was the matter—I told him I had come to take the prisoner, and was searching for the trowsers—he seemed much surprised—I told the prisoner I would not go till I had searched this stable—he was standing at the stable-door with the door just open, ajar—he then allowed me to go into the stable—he had not prevented me, but stood at the door as if he wished me not to go in—I went in with the two lads, Houghton, the prisoner, and his child—when I got in I desired Speed again to stand by the prisoner—I commenced, and searched the first and second stalls of the stable, found nothing, crossed over to search the corn-bin, and while search<lb></lb>ing the bin the prisoner said, "Let us go to Wandsworth, and have it settled"—I said, "No, I will not go till I have made a more diligent search"—the prisoner then walked down to the fourth stall himself—there are four stalls all in a row—I saw him move a truss of hay from one side of the stall to the other—I followed him down—there was nobody in that stall—I went to it, and desired him to go and stand by Speed, saying I did not require any of his assistance—I then moved the hay from where he had put it—it was in the direction he had moved it to, but there were several trusses there—I cannot swear it was the same truss—I moved two trusses and some loose hay which was underneath, and discovered something laying, which appeared to me to be a goose—it was a piece of flesh—I said, "What is this? this is a goose" loud enough for every body in the stable to hear—at that moment I heard the stable-door shut, looked round, and the prisoner was gone—I ran to the door, tried to open it, and found it was fastened outside—Speed found a two-pronged hay-fork in the stable, and commenced prizing the door—I assisted him, but could not open it—I went back to be positive as to what I had seen in the stall—the two lads and Houghton followed me—I moved the remainder of the hay off, and thought it was a pig—I found it was the trunk of a female, the body—it was laying on its abdomen with the back uppermost—Speed turned it over—I had no difficulty then in discerning that it was a woman—the arms were cut off at the shoulders, and the legs cut off at the upper part of the thigh; the head severed from the body at the lower part of the neck, and the thigh-bone was taken off right at the hip—it was quite gone—the belly was cut open, and the bowels taken out—I then went to the door, and succeeded in breaking out—the head and all the four limbs were gone—I made a further search an hour and a half after—(I had not left the stable)—I searched in a third stall with another constable, removed several trusses of straw, and under it found a mattress rolled up, and two blankets rolled up in it—I unfolded the mattress, and discovered a large stain on it, apparently of urine—it was not wet—I saw some blood close to where</p>

                  </hi>. I am eighteen years old, and live at Wands<lb></lb>worth. On Wednesday, the 6th of April, I went with Gardiner to Mr. Shiell's, at Roehampton-lane—we went to the house first, and afterwards to the stable, to a small private gate—I rang the bell—the prisoner answered it, and the young woman, the daughter of the gar<lb></lb>dener—they came to the gate—when we were at the gate, Gardiner told the prisoner he had come for a pair of trowsers he had stolen from Mr. Collingbourn—he said he had no black trowsers—when we got inside the premises Gardiner told me to take care of the prisoner—we were then in<lb></lb>side the premises, not far from the stable—we afterwards went into the stable—the prisoner went first—I saw him open the stable-door with a key—I saw him turn the key which he produced from his pocket before he got to the door—I saw him turn the key—we all went in, and I kept near him—Gardiner commenced searching, and after searching some time the prisoner went into the place where the body was found—Gardiner told him to stand back—before that, I saw the prisoner begin taking the hay from one side of the stall, and putting it over where the body lay—it was on that Gardiner told him to stand back, he must make a more diligent search—he stood back nearer to me—we were about two yards from the stall Gardiner was searching—while Gardener was searching he said, "What is this?" loud enough for the prisoner to hear—I stepped forward to see what it was, and the prisoner rushed back towards the stable-door to escape—I saw him as he had the door in his hand going out, and imme<lb></lb>diately heard the door locked—I heard the sound of the key turning—I afterwards saw the body.</p>

               <p>Shiell, at Putney—I went into the stable-yard that evening, and found the prisoner and policeman there—we afterwards went into the stable—I did not hear the policeman make an exclamation—the prisoner made his escape, I believe, without any one seeing him—I afterwards went into the harness-room, which was in the prisoner's care—no one else had access to it—I cannot tell how it was entered that night, as the policeman had ex<lb></lb>amined it before I came—the prisoner kept the key of it, and lighted the fire in it—about six o'clock on the Tuesday morning, the day before the policeman came, I observed a smoke coming from the harness-room—it was common to have a fire as early as that, and earlier in the winter—I had not seen a fire there for perhaps more than a fortnight, I think.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what state was the stove in the harness-room on the Wednesday evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was an immense preparation of wood and coals with straw underneath ready to light—it was very considerably more than there would usually be for a fire—I should consider there were three times as much as would answer for a common fire.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How does your son go to bed over the stable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a door opens close by the harness-room which leads up stairs, to what we call the outer door—it turns to the left when you get to the top of the stairs, and this door faces him—there are two rooms beyond where he sleeps, and one on the right of him, where the stableman used to sleep—my son's room is part over the back harness-room, where the dirty harness is kept—his window looks into the garden—he would come along the garden into the stable-yard to go to bed, and by the harness-room—it is an open stair<lb></lb>case—I have two men and a boy besides my son—they do not sleep on the premises—a fire is necessary in the harness-room in wet weather, to dry the harness.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could any body in the stable-yard see any thing which is going on in the colonnade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They can, if they were to look into the harness<lb></lb>room itself, through the large window, any body who was in the stable-yard could—there is no curtain to the window that I know of, to either of the windows which face the garden—the glass is frosted, that people should not look in out of the garden—no body in the garden can see through, unless they get steps or something, and look through the upper panes, which are not frosted—they are rather higher than a man's head—any body can see into the harness-room from the stable-yard.</p>

On Wednesday night, the 6th of April, I was on duty at Wandsworth, I went to Mr. Shiell's stables, and saw the body of a woman found—I found Gardiner there—on going into the harness-room I noticed a very bad, fulsome, sickly smell—I never smelt such before, but it appeared to me like rind of bacon—after stop<lb></lb>ping some time it was so bad I went out to the sergeant, and said, "Here is a very bad smell here, something must be wrong"—I searched the fire-place, and found two pieces of bone in the cinders among the coals in the furnace of the fire-place—I afterwards took them to the sur<lb></lb>geon—on the 12th of April, the Tuesday following, I went there again, and searched the coach-house—I went to the four-wheeled chaise, and opened the gig-box lid, I saw nothing in the box, but smelt a very bad smell, like the smell in the room—after taking off the cushions, and taking the box out of the chaise, I found a small piece of flesh on the outside—it was so very small I could not keep it—I found it here—(<hi rend="italic">pointing to the box</hi>)—I found another set of bones in the left-hand side of the furnace where the fire burns—I found them all at the same time, and in the fur<lb></lb>nace.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the V division of police. I went to Mr. Shiell's stable on the night of the 6th of April—I arrived about a quarter past eleven o'clock—I went into the stable, and saw the trunk on a female, and proceeded to search the harness-room, the door of which was locked—I got the key from the elder Houghton—I unlocked the door—I beg to correct myself, I was called by the superintendent to go into the harness-room, which was then open—it was at a subsequent search I got the key—the superintendent ordered me to break open a flat wooden box, which was there, locked—I found in that a quantity of clean linen belonging to a male, and some books—I searched the drawer of a table there which was shot, but there was no lock on it—I found in it this knife closed as it is now—I examined it, and observed what appeared to me to be stains of blood—I found it had been newly sharpened, and on this part of the handle was what appeared to be a stain of blood, and the knife appeared to be rusty after it had been sharpened—the stain of blood was partly on the handle, and partly on the blade—I showed the knife to Dr. Ridge the next day—I found some keys in the drawer, which sergeant Palmer has possession of—I laid them on the table—on the right-hand side of the fire-place, in a corner, standing by the chimney, I found this axe—I did not examine it that night—I kept possession of the key of the harness-room myself—I looked at it, and could not distinguish whether there were stains on it that night—I locked the room when f left, and took the key with me—I observed next morning what appeared to be stains of blood, one mark on the pole of the axe, and one on each side the edge along here—I do not think they were more visible than they are now, because I have kept it so carefully—there were lines across the room to hang clothes on, and on a line next the fire-place, I found this piece of silk handkerchief, which appears to be marked with blood in several places—I found divers clothes, but not on the line—the articles of female wearing apparel I found in a saddle-rest in the harness-room—here is what appears to me to be part of a flannel petticoat, forcibly torn in two, and one part cut in the seam—these two pieces were together as they are now, and correspond exactly where it appears cut at the seam—they also correspond in quality; they were both together, thrown over the saddle-rest—I found what appears to be part of a calico petticoat, close to the saddle-rest, underneath a box-coat, which was thrown over the chair, and one of these was knotted as if tied together, but it became untied after<lb></lb>wards—both are marked with blood, and on one of these there are marks of blood close to where there have been pieces cut out—they are not drops but splashes of blood—not as if dropping from a person's nose—I found also a pint bottle, under the window; there were a few drops of liquid in it—I poured it into the palm of my hand, tasted it, and believe it to be milk—I found the bottle on the 8th, but I had always kept the harness-room locked up, and had the key—on the night of the 6th I assisted in searching the fire-place, and found a quantity of calcined bones in the ashes—the fire was laid with straw, wood, and coal—I removed them, and searched underneath—there was a pair of brand-irons at the fire-place, so as to bring the fire out further from the chimney—I believe it was a Cob<lb></lb>bett's register-stove—I found the bones under the fuel, among the cinders and ashes underneath—I showed them to Mr. Allen the same night—</p>

               <p>they are now in the same state, except one piece of a very claimed bone fell asunder—I put a string round it to keep it together—I found about an ounce of tea in a <hi rend="italic">box,</hi> which was not locked—on the 8th, the day of the inquest, in sifting the cinders through two sieves, assisted by Dr. Ridge, among these at the bottom of the stove I found more bones—I examined the body that day after it was washed, having a very clear and good light, and on the neck, about half an inch below where the head had been taken off, I found a small mole, a very dark colour, on the right side—to make sure that it was a mole, I wetted my thumb, and rubbed it two or three times—I was quite convinced it was a mole—in the harness-room I found the two umbrellas, one hanging on a nail over the chimney-piece, the other standing in a corner, not far from the axe—I found this rent-book in searching No. 18, South-street, Manchester-square, and the landlord gave me this sign-board.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Mr. Shiell's gardener, and was in his service the beginning of April. I slept in the room over between the stable and harness-room—part of the room is over each—I get to it by the stair-case outside—I do not pass through the stable—the prisoner kept the key of the stable—it was always kept locked—I got up on Tuesday, the 5th of April, at half-past six o'clock, 0. and saw the prisoner when I came down—I smelt a very unpleasant smell, and asked him if he had been singeing—it smelt like the singeing of horses—he said he had been in liquor overnight, and had been toasting some cheese for refreshment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Shillito, a surgeon. I was called on Wednesday night, the 6th of April, to the stable of Mr. Shiell—the trunk of a woman was shown to me—Superintendent Bicknell, and several officers were there—I examined it—the head bad been severed from the body by a very clean cut through the integuments, and through the second and third vertebrae—I imagine that to hare been done all by one cut—both arms had been taken off above the shoulder joints by a clean cut through the flesh and muscles, and the bones were rather hacked as if with a knife or chopping.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the appearances present such as would be produced by an axe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not so much as the thigh bones did—they appeared more like hacking—the legs and thighs bad a clean cut through the integument, and the bones divided just below the great <hi rend="italic">trochanthus</hi>—the flesh was cut, but I think the bones were chopped—this axe was the most likely instru<lb></lb>ment to produce the appearances—the bowels were all gone, the abdominal and pelvid viscera—there was a clean cut from the sternum to the pubes, and all the way round to the vertebrae.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to form any judgment whether the incision had been made before or after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After death, I should say decdodly—we have the means of forming a judgment on that subject—the body was in a most healthy state—there was not the least appearance of disease whatever that I could observe in any part—I did not see the heart or lungs—Dr. Ridge had an order next day to make a post mortem examination, and I was not there—my examination terminated on the Wed<lb></lb>nesday—I saw the body again, but did not examine it—from the appear<lb></lb>ance of the blood vessels as the body lay, they appeared perfectly empty, both the blood vessels and arteries—the body appeared perfectly empty—from the general appearance of it she was not at all likely to have died of apoplexy or any sudden disease—I should say she could not have been dead longer than three or four days, or I would say five day at far<lb></lb>thest—there was not any appearance of decay—decomposition had not taken place at all—there was a very slight smell—I saw the axe that even<lb></lb>ing, but did not examine it till before the Coroner's inquest—I certainly think the marks on it are stains of blood—they have more the appearance of blood than anything else—I saw some of the bones on Wednesday, and also afterwards at the inquest—the large bone has the appearance of part of a thigh bone, and here are portions of the skull, and a portion of the knee joint—merely the top of one of the lower bones—these two pieces roost decidedly are portions of a human skull—the serrated edges of the sutures are quite visible—I am rather inclined to say the female was pregnant, but there was not sufficient to decide that—I merely come to the conclusion from a slight appearance on the nipple, and would not speak de<lb></lb>cidedly—I should be very sorry to say this is the thigh bone of a human being, in the highly calcined state of it—I did not examine the body in conjunction with Dr. Ridge—there must decidedly have been a most in<lb></lb>tense heat to make the bones so highly calcined—I merely looked at the</p>

               <p>knife that night—I saw very little appearance of blood on it—I did not observe any thing inside it myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you speak with any degree of positiveness as to the appearance on the axe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it is decidedly blood, from the appearance it had then—it is not so bright now—it was much more plain—the appearance of blood on the knife was very slight—I should be sorry to swear it was blood—I saw the axe standing in the corner that night, but did not examine it—the inspector said he would put it on one side till daylight—I saw it at the inquest on Friday—it was then in the inspector's possession—I think he showed it to me before the Coroner—the marks are decidedly not so plain now as then—they have been rub<lb></lb>bed off, or gone off by carriage, or something, from both sides—it is cer<lb></lb>tainly not so bright as it was—the blood was redder, more distinct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what you saw of it at the inquest do you think the appear<lb></lb>ances might be very visible on Wednesday by the aid of the policeman's lamp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They would have been visible, but not so visible as by day<lb></lb>light—there was sufficient to enable a person to see the appearances on Wednesday, I think—this axe is a very likely instrument to have separated the thigh bones—there was a clean cut all the way round the neck—it has the appearance of having been done by one stroke—I think it is be<lb></lb>tween the second and third vertebrae, but without dissecting, I cannot be certain—the blood vessels were very empty—there must have been a very large quantity of blood effused—it was the trunk of a full grown female.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you form an opinion of her age? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say she was upwards of thirty—there was very little to judge by—the skin had a very fair appearance—that might have been from the draining of blood—I should think she had been dead four or five days—the body was plump—I should think she was about a middle size, and rather a fine made woman—the bosom was rather plump and full—I should think she had not borne a child, from the appearance of the breast—I should think her rather of a medium complexion—the skin appeared fail by that light, and very clear—I think that she had been dead four days, from the general appearance of the remains—the rigidity of the skin was over, and its flexibility come back—I judge the incisions were made after death, from their clean ap<lb></lb>pearance—if made on a living person the skin retracts—I judge it had lost its elasticity at the time the cut was given.</p>

               <p>of the cavities of the heart—there was a small portion of blood in the large blood-vessel from the heart, the ascending aorta (but none in the descending aorta)—there was a small quantity of blood, which would fill perhaps a very small teaspoon, but not more—the lungs were very collapsed; indeed, at the first view, I thought there were no lungs at all—there was neither blood nor air in the lungs, they were per<lb></lb>fectly empty—the person had certainly not died of apoplexy, or I think we should have found blood in the heart—I am sure we should—the appearance of the body was not consistent with death from any mode of disease I am familiar with—the lungs and heart were perfectly healthy—should be inclined to say the person had died from violence, from the sud<lb></lb>den joss, while in health, and the muscular powers going on, that the Wood had emptied itself completely out of the body by the incision of some large.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after death does the blood cease to flow in the way it usually does in life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very soon indeed—the fluids soon separate—a person was knocked down, and life was extinct for about ten minutes, if you opened a vein, or cut an artery, you would not find blood-coagulation takes place immediately the vitality ceases—the bones produced are most decidedly those of a human body—I have not a doubt of it—here—is the lower portion of the joint of one of the thigh-bones, where it articulates with the knee-joint—here are portions of a human skull. I have no doubt whatever—they have got into the state they are now in by being burnt in a very strong fire—I saw the grate—there was a considerable quantity of fuel in it—I saw it before it was removed—I dare say there was a full bushel of fuel altogether—the stove was quite capable of producing heat to reduce the bones to the state they were found—it had a very great draught—it is my opinion the woman was pregnant—there was nothing to judge by but the breast—there was an indication there which made me form a notion of it—from the appearance of the breast I thought she might have been pregnant between four and five months—I saw the knife on the Friday, and examined the inside of it—I was attracted by the powerful smell of that part of the knife—a strong animal smell, very much like our dissecting knives—I put a small instrument into the handle, and found a very small piece of flannel at the bottom, and that had evidently been saturated with blood—it is here now, but the smell has gone off—it was saturated—it was moist that morning, and in my opinion it was human blood.</p>

               <p>opinion whether the person had died from disease or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think it was quite clear—no disease empties the body of blood—it is not consistent with death from disease of the heart, apoplexy, or any com<lb></lb>plaint I am aware of—nor strangulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you find, after death, the body entirely deprived of blood, can you form an opinion whether a large quantity of blood must have flown before life was extinct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think it very probable and possible, but can scarcely say for certain—the time which blood begins to stagnate after death, varies much, but in a very few minutes—in half-an-hour or an hour after death the body could not be emptied of blood, but in some rare cases the blood does not coagulate—in death from apoplexy, disease of the heart, nor any thing else, should we find the body so empty of blood.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You concur with the medical gentlemen, that the draining of blood was caused by an incision of some large vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there is sometimes a considerable flow of blood from the external bursting of a vessel—my attention has not been called to a case within a few days of a lady dying from bursting a blood-vessel in the leg—I have met with cases of hemorrhage from the sudden bursting of a vessel, and death ensuing.</p>

ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could that occur without previous dis<lb></lb>ease in the leg or arm? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I should say certainly there must be some previous disease—I should not expect that a person in ordinary health bursting a blood-vessel would deprive the body of blood.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that complaint attended with considerable pain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yet, very great pain—though they go about their work, they would complain to people about them—it is in a very advanced state of disease that it bursts out through the wound, and after some violent effort—a person in such a case would die in a very few minutes unless they called for assistance—death is so rapid, assistance seldom arrives in time—it is not a very painful death. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are the cases in which blood does not coagulate after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Death from electricity, when struck by lightning, the blood is found to be fluid, and it never coagulates—it will remain, and cannot be let out by an incision; there would be no muscular action.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Brown, of No. 18, South-street, Manchester-square, and keep a greengrocer's-shop; I let part of the house in lodgings. I knew a person called Jane Jones—she took a lodging of me three years ago last October, in the name of Jane Jones—she afterwards went by the name of Jane Good within about six months of taking them—I saw her last on Sunday, the 3rd of April—she was rather a plump person, and ra<lb></lb>ther dark—I had no opportunity of knowing whether she was with child before the 3rd of April—the prisoner used to come to see her almost at soon as she came—be never said who he was, only a friend—when she changed her name to Good, he called her his wife—there was a little boy called Daniel Good—he was about eight years old when he first came—I have seen him, the prisoner, and Jane Good together—the prisoner called Jane. Good hit wife, and sometimes Jane—the boy called her "mother" in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner told me the mother had been dead a year and a half, and so the child called this woman mother—that was when he called Jane his wife—I saw Jane go out on Sunday, the 3rd of April, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—she was dressed in a blue bonnet, black ground shawl, with flowers on it of different colours, and a mingled cotton dress—the little boy went to school about two o'clock—I did not see him again that day—I did not know that he did not sleep at my house that night, till the day after—I only heard it—I did not observe it by his bed or any thing—last October Jane Good had the front and back kitchens, and afterwards had but one kitchen—the sign-board produced was put up to denote her trade—she kept a mangle, and took washing—(<hi rend="italic">on the board was painted, "Mangling done by J, Good</hi>")—I did not see her after the 3rd of April—I think she slept out on Easter Sunday, but cannot be certain, but a padlock was on the door at eight o'clock on the morning of Easter Monday, and it was on when she went out the night before—I cannot say whether she slept out on any other night during the time she lodged in my house, but I believe she slept at her lodgings every night but Easter Sunday—the prisoner used to call to see her two or three times a week—on Monday morning, the 4th of April, I think about ten or eleven o'clock, he called to ask if he could have the room a fortnight or three weeks longer, because there was a mangle</p>

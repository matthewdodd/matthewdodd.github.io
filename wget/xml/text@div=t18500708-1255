                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop in Widegate-street, Bishopsgate. On Saturday, 8th June, the prisoner came a little after eleven o'clock at night—I was very busy—he joined some other men—he had a pot of beer—he paid me for that in coppers, called for another pot, and threw down a half-crown—it came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him change, and put the half-crown in the till—there was no other half-crown there—when the second pot of beer was drank, the prisoner went away—I took the money out of the till in three or four minutes after he was gone—there was only one half-crown there—no one had been to the till in the meantime but myself—I was there the whole time—I found the half-crown was bad—I marked it and put it on one side—I afterwards gave it to the police-sergeant—on the following Saturday night, the prisoner came about the same time—I was very busy—he called for a pot of beer again, and gave me a bad sixpence—I did not mention to him that it was bad—I gave him change, and kept it in my hand—I sent out for a policeman while the prisoner called for another pot of beer, and gave me another bad sixpence—I saw a constable go by—I called him in, and gave the prisoner in charge—I told the prisoner I could not stand it any longer—he said, "Is it bad?"—I said, "Yes, and you know it," and he gave me another bad sixpence—I marked all the sixpences, and they were given to the sergeant and the half-crown.</p>

Pulling, of No. 125, High Holborn, have this day deposited in the possession of Messrs.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. Nearly everything was sold in the sale of the 8th November by arrangement with the Receiver—he asked me if I thought there would be a profit, and I said I thought there would—he directed me to sell and pay the proceeds to him—if he had paid me the amount owing I would have given the goods to him, and I wrote to him to that effect—they were sold in the ordinary way—there was no reservation on that day—the Receiver had no one there to buy them in—in the other sales somebody attended to protect the goods or written instructions were sent—I have some of them here (<hi rend="italic">two produced</hi>)—when there was a reserved price we did not sell unless the goods reached those prices—on several occasions the goods were bought in—the cabinets were not bought in on previous occasions, but the dining-room suite was, on the 19th October, at 48 guineas—it was not put for sale between that and the 8th November—it then fetched 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot recollect whether it was soiled; to the best of my recollection the velvet was faded—it was on the first occasion I saw the defendant that he told me he had bills to meet to pay off his partners, and that he had taken the stock and could afford to sell cheaper—I also saw him afterwards—we were specially directed not to sacrifice the goods—I had an interview with him in August in reference to the silk; that was the third occasion on which I saw him—I believe those were the only three occasions on which I saw him—he then told me the silk was not to be sold, and we agreed to hold it over—that applied to all the silk that was sold on the 8th November—he said he would redeem them—there was not to my knowledge any arrangement with Marler to that effect when the silk was deposited—Marler came to us upon that occasion in August, and that was the reason I went to the defendant—the silks had accumulated from time to time, and I told Marler we should sell them the following week, and he said "Do not do so," and then I went to Mr. Pulling to know why we kept them, because they would sell at better prices by being sold in bulk—we never sold without having a price, or some one to represent the defendant at every sale—these things fetch good prices at our sales—the cabinets I consider fetched retail shop prices—on some occasions things fetch better prices than they would at a shop, and some<lb></lb>times considerably less—I should think thirty to forty lots were bought in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187210280042"></xptr>
               <p>—the 10 percent, included all expenses, and the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. included every expense when the lot was bought in—when bought in the goods are again carried into the account, which is swollen in that way—I cannot tell the amount of the sales previously to the 8th November without looking at the account—(<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>)—it is an extract from our books—on the 8th November the sale was 642<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was by far the larger sale we over had—when I spoke to the Receiver about that sale he said he would consult the committee, and he took time for that purpose—I saw Mr. Hincks on the matter, I believe that was after the sale—I do not believe I saw him while he was acting for the prisoner—it is not an uncommon thing in the trade to put furniture into sales at our rooms—it sometimes fetches good prices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Sometimes it fetches very bad prices—the amount of 418<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the amount due to us the day the account was rendered—that sum represents the goods sold—those were not counted again in the subsequent part of the account—a portion of the sum of 229<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would be—that amount does not include the total of the buying-in prices, but only the prices of goods sold—the total in the account of 511<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nett for 2nd June is for goods sold—the same as to 440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the next item—those are not counted over again—the amount of 2583<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. between the dates in the account represents all goods—deducting 642<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the balance shows the goods sold without any negotiation with the trustee—the sale for the 8th November had been fixed originally, and the goods would have been sold in the ordinary course—the negotiation to hold them over was on a previous occasion—the interview with Mr. Stewart was whether, with reference to the interests of the estate, we should hold the goods further, or allow them to be sold—we agreed to do that provided we were indemnified or repaid our advances at once—if we had been repaid our advances we would have handed the goods to the trustee—the silks were, by the direction of Mr. Pulling, held over by us—we did sell some silks between August and the 8th November—the silks he told us to hold over we did hold over; the others we sold—we always had a mark on to protect ourselves—the two letters of instruction I produced are not the only letters I received; the others are on the file—those I produced were merely a sample of them—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read as follows:</hi> "September 28th. Dear Sir,—The under-mentioned lots should not be sold under the prices quoted below, but of course we will leave it to your good judgment to a pound or two up or down. Try and do the best you can for us, and oblige, yours truly, S. Marler.")—Then follow the lots—lot 100 refers to a walnut wardrobe, and the reserve price is 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—lots 1 and 2 are a washstand and dressing-table, price 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—lot 172, a pair of silk curtains, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—lot 186, a 17ft. side<lb></lb>board, 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">The second letter was read as follows:</hi> "Oct. 2nd.—Dear Sir,—I do not think there is anything in to-day's sale to reserve besides the sideboard, which we think should fetch 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The velvet suite I must leave to your judgment what to sell it for. Yours truly; S. Marler." Those two are a specimen of the directions we received; that is the "velvet suite bought in—pursuant to that letter it was bought in at my discretion—some goods were sold and some bought in—we should not deduct so much as if it were cash; we return the amount of the actual sales—we make no return of the amount that was bought in—we charge 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., then a nominal sum—there are lots unsold 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is the nominal charge for buying in—those goods go in the account of the following sale—the goods are not then carried out in the column as if they had been sold.</p>

Pimm Brothers, and have been their manager for some years—on turning to the ledger account it would appear there was a bill met by defendant on the 4th October for goods bought before that date—the goods supplied between the months of August, September, and October are not paid for—there is an invoice dated 22nd September of crimson brocatelle, 44 inches and 63 inches, 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and another invoice 3rd October, 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at folio 150 of the guard book—I bought those goods in or purchased them—I paid 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the lot, or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—the entire amount of debt due to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, residing at 22, Great Winchester Street, and was employed by Mr. Stewart, the Receiver, to prepare a statement of the bankrupt's affairs—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of it—the bankrupt assisted me in preparing it—the details were obtained from him, and nothing was entered in it without his knowledge—I had access to all the books that were on the premises—there were a cash-book, a bought-and-sold ledger, day-book, an invoice-book, and banker's pass-book—we found no account with Messrs. Bonham on looking over the books—they are returned in the statement as secured creditors—Mr. Stewart applied to them for a statement, which they supplied, and which resulted in a balance of 642<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in that statement there are the debits of cash</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187210280049"></xptr>
               <p>received from Bonham &amp; Son—there are no entries <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the cash-book to identify them—we could not make the cash account balance; there is a large excess of payments—the cash-book had not been balanced for sixteen months—I have not gone into the question of purchases by the defendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. The defendant told me he had had dealings with Messrs. Bonham—there were no entries of them in the cash-book—now and then we found items in the cash-book corresponding with the receipts from Messrs. Bonham, but not in all cases; the book did not furnish the necessary materials—he mentioned that he had had dealings with Meters. Bonham, in the presence of Mr. Hincks and the Receiver—he declined to say anything about it until he got the account—I will swear that he said he could not tell anything about the transactions with Messrs. Bonham—I knew the goods were at Bonham's; I cannot say defendant told me they were there—I asked him why the name of Bonham did not appear in the books, and he said he did not want the name to appear; and, with regard to paying in the cheques, he did not want his banker to know it—he used to get the cheques cashed, so that they might net pass through the bank—besides the books I have mentioned, there was a diary—I cannot say the books were very well kept; the invoice-book was well kept—I do not know anything of any stock being taken away from Holborn; I only know what is in the statement of affairs I was simply employed to make up the state<lb></lb>ment of affairs—I was then acting under Mr. Stewart's instructions—I have had nothing to do as the accountant in the bankruptcy—I had nothing to see to as to the profit for the last twelve weeks; I cannot tell whether there was any—I cannot say whether he bought largely, or increased, or what he did; I was not asked to ascertain—he was paying away about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week during the last three or four months—his cash account shows payments in excess of the receipts—I have not analyzed the trade payments during the four months, and cannot say whether they were 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the purchases of 1871 were not larger than those of 1870—I know nothing about the sale of the cabinets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The bankrupt was directed by the Court to file a cash account for the last six months of his trading, and I was appointed to assist him in complying with that order—that was my only employment—as to the trade bills we took his word for them as to which were trade bills and which for accommodation—we judged as to that by the names in the state<lb></lb>ment of affairs, and treated them as trade bills accordingly—when I saw in the statement "Bonham 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," I did not assume that was a trade bill—all the bills in the bill-book I treated as trade bills—there were others where no cash was advanced, and which were not in the bill-books—I did not compare them with the invoice ledger, but with the statement of affairs—I found those that should be due appeared according to the bill-book—this account would not be necessary to show whether it was goods supplied or money lent—I found the bill-book corresponded in substance with the proofs of the various creditors—I did not know whether a proof was in respect of an accommodation bill, or money lent, or goods supplied—the amounts received from Messrs. Bonham do not correspond in date with the entries in the cash-book—there was no name attached to them—defendant would tell me which they were—there was nothing in the books to identify them—in July there is a receipt for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Messrs. Bonham, but there is no entry in the cash-book—there is the same amount, but not corresponding in date—it is the same as to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 13th July, 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 5th</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. I cannot say that there was a single bill out<lb></lb>standing at the date of the petition, the 31st October—from week to week the payments were always in excess—payments were made on the day of the receipt, or a day or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The examination of the defendant in bankruptcy of</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th March</hi>, 1872, <hi rend="italic">was put in and read at length. He attributed his failure to an unfortunate specu<lb></lb>lation in the Suburban Hotel Company, and also to the fact of a dissolution of partnership, he having to pay out the two retiring partners; to meet these calls he sold large quantities of goods at Bonham's auction-rooms, and pledged others at Attenborough's. Portions of further examinations on 22nd March and 20th April were also read at the request of defendants counsel.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Stewart, the trustee to this estate—we are accountants—I understand that, at the time of the liquidation, there was some property taken to secure the costs of the petition—they were brought back again, and sold in the bankrupt's premises—I saw every article sold—I did not see them taken away—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the stock account of the sale—the goods consisted of a pair of large vases, lot 102, and a pair of small vases, lot 107; a piece of crimson silk, and a piece of gold—those were sold at the sale, and the proceeds duly carried to the credit of the estate—the charges upon it, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Hincks and 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to our firm, were paid—with the exception of those two sums the rest of the property has gone to the credit of the estate—I have looked at the books to see what they are; there is a cash-book, a day-book, a guard-book for invoices, a banker's pass-book, and some scroll diaries—all those books are here, and susceptible of being examined—they are not kept so as to show what was the bankrupt's condition at the time of his stoppage—credits were not posted in the ledger for a considerable time before the bankruptcy—the cash-book is not kept in an ordinary way; it is very badly kept, imperfectly kept—the invoices show the amount of purchases during the last four months, before the petition for liquidation, to be 6,535<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is a statement prepared in our office—the statement of affairs shows a deficiency of 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that does not include the 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at which he overstated his stock at the time of the dissolution of his partner<lb></lb>ship—there was no notice taken of that in his statement of affairs which he prepared for the liquidation—I am not able in any way, by these books, to find out how that deficiency could have arisen.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would add to the deficiency if it were taken notice of, but it is not; it would not make any difference in the actual state of affairs at present, but it is unaccounted for—he said there was 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more stock than there was—I was not present when the goods I have spoken of were taken away; I was on the premises, I believe, but engaged on the books—I understand that my partner was on the premises; I can't speak with certainty as to Mr. Hincks—I cannot explain why 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods were taken away to cover 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd due to Mr. Hincks and us—I understand they were taken to Mr. Walker's in Bunhill Row; he was not one of the committee then; he was one of the largest creditors—he was inquiring into the state of affairs—I believe the goods were retained at his place until they were brought back to the sale—I am not sure, I won't swear to it—I believe</p>

               <p>other goods of Mr. Walker's were brought into the sale—he is a cabinet-maker—I can't say whether they were new or second-hand goods—some goods of Mr. Mitchell's were also brought in, I understand; he is a cabinet-maker, and the petitioning creditor—I am not aware that any other persons put in goods—I cannot tell you how much the bankrupt paid to trade creditors in the last four months; it is impossible to find from his books—we don't consider the cash account filed by the bankrupt reliable—we have not been able to ascertain with certainty how much he paid away within the last four months; I have not personally tried to do that—the amount of the purchases in the corresponding four months in 1871 was ascertained, but I really forget it at this moment—I am sure they were not as large as those I have mentioned—it was apparently a very large business—I could not say that it turned over 24,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is quite possible—it is impossible that it could be making a profit during the last twelvemonths—I have not worked it out—I don't see how it is possible—I have not sent in any account yet against the estate, with the exception of the small account of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I am not aware that an account for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd has been sent in—my partner is trustee—the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd has nothing to do with the trustee's personal work; that is the lawyer's charges—I can't speak to these accounts—I don't know about them—it is a very difficult question to answer what has been done—everything has been done with regard to winding up the estate—I have not made an estimate of the purchases for the whole year of 1871—possibly I could have done it—it is not possible from the bankrupt's books to make any estimate of the payments at any period—I was present part of the time at the meeting when lie was asking to pass his last examina<lb></lb>tion—I remember a document being produced—it was not to my knowledge put into the hands of the trustee and supported by affidavit—I can't say whether it was put into Mr. Hincks' hands—I will swear that I don't know that—I am not aware that trade creditors to the amount of 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. opposed the prosecution, and asked that he might be admitted to pass his last examination—I was not present on any occasion when such a thing was done; it has never been placed before the trustees.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, at 30, Moorgate Street—some goods were taken away to secure the costs of the petition for liqui<lb></lb>dation; they were taken to Mr. Walker's—they were two pairs of vases and two pieces of crimson silk and gold—they were afterwards returned, and received by myself—I was appointed trustee on 9th June—I was pre<lb></lb>sent at a meeting of creditors, where it was resolved that the defendant should be made bankrupt, and not be permitted to proceed in liquidation; it was somewhere about 23rd November—the matter was discussed, and the bankrupt himself was heard—I was afterwards present at a meeting when it was determined to prosecute him; the meeting was specially called for that purpose—I think it was on 10th May—it was then resolved by a considerable majority that he should be prosecuted—there might have been some dissentients in the room, possibly, but they did not give expres<lb></lb>sion to their opinions in public—the minutes were submitted to the Registrar in Bankruptcy before any steps were taken at all, and his advice and permission were requested to proceed under this resolution.</p>

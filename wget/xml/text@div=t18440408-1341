At the time this happened I lived at 2, Bird Cage-alley, where Carroll and his wife lived—there were several lodgers in the house—I and my wife occupied the front-room second floor—I had been there four or five weeks when this happened—Carroll was my landlord—on the 2nd of March I left my wife in the Black friars-road as I went to work—we had been at a public-house, and had half-a-quarters of rum together—she did not drink quite a quarter of it—I left her at five minutes before six in the morning—she was in good health—I never knew her in better health—when I came home at night I found her dead—her name was Elizabeth Hobbs.</p>

I went down stairs, and Mr. Carroll followed me—in about half an hour the deceased came down stairs—I heard a quarrel about the boots and crockery between the deceased and Mr. and Mrs. Carroll—Mr. Carroll told her if she would replace the things she had broken he would give her the boots—they were then on a box in the room—a few minutes after, he com<lb></lb>plained that she had run the fork into his lip—I did not see any sign of that—the deceased had a fork in her hand, and was trying <hi rend="italic">to job</hi> it at him—I saw her <hi rend="italic">do</hi> that upon the landing, but did not see it strike him—there was a piece of broken long below stairs in his room where we were at this time—Carroll</p>

About ten o'clock on Saturday morning, the 2nd of March, I was called in to see the deceased—both Mr. and Mrs. Carroll came to fetch me—they waited for me, and accom<lb></lb>panied me back—I examined the deceased, and observed she was bruised about the face—I did not observe that she had drank very much—I should think not—she was dead when I got there—I could not account for her death then—there were external bruises, but not sufficient—I opened her head on the Monday—externally there were marks of bruises over the left eye, and also a contused wound behind the right ear—on removing the scalp, there were large clots of blood effused, corresponding with the external marks—there was also evidence of blows being struck immediately behind the right ear—I should say that was not done with great violence—I saw the piece of tongs at the inquest—it may have been produced by that—a fist would not produce the wound behind the ear, it must have been something sharp—there was no wound on the temple, but three or four external bruises—in my judgment death was caused by concussion of the brain, produced by repeated blows—I should not think the blow behind the ear sufficient of itself, but, in combination with other circumstances, it would aid—it was the only wound—the other marks could be accounted for by blows from a fist or hand—if she</p>

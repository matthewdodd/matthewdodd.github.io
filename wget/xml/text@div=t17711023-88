            . I bought this shirt of the prisoner about five weeks ago; it was in pawn; I gave her one shilling and six pence for it; I deal in cloaths, and bought it to sell again.</p>
               <p>Q. to M'Gee. What did she say when she offered to sell you the shirt?</p>
               <p>M'Gee. She asked me if I wanted a coarse shirt for myself or my lodger, I looked at it and saw it was mine; I told her it was stolen; she said some of my lodgers sold it to her.</p>

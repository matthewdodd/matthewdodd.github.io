I know the Fletchers, the father and the three others-three packages were brought to our place by Butler—one was a large bale, which appeared to be soft like wool—one was a crate, which appeared to be china, packed with straw, and the other a hard package, which appeared to be cloth—it was a close, flat, narrow package—I observed a hole in the covering of the hard package, and saw dark cloth through it—after they had arrived, the elder Fletcher came with Mitchell, and a town cart, to take them away—that was about four o'clock in the afternoon, I think—he lives over at Temple Mills, towards Stratford—he helped to load them—he asked the carman if there was convenience to ride—Fletcher went away first towards the public-house, and the cart went after him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Fox-buildings, Kent-street, and have lived there since July last. Ellen Fletcher keeps the house-her husband John Fletcher also lived there—after I had been there a fortnight, Ellen Fletcher told me her father-in-law had some cloth in pawn, and she would ask him to get some out, and let me try to sell it—Fletcher, sen., called two or three days after, and after that she said she had asked him and he would get them out for me—in the course of two or three days after, Fletcher, sen., called and brought one piece of black kerseymere, and asked me to fold it up in a proper way—it was all rumpled then and not folded in a business-like way—I folded it up into the old folds which there had been—he then went away for about half-an-hour, and brought another</p>

               <p>piece something similar to it—I folded that up also—he said it was a very nice piece of kerseymere—I asked him if he had brought them for me to sell—he said no, he had sold those at the West-end—he stopped about half an hour, and took the two pieces away with him—he called again in two or three days-George Chappell was with him on both occasions—he brought a piece of cloth with him the third time, which he said I might try and sell—there was twenty-five yards and three quarters—Ellen was not in the room—she was in the back-kitchen at the time—she came in afterwards, but said nothing about the cloth—she said she had sold a pair of trousers to a young man at Walmsley's, the pawnbroker, if the old man would let her take the piece there, and have it cut off, and George Chappell was to go with her to represent it as his—he went with her—when they came back the old man was sitting in a chair by the side of the table—Ellen said she had sold two yards and a quarter, and George Chappell gave the old man 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—the old man went away with Chappell, and said he should come back in the evening about six o'clock to see what I had sold—they called about that time, and I told them I had sold none-old Fletcher then told me I must sell it by Saturday night, if I could, for he wanted the money—I was to meet him at the Star, in Gracechurch-street, on Saturday night, which I did—I tried to sell it on the Friday, but could not, and I pawned it at Attenborough's in Charlotte-street, for four guineas, in the name of John Bates, Berwick-street, and gave him the money on Saturday night-in the middle of the following week old Fletcher called again, and brought thirty-three lbs. of thread, which he asked me to try and sell—he afterwards asked if I would try and sell another piece of kerseymere, if he got it out—I said I would try—he told me to come with him, and he would give me a piece—I went with him to Cresswell's, a pawnbroker, at the corner of Trinity-street, Borough—he went in there, and I with him—he gave them a ticket, and while he was doing that I went out to try to sell some of the thread—when I returned he was waiting outside for me, with the kerseymere in his hand—I took it home—it had a ticket on it of twenty-two yards and a half, but he sent me for a measure, and it measured nearly twenty-six yards, or more—on taking it home I found Ellen there—she said if I would let her have it, she had sold some to Waterman, the publican, for a pair of trousers—I let her have it, and she went away to Waterman's—she came back and asked me to go to Waterman's, and cut off three yards for Waterman, and two and a quarter for another young man who was there—I went and cut it off—I have since understood the young man's name to be Spriggs, or Spinks—she told me to leave the cloth there, as some of Waterman's friends might come in, and he would see if he could persuade them to have it—I left it there for two or three hours, and then went for it, and took it out to try and sell it—Ellen met me when I came outside, and said she would take it elsewhere, and try to sell it—I gave it to her, and she returned it to me with ten yards only left, which I pawned at Walmsley's, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and took the money to the old man, at the Star, in Gracechurch-street—Chappell was there.</p>

               <p>years of age—I will tell you my reason for going by different names—I had a writ out against me, three or four times—that was the principal reason—I never had any other reason—I had an execution against me for a tailor's bill—I have never gone by any other name, for any other purpose, than on account of some debt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you go by the name of Gardener? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I hired a horse and chaise once, by the name of Gardener, of a person at Newport Pagnell named Greaves—I brought it to London and put it up at a livery stable two or three days, till the horse recovered, to take it back—I drove it fifty miles in a short time—there was a charge of felony preferred against me on that occasion—I saw a handbill offering a reward for me—the officer brought it when he took me—I had made away with part of the chaise on my journey to London—one of the cushions and the driving box—that was all—I did not leave the whip—I had seven or eight shillings in my pocket when I hired the horse and chaise—atthe time I went to Newport Pagnell, I resided in Crawford-street—I went there to borrow money from my friends—I was not quite nineteen then—I have been doing nothing for the last five or six months—I have had money from my friends at Bromley, in Kent-no charge has ever been made against me except stealing the horse and chaise-not that I know off—it was once reported that there was a warrant against me for forgery, but I never knew it—it was said I had altered a bill of exchange from 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I understood that was the charge—I was not taken before any Magistrate for that—there was a trial about it at Guildhall, just this time twelvemonth—Thomas Miers was the plaintiff in the cause, and John Bowler the defendant—he is my uncle—the verdict was for the defendant—I was not called as a wit<lb></lb>ness—I was at a public-house in Basinghall-street at the time, waiting to be called, if wanted—I went away after the trial, and lodged for a week at West Ham, as Mr. Miers thought the officer had found out where I was living and would take me—I did not get any money for that bill—I got goods for it—I paid it to Robert Miers—he was transported from here a few sessions ago, for arson—he paid the bill to his brother Thomas—I had different goods for the bill-not so much as 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the bill originally for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and did not you promise to take your uncle the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not pay my uncle 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you were connected a good deal with Robert Miers in help<lb></lb>ing him to remove his goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I assisted in removing very few of them—I assisted in moving some—he had taken another shop—that was before the fire, some time—I do not know how long-more than a week—it must have been a month or five weeks, I think—I was a witness for him when he was tried here—I am a single man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not on the last occasion when you stood in that box swear over and over again that you were a married man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never was asked the question, to the best of my recollection—it was not put to me that I was a married man—they asked who managed the shop, and I said my wife, but the question was never put to me in that plain way to my know<lb></lb>ledge—I really do not know whether I swore I was married at St. George's, Hanover square—I cannot swear I did not say so—I do not know whether I did or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I hold the lease of three houses in Fox-buildings, Kent-street. The prisoner, John Fletcher, was a tenant of mine—I have seen the other prisoners at John Fletcher's house, and also at Temple Mills—on the Thursday before Good Friday last, I saw the witness Tibbs and old Mr. Fletcher in the back yard at Fox-buildings—I did not notice par<lb></lb>ticularly how old Mr. Fletcher was dressed—he seemed to have a brown coat on—I believe he was dressed as he generally was—there was a cart there—I did not see any thing taken out of the cart, but I saw a bundle in the back parlour-old Fletcher was then gone into the front parlour, and there was only Tibbs and Ellen Fletcher present—I took hold of the bundle, and said, "What have you here?"—Tibbs said it was a bale of goods that he had brought from the docks—I went into the front parlour to old Fletcher, and asked him for some money for the rent that was owing—he said he would let me have some in the course of a few days—I had frequently seen Chappell and old Fletcher there together before that—I had never seen Barker—in July last Ellen Fletcher called on me, in consequence of which, I went to No, 2, Fox-buildings, and saw Chappell, old Fletcher, and Midgley there, in the parlour, and I passed through into the back parlour—I saw Chappell and Midgley go out together-Midgley had a bundle on his shoulder, fastened up in brown paper-old Fletcher came into the back parlour to me—I asked him if he had got any rent for me, as he had promised me some several times, and had not fulfilled his promise—he said he had not got any money for me then, but in the course of a few days he would—he said he should have a piece of black merino in about a week, if I would purchase it—I asked him what would be the price of it—he said, "About half-a-crown a yard"—after they were all gone I asked Ellen if she did not intend to get rid of Mr. Midgley, as I thought she ought not to let him stop in the house, for I thought he had sold old Fletcher a duplicate—she said it was her father's goods, and not Midgley's—that was all that took place.</p>

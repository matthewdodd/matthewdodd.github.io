                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in the Caledonian-road. On 27th Jan. I was proceeding down the Portland-road, at five or ten minutes past nine o'clock—a woman touched me—I took no notice, but she fol<lb></lb>lowed me, and pulled me towards a carriage entrance in Portland-road—she asked where I was going—I said, "Home"—she put both her hands under my great coat, and began fumbling me about—I put my hand and found my watch and chain, were gone—I said, "You have stolen my watch"—I seized her by the neck, and called "Police!"—the moment I called, the prisoner and another man came up, caught hold of my arm, and tried to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> me inside the gate of No. 10, which was a little ajar, and tried to get the woman away from me—I still had bold of her—I squeezed her neck, and she said, "Here is your watch," and she gave it into my hand—I put it into my pocket—she then ran away—the moment she was gone I seized the two men—the policeman came up—I said the woman had stolen my watch—he went after her, but he returned and said he could not find her—while the officer was gone the other man got away, but I kept the prisoner and gave him in charge—he said what was I going to give him in charge for, that I had run against him, and he would give me in charge—this is my watch, it cost me seven guineas, and the chain cost 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had a little silk guard round my neck, which was cut or broken.</p>

At a little after nine o'clock that night, I heard a cry of "Police!"—I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner struggling—the prosecutor was pointing to a woman who was running—I pursued her but could not get her—I came back and took charge of the prisoner—in taking him along the road he seized me by the collar, and endeavoured to throw me down—we struggled and fell to the ground, but assistance came and we got him to the station.</p>

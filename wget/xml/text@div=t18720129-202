I am maid to Hannah Elgar Harvey, who lives at 2, Addison Road, Kensington—on 17th November I went to bed about 10 o'clock, leaving the house fastened up all safe—at that time this clock was in the dining-room, and the other one in the drawing-room—I came down in the morning about 5.10, and I then missed the two clocks, a table-cover, a biscuit tin, 12 dessert knives and forks, 11 fish knives, a number of dinner napkins and rings, some table knives and carving knives, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, four pillow cases, and other things—I was not the last to go to bed, but when I went up all was safe—no one went round the house after me—there was a hole cut in the back door, large enough to admit a man's hand, so that the door could be unfastened—it was fastened by a bolt and a bar—I found the door open, the piece of wood which came from the hole, and a centre-bit—the back door was open—the inner door was the one they cut—I saw the two clocks and some other things about a fortnight afterwards—I identify them, and the dessert knives and forks, and the fish knives and forks, as my mistress's property—I have been in her service twelve years and a half—two of the napkin rings, a pen knife, and part of a table-cover were shown to me, and I identified them.</p>

On 22nd January, I went to Leicester Place, Leicester Square, and found the prisoner Collin and a man who is not here, and took them into custody—Towers saw Collin, and picked him out from five others, and said he believed he was the man who pledged the clock—the other man was subsequently discharged—I searched Collin's house, and found about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, consisting of opera glasses, telescopes, spectacles, four gold watches, two gold rings, a dozen shirts, three portmanteaus, and a large box—the box contained the property I have described—I also found a bottle of liquid, used to take out writing—that property was restored to the owners in Brussels—an optician's, in Brussels, was robbed on the 16th, and those were the goods that were stolen—I found the clock, which has been identified, at Mr. Smith's, the pawnbroker's, at Tottenham Court Road—I took Smith into custody on 4th December—I found him in bed—he got up, and I searched the room—I found some knives and forks, which are produced, a table-cover, and a centre-bit—the table-cover and knives and forks were afterwards identified by Groom—I compared the centre-bit with the marks on the door which was broken open, and it appears to me to fit it nicely—the next day, the 5th, I saw Dulax at 4, New North Street, Theobald's Road, in the kitchen, at his supper, with a prostitute—I told him I should take him into custody for being concerned with Smith in breaking into a gentleman's house at Bromley, in Kent—he said "I know nothing about it"—he spoke in English—Sergeant Knight, who was with me, found this brush—Dulax said "Everything in the room is mine"—the brush is identified by a witness as having been stolen from a gentleman's house, in another case—the goods which have been stolen from Harvey's, and have been identified, are worth about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

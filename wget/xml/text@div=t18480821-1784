                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my service. On 10th July I found a pail in my wood-cellar—I felt in it, and found some coal—I took it out, and marked it with chalk, and put it back—I told the policeman—there was hog-wash in the pail, which the prisoner was authorised to take—I can swear this is the coal that was in the pail—the mark was on it when we took it out again, but by carrying it away it is rubbed off of it.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 21st of April, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner entered my father's shop in Regent-street, and asked to look at some cravats, silk stockings, and silk socks, and de<lb></lb>sired I would send a number over for the inspection of a gentleman, to the address which she gave me, "Madame D'Arcy, 133, Regent-street"—she wished them to go over in a quarter of an hour, as she would soon dine—I took them over, and was shown up stairs, where I found the prisoner without her bonnet or shawl, in the front-room—after looking over the things for a few moments, she took them into a back-room, and requested me to sit down for a few minutes—she brought some of the articles back, and asked me the prices—I told her—she asked me if I had a bill—I said, No; I could make one if required, but I could tell her the prices of any of the articles—she then stepped into the back-room again—after waiting a long time I concluded she had gone to dinner—I waited longer, and at last requested the servants to search for her, but she was not in the house—she took with her seven cravats, four pairs of silk stockings, and six pairs of silk socks—the cravats were worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—four were satin and three silk—the silk stockings were worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the socks 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think I should have sold them at that price.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Samuel Thomas. The prisoner came on the 21st of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and asked to look at the apartments—I showed her up stairs, and immediately fetched Mrs. Thomas—she took the apartments from Mrs. Thomas—I was not present then—she said she wished to come in that evening, that her mother was coming from Dover with a little girl, and we were to prepare for them, and Mrs. Thomas was to order in some things—she then went away, and returned in about half an hour—I let her in—she said she expected her luggage, which I was to take in—she gave her name as Madame D'Arcy—she went up stairs, took off her bonnet and shawl, and sat down in the front-room—in about a quarter of an hour Mr. Gahagan came with the goods, and was shown up into the front drawing-room—I left him there for full an hour and a half—he then came and called me, and the prisoner had left the house.</p>

I lost a silver watch from my shop on the 17th of November - it had a ribbon and two keys to it. I had seen it hanging in the window about an hour before it was taken - the window was close shut down. I did not see either of the prisoners. I missed it about half-past four or five o'clock, and saw it again on the following Saturday in the possession of the constable. The prisoners were in custody.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. My husband went out about three o'clock. Mr. Poole's watch was in the shop on the counter. The prisoner Carrol came to the shop and gave me his watch, and asked me what would be the expense of having something done to it - I said I could not tell. Mr. Poole's watch was within his reach - I had put it on the counter - he went away and said he could not come again. No other person had been in in the mean time.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker, and live in King-street, Hammersmith. I saw the two prisoners on Wednesday evening, the 17th of November, about ten minutes before six o'clock, in a cart, in Phillmore-place, Kensington, about two miles from my house - I was looking after them. I thought it would be improper for me to take them myself, and I applied to some persons passing the road to assist me, as I suspected they had robbed my shop; they drew up the cart by the road side, and Cox got out - some persons took him. I got into the cart, and took Carrol - the watch was found on Cox.</p>

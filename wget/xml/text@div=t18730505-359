I live at 68, Russell Square—in March last I was a member of the firm of Merton, Hart &amp; Co., 62, Piccadilly, bankers and exchange brokers—I had formerly been on the Stock Exchange—I have known the prisoner as a stock broker for about four months—I saw him at his office in Threadneedle Street, on a Wednesday about March 26th—but previous to that my partner had made a communication to me—the 15th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187305050060"></xptr>
               <p>and the 31st are the account days—I said "You hare been speaking to my partner about making you an advance on the account day"—he asked me whether I could take in any stock on the account day—I said "To what extent?"—he replied "About 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there was a little conversation, which I do not exactly remember, the result of which was that I asked him to put his proposal in writing, so that I might consult my partner—he said that the stock was Turks, Eries, and Varna obligations, which are securities well known on the Stock Exchange—"to take in stock "means to make advances on stock—it is a technical term used on the Stock Exchange—we received this letter from him late on the afternoon of the 26th—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "51, Threadneedle Street, March 26th, 1873, Messrs.

W.A. Roberts.")—This is a copy of my answer, which was sent by poet in the ordinary way; "62, Piccadilly, 26th March, 1873; W.A. Roberts, Esq. Dear Sir,—We beg to inform you that we shall be prepared to advance you on the account day, till 17th April, 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Erie and foreign stocks, with a margin of ten per cent. Terms on foreign securities same rate of interest as charged by your bankers, with one quarter per cent, commission; Eries, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per share, and one quarter commission; the loan renewable upon terms subject to arrangement."—After having sent that answer, I went to the prisoner's office next day and saw him—he objected to pay the quarter per cent com<lb></lb>mission, and said that he thought one-sixteenth was sufficient; and we ulti<lb></lb>mately arranged to make the advance at one-eighth commission—it was arranged that payment was to be made in the City by cash on an open cheque on the account day—on the same afternoon I received this letter from the prisoner: (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "51, Threadneedle Street, March 27th; Messrs. Merton, Hart &amp; Co. Dear Sirs,—As it is in your way, a friend of mine requires 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of French notes on Saturday or Monday; will you please get them for him, and I will pay you. Yours, W.A. Roberts.")—I under<lb></lb>stood that as a separate transaction from the other—next day, Friday the 28th, I saw the prisoner, I think it was in Threadneedle Street, and told him it was impossible to get the notes by Saturday—he said "If you can<lb></lb>not get them to-morrow, Monday will do—I did not see him on the Satur<lb></lb>day, but I did obtain the French notes, 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, in different amounts—he asked me to buy them, and I got them as I could—I went to the prisoner's office on Monday, the 31st, about 12 o'clock or 12.30, and he told me that if I would call about 1.30 he would give me the securities, but previous to that I had shown him a letter of hypothecation which he would have to sign—he looked at it, and made no demur to it—I called again about 1.30 or 2 o'clock for the securities, and the prisoner gave me 400 Erie shares, 3,000 Turks, of 1871, 3,000 Turks of 1868, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cents., 2,040 Spanish, and 15,000 Atlantics, Third Preferential, that means 15,000 of the shares, 15,000 dollars—each Erie share also represents a dollar—the value of the whole was 10, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I did not give him any money then—I returned to his office at 3.30 or 3.45, and requested he would go with me to my solicitor, in the Old Jewry, that he might witness the transaction—he went with me to Messrs. Abrahams &amp; Roffey, solicitors, in the Old Jewry, and signed the agreement, which we call the hypothecation—I then gave him two open cheques, one for 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the West End Branch of the National Provincial Bank, but payable in the City to Mr. W.A. Roberts, a cheque of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187305050061"></xptr>
               <p>my firm; and another for 1,000, dated 31st March, payable to W.A. Roberts, Esq., at the West End Branch of the National Provincial Bank, Waterloo Place—both were payable to order, and both are endorsed by the prisoner "W.A. Roberts"—at the same time I handed him 75, 750 francs, which is 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in English money, corrected according to the rate of Exchange, that made up the advance of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I paid this sum by open cheques—I cannot say that on the night of the 31st he said in substance that the reason he left the cheque about was that he wished it to appear to his clerk that he had a good balance, and had no intention whatever that the cheque should be paid in to his bankers—I do not recollect his saying that he had the cheque drawn to give an appearance of solvency to his clerk, and that his clerk had paid it in to the bankers—I understood that his clerk had paid it in by mistake—he said something about why he had left it out, but I cannot exactly say what it was—I understood him to say that the cheque was left on his desk for some pur<lb></lb>pose, and that his clerk had paid it in—he told me for what purpose he had left it out, but I cannot remember the words exactly—he told me in substance that he had left it there for some purpose; I know he told me the cheque had been left on the desk for some object—he said that he was in difficulties.</p>

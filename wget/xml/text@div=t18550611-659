                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 34). On 21st May, I was in company with Sergeant Turpin at the China Hall public house, Lower Rotherhithe-road; we were in plain clothes—there is a trough for water on the south side of the road, opposite the China Hall, and behind it some vacant ground and then a shed, and at the back of the shed a door leading to a harness room—I saw a team belonging to the prosecutor come up, driven by Verrall and Franklin—there were four horses to it; it was driven between the water-trough and the shed—after the waggon stopped, Franklin took two nose<lb></lb>bags from under it, and placed them on the ground underneath the shed; they appeared full—Verrall took the bits out of the horses' mouths, and then took two other nosebags from under the same waggon, and put them by the ode of the two that Franklin had placed on the ground—I then saw Verrall take an empty sack from the waggon, which Franklin received and held open while Verrall took the four nosebags one by one and shot the contents into it—Franklin then took the empty nosebags and placed them on the four horses' noses—they left the sack containing the food on the ground, and in two or three minutes afterwards, Abel came from an enclosed shed behind the waggon, picked up the sack, and took it into the shed—shortly afterwards he came out with the empty sack, and placed it on the ground where he had taken it from—Verrall put it into the waggon, and he and Franklin crossed over to the China Hall—Abel remained underneath the shed—(some other waggons had just left when this took place)—about ten minutes afterwards I went to the China Hall, told Verrall and Franklin that I belonged to the police, and that they must consider themselves in custody for stealing the horses' food, belonging to their master, and selling it to Abel—Verrall replied, "You must be mistaken; there has nothing of the kind taken place"—Franklin made no reply—I took them to the station—we found in the mixture some small pieces of marked paper cut up.</p>

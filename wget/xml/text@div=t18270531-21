On the 27th of March, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, he came into the shop, and asked to look at some gold chains - I showed him one or two; he then asked to see some gold seals, which I showed him; he was about ten minutes in my sight, with only the counter between us; he turned his back to me, and pretended to count the money in his waistcoat pocket; he then said he had not sufficient money, but would call again, and went out - I did not see him again, till about a month afterwards, when I found him at Hatton-garden; immediately as he left, I thought I missed a gold seal, and on looking over the tray next morning I missed a very remarkable one; I only had one of that pattern; it was a plain stone, but the shape was remarkable - I found it at Hatton-garden, and have no doubt of it; it is worth about two guineas, and cost me more.</p>

On the night of the 12th of August, the prisoner was very much in liquor, and a neighbour brought him to me and asked me to give him a bed—I gave him one—I wanted him to go away the next morning, but he said his feet were blistered and he could not go—I left him there on Sunday morning, while I went out for an hour and a half-when I came back I found my back door open, and he was gone out—these are them, and these trowsers were missing—(looking at them.)</p>

I stopped the prisoner offering these trowsers for sale at a marine-store shop, on the 13th of August—I asked him whether they were his—he said, "Yes," that he brought them from on board a vessel-seeing they were not made I asked him how that was—he said he was so hard up that he could not get on any further with them—I took him to the station—he came home in the <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi> from the East Indies—the vessel was in the Dock at the time.</p>

On the 6th of June, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I went out, leaving my daughter Jane in care of the house; I returned in ten minutes, found her standing at the door, and missed the articles stated in the indictment from the counter; the cloth I had frequently cut, and am not certain of the quantity; it was worth above 3l. or 4l.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter. On the 6th of June my father went out for about ten minutes, leaving me alone in the shop - and almost immediately he went out three men came in; they were all dressed in blue jackets and trousers - two of them had white stockings and shoes on; the other had lace-up boots: one of them asked if my father was at home - I said he was not, but he would be in a few minutes; he said he wanted to be measured for a pair of morine trousers; I asked if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160027"></xptr>would wait - one of them stood with his back against the counter, and another sat down in the shop; the third walked about, and was talking to the baby which I had in my arms; my mother called me - she was at the parlour window, in my sight; I went out of the shop to her: I came back directly, and the men were all gone - the shop door, which was closed before, was open; I went and looked out, but could not see them - my father came back while I was looking out; nobody had been in the shop but those three men after he went out: I told him what had happened, for as soon as I came back to the shop I missed a roll of black cloth off the counter - I did not know any of the men; I am certain the prisoner was one of them: there was something particularly vulgar about him and the others looked genteel; he talked to the baby: I am sure of him - I described him to Norris, and saw him in custody in about a fortnight, dressed the same as he was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you quite sure it was not because you saw him in a sailor's dress, that you thought him the man? A. I am sure of him - they were all three dressed alike, except one wearing laced-up boots; I should know the others again - I never saw them before: they came in directly my father went out - he turned to the right; they seemed to come from the left; they had not been in the shop above two minutes when my mother called me, and when I returned they were gone; I can swear more particularly to the prisoner - I am sure I should know the others: I was not looking at the prisoner all the time, I suppose about half a minute; I told the officer the other two were of a dark complexion - they had hats on; I am thirteen years old: we had nothing but light goods hanging in the window.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.There was light enough for you to see the prisoner? A. Yes; I am sure of him; his face was broken out - I saw him at Lambeth-street, with another man, and knew him.</p>

             described the men as mates or sailors - that one had a red face, with pimples on it, and the other two were about the same size; I took the prisoner and another man to the Cherry Tree public-house, but not from her description; both were dressed as sailors: Norris and his daughter came to the office - she went into the lock-up room, where there were several, and picked him out from the rest - he was not pointed out to her; I had seen the prisoner several time before, but not since the robbery; she did not know the other man - she was positive of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did she describe the others except by their dress? A. No - she said she should know them again.</p>

That in the Evening on the Date aforesaid, word was brought to the Prisoner, that the French Prisoners were broke loose, and got into his Cock loft (a Place contiguous with the Cock-loft of the other Prison) It likewise appear'd that the Prisoner having formerly been robb'd by those French Prisoners; for the Defence of his House, took his Gun laden with small Shot, and went up with a Friend into his own Garret; that when there, the Sceiling over the Garret was seen to bend by the trampling of Feet on the other side; but all on a sudden, they were all gone, except one which seem'd to be on the further side of the Loft. It further appear'd, that the Prisoner designing to fright them, put the Mussle of his Gun into a Hole of the Sceiling, in order to discharge it against the Tiles, and while he was doing of it, the Deceas'd tripp'd over the Guyces, and came to the Hole just as the Prisoner discharg'd his Gun, by which he receiv'd the Wound, of which he dy'd.

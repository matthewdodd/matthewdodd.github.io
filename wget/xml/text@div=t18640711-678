                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was coming from my sister's place to see my grand<lb></lb>father in Northampton-street, and when I got to the parcel office at King's-cross Smith (<hi rend="italic">see next case</hi>) came up and said, "Halloa, Davis! where are you going?" I told him. He asked me if I was in work. I said, "Very little." He said that he was doing better than work, and living like a gentleman. He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a handful of half-crowns. He asked me if I would take one into the baker's shop at the corner. I said, "No." He said, "You need not be frightened; do you mind sending a boy in?" He told me to call a boy and send him in, and give him a slice of cake and a penny. I did so, and Smith came over to me again, and said, "You see it is all right; they cannot hurt you." I offered him the change and he would not take it; he told me to send two separate boys in, and be sure not to send the same boy in twice, but to ask the boy whether he was the same boy that went in before. When I saw the policeman coming I was frightened and threw the half-crown down. He took me, and I told him about Smith, and that he had more bad money about him. I had not the slightest intention of doing this when I left home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a japanner, of Rutland-street, New-road. Between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, on 26th Dec., I was in Leman-street, Whitechapel—I was suddenly seized from behind by two or more persons—I was severely beaten, and my watch and guard were stolen—I was thrown down, and became insensible—when I came to myself, the first thing I saw was a policeman, who had the two prisoners—my watch and chain were missing—I had the watch only the moment before the attack was made on me—it was in my pocket, and fastened by a chain round my neck—this is my watch—the chain has not been found—a button was missing from my shirt collar—I did not see the face of either of the persons—one of them had a jacket on resembling the jacket that Williams has on now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 70). I was on duty on the morning of 26th Dec., and my attention was attracted by a sound as if a man was choking—I looked across the street, and saw the prosecutor in a stooping position, and the prisoners one on each side of him, striking him—in an instant they ran towards me—I ran, and caught Williams in my right hand—I asked him what he was running for—he made me no answer—Brown was coming up—I took him with my left hand, and asked him what he was running for—he said a gentleman had been knocked down—I said, "I suppose you know something about it?"—he said, "No, I don't"—I took them across, and said to the prosecutor, "What is the matter?"—he said, "They have knocked me down, and taken my watch and chain"—I took the prisoners to the station, and found on Brown this watch—I went back to the place, and found this shirt button—I went back again after<lb></lb>wards, and over a fence I found this watch, which the prosecutor claims—from the time I saw the prisoners striking the prosecutor till I took them, I did not lose sight of them—I did not see any other men there—I saw two women.'</p>

On the 6th of July I lodged at the Nag's Head, James-street, Covent-garden. About half-past eleven o'clock at night I was going to my lodgings, the prisoners accosted me in Brydges-street, and solicited something to drink. I wished them to pursue a better course, Smith said she should be very happy to do so, but was afraid her friends would not take her back. I walked with them, conversing on that subject, and then went to their lodgings in a court near the Theatre, I might have remained there three or four hours. I sat on the bed, and being particularly tired, I fell asleep - Byrne had left me with Smith. I had taken my coat off, the notes were in the pocket. I awoke about four o'clock, and missed them, Smith was then gone. I got Gooding, and we found the prisoners together in Wych-street - I am certain they are the women - we secured them, and took them to a house. As Gooding was going up stairs with Smith, something fell from her; we called for a light, and found, a half handkerchief lying on the ground, containing my notes; they have my writing on them. We charged her with dropping them; she cried, but said nothing.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Corfe, and took the prisoner in Wych-street. I took Smith, and he took Byrne. As I was taking Smith up stairs in a coffee-shop, something fell from her. I found the handkerchief, containing two 10 l., one 5 l., and one 1 l. note, with three half-crowns and one shilling. She said she was sorry for it, and hoped he would forgive her.</p>

            : I went there in company with Gossett, Lewin, and Manwaring, between the hours of two and four in the afternoon; Gossett went into the lower room first, Lewin followed him, and I followed Lewin into the passage. Mrs. White the prisoner came out of her apartment, on the bottom floor; she caught hold of me by the coat and said, who do you want up stairs? you shall not go up, which gave me suspicion there was somebody up stairs that did not wish to be seen; they had gone up stairs before she took hold of me I got from her, and went up to the garret; the door was fast; I forced the door open, and we went in: either Gossett or Lewin called me up, and said now they are getting out of the window. I ran up directly. Baker and Radcliffe had got out of the window, and Gossett was out and had hold of Radcliffe: he said the others could go no farther. Baker said, use me well, I will surrender myself. Then Gossett pulled Radcliffe in at the window again, and Baker came into the garret. Baker turned round immediately to his sand through; he made a sort of a stand at the flask which had sand in it, and there were shillings, half-crowns, and six-pences lying upon the sand: in the flasks are put the sand, and upon the sand is put the money to make the impression. He swept part of the sand off: I stopped him from so doing, and we handcuffed them. Then they begged to put on their cloaths; for when we first saw them, one was in his shirt sleeves, and the other in a flannel waistcoat and trowsers. The money we found upon the flasks was good money; they put that upon the sand in the flasks to make the impression. Then I went to the vice-bench, and there I found a quantity of counterfeit shillings filed, and some unfiled. They are cast rough, and they afterwards file them smooth, and polish and silver them.</p>
               <p>What quantity did you find? - I did not count the base metal; there were a great number of them: the good ones amount to between 3 and 4 l. There was in the same garret a furnace: I took this crucible (producing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060064"></xptr> it) with the metal in it red hot out of the furnace; and all the implements that are here were in that garret.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What are you, Ryder? - I have attended justice Wilmot's office two or three months.</p>
               <p>And have on no other employment but that of catching and convicting people? -</p>
               <p>None else.</p>
               <p>And I suppose you expect when they are convicted to have a little bit of the reward? -</p>
               <p>I suppose I shall have no more than what the law allows me.</p>
               <p>What do you expect upon the conviction, should it so happen, of these three prisoners? - I came to speak the truth, I don't come to talk about rewards.</p>
               <p>You expect to have the reward, don't you? - I came to give my evidence.</p>
               <p>Do you expect to have the reward? - If there is any allowed, without doubt.</p>
               <p>But what that sum is you don't know? - I don't know what will be allowed to me.</p>
               <p>What is to be allowed for each? - Forty pounds.</p>
               <p>And you expect to have your share? - Without doubt.</p>
               <p>Which went up first into this house? - Gossett and Lewin.</p>
               <p>The woman did not stop them? - The door was open, and they went up before I saw her.</p>
               <p>Were these flasks set or not? - One was.</p>
               <p>What else did you find in the room besides shillings? - Half-crowns and sixpences and these implements.</p>
               <p>Was there nothing else there? - There was a vast quantity of rotten stone and sand, which is not produced here.</p>
               <p>Were there any buckles? - There were three rims, one pair, and an odd one.</p>
               <p>These might, I suppose, as well be cast in these flasks as any thing else? - I am not of that branch.</p>
               <p>I suppose these are common files? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I suppose they are made use of by every smith in the kingdom? - I am not a smith.</p>
               <p>You say you are not at all of the business, and yet you have ventured to swear that this money was ready for silvering? - They polish them up after they are rough cast before they silver them.</p>
               <p>Was the flask set with them or not? - They lay upon the sand in the flask.</p>
               <p>Was that flask set or not? you know what I mean by that term; was it set ready for melting? - No, because they must be taken out first.</p>
               <p>Then the flask was not set? - They were all laid ready to make the impression.</p>
               <p>Was all that handful you have produced laid upon the sand in the flask? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Whether these three rims of buckles you speak of were silver or base metal? - They were base metal.</p>
               <p>What day was you there to search? - On a Saturday; I believe, the 15th day of the month.</p>
               <p>The 15th is not a Saturday? - It was however upon a Saturday.</p>

Baker was dressed in a flannel waistcoat and a pair of trowsers, and without his coat. Radcliffe was in his shirt tucked up to his armpits, and his collar open, without any wig or any thing upon his head. The moment they heard the door breaking open, Baker put his foot upon the trough, jumped out at the window into the gutter, and from thence he got upon the house. Radcliffe followed him, but being a more bulky man could not get out so fast as Baker did. They were brought in by

               <p>Was you of this party that went to this house? - Yes: Ryder, Lewen, and Manwaring were with me; I saw Baker and Radcliffe getting out at the window, I followed them: I took Radcliffe, and Ryder took Baker, and we brought them into the room: when Baker came in at the window, he put his hand into the trough, and threw the money and the sand about.</p>
               <p>Was there a furnace there? - Yes; and this scouring paper, and files, and flasks, and vices, and things.</p>

               <p>I believe you know nothing of finding these instruments? - No.</p>
               <p>Describe the use of the several things produced? - These flasks are made use of to cast, the sand is put into it: here is what they call a get, a leader that makes a channel in the sand, through which the metal runs to the impressions; here is a mixture of silver and metal, copper, I suppose, and some filings; here is scouring paper that is used in coining; and here are a great many crucibles: these three half crowns are counterfeits; in a good half crown you will find the letters upon the edge, on the counterfeit you will find none in general.</p>
               <p>Are these counterfeits or not? (shewing the witness some of the shillings that were found in the trough) - I look upon these to be good ones, and I apprehend they were used for patterns.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are very conversant with this sort of business: I understand that flask may be used for the purpose of casting any thing that may be enclosed in a flask? - Any small things.</p>
               <p>Crucibles are used in melting metals? -</p>
               <p>Yes.</p>
               <p>And files are used for many things? -</p>
               <p>These files are not used, I believe, in buckle-making,</p>
               <p>Nor no other business? - Other business they may; whoever has used these has filed counterfeit silver.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose there are none of these instruments now produced, but what may be used in some other business? - They may be used in small work of silver or gold, or any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Do you look upon these half crowns to be completely counterfeit, or is there any thing remaining to be done upon them in order to pass them off? - No: when I saw them they were finished ready to utter, lying by turns them of that colour.</p>
               <p>In the state they are at present, they don't appear to me to be likely to impose upon any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060066"></xptr> body? - That is by lying by for some time; in a course of circulation they keep a better colour; in order to put a proper colour on them, they use aqua fortis and water, which purges the silver, and brings it to the outside. These are so bad at present nobody would take them; therefore it will be necessary to throw them into aqua fortis first, or rub them they will come to their proper colour directly.</p>
               <p>Were they of a better colour when you first saw them? - Yes; they would have passed then.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ryder. What quantity of counterfeit half crowns were there? - I did not count them.</p>
               <p>You have produced nothing now but what you found in the garret? - I have produced nothing but what I found in the garret; but I have not produced all I found in the garret.</p>

               <p>These things were brought to me the day before by three men, from one Mr. Welbank: they told me Welbank sent his compliments to me, and begged I would melt down some things they had got there; that they had found them a week or a fortnight ago. I told them I was very busy and could not do any thing for them then; there was a bag full of pieces of money. I did not know neither of those three men, but I know Welbank very well; Welbank told me on the 3d of October, that he should be in town soon, and would bring them to me; but as he did not come to town, he gave these men a direction and they brought them to me. I said I was very busy cleaning some buckles, but if they would leave them with me, I would melt them down and sell them to a refiner for them: the next morning when I came to my shop, I swept my board down and sorted them out: I shaked them in some saw dust, they were very dirty and nasty; I looked them over and found some good amongst them; then I weighed them off in different parcels, as much as my scales would hold, and put a pot full into the skillet upon the fire, and as I was doing them these men came in: I had been three or four hours sorting the good from the bad: I did not know there was one good one among them when I turned them out of the bag; they were to call again upon the Saturday afternoon; me and my men were at work about them when they came in.</p>

            : we met Mr. Welbank just at the end of Chiswel-street, we agreed to go to the Black Dog, in Shoreditch; going across Moorfields by the watch-house he kicked something before him with his toe; he said, bless me, here is something of some bulk, we will take it up and see what it is; Mr. Welbank stooped and picked it up: Benfield and Clarke both came up and said halves: we took it up; when we got to the Black Dog we had a pot of beer, and there we examined it: there were some half crowns, and there might be some shillings, and some other little pieces that I know not what the name was: I looked upon it to be good money; not being a judge, then we examined it. I said to Mr. Welbank, I think it will be very proper for us to keep this a while, to see whether it will be advertized, and if he had a mind I would take it home with me: I said tie the bag with a string, and then get a bit of wax and clap your own seal upon the knot: it was done; he said I shall be in town such a time, and if I am not, carry it to Baker, he is an honest man, and will give the worth of it: Welbank not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060067"></xptr> coming, I went to Benfield (he keeps a cook's shop) Clarke was with him, I said I thought it would be proper to carry this bag to Welbank's acquaintance, and see if it was worth any thing: we three carried it there, and there I left it; Mr. Baker said come up into the shop, and I will see what it is; he looked at it, and said there is no other way that I can see for you to know the value of it, but by melting it down and making an assay of it, then I can be a judge of it: some were sticking together and some loose, some little and some big.</p>
               <p>What day was it? - I think it was a Friday; I carried it about the 12th or 13th of October, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When was this first meeting with your friend Mr. Welbank? - I had not seen him before that day for I suppose a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - Number 1, Lane's Court, Cold-Bath-Fields.</p>
               <p>Have you been a long while acquainted with Mr. Welbank? - I have known him some years.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I deal in pens and quills; I was going to Mansfield-street for some quills.</p>
               <p>You was bail, I believe, some day last week, in the court of King's Bench? - I don't know whether I was or not; I might.</p>
               <p>You know whether you was or not? - I was.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Welbank? - Six or seven years.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He goes about the country with hard wares; he is a Somersetshire man.</p>
               <p>Has Welbank been much in town at the end of the year? - I cannot say, I met him promiscuously then.</p>
               <p>Welbank hit something with his foot, that was about the end of September? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it opened? - Directly.</p>
               <p>What quantity of shillings and half crowns did you find? - A good many.</p>
               <p>Were there ten? - More than that.</p>
               <p>Were there seventy? - We did not count them.</p>
               <p>Were there as many as ninety? - I cannot tell; I did not number them.</p>
               <p>Have you seen Welbank at any time since he picked these up? - No; I have not.</p>
               <p>How came you to stay so long before you carried them to Baker? - To see if they would be advertised.</p>
               <p>You did not know Baker before? - I never saw him before, he was a stranger to me; I carried them there by Welbank's directions.</p>
               <p>Do not you think it would have been better to have carried them to that old friend of yours the Solicitor of the Mint? - My old friend! I don't know him.</p>
               <p>You have had some connections with him? - I am but a little judge of money; I tell you the pieces as near as I can, chapter and verse.</p>
               <p>Look upon that, and tell me whether you think that money coined at the Tower? here are, you see, five pieces joined together as cast. - I look upon it to be bad; but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Are you of opinion that it is good money? - No; but there was some silver in it, but not all.</p>
               <p>You looked at that before? - It was by candle light.</p>
               <p>And did not you look at it from the time you picked it up till the time you carried it to Mr. Baker? - We looked at it the very night we picked it up; and then it was tied up with a piece of string, a bit of wax put upon it, and Welbank's seal sealed it; no body saw it as we sealed it up.</p>
               <p>Do you know what is become of Welbank? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you attend here last sessions, when this trial was put off? - I was here, but not called in court.</p>
               <p>Counsel. No; because there was an affidavit made that Welbank was a material witness, and he was out of the way.</p>
               <p>Court. I thought you said, that when you looked at the things found in the bag, that you took it to be money? - We did look upon it to be money, and monies worth.</p>
               <p>Court. But did you look upon it to be all current money? - Yes, we did by candle light.</p>
               <p>But did you look upon these five or six pieces that were together to be current money? - We could not tell, what could we see by candle light.</p>
               <p>Did not this six-pence in the middle of these half-crowns strike you a little? - I am not a judge; if I had, it might have struck me.</p>

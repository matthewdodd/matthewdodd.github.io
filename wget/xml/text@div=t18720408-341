                  </hi>. On 30th October, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was driving a two-horse dray, with two wheels, over London Bridge, coming from the Borough—I was going about two miles an hour—I was sitting on the front plank of the dray, near the kerb—when I passed the crown of the bridge, looking towards King William Street, I saw a man and woman—I do not recognise the man—they were coming from the City towards me—I saw the man make a rush behind the woman with his arm up, likewise he gave her a shove that caused her to fall to the ground, and she came under<lb></lb>neath the dray—he shoved her by the back of the neck; as she dropped her head I saw his hand on the back of her neck, one hand—I pulled my horses up and eased the dray, for the people to take her out—I backed my horses as quick as possible—when she fell she was out of my sight, I could not see where she was—it was gas-light, but it was dark—I was on the western part of the bridge, and they were coming on the same side—the dray did not pass over her, or any part of her, if it had it would have cut her in halves—the dray and the load I had got weighed about two tons—I heard her scream once; that was as they were taking her from the wheel, just as I pulled up—I did not see what became of her afterwards—a police<lb></lb>man came up and took my name and address, but I did not know what he said to me or what I said to him—this is the first time I have been examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 22, Scott Street, North Street, Whitechapel, and am a labourer in the employment of Messrs. Hoare &amp; Co.—on Monday night, 30th October, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I was on the dray with Webber—I was sitting with my knees to the side, looking towards the City—I saw a woman and man coming along by the head of the first horse—I heard something, but what it was I could not hear, but when they came to the shaft I heard her call him a good-for-nothing blackguard, or a good-for-nothing vagabond—he put up his fist and said, "Go on with you," and he shoved her down—she went down the near side of the wheel, and he went down the off side—she fell between the kerb and the wheel, into the road, in front of the wheel, he fell on the pavement, not in the roadway—Webber pulled up at once, as fast as he could—I did not get off the dray—I could not get down either side—persons came up to assist, and I saw the woman taken into a recess of the bridge, I could not say who by—a police<lb></lb>man came up and told my mate to stop—I recognise the prisoner as the man who was with the woman.</p>

On Monday night, 30th October, I was on duty on the Southwark side of London Bridge—I was fetched across towards the London side, and found a woman in a recess and the prisoner standing in front—as soon as I got up I heard the prisoner ask if he should take her to the hospital, and I put the same question—she said "No, let me be taken home, but I can't walk"—the prisoner asked me to get the name and address of the drayman—I was in uniform—I turned to do so, and Mr. Crouch said "There is no fault attached to the drayman, policeman"—I took the name and address of the drayman, and he was allowed to go shortly after—the dray was then stopping in front of the recess, and Webber was sitting on the side—I asked the prisoner if he saw anything of it, he said yes, he was walking alongside—I told him I should require his name and address, and he gave it me as Walter Pettingell, 10, Manor Road, Bermondsey—I also took Crouch's name and address—by this time a cab had driven up to the side and the woman had been placed in it—the prisoner asked me if I had got the particulars—I said "Yes, are you going with her"—he said "Yes, it is my wife"—he got into the cab, and she was then driven to the hospital.</p>

I am the wife of James Nicholls, of Great Grimsby, Lincolnshire—I have known the prisoner since May, 1871, by the name of James Pettingell—he called on me on that occasion with Ellen Garnett, my husband's aunt—she was living at Cleathorpes, about two miles from us—she said the prisoner was her husband—they were living as man and wife—on Tuesday, 31st October, I was at her house—the prisoner came there about 9 o'clock that evening—he then had his beard and moustache shaved off—I had seen him about three weeks before, he then had a beard and mous<lb></lb>tache—Mrs. Garnett and my husband were also present on the 31st—we sat down to supper—Mrs. Garnett asked the prisoner what he had done with her, meaning his wife—he said, "I have left her all right for two or three months"—she said "You have murdered her"—he said "No, I have not; I have left her in Guy's Hospital; she will not trouble me again just yet"—he then said how he had done it; that he had first taken Mrs. Gar<lb></lb>nett to the Cleathorpes station; that he then went back to his house at Cleathorpes, and found his wife there writing a letter; that he asked her to go to London; she refused; that he then went out to get a chopper to split her head open, but he thought he would not do it then; that he got her out to fetch some beer for dinner, and while she was gone he made a key to the door to lock her out; that he then took her to Grimsby, and from Grimsby to Hull; that he wanted her to go to London by the steam<lb></lb>boat, but she was afraid he would put her overboard, and she would not go; that she got away from him, he found he had lost her, and he told a police<lb></lb>man that she had robbed him and got away, close to New Holland; that he then got across the Humber after her soon after 3 o'clock; that he ran about the station, and could not find her, and he jumped into a London train without a ticket; that when the train had got about 100 yards from the station he saw her on the road close by the railway, and he jumped from the train; that he then went back to the station with his wife, and first gave a wrong address to the station-master; that he said "You are detaining the train, you had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187204080027"></xptr>
               <p>better give a right address," and he then gave his right address; that he then took his wife on the road to Brigg, and stayed there all night with her; then he said "When I reached London, in going down Oxford Street, I was determined to get rid of her, and gave her a severe push against an omni<lb></lb>bus, but it did not go over her;" that, going over London Bridge, he saw a great many persons about, and he saw a good chance; that he gave her a severe push, and she reeled underneath a brewer's dray, and he fell also, to make people believe it was an accident, but he took good care to fall the right way; that he then lifted her up on to a seat, got a cab, and took her to Guy's Hospital; that when she came to in the hospital she told the nurse that James had done it, and the nurse said "Hush, hush;" that he took her boots and stockings to her mother's, but her mother was not at home; that he saw her brother, who made a strike at him, and he ran away; that he went into a barber's shop to get his moustache and whiskers shaved off, as he was afraid they would be after him—he said that he ran three miles, and he telegraphed to Mrs. Garnett, at Cleathorpes, to meet him, and that he had got rid of her—I left Cleathorpes a little after 10 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing—the prisoner got up before daylight, and went away between 4 and 5 o'clock—he went to our house at Grimsby, and stopped there for a week in the name of James Smith—when he left he said he was going to Sheffield—I did not believe that, and made a communication to the dock-master—I afterwards read an account of the inquest in the paper, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of that I went to the police-station, and gave information on Satur<lb></lb>day the 13th—I know the prisoner's handwriting—I have seen him write—I believe this letter, signed "E. J. Smith" to be his writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know that Mrs. Garnett was not his wife—I thought she was his wife until this occurred, up to the time I read the death in the paper—it was on 31st October that the conversation took place—Mrs. Garnett had previously been over on Sunday, and told us that a woman had been there who said that Pettingell was her husband; that was the first time I knew it—I understood on 31st October, that he was referring to his wife, but I did not know that it was true that he really had a wife till I saw the inquest in the paper—I can't tell you where Mrs. Garnett is; she is somewhere about here, not far off—the prisoner lived at our house for a week all but a day, after he had made this statement; I and my husband were at Cleathorpes, and he was at our house; I was at Cleathorpes, and my husband slept there at night, I went over in the day to help to get things ready for my husband; my husband was only there at meal times—no one was present at the conversation on the 31st but Mrs. Garnett, the Prisoner, me and my husband—I believe I produced this letter at the Mansion House—I have not got the envelope—I believe I stated before the Magistrate that the prisoner used the words—"I saw there was a good chance"—my deposition was read over to me—I did not notice that those words were omitted—this conversation took place as we were sitting at supper—when Mrs. Garnett asked him where she was, he may have said "It is all right; she is in Guy's Hospital;" I only speak from memory—I have not seen any written statement of mine before coming here to-day; I saw a paper yesterday at Mr. Kirby's office—I did not read it all, only one or two lines, they had put a wrong date—I don't know what the paper was; I daresay it was a copy of my evidence—I saw it lying there—I did not take it up; I took it up afterwards and laid it down again, my husband was there; we merely went there to let Mr. Kirby know that we had come up—I don't know whether my husband saw the paper or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 60, Church Street, Great Grimsby, and am a journeyman tailor—I first saw the prisoner in May, 1871, at my house, he came with my aunt Mrs. Garnett, who introduced him as her husband—they were living at Cleathorpes, about two miles from Grimsby, as man and wife, in the name of Pettingell—on Sunday night 29th October, Mrs. Garnett came to my house and made a statement to me, and on Sunday evening I went over to Cleathorpes and found the house all locked up; I was not able to get in—the prisoner was there—I returned to Grimsby, and the following evening between 7 and 8 o'clock I went to the house again, and found my wife and Mrs. Garnett there—they had gone over in the morning—I believe the prisoner did nothing while he was living with Mrs. Garnett, she had a private income at that time I believe—on the Tuesday evening from 9 o'clock to 9.30 the prisoner came there—my wife and Mrs. Garnett were there; he said he had come from London—I noticed that his moustache and whiskers were shaved off—Mrs. Garnett asked him what he had done with her, meaning his wife—he said he had left her in London at Guy's Hospital; she would not trouble him for two or three months—(<hi rend="italic">The witness detailed in substance the evidence given by his wife</hi>)—The prisoner also said in the course of the conversation that he took good care she should never come back again—next day I asked him if he had done this for the purpose—at first he said "No," afterwards he said "Yes"—he left Clea<lb></lb>thorpes on Wednesday evening, and came over to my house at Grimsby—he remained there till Monday, in the name of James Smith—he then went to Manchester—he said he would write—on 1st December, I received this letter from him enclosing this card:—"Mr. Griffin, at Mr. Braggs, Sum<lb></lb>merfield Cottage, Cheetwood Strangeways, Manchester"—I wrote to him at that address, and afterwards received this letter of 13th December—the envelope has been destroyed—it is in the prisoner's writing—we did not give any information to the police until we heard of the inquest, that was on the 12th, and on the 13th my wife communicated with the police—I was too ill to do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am station-master at the New Holland Station, on the Manchester and Lincolnshire Railway—on Saturday, 28th October, I saw the prisoner there on the platform—the 4.15 train was detained two or three minutes while he was searching the station, and he then went in the train just as it was moving away—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I received a telegram from the next station, and soon after I saw the prisoner back again at my station with a woman—I told him he had, by jumping out of a train in motion, rendered himself liable to punish<lb></lb>ment, and asked him for his ticket—he said he had not got one—I said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187204080029"></xptr>
               <p>that was a second offence, and I told him that, from information given to me, he would be in worse trouble through representing himself as a detective officer—after some time he gave me his name and address, but from his manner in giving it I said I did not believe him—I wrote it down—it was "George Pettington; 174, Albion Street, Grimsby"—after some time he gave me his address as "4, Albion Cottages, Cleathorpes," but still as George Pettington—he remained at the station till half-past seven, or nearly eight o'clock, walking about with the same woman—I spoke to him frequently, and about half-past seven I said to him, "This is the last train to Grimsby or Cleathorpes; if you are going home it is your last chance to-night"—he replied that they were not going to Grimsby or Cleathorpes that night—he repeatedly begged me not to take proceedings against him—a few days after I received this letter from him.

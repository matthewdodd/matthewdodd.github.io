Says he, I have got chips; says I, they are very heavy chips, I fancy they are oaken chips; says he, I must look at them; says I, come, you must go along with me; I took him to a public house and found it to be lead; it was in a basket which is here in court now; the basket was on his shoulder; I and my fellow servant took off the basket and took him into a public house; my fellow servants names are Conoway and Appleyard; we took him to a public house and found the lead; says I, my friend you had better speak the truth, I dare say you have been made a dupe of, there are others in the business as well as you; with that he said, he was hired to carry it across Smithfield, and he was to have 6 d. and a pint of beer; with that we put him in the Compter; we had him in custody from Saturday to Saturday, and he was then discharged before Alderman Harley; we could not find out at that time where the lead came from; since that he has been taken again by the officers belonging to Worship-street and they sent for me, and I have been since and matched the lead to the dwelling, where he took it from; I matched the lead Tuesday last, on the top of the building in Finsbury-square, Moorfields, belonging to Mr. Rolfe, it is a house not finished.</p>

I was present<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200043"></xptr>when the lend was compared; it answered the trunk exceeding well; it was cut off from a gutter; it goes across the middle between the two roofs.</p>

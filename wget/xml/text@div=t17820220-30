             deposed about five weeks ago she missed a cotton gown that was in her bed-chamber, I she don't know whether it was in or upon the drawers; they were not locked; she could not recollect how long it was after she saw it last; the prisoner was a <rs id="t17820220-30-deflabel149" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>John Lane; produced the things, said he had them from the prisoner, three yards and a half, 8th of December, and to the 29th she brought them; I knew her some time using the shop; she told us where she lived truly, and that she was sent with them, and she told her name; she said, she was sent by different apprentices and servants to pawn things; the woman where she lives has thirteen apprentices and servants; I know the prisoner was the woman that pawned them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dimn another pawnbroker, produced two yards of linen she pawned the 12th of December.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clarkson deposed to the gown; said she knew by the make it was her property; as to the linen there was no mark on the shift bodies, said it was her cloth indeed.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear with certainty that new linen is your's without any mark to it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any mark to know it by? - I know it by the quality of the cloth I have at home; I would have brought the other cloth to have shown you; I would not swear to it if I was not certain; I know it by her own confession.</p>
               <p>Do you know the gown any better than you do the cloth? - I very well know that I know them both; I have no particular mark on it.</p>
               <p>Do you swear to the gown as you do to the cloth because she confessed it; should you know the gown if you saw it in a different place? - Yes; I should know it by the make; no promise was made to her in my hearing after I had been to the justice; I told her I would not hurt her before the constable came.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence, but said the prosecutrix had promised her forgiveness to confess.</p>

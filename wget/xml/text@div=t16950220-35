Mrs. Mottershed swore, that the Prisoner came to her House with another man, one B - and told her that she was a Clipper, and would swear it, giving her threatening language, that she should burn as Fire burned. But before this, the Prisoner asked her to lend him some money, for that he was in Law; but she refusing it, he caused her to open her Trunks, wherein was the Watch and the money. He pretended to search for Clippings and clipt money, but found none; the Watch and the money lying upon the Bed, whilst Mrs. Mottershed went into another Room to dress herself (to go to Newgate as she thought) being in great terror, did not mind the Prisoners motions, upon a sudden the Prisoner, and the other man B - (not yet taken) went down stairs, and away they went with the Watch and money.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner alledged that he was maliciously prosecuted, and that Mrs. Mottershed went by several Names, viz. Tomson, Sturgess, and Mottershed, and that all her Neighbours knew her to be a Clipper; but that was no such thing, for she was a person of known integrity.

               conspiring against the said Mr. Powell and his Wife, for falsly charging them with the Crime of High-Treason, thereby to bring them to final death
            </rs>. The Evidence for the King first swore, that the Prisoner said he had been with the Parliament to get a Warrant or Order for to take up the Clippers, and Mr. Powell declared that the Prisoner came to him to his house, and told him that there were two men at a Coffee-house hard by, had a Warrant of High-Treason against him, and he knowing him to be his Friend, and a worthy Person, he came to let him know of it to secure himself; so he and Coppinger went out to a Tavern, and just as they were entring in at the Door, comes Brandon and Smith up to him, and in a rude manner accosted him, telling him that they had a Warrant against him and his Wife for High-Treason; and immediately seized him, and took him into the Tavern, and threatened him in a strange manner, with horrid Oaths and Execrations, that he and his wife were Clippers, and that he should be hang'd, and his Wife burnt; at which Mr. Powel was much surprised; and they went and fetch'd Mrs. Powel, and then removed from the Tavern to an Alehouse, where they said that they would swear it downright against them; upon which Mrs. Powell was very much affrighted, and fell into a Swoon; so Coppinger came to her, and bid her not to be troubled, pretending to be a Friend, and that it was nothing but a Trick, and that the two men were Rogues, and only wanted money; so they at last compounded the matter, and took 30 Guineas, which Mrs. Powell had fetch'd from home, unknown to her Husband; so away they went. They came with a Warrant, but without any Constable; and it appeared upon the whole matter, that the Prisoner Coppinger was privy to the whole Design, and joined with the said Brandon and Smyth in carrying on the Villany, and that he was at the Horse-Shoe Tavern in Drury-Lane just after they had received the money. Mr. Powel did not know the said Brandon nor Smith, nor had any great Acquaintance with Coppinger. Other Evidence proved that he had part of the Guineas to his Share: And that he made his humble Application to Mr. Powel (by Letters), That if he would pardon him, and be so merciful to him as to make him an Evidence against the said Brandon and Smith, he would upon Oath discover the Design, for that the said Brandon nor Smith did ever know the said Mr. Powel. He could not urge any thing material in his Defence; and the Court being very well satisfied of the Heinousness of the Fact, and of the Innocence of Mr. Powel and Madam Powel, being Persons of an unblemish'd Reputation; this therefore was duly considered by both Court and Jury; So he was found <rs id="t16950220-35-verdict146" type="verdictDescription">

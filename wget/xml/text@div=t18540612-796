                  </hi>. I am a chimney sweeper, of Streatham, in Surrey. In July, 1852, I had a roan gelding pony; I saw it safe between 10 and 11 o'clock at night, and missed it about a quarter to 4 next morning, when I went to the stable to put it to work, and the harness also—the pony was worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me; I was shown it by the policeman on the 15th, and also the harness, which was in another place—I identified them both.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chimney sweeper, of Brixton. On 7th July, 1852, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at the top of Brixton-hill, coming from Streatham towards London with a pony and harness—I took particular notice of him, as I knew it was Mr. Harriss's pony that he was leading, and I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you see the prisoner again, supposing that you are right in him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At Hammersmith, about three weeks ago—Tapping, the policeman, sent for me to see him; he came to my house—I knew I was coming to see if he was the man—I saw him in the cell, with another man, who I did not take particular notice of—he was called out, and I was asked if he was the man—I could tell him from a hundred, by his features—I had never seen him before 7th July, but I took particular notice of him, seeing him so early in the morning with my friend's pony—it was not Tapping who asked me if he was the man, it was some other constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fruiterer, of No. 25, Cambridge-road, Mile-end. On 8th July, 1852, I was near the Salmon and Ball, Bethnal-green, with a friend, we met the prisoner with a pony and harness, my friend asked him if the pony was for sale—he said, "Yes," and that he had a colt at Hackney-marsh, and had been to order some new harness; that he had quite done with the old pony, and if I did not buy it he was going to have it killed—I bought it for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was a very old roan gelding pony, and very lame and poor; I sold it next day, or the day following for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Mr. Rickman, who was taken up, and taken to the police court—I went as a witness for him, and he was set at liberty—the pony was in the green-yard, and Mr. Harriss paid the expenses and had it-—I have not the least</p>

               <p>doubt that the prisoner is the man; I had a slight doubt at Hammersmith, till I saw him walk out in the yard—I had never seen him before 8th July, and I did not see him again till I saw him at Hammersmith—I went to the police court to see him; the turnkey called him out of the cell, I looked at Him very hard, and I could scarcely recognise him, and should not like to swear to him, but when I saw him walk I recognised him immediately—I could scarcely see him when he first came out of the cell, but when I saw him in the light of the yard I recognised him—I have no doubt he is the man, but he has had his whiskers cut off since he was at Hammersmith.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, of No. 39, Curtain-road, Shoreditch. About 13th or 14th July, 1852, the prisoner, whom I did not know before, came to my place, with two men, one named King, I think, and the other named Harman—he had a pony, a cart, and a set of harness—he offered to sell them to me—I would not buy them, but I lent him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them till the morning, and he went away—I was taken into custody next day for having the cart, on suspicion of stealing it—Harriss claimed the harness at the same time, and I gave it up to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you at all in doubt about the prisoner when you first saw him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the least—it is a long time ago—I saw him get out of the van at Hammersmith, and recognized him, and they afterwards pointed him out to me, not knowing that I had seen him; I had not any doubt at first—there is nothing peculiar about him, but I was as close to him as I am now; I could recognize him among a great many—he had a beard when I bought the cart of him, and also when he got out of the van at Hammersmith.</p>

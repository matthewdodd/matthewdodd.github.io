                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live in Westminster-road. On 7th July, the prisoners came in about a quarter past 10 o'clock at night; Gilchrist asked for two cubas—the girl was about to serve them, and I went forward and served them myself—the cubas were given them—they bit the ends off, and Gilchrist tendered a counterfeit 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said it was bad, and each of them offered to pay in good money—I asked Gilchrist it he had any more of them, and he made no answer—a friend of mine was there, I called him, and sent for an officer; and while I was waiting for him, I found the prisoners were fumbling in their pockets—they were standing on some straw in the shop, which had not been there ten minutes—the floor had been washed, and no one had been there from the time the straw was put down till the prisoners came—when the officer came, I examined the straw where Gilchrist had been standing, and found one sixpence, which I gave the officer—I saw Mr. Rigg find two more sixpences—the prisoners said they knew nothing about them—I marked the sixpence that was offered to me and gave it to the officer.</p>

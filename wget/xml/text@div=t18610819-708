                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery—the prisoner was either a gunner or a driver—I knew Murphy, the deceased, by sight—he was a sergeant in the Royal Artillery stationed in Woolwich—on 8th July, I was on duty with the picket in the streets of Woolwich, and saw the prisoner in the streets about a quarter-past 10 at night—I asked him if he. was on leave; he said that he was—I asked him to show it to me—he said, "So I shall." and turned round and used very bad expressions, and ran away from me—I followed him about half a mile and caught him—he said, "I will rip your guts open if you come neat me'—I caught hold of him and saw that he had nothing in his hand—there was a gas light close to me—I took him, handed him over to the picket, and he was taken to the guard-room, where the deceased, Sergeant Murphy, was on duty—he was sitting here (<hi rend="italic">pointing out the spot on a plan</hi>)—I told the prisoner to step forward and give his name to the sergeant of the picket—he said to the sergeant, "You well know my name, you got me three months at a Court Martial"—Sergeant Murphy asked him his name, and I told him to stand forward and give his name—Sergernt Ashton came in that time and asked the prisoner his name, but I did not pay particular attention to what he said because I was frightened—on that I left—I came back in about a quarter of an hour or more and asked Sergeant Murphy for the report of the men's names who were confined that night—Sergeant Murphy was still sitting at the table writing, and while he was in the act of writing the names, the prisoner came behind him and hit him with a bar of iron—I had not seen the prisoner come across, my attention was first attracted by the sound of the blow—my head was down on the table, lying on my arm—I turned round and assisted the sergeant of the guard and some of the picket to hold the man on the ground—I saw the sergeant of the guard take this bar of iron (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the prisoner—while the prisoner was struggling, he said that he had had it <hi rend="italic">long</hi> in for him—that is the way be pronounced the words—he was secured—I saw that the deceased was bleeding from the head at the back of his ear, and ran for a doctor—the prisoner was the worse for drink—he must have known what he was about, because he talked very sensibly to me when I took hold of him the last time—this iron bar was usually kept in the coal box for stirring the fire up—I cannot say whether it was there before he struck the blow—there are two platforms in the guard-room; the prisoner was sent to this one to the bed, I saw him walk over to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corporal in the Royal Marines at Woolwich—on this Monday I was on guard in the Arsenal in the guard-room—the prisoner was brought in about half—past 10 by the military police and the picket—the deceased was sitting at a table, and I was reading a newspaper by his side—he asked the prisoner his name—the prisoner said, "You know my name well enough, you gave me three months by Court Martial some time ago"—he asked him a second time, and the prisoner said, "Go to hell"—Sergeant Ashton came in, and the sergeant said, "He will not give his name;" but he gave it to Sergeant Ashton very quietly—Sergeant Ashton ordered him to the farther end of the guard-room—there was a small bed there and he sat down, and I heard no more of him for twenty minutes or half an hour—I was then sitting by the sergeant reading a newspaper, and he was writing, when I heard the sound of a blow—I turned my head round, and the deceased called out "Oh!" and staggered—I caught him in my arms—he was bleeding from the back of the right ear—the prisoner was standing behind, and the sergeant of the guard held him in his arms and took the bar away from him—I did not hear the prisoner say anything—I should think he was sensible enough to know what he was doing—he was taken away and secured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of marines, stationed at Woolwich—on 8th July I was sergeant of the guard, and sat on the same stool with the late Sergeant Murphy—I remember the prisoner being brought in by the picket—as a soldier he was drunk; he must be either drunk or sober, and as a soldier he was drunk; but he knew perfectly well what he was doing—he was charged by McGranary with being drunk and absent—the deceased asked him what his name was—he said, "Oh, by Jesus, you know my name; you got me three months some time ago; I lay a month in the guard-room, and got two months by sentence of Court Martial"—the sergeant asked a second time what his name was, and he said, "Oh, go to hell!"—at that time Sergeant Ashton came in, and went up to him and asked him his name—he was quite civil to him—he said, "I will tell you my name, Sergeant Ashton"—he told him his name, and Sergeant Ashton ordered him to go over to the place where the prisoners are kept, and he did so—he was quiet for twenty or twenty—five minutes—I remained in the guard-room, still sitting on the same stool with the sergeant; and about that time I got up, turned to my right, and went towards the guard-bed of the guard, not the prisoner's guard-bed—I turned to my right again coming back, and saw the prisoner about two paces from the sergeant, in the act of walking up to him—his eye was fixed upon him—he had this crow—bar in his right hand, close to his right leg, as if he was hiding it—I instantly rushed to the place where the prisoner was, but before I got there he had struck the sergeant a blow with this crow.</p>

               <p>bar at the back of the head, just behind the right ear—I caught bold of the prisoner and took the weapon from him, had him removed, and instantly sent for a doctor, who dressed his wound, and he was taken to the hospital—the prisoner was also taken away—this bar was usually kept in the coal-box, with the poker, shovel, and fire-irons—I am able to say that it was there that night—I saw it shortly before this took place; shortly before the prisoner was brought in by the military police.</p>

I am in the Royal Artillery at Woolwich on the night of 8th July I went on duty in the guard-room about half-past 10 o'clock—I heard a noise, and saw the prisoner leaning over Sergeant Murphy and using threatening language—I cannot say exactly what he said, for I did not take particular notice—I asked Sergeant Murphy what was the matter—he said that the prisoner refused to give his name—I went to the prisoner and asked him what he meant by such conduct—he said he knew me perfectly well, and would do anything I ordered him to do; then turning rouud, facing Sergeant Murphy, he said, "I have had three months for throwing a quart pot at his head, and I will pay him off yet before I go to India"—he was under the influence of drink, but was steady, and quite aware of what he was doing—he was drunk in a military sense—I ordered him to lie down on the guard-bed and keep his proper place; he did so, and I left the guard-room—I returned in about half an hour and saw Sergeant Murphy carried out on a stretcher, apparently dead—the prisoner was brought out, handcuffed immediately after, and requested to see me—I saw him, and he said, "I wish to give myself up as a deserter from the 11th Foot—I told him he would have to answer the charge of assaulting Sergeant Murphy before that could be considered—he then said, "I wish I had killed him right out"—I ordered him to the guard-room.</p>

I lost a shawl on Thursday, the 16th of February, it was in the shop on the counter, on that day, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner came in with a child in her arms, she asked the price of some silk shawls that were in the window; I told her the price, and shewed her several others; I asked her thirty shillings for a shawl; she bid me twenty. I had a great suspision of her; I cleared the counter, and while she was in the shop a person came into the shop to change a shawl for another; she left the shawl with me; I folded it up, and left it on the counter until she came for it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the shawl you charge her with stealing - A. Yes. I missed that shawl after the prisoner was gone; the prisoner bought a gown, and left three shillings on it. The prisoner called on the Thursday following, and paid the remainder of the money for the gown, and took it way; I desired my wife to watch her; I intended to take her up on the Sunday following; I did not do it. She came again on the Tuesday, I took her up then. I saw my shawl again on Thursday after, at the pawnbrokers.</p>

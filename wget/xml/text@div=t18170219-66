On that day, about two o'clock in the afternoon, a woman called on her, and took her to the Bank of England. We had some apartments to let, and a bill in the window. About a quarter of an hour after she was gone, a man and woman knocked at the door. I have seen the man since-it is the prisoner Hallard. I saw him at Hatton-garden. He came with the woman. The woman asked me if there was not a room to let; I told her there was. She asked me which it was; I told her the front parlour, and opened the parlour door, and they both went in. While we were in the parlour, I stood against the parlour door; I had shut the street - door - A second knock came at the door, and while I went to open it, the people who were in the parlour shut the parlour door close I found the prisoner Handley at the street - door as soon as I opened it-he leaned his arm against the door-post, and said, "Pray is Susan at home?" (There had been a person of that name lodging at our house). I told him Susan had left. He said, "Left!" and seemed much surprised. He said, "How long?" I told him about a week, and gave him her address. He rushed into the house very quick, and went down stairs into the kitchen - He said nothing more then. The kitchen is under ground-the staircase may be seen from the door. I followed him. When I got down stairs, he was resting his elbows on the mantle-piece, and said, he wished to know the particulars of Susan's leaving; I told him it proceeded from a quarrel between Mrs. Bright and herself, and that she had left. At that moment, I heard a crash up stairs, like the breaking of a door. I left the kitchen, and went up one pair of stairs, above the parlour. When I got up, I saw the the prisoner, Hallard, breaking Mrs. Bright's bed-room door open. I said, "For God's sake, what are you doing?" he said, "I am looking for the woman that I brought in." I said, "The woman you brought in is now sitting in the front parlour." (I had seen her as I went up stairs-the parlour door was then open) I told him so. The prisoner, Handley, followed me directly out of the kitchen, and stood close against my left arm. He did not touch me then. The prisoner, Handley, looked up at Hallard, and asked me, whether I knew him (meaning the man who was breaking open the door); I said, "No, I do not." He said, "Did you ever see him before?" - I said, "No, not to my knowledge; he is a total stranger to me." He then looked in my face, and said, "Do you know me?" I said, "No, I do not; you are likewise a stranger to me." He took me with a grasp round the waist, and took me down into the kitchen; as soon as he got me into the kitchen, he put his hands into the breast of his coat, and pulled out a double-barrelled pistol, and said, "Now you know what I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190033"></xptr>come for." He then went to a drawer in the kitchen, and and took out a piece of canvas, and tied it about my mouth - He tied it behind. I said, "For God's sake, do not take my life!"-He said, "I will not, at present." he desired me to give him my hand, and said, "By the word of a man-by G-d I will not, at present." He then took a large piece of dyed cotton, and doubled it, and tied it over the canvas on my mouth, so as to prevent my calling out. I was not able to call out - He tied it most violently tight. I put up my hand to relieve my mouth, and he said, "If you lift up your hand against me, I will give you the contents of this pistol down your mouth;" - He had the pistol in his hand. After this, he took a piece of printed cotton, and tied my hands together, and said, "Now you must consent to every thing." There was a turn-up bedstead in the place; he took the bed down, and said, "You must consent to go and he smothered in that bed." He then said, "But stop a moment!" and took the cotton off my hands. He had a leather strap, and strapped my hands behind my back, and brought it round my waist-(it was like a gentleman's brace) - He took me to the bed, and laid me on it. He opened the kitchen door, and called out,"Tom, have you got a rope?" I did not hear any answer; he shut the kitchen door, and said it was all right. He went to the table and loaded the pistol; he put two small bullets into it, and put some powder into the pan - He took the powder out of a little piece of paper, which he took out of his waistcoat pocket. He came, and rested his right arm on my left shoulder - He had the pistol in his hand-and said, "Now you must make up your mind to take the contents of this as soon as you are able to receive it; it will be better for you; for when you are dead you can swear to nobody, because I should be sorry if you should be brought into any blame." He then said, "But I have a few more questions to ask you."-There was a small chest of drawers by the bed-side; he put his finger to the ring of the drawer and pulled it, but found it locked, he said, "It does not matter-when you are no more, we shall soon know the contents." At that moment, a double knock came at the street-door - I heard it-at this time I was on the bed. There were two double knocks. The person knocked twice, and came down to the kitchen. The door fastens inside; there was a handle outside-nobody could enter from the outside, if it had not been left open-it was a gentleman; he came down. The prisoner, Handley, was in the kitchen, standing at the door; he left me the moment that he heard the knock at the street - door - He got up from the bed; he went and stood with his feet against the door, to prevent it from opening-the gentleman tried to push the door open, and the prisoner said,"You cannot come in." A voice from the outside, desired to come in, and the prisoner, Handley, said, "Nobody shall come in here." The person from the outside forced the door open with his umbrella-it turned out to be a gentleman. The kitchen door came open a little way; the prisoner started from the bedside, looked at the person a little while, and made a start and got off-it was Mr. Buttery. When I came to myself, I went over the house, and saw no more of the prisoners. The other prisoner, and the woman, were gone away. I went up stairs in about ten minutes. I do not know how I was untied, I was in such a fright - I said, "My life! my life!" to the gentleman; meaning he had saved my life. He went to alarm the neighbours. Mr. Best came in. I found Mrs. Bright's drawers were all emptied, and put on the bed-the property was gone; it was very soon after the prisoner went out. Mrs. Bright returned about four o'clock. I did not tell her what had passed for sometime, I was so far gone in fright-it was near six o'clock before I could tell her, what had happened. - She came back with one of the lodgers of the house. Mr. Best went to the Police-Office with her before I told her the particulars, I suppose. Mr. Best's wife was in the house with me when Mrs. Bright came back-she came into the house directly after her husband had seen the state of Mrs. Bright's bed-room, and stopped with me. Mr. Best brought her, and she remained with me till Mrs. Bright came back. I did not see either of the prisoners till about a week after, when I went to the Police Office, and saw the prisoner, Hallard, in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. On the solemn oath you have taken, have you any doubt that the prisoners are the two men - A. I have not the least doubt of it. I had a full view of them at the door, when they were breaking it open. None of the property has been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. They came in about a quarter past two o'clock. I should have gone into the parlour to Hallard, and the woman, if the other man had not gone into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. On the solemn oath you have taken, do you not let rooms out for half an hour, or an hour - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mrs. Bright - A. Not that I know of. I have lived with her nine months.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Does she permit men and women to come to the house - A. She does.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man and woman, when they came, ask for a room for half an hour. - A. No; they asked if there was not a room to let for a lodging; I did not ask them for a shilling. There was a girl, who was gone with Mrs. Bright, she is one of this description. Mrs. Bright has got a son; he does not live with her. I never was in a Court of Justice before. We had a person named Susan living with Mrs. Bright once. I gave a description of the prisoners to Limbric and Reid; Mrs. Bright's son took it down on paper from my mouth. I gave the description, for the purpose of its being given to the officer-it was read over to me, before it was given to them. Reid, the officer, brought Hallard up to me at the office; he was hand-cuffed; he was by himself. This was the first time that I saw him, after he left Mrs. Bright's house; I said he was one of the men; I knew him by his face. I saw Handley in Newgate, and knew him as soon as I saw him; he had the very same coat on that he wore on the day of the robbery. I was alarmed, but not insensible - He did not cover my eyes; I am sure that he put two bullets into the pistols; he put the powder into the pan. I have heard that there is a reward. Buttery did not appear at Hatton-garden. I told where he lived.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In the course of your examination, you have said, that the man loaded the pistol with powder and bullets - A.He put one bullet into each barrel; he put the powder into the pan; he did not put any powder in the barrels.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR BRIGHT. I am a widow. I live at No. 4, Northampton-street, Battle-bridge, St. Pancras. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190034"></xptr>8th of January, I went to the Bank. I left my house a little before two, and returned about four o'clock. I had left every thing safely locked up when I went out; I left Martha Green in the house by herself. I found my door and cupboard locks broken, as well as my drawers; the drawers were left empty on my bed; I missed the articles mentioned in the indictment. I am sure they were all safe when I went out. When I came home, I found a picklock-key in my room-door, and a crow-bar on my bed. Martha Green was all but dead in the kitchen; she was speechless. I found a handkerchief on the bed in the kitchen. Green could not tell me any thing for some time when I came home. I found Best and his wife in the house; they live next door. Directly that he had shewn me the state of my place, I sent him to the Police-Office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Best was the first that told me that the house was robbed. I have known Buttery for five years; he used to come to see my lodgers; the magistrate told us to find him - We found out where he lived; it was at No. 7; Brill-row, Somers-town, he is a music-master. I have paid for his subpoena.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live next door to the prosecutrix. On the day of the robbery, I saw a man looking at her house, about two o'clock; it was the prisoner Hallard, he had a woman with him; they were walking on the opposite side of the way, as if they were looking for a lodging; I took notice of them, as I had a lodging myself to let. I went on, and when I came back, I saw them coming out of No. 4, which is Mrs. Bright's house; it was the same two persons. I am quite positive that the prisoner, Hallard, is the man. I saw him at Hatton-garden, about a week after. About half an hour after, I heard the house had been broken open; I went in and saw the servant there. My wife afterwards went into the house, and remained there two hours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is a lodging-house. I will swear that Hallard is the man; I saw him quite sufficient to swear to him. He had a long, loose, dirty great coat on. I returned in about twenty minutes - He had no bundle when he came out. They walked quite leisurely towards Edward-street. I did not see a bundle with either of them. The woman had a great shawl on - She might have many things concealed under it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long would it take to break open thirteen locks - A. You could break open more than thirteen in twenty minutes. Hallard was very stout when he came out, A gentleman called me into the house; I found Green in a very bad state-after a little while, she told me what had happened, as well as she could. She said, that the man had tied her mouth and hands, and fastened her to the bed. When Mrs. Bright came home I went to the Office.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you first saw Green, in what situation did she appear - A. She was very ill, trembling and shaking; she appeared to be very frightened; I had seen her before. When I first saw her, a gentleman was with her. A person, who had put on the appearance of fright would not appear as she did. I really think that she was frightened. The lock of the drawer was burst open, apparently by the foot, it was wrenched. Green said, that there had been a party in the parlour.</p>

            . I live opposite to Mrs. Bright. I saw a man very much like the prisoner, Hallard, coming out of her house on the same day that the robbery happened-it was about an hour before I heard of the robbery. I saw him go in, and about an hour before the alarm was raised, I saw a man come out, but do not think it was the same man that I saw go in. I saw Hallard at Hatton-garden, about ten days afterwards - He is the man that I saw go into the house - He is very much like him; he is the same man. I will not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The man that I saw go in had a blue coat on; I think I saw him go in about two o'clock, or a quarter after; the servant let him in - I afterwards saw her come out, very much alarmed, and go into Best's house next door. The man that came out had a pint pot in his hand; he did not appear so tall as the man who went in; there was a woman went in with the man; the woman went in, and the man followed her; she shut the door.</p>

I went to look after Buttery; he lives at Somers'-town; the servant directed me there; I could not see him, I left a notice with his wife, for him to come here to-day. I went after him last night; they gave me his name. After Best came to the Office, I examined Bright's house, and found it broken open. They said there was a gentleman there; I afterwards learned his name. Green said, a gentleman, who lives at Somers-town, was in the house.</p>

             re-examined. I found the bed-room door broken open, and a skeleton key forced into the lock; I could not get it out. The drawers were broken open and emptied; it appeared to me to have been done with an iron crow; I found one in the room, and compared it with the marks on the drawers-it agreed with them. It would take great strength to break open the door. Green gave me a piece of leather, a piece of canvas, and a piece of dyed cotton. On the 13th of January, I apprehended Hallard, in consequence of the description I received from Green. I took him at a public-house. He asked me if it was concerning a warrant; I told him it was not. He asked what; I told him, if the people could not identify him, I would let him go. As soon as he got to the door of the Office, he ran away. I took him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was present at all the examinations. Green gave Buttery's address; she said she did not know his name. I went to look for him last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Rainsford expressly order that he should be brought before him - A. He did; the examination was adjourned, in order to have him produced. I never could find him out. I did not apply to Green to go with me. I thought the man would come forward.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mr. Rainsford directed that the man should be brought forward, why did you not enquire for him - A. I did last night. I have had a great deal of trouble with him to bring him forward. I never attempted to find him till last night.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR BRIGHT re-examined. Limbric never knew where Buttery lived till I went to take out the subpoena, which was on Saturday. I have found him out within the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190035"></xptr>last fortnight; I did not know where he lived till then - A Mrs. Hamilton told me. It was after all the examinations were over.</p>
               <p>MARTHA GREEN re-examined. I knew Buttery's name about a fortnight afterward. His name was not given to the magistrate; it was not known till after the prisoners were committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, that you knew where the person lived - A. I said, I would make every inquiry. I said, I saw him go into a house at Somer's-town. I did not know his name.</p>

             re-examined. I attended all the examinations. Green said she had seen him go into a house in Somers-town, and would try to find him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say she knew where he lived - A. No; she said she had seen him go into a house, but did not know where he lived.</p>

             re-examined. Did you not tell the magistrate that Buttery was a married man, and it would hurt his family if he came forward - A. He asked me if he was a married man; I said I did not know. I neither knew his name, nor where he lived.</p>

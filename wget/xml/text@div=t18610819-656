On 9th July, frominformation I received, I went with my son and Inspector Fife, and Sergeant Elliott, to Featherstone-street—I saw the prisoner coming towards me, pushing a costermonger's barrow—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Well, Dick</hi>, I have received instructions from the solicitor of the Mint to look after you, you are suspected strongly of dealing largely in counterfeit coin; what have you about you?"—he said, "Nothing, Mr. Brannan"—he was then seized by Sergeant Brannan, and I took this coil of rope off the handle of his barrow, undid it, and found in it nine counterfeit shillings, and two florins, separately wrapped up in paper—I said, "What do you call this?" he said, "Oh, my God, I am done!"—I said, "It appears the imprisonment you have had has not had the desired effect; you might have got a living at your work"—he said, "There is no living to be got at it, Mr. Brannan; I cannot help it"—I said, "You must come back with us to your lodgings, we are going to search them"—he occompanied us to a house in Feather-stone-court, and on entering the room he said, "Mr. Brannan, I will save you the trouble," and went to a cupboard and took out a packet containing three counterfeit florins, which he put into the hands of Sergeant Elliott—we took him to the station, and on the charge being read to him he said, "I am guilty.".</p>

I saw my wife give a shilling back into her band—I looked at it, and said it was very bad—I gave it back to the female prisoner, and she left the shop—when she left I taw a man standing opposite—I could not swear it was the male prisoner, but the female crossed over the road to him—I went to the corner, and there she was talking to him, and she passed something to him, but what it was I could not say—they then walked on up Chiswell-street—I followed them—when they got to the corner of Milton-street, I saw the female standing against a linen-draper's window, opposite the Paul public house—I lost sight of the man for I moment—after that I saw the man come and join her, and they went into he Paul public house—I went into the house in the course of a minute, and found them both there—no one else was there but the street keeper, who stood inside the door—I said something to the barman about bad money, but I do not know what—I said, "The woman has been in my shop and offered a bad shilling"—the barman said he had bent a shilling that the male pri<lb></lb>soner gave him, and he had given it back to him—I said, "Was it bent before? I should know the one my wife bent"—the female prisoner said she was sure she did not know it was a bad one when she came into my shop, and that she had thrown away the one that my wife bad bent.</p>

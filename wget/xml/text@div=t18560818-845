I saw the prisoner with this bundle with her—she saw I was noticing her, and she went into a public house—I told a person to tell her to come out, I wanted to speak to her—she would not, and I called her myself, and asked her what she had in her apron—she showed me, and it was these two pairs of boots and two gowns—I asked her how she came by them—she said one</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Hearne; he is a fire wood cutter, and lives at No. 8, Garden-place. I went to bed last Sunday night at 10 o'clock—I had fastened the doors, and bolted them—my husband generally gets up at 4 o'clock in the morning, and the policeman called him as usual, the next morning, but he did not want to get up so early that morning—he answered the policeman and went to bed, and when he got up at half past 5 o'clock, the street door was open—he went down and missed his boots—he called me—I went down and found the back door was open, and then two frocks and the boots were gone—I went to the station, and the prisoner was there—she said to my face that these were her things—I said, "They are mine, and I can prove it"—when we were before the Magistrate, she said she had them given her—I am quite sure she said to my face that they were her's—they are my husband's property.</p>

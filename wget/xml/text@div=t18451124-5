                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he not, in July or the beginning of Aug., leave between 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with you at half-past ten o'clock at night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He positively did not—I was out of town on the 2nd of Aug.—he never left asmuch as 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me; I do not think more than 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I cannot speak positively to the sum—he has paid me twice, and there may have been 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the twice, but, to the best of my belief, I should say not on one occasion—I should not like to swear it, because I may be mistaken, but, to the best of my belief, he never has—when he left the money with me the servants called me down, saying Mr. Jones wished to speak to me—I went down into the counting-house to him—he furnished me with no voucher with it—I took the money, and placed it on the dressing-table in the bed-room till Mr. Mil<lb></lb>lington came home, and he took it down in the morning, saying he would take it down and book it—I did not know on whose account the money was paid—I did not about the same period receive from the servant girl 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which the prisoner had left—I have received money from a servant that has left me—it may be six months ago, or more—I have very likely done so on more than one occasion—I never received to the amount of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the servant—I have no recollection of only trifling sums, such as 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I handed them over to my husband.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever made use of any of the money on his account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I handed it over to my husband as I got it—I counted it, wrapped it again in paper, and gave it over to my husband—I received no account from the prisoner what the money applied to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever received any money paid in that way from any servant you have now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the servant I did receive money from left on the 2nd of Aug.—I can swear the two occasions I have spoken of were before the 13th of Sept.—the servant who called me down to receive the money went out of town on the 2nd of Aug. with my children, and never came to town again for five weeks—I have never seen the prisoner, or re<lb></lb>ceived money from him, since the 2nd of Aug. last—he told me at one time that he should have brought more money, but a man wished to pay him in coppers, and he did not wish to bring them—he did not say from whom he received the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MILLINGTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> If the prisoner will state a date I can refer to my books, and see how that money was accounted for, but no date was specified by him—I always took the money my wife gave me, and put it into my desk till the prisoner accounted for it—it has often been the case that I have received money from my wife when I came up to bed, and from the clerk also—I took the prisoner again, after discharging him, from the pleading of his wife and family, and being a good servant—I have no</p>

               <p>amount entered to him that is not accounted for to some party—if I had an account doubtful I should know immediately—I am sure I have not received either of these accounts—I have no lumping payments unaccounted for—when I have received money from him over night, for which he accounted next day, he had his book to refer to, which I gave him on purpose—I have it here—there are hardly any entries in it after a certain date—that book ought to prove the monies he received, but he then spoke from memory—the book did not assist him—he used to keep bits and dabs of paper instead of using the book, as he ought to have done.</p>

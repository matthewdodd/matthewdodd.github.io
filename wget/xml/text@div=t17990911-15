I did not offer her any thing, I had nothing else but a seven-shilling-piece, and a shilling in silver; I had seen my money at the last place I had paid my reckoning, at Bethnal-green, and had had no conversation with any other woman. I was sober enough to know all that passed, I had been drinking some time, but I do not drink much; I was fresh, and knew every thing; I drank nothing but porter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give it me instead of a sixpence? - A. No, I gave you no money at all.</p>
               <p>- BRIGGS sworn. - I am constable of Cheap Ward: I produce a half-guinea.</p>
               <p>Ash. It is a crooked half-guinea, and a pale one; there is a small mark, it is bent up on both sides, and there is a head, I did not notice it any further; it was an old one, and I cannot recollect whether it was a spade half-guinea or not, I had it in change.</p>
               <p>Briggs. I took it out of the prisoner's hand in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110029"></xptr>watch-house; Ash charged her with robbing him of half-a-guinea; she said, Ash had given it to her for sixpence, there was nothing freer than a gift, and she would keep it; I have kept it ever since; he told the same story the next day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I gave the half-guinea into the watch-house, he gave it me instead of a sixpence; between Queen-street and Bow-lane, two men met me, and asked me where I was going; one asked me to stop a-bit, as he was going to his friend to wish him good night, and he would come to me again; I stopped, and he came back; I am an unfortunate woman; I mean the prosecutor; we went down on the left hand side of Bow-lane; I stopped there, and asked him if he would give me a compliment, and he gave me, as I thought, a sixpence; I asked if it was all he was going to give me, as that would not buy me a breakfast; says he, I will give you a shilling, and he said, out of mistake I gave you half-a-guinea, and I said, nothing is freer than a gift; the man says, he was robbed in Old Change, I was taken in Bow-lane. <rs id="t17990911-15-verdict82" type="verdictDescription">

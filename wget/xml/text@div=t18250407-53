            . I am the prosecutor's brother. A person gave me information, and pointed out which way the thief was gone - I ran and came up with the prisoner, with the flat in his hand, about one hundred yards off - he said I should have lost it if it had not been for him. It could not have fallen from the waggon - it was a dirty day and the flat was quite clean.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might it not have fallen on the pavement? A. The waggon was not near the pavement; he was standing still when I took him - the waggon stopped when the alarm was given.</p>

               <p>JURY to PALMER. Q. Was your attention directed to any one person? A. A gentleman said,</p>
               <p>"A man has taken your flat, and gone towards Pilgrim-street;" and I found him at the corner of the gateway leading to Pilgrim-street.</p>

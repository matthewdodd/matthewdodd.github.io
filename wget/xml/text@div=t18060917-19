               <p>Q. Who do you hire it of. - A. Of a gentleman in Hoxton Square, I cannot tell his name; the whole of the house is let out in tenements.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes she lived with me to look after my family, she lived with me only a week, on the Tuesday that she robbed me on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she use to sleep when she was with you. - A. In my room, on the side of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you hired her by the week. - A. Yes, and I paid her weekly.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was it that you missed any of your property. - A. I get my living in the street, I set in the street till ten or eleven o'clock, I sell fish and fruit; I always made it a rule to carry my silver and gold, or whatever I had, in a purse, which I put in my bosom; when I go to bed I take it out of my bosom and put it in my pocket, and I put my pocket under my head.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect the night that you was robbed. - A. Yes, I was robbed in the morning on the 3d of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed at night, what did you do with your purse. - A. I took it out of my bosom, and put it in my pocket; as usual, I had in it a guinea, a half guinea, three seven shillings pieces, and nineteen shillings and sixpence; to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it. - A. It might be twelve o'clock when I went to bed, she and my children were in bed in the same room when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you awake in the morning. - A. About seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you awoke in the morning, did you see or hear any thing of the prisoner. - A. I looked round when I awoke, to look for her, she was gone, I thought she might be gone out to get something to light the fire, I went to sleep again, I awoke again in a few minutes, I thought she might have come in, she did not come in, I said to some of the children, did you see nurse, I looked under my head for my pockets and they were gone; after I missed my pockets I put on the remainder of my things, I spoke to my neighbours, and said she had robbed me of all my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing besides your pockets with the money in it. - A. I went to my drawers, and missed two silk handkerchiefs, and a pocket handkerchief out of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at home that morning. - A. I went directly after her, but could not find her; on the seventh of this month I saw her again, a person told me she saw her go down Curtain Road; I found her at the public house next to the office, Worship-street, she was there drinking half a pint of porter, I says to her how came you to think of robbing me with five fatherless children, she replied if you live in a bad place where they rob you, more shame for them; I said you bad woman you have robbed me, she said you cannot stop me on a Sunday, I got an officer, the officer took her in a room and searched her, I was present, the officer took an old lace cap of mine out of her pocket, which had lain in my drawer.</p>

               <p>Q. Now look at the sixpence. - A. I can swear to the sixpence; on Tuesday an acquaintance of mine asked me to give her change for a shilling, I took my purse out of my bosom, I gave her that sixpence, she said this is a bad sixpence, I looked at the sixpence, I said it is a bad one indeed, I gave her another and put it in the purse again; I am sure it was in my purse, the prisoner did not deny it at the justice's, she said I gave her the sixpence on that morning, but I never gave her none; the bottle I used to put a bit of myrtle in, or any thing that I brought from the market, she has made a gin bottle of it, I saw the bottle on the Thursday before.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

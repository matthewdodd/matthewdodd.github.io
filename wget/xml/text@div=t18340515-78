            . I am a coachman. On the 4th of May, about ten or eleven o'clock at night, I was on my coach box in <placeName id="t18340515-78-crimeloc437">Davis-street, Berkeley-square</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you been on the coach-box that night? A. About an hour and three quarters - I cannot tell how long I had been asleep - I had been up till three o'clock the morning before- I was a little drowsy - when the prisoner was taken, he denied knowing any thing about the coat - it was not dark - there were lights about - it is not a very great thoroughfare - if any one had walked heavily down the street I should have heard them when I was asleep - I am sure the prisoner is the man - it is the footman's coat - my master is in the country - I am sure he had not given this coat to the footman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the footman out that night on duty? A. Yes. When he is out on duty, he wears his master's clothes.</p>

             (police-constable C 88). I was on duty, and heard the coachman call to the prisoner, and ask what he meant to do with the coat. I was on the opposite side - he called to the prisoner a second time, and asked whether he meant to bring the coat back - he then called"Police," and turned his coach, and pursued the prisoner - I ran across and pursued the prisoner into a mews, where I took him - the coachman pointed out the place where the coat was thrown - a man came to the place, got the coat, and gave it me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then there was another man in the street? A. There were seven or eight persons when I took the prisoner. When the coachman first called to the prisoner, I thought he might be a fellow-servant - but when he called "Police" I went over - I saw him with the coat, but I did not see him take it, nor throw it away, but the coach got between him and me - I saw him walking along - I had never seen the prisoner before - I saw no one there but him; but there were six or eight persons when I took him.</p>

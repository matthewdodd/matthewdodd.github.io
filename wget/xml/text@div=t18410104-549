                  </hi>. I live in James-street, Featherstone-street, St. Luke's. I have known the prisoner some years—I worked for him as a straw-bonnet maker—a little before last December he proposed to marry me—he was living with Mrs. Brown—I spoke to him about her—he said he was only living with her, she was not his wife—we were mar<lb></lb>ried at St. Mary's Church, Dover, by banns, on the 22nd of December—we lived together a month, and then I gave information.</p>

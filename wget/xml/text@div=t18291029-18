            . I keep the Three Compasses. -Gibson left a parcel in my bar in a bag; I saw it safe about ten minutes before it was taken - the prisoner was in the house, and I served him with half a pint of beer at the bar door, not ten minutes before the bag was missed; I was very busy, as it was a clothes-fair; he was gone when they were missed - the bar door was open; any body could step in and take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I left a bag with her on the Monday - she told me to put it down. Witness. Never - if he left one there I never saw it; several bags were there - people are in the habit of leaving them.</p>

            . I am a carver and gilder, and live in Redcross-street, Borough. I was at the public-house, and saw the prisoner at the bar door; Mrs. Dawson asked me for some halfpence to give him change, which made me notice him - I went into the yard, and shortly after was asked if I knew the man who had been at the bar; I went to look after him, and found him in Mr. Wilson's shop, Holborn-hill, that day - the boots and shoes were on the floor, by the side of the bag; I called him, and gave him in charge, saying he had stolen them - he said nothing then- Wilson keeps an open shop, and sells shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me in the bar with a bag over my shoulder? A. No; I saw no bag - I did not notice when you went out.</p>

I went to buy clothes; people buy and sell in the house - I asked Dawson to mind my bag; there was another bag brought to the office, which I had left - she said she supposed it was what I had left: I came in and asked her for my bag; she said, "There it is, take it;" I staid there half an hour - I walked away with it, thinking I had old shoes in my bag, and took them to Wilson's.</p>

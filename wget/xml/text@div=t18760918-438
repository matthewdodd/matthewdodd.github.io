On 26th August, at 11.15 p.m., I received information and went to 23, St. Mary's Place, Notting Hill—on entering the passage I saw a woman lying at the foot of the stairs, face downwards, her feet were resting on the two bottom stairs, and she was bleeding from a wound oh the top of her head, which was bent down almost on her breast—I raised her into a sitting posture with her head leaning against my knees—she was also bleeding from her nose—she had nothing on but a chemise—I sent for a doctor, he arrived in about ten minutes—I then went to the first floor front room where the prisoner was, and told him—I should take him in custody for causing the death of his wife—he said "Very well sergeant, I will go"—he asked me to allow him to see her, which I did—she was then in the washhouse—he said "I am very sorry for it"—on the way to the station he said "It is all through a man named—Laurence, we went to the Unicorn beerhouse and had some words, and Laurence told her to shut her b——mouth—we then left the house and went home together, and when I got home I stripped and got into bed, my wife kept on jawing me, I told her if she did not shut her mouth I should get out of <hi rend="italic">bed</hi> and <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> her out; she still kept on, and I jumped out of bed, she ran to the door and must have fallen downstairs, but I did not hear her fall."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> These are two-story houses, and the road is narrow—there is only a road for one carriage—the stairs are very straight, very steep, and there are no ballasters—the door of the prisoners room opens flush onto the stairs—there is no landing—the prisoner was detained upstairs by a man named Shepherd, who I found with him—the doctor had pro<lb></lb>nounced her dead when I took him into custody—the door—Is right lacing you as you go up, and I believe it opens into the room.</p>

I am the wife of George Tunnell, a labourer, we live in the same house as the prisoner—on 26th August, about 10.20 p.m., I went into their room and they were in bed together—the prisoner said. "Have you got any beer"—I said "Yes"—I had a pint in a can, and I gave them a glass each in bed, he and Mrs. Somers—he said that he had been grossly insulted by a man named Laurence—I said "Nevermind," and wished them good night, left the room and went into the street, and when I returned about 11.30 I saw Mrs. Somers dead in the washhouse—they appeared on very good terms.</p>

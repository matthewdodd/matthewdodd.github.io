               <p>I lost a black mare on the 2d of July; it was kept in my stables in Brick-street. I let her to hire for that day to the prisoner, to go to Sutton in Surry. He said he was to return at eight at night. He did not return with it. I asked him where he lived. He said No. 25, King-street; that he I dged there. I went next day to this place to enquire after him. There was no such man to be met with. I heard afterwards that my mare was sold on the same day at Smithfield.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Warner Street, and on the afternoon of Saturday, 13th July, was in the Caledonian Road—when about 100 yards from the railway station I saw a waggon and three horses coming along from king's Cross towards Holloway—it was a waggon such as is used by market gardeners to bring their produce to market—it was laden with manure, and the prisoner was sitting on the top, apparently asleep—stand<lb></lb>ing by the pavement was a pony and van, and the deceased was near to it in the act of posting a bill on a hoarding—I called out twice to the prisoner, but he took no notice, and almost instantly the waggon came in contact with the van, and upset it on the pavement—the deceased ran to the pony's head as if to save it, when he was knocked down, and fell close to the near wheel of the waggon—the wheel went over his left arm—he was soon afterwards taken to the hospital—the prisoner seemed to be re<lb></lb>clining on the manure, and made no effort to stop his horses—I don't believe he knew at the time that he had ran over a man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined at the Police Court, and also before the Coroner—I was not asked how far the waggon proceeded before it was stopped—it went at least twenty yards—there was a distance of about eight yards when I first saw the waggon coming towards the van—it is a wide road—it happened about 2.30 in the afternoon—I was crossing over. to the middle of the road at the time—there was no other vehicle near—I had been reading an excursion bill just before, and did not notice the waggon until it had got within about a dozen yards of the van—I don't know a Mr. Soaper, and no such a person has ever examined me—I have no interest in the matter, and wish I had not seen it—I can't say whether Featherstone's widow has commenced an action against the owner of the waggon—the deceased's van and pony were standing close to the kerb—I can't tell bow the deceased got under the van—he was about a yard and a half from the pony's head when the van was struck, and had the side of his face towards me—there is a slight incline in the road near the station.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Three carts came by soon afterwards—there was a man in the van when it was knocked over—the horses were going at about two miles an hour, and there was ample room for them to have gone by had the prisoner exercised proper control over them—I see plenty of men asleep on waggons on a market morning—there were about four tons of manure in the waggon, and it did make a great noise as it came along.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 36, Gilbert Street, Clare Market, and am a hammerman—on Saturday, the 13th July, the deceased asked me to take a drive with him, as he had to go to the Caledonian Road and stick some bills for his employer—he had about an hour's work to do in the road and at the station, and his pony and trap were drawn up close to the kerb—the de<lb></lb>ceased was engaged in sticking the first bill when a waggon came by and knocked the trap and myself over on to the pavement—I fell under the trap with my legs near to the pony's, and it was two or three minutes before I could get up—the first horse had pulled in on the near side, and the wag<lb></lb>gon was thus brought into contact—the deceased took hold of the pony's head with the intention of saving it, as well as myself, from injury, when he fell beneath the waggon, and one of the wheels went over his arm—I helped to pick him up his arm was all over blood, and had been rolled about—the waggon went on fifteen or twenty yards before it stopped.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sang out to the waggoner "Hold hard," and just as I had said that the waggon and the van collided—I did not see the prisoner get down, but he remained in the same position till the waggon was stopped by a constable—Mr. Benn was the deceased's employer, and the pony and van belonged to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see Penfold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he took the pony home—I did not hear him call out twice—it was all done in a moment—I was looking at the deceased sticking the bill when the waggon came up—the deceased when picked up was lying full stretch on his side and bleeding—he had been rolled over in the mud—it was his left arm that was injured—the horses in the waggon were merely coming at a walking pace—when I got up the waggon had been turned round—it was fifteen or twenty yards off when I got up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. VORES</hi>. I was the resident medical officer at the Royal Free Hos<lb></lb>pital when the deceased was brought in—he was suffering from a frac<lb></lb>ture of the left humerus—the bone was broken obliquely above the elbow, and a part of it was projecting—the elbow-joint was-laid open—the injury was so serious that we advised amputation—there was both a com<lb></lb>pound and a comminuted fracture—the bone was crushed and penetrating through the skin—the deceased refused for a week to have his arm ampu<lb></lb>tated—it was necessary in order to save his life—he refused after having consulted his friend—we put some lint on it to keep the injury from the air, and he carried his arm in a sling—the arm was amputated a week after<lb></lb>wards—when he refused I sent to Mr. Gant, the surgeon of the week, and he saw the man and advised him to give his assent—afterwards the arm was put upon a splint and the man lay in bed—Mr. Gant said that amputa<lb></lb>tion was absolutely necessary, as the joint was seriously injured—when we told him a week afterwards that his life was in actual danger he assented, and the limb was removed—we told him that it was positively certain he could not recover until he had the arm amputated—we told him as plainly as we could that it was a dangerous thing not to have his arm removed—the deceased died of pyæia, or blood-poisoning—there was a lot of inflame<lb></lb>mation</p>

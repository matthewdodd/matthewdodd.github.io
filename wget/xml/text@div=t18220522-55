On the 26th of April I missed the sovereigns which were in my box; I had seen them five or six days before; they were wrapped in a piece of paper. I slept on the second floor, it is a double beded room. Two more people slept there; I had broken the key of the box; it was not locked, I tied it up with a cord; the prisoner was servant at the house; the money was at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182205220022"></xptr>bottom of the box, covered with clothes; I missed nothing else. One person who slept in the room was a companion of mine, the other was a stranger. When I mentioned it in the house the mistress sent for the prisoner, she said she was innocent, and consented to her box being searched. I had marked none of the money. Gardner was sent for, the sovereigns were produced, inclosed in the same paper as when in my box. I never gave the prisoner any money. I had been eight or nine days in the house, and never changed a sovereign while I was there.</p>

Three men besides him slept in the room for two nights, and afterwards only two. On Friday he complained of losing eleven sovereigns from the bottom of his box; the prisoner was sent for, and questioned about it; I used to attend the room, and she assisted me. She was asked if she had taken the money, and denied it, she agreed to her box being searched, which was kept in her bed room; she was the only servant. No money whatever was found, and she said she had no money whatever. Next morning about half past nine o'clock, I found ten sovereigns in a paper, wrapped in a handkerchief in the bolster, which had been ripped open, and pinned up; nobody but her slept in the bed; there was another bed in the room where I slept with my sister. This room was quite in a different part of the house, to where Cook slept. An officer was sent for, and I then told her the sovereigns were found in her bolster, she said nothing; Cook said the money was wrapped in a newspaper, but it was in whitey-brown paper when I found it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You act as chamber-maid - A. Yes; the prisoner did not take out beer; I cannot say she hid it there; she had just left her place and had no money when she came to us; we advanced her four shillings, she said the people she left had not paid her. We had sent her out once or twice after her box was searched.</p>

            . I keep a milliner's shop in Fetter-lane, nearly opposite Smith's. On the Wednesday before the Saturday the prisoner was taken, she came about a lace cap and ordered a lace frill to be made by Saturday; she left a sovereign and the cap in my possession, meaning to have them both on Saturday; the cap was 11 s., and the frill was not to exceed 9 s. On Saturday morning the officer came, and I returned him the sovereign; she appeared to have more sovereigns, and asked for plaid dresses, and other things which I had not got.</p>

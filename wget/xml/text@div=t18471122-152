                  </hi> Jun. I am son of the prosecutor—the prisoner was in our employ in May, 1845—he left in Aug.—a book was kept for him to enter his money in—either I or my father went over the account every week—there is no entry in this book of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. since the 1st May—he never paid me those sums—I found out they had not been paid a month, or six weeks after he left—I did not know where he was gone—I found him in Nov., 1845; took a copy of the bill to him, and asked if he knew anything about it—he said he had never received the money—I afterwards asked him to give me the money, and there would be nothing further done in it—he said he could not give it me then, but would in a week, on a certain day; he did not fix any place—I went to where he lived on that day, but he was gone and his things and all.</p>

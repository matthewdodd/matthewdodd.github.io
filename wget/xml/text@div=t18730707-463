                  </hi>. I am a painter, of 1, Back Street, Cubitt Town—on Sunday morning, 29th June, I was coming from Bromley Station to my home—I was very tired—I had been up forty hours, and had walked from Cubitt Town to Bromley—I had two pots of stout and mild, and coming home I sat down on a doorstep in, I believe, East Ferry Road, but I was a stranger there—a person named King came up and said "<hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, what are you doing here?"—I said "I am only resting"—the two prisoners, and one not in custody, came up to me, and said "Halloa, old man, what are you doing here?" and caught me round the neck and held me there—I did not speak or move—the man not in custody emptied my pockets, and took from my breast pocket 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went on ahead and halloaed out "Police!" and "Murder!" and the prisoner Byrne came across the road, hit me in the face, and knocked me down—I got to one of the Dock entrances, and saw Crawley—he asked me what was the matter—I told him I had been robbed and knocked down, and he no sooner saw it was me than he hit roe in the eye—I would not swear on my solemn oath that Byrne was the man who knocked me down—I picked him out from the crowd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not exactly sober, and I was a great way from being drunk—a very bad lot were at this spot, and a large crowd—I dare say there were as many as twenty people about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barge master, in the employment of the East and West India Dock Company—on Saturday night, 28th June, I was going on duty between 12 and 1 o'clock—I saw the prosecutor leaning across the railings of the bridge; I went to look at him, and he fell backwards—I can't say whether he was tipsy, but he looked very much as if he was—he could not get up again—these two men came up and began to pull him about; they said they knew him, and wanted to take him home—they went away and a lot of men came up soon afterwards, and began to pull him about—I got a light, and looked at him; he did not seem disturbed in his dress—I went away up to the South Dock Bridge—I was not there above ten minutes before the prosecutor came up with all his pockets out, and he swore at Crawley that he had taken his money; he pointed out Crawley to me—I told him he had better go away and find a policeman, as I could not do anything in it—I said I never saw him robbed—Crawley struck him in the face and cut his eye, when he said he had robbed him—I heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> afterwards by the toll-gate, but I did not go down there.</p>

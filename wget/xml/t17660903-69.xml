On Thursday last, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into our house and called for three pennyworth of brandy and water, which I served her with; there was a child's silver spoon in it; my husband came in soon after; I gave him a caution that the liquor was not paid for, but I said nothing of the spoon; after I had been above stairs about an hour, I recollected the spoon; I went down; the prisoner had paid for the liquor, but was not gone; I asked her for the spoon; she said she knew nothing of it; she said, I brought it into the room, but did not know who took it away; I was very cautious of accusing her with it; after some time I went and argued with her, and told her what would be the consequence if I found it upon her; she threatened me in case I searched her and did not find it; I sent for a constable; she was taken to the Compter, and a man searched her as far as decency, but could not find it. The next witness can give you a further account.</p>

            . I belong to the Compter; I saw this spoon fall from the prisoner, as she was undressing herself to go to bed; (produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dorrington. This is the spoon I lost; the prisoner said she did not value being transported, she seemed desirous to go abroad.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>
               <p>Briant Borough. I am one of Mr. Akerman's servants at Newgate; the prisoner called at our lodge one day last week, either on the Wednesday or Thursday evening; she said to me, I beg your pardon, I want to ask you a question; I said, I'll resolve you if I can; she called for a pint of wine, then she asked me how she could be transported, she wanted to be transported; I laughed at her, thinking she came to make game; after I had drank a glass with her she called me aside, and said, I'll tell you the reason of it; I have a husband that is to be transported from Maidstone, and I want to know how I can go along with him: I told her if she had any money, she had better go and contract; she said she insisted upon going if she knew how, and wanted to know how she could; I believe somebody, out of a joke said, if you step over to the goldsmith's shop, you may soon know the way to be transported.</p>
               <p>Recorder. I would be glad to apprize you of this, was you to have gained your end, perhaps you may not go to the same colony, or be disposed of in some other part of the country, you may never see each other.</p>

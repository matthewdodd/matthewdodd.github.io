I put a washing tub against the door, and laid on the bed with my trowsers on, and put my watch in my right hand breeches pocket, I gave her what silver I had. My pocket-book, containing 2 l., which was in my coat pocket, was across a chair. I awoke about eight o'clock in the morning, and found her gone, and missed my watch, put my coat on, and found I was fastened in the room - I made a noise at the door, and old man came up, and I asked him to let me out, he said he could not. Sometime after, the prisoner came and let me out; I charged her with robbing me, she denied it, and said, I never had a watch - I got an officer (after going to several places) who searched the room, and found my pocket and rule on the table, they were not there when I charged her with stealing my watch - nothing was found on her, the watch has been found - I had been at the Play till eleven o'clock, then went to a public-house or two, I might have drank two pots of beer before I met her - I was not intoxicated.</p>

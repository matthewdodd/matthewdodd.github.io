             sworn. - I am a constable; I was fetched by Mr. Fitch on Wednesday, the 23d of November, to take the prisoner into custody; the prisoner was coming down stairs as I went into the shop; as I was going with him into the counting-house, he made a kind of fumble; I went into the counting-house, and searched him; I took out of the inside of his breeches this box; there is thirty new guineas in gold in it; I found four shillings in his left-hand pocket, eight shillings and two sixpences in the fob pocket, two of them are marked; seven shillings in silver in the right-hand breeches pocket; three penny-worth of halfpence in his waistcoat pocket; I received one shilling form Mr. Fitch afterwards, which was put with the two marked shillings found in his fob.(The three marked shillings were produced and deposed to by Mr. Fitch; Mr. Paton deposed to two of them, as two of the shillings he received from Mr. Fitch, and gave to the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into the cellar where the cheeses were; I had a box there with 30 guineas in it; and because my box had not a lock upon it, I put it in my pocket; I went up stairs; my master came into the shop and called me down, and the constable was in the shop; when I came first in the morning, I had bought some nails for my master, and there was but one shilling in the till to pay for them, and I put this money in my pocket to pay for the nails.</p>

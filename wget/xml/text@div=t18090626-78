               <p>Q. Is not he capable of getting his bread - A. No. He was sent to us as a person incapable of getting his bread; he has lost the pallet of his mouth. Being a bricklayer I sent him on the top of the house to do some repairs; I was at the door of the workhouse, I saw him turn down an alley which is at one end of the workhouse, and perceived a bundle under his coat; I sent one of my people to order him back again, in order that I might see what he had got; she returned and said she had missed him. When he returned I asked him where he had been; he told me next door; that I knew to be false; I asked him if he had taken any thing; he said nothing. There was one of my people that I saw him more intimate with than others; I suspected that he knew something of what he had been about; he came to me and said I understand you are angry with me; I said I am; you know what he was about; he said he did not, I had better go up on the top of the house, there was something in the blue pigeon way.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by the blue pigeon - A. Something of lead. I charged the prisoner with stealing the lead off the top of the back of the workhouse; he denied it. I threatened to take him to the watchhouse; then he took me into his room, unlocked his box, and shewed me the lead, which I have here. That lead I took out of his box.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had he taken that lead from before it was in his box - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not match it - A. No. When I took it out of the box, I said Remmington, this is not all, what have you done with the rest; he said he had sold it in Brick-lane; I said come along and shew me; we went to an iron shop in Brick-lane; I asked the man if he knew the prisoner, he said, yes; he had bought a little old lead of him; I then said, can I see it; he said it laid behind the counter; he removed a sack from off it, he said that was the lead that he bought of the prisoner; he asked me if it was my property; I said no, it belonged to a house that I had the care of. The iron shopman then begged me to hush it up, I told him I could make no promise of that kind; I had seen the lead, that was all I wanted to see. I then came home and acquainted the churchwardens, they ordered him to be taken in charge; he was taken before the magistrate the officers told me I had done wrong. When they went with a search warrant to the iron shop the man and the lead were both out of the way.</p>

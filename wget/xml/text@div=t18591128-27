                  </hi>. On Friday evening, 11th November I was at the White Bear at the top of King William-street at half-past 11 o'clock—I had been about an hour before at Mr. Chappel's, the Green Man—while I was there the prisoner came in with another man—I said I was going home, and I lived at Mile-end, and I was going over London-bridge—the prisoner said he was going that way and he and the other man came with me—when we got to the end of the bridge I said, "I am going to Mile-end, but we will have something to drink at the White Bear"—we all three went in, and a woman we had met on the bridge—we had half-a-pint of gin—I gave half-a-crown and they took 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of it for the half pint of gin—we all drank of it—as I was taking up the change the prisoner said, "Put the money all in your purse"—it was a leather bag that I had, and I took my bag out and put my money in it—I put my purse back, and the prisoner and his com<lb></lb>panion and the female all began <hi rend="italic">rustling</hi> me about—the prisoner knocked me behind my legs and tripped me backwards—I fell on my back in the house and the prisoner went to lift me up and put his left hand in my pocket and pulled out my purse—I said, "You have put your hand in my pocket and taken my purse and money"—he said, "I have not"—he gave the purse to the man that was along with him, and he ran out of the house with it—I went to the door and the barman gave me assistance to detain the prisoner till the policeman came—the woman was still there, but she was not taken—I charged the prisoner with robbing me of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was the amount of money I had in my purse—he said he had no money about him—I knew he had not, because he had given it to the other man—I had been drinking but I knew what I was about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the White Bear—I saw the prosecutor at 11 o'clock that night—the prisoner was with him and another man and a woman—I saw the prosecutor pulled down on his back—I heard him fall and I saw the prisoner take his purse from his pocket—he put it behind his back and the other man or the woman took it—the other man stood behind him to take it—the other man went out and the prosecutor and I stopped the prisoner—he said he had got no money about him.</p>

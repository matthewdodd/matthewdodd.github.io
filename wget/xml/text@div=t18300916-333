            . I deal in iron, and live in Church-lane, Commercial-road. Last Friday week I saw the two prisoners between four and five o'clock - they brought two iron gratings and one iron curb in a truck; Sullivan offered it for sale - I asked where they got it; he said he came from Mr. Robertson, the builder, at the back of the hospital - I said, "Why does not Mr. Robertson send a note that I might know who it came from?" Sullivan said I had no occasion to be afraid - I said I would know whose it was before I bought it; Kirby then said, "To tell you the truth, we picked it up in the Commercial-road to sell for some beer;" I said they might put it into the scale, and while they did that I saw the officer, and gave charge of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever bought things of this kind before? A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 10th of September, I was near Skipp's shop; he took me in - there were these two gratings and frame - I asked the prisoners if they belonged to them; Sullivan said, No; I asked Skipp's men who brought them, and one of them said the two prisoners - I then asked Sullivan where he got the truck; he said, "From Collins, a wheel wright;" I put the prisoners into two different lock-up rooms, then went to Sullivan and said, "I suspect they belong to the Commercial-road Trust;" he said, "You have just guessed it?" I then went to Kirby and asked him where they got it - he said he knew nothing about them - that he was employed by Sullivan.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said, "You have guessed it," not"You have guessed right?" A. No; and Kirby said he had helped the other - I asked them about it to get the truth.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the new works on the Commercial-road; Christopher Richardson, the elder, and a great many others are Commissioners; I know these to be ours, by the exact similarity; they are from a pattern made specially for the use of our road; Sullivan was employed on the road, but had left about a fortnight; he had been employed several months in pitching the road; he knew the road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any private-mark on the property of the Commercial-road? A. Not on the grating- Messrs. Hunter and English, of Bow, are the manufacturers; it would be a breach of trust in the manufacturers to send the same sort of grating to other people; the pattern is not common.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Do you know of any road near the Commercial-road that has such articles on it? A. No; there is no other road undergoing any improvement.</p>

The prisoner was an occasional servant. At the time in question we slept out of town for the benefit of my health, and the prisoner slept there to take care of the property - I have known him six or seven years: he had slept there for three months, for the last two summers. On the 10th of August, immediately after breakfast, I went to the chest to take out the property, and missed a quantity of beads; I had been out all the day before, but on the Thursday previous I had put them all into the awer - the drawer belonged to a small<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160098"></xptr>cabinet, and these drawers are all placed in the iron chest at night. I had slept there from Thursday till Sunday, but not on Monday. On missing them I informed my husband. They were worth 80 l. - we have found some of them.

            . I am an officer. I was informed of this, and went to the prisoner's house, No. 1, Paradise-place, Kentish-town. The prosecutor took me there himself, on Tuesday, the 10th of August - I found his wife there, and in a bed-room up stairs, in the closet, I found eleven rows of pearls in a piece of paper, in a pickle jar, concealed behind some rags. I had been fetched to Sparrow's, and found the prisoner there - I asked if he knew any thing of the pearls; he said not: I searched him and found one string of pearls in his shoe. I then told him I had been to his house, and that there was a considerable quantity more lost - he said all the rest were between the rafters and tiles in his wash-house - I went there, and found three ornaments.</p>
               <p>MRS. SPARROW. The one set found in his shoe are worth 4 l., cost price.</p>

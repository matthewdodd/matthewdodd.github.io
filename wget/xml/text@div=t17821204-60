               <p>The prisoner was in my front shop on the 20th or 21st of November last, about half past one; she asked for some ribbon, and my man having told me she had taken something, I took her by the hand, and told her to go with me; then she dropped one card of edging, I saw her drop it from under her cloak; going a little further, she dropped another card; after that I got her into the back shop, and told her I should send for a constable immediately, and I sent for one; mean while she dropped two pieces of ribbon in the back shop, that were not there before; then I took her up stairs to be searched, and going up, I saw her drop another piece of ribbon.</p>
               <p>Court. Were those pieces of edging and ribbon that were dropped your property? - Yes my Lord.</p>

               <p>I am shop-man to Mr. Thorne; I was shewing the prisoner some edging; she took one card, I did not observe the second; but I saw her take a third, then she let one fall; I put back her cloak, and there was another piece under her arm; I saw her drop it in the shop, from under her cloak.</p>
               <p>PRISONER.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury, Gentlemen, the evidence does not amount to stealing privately, because the shopman saw the prisoner take two cards of edging, and in order to constitute stealing privately, no person must see the property taken.</p>

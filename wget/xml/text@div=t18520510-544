Let gave Samuels into my charge, on 1st April, in the Minories, and said, "I give this man in charge, for robbing my master, and obtaining skins from him by false pretences"—Samuels said, "I know nothing about your master, or the skins, I am a slipper maker, and have worked with a master three years"—I took him to the station, went after Goberg, and found him at his house, 19, New-street, Houndsditch—I inquired of him whether he knew Samuels, and whether he had worked for him—Goberg said he had worked with him a long while, and had left him two or three months—I took him to Fenchurch-street station—I took Solomons in custody on 4th April—I took them before the Lord Mayor, and they were sent to the Thames police court—while there Samuels said, "If I am guilty I will take three months before I <hi rend="italic">split</hi> upon my mates"—that was on 7th, before going before the Magistrate.</p>

I went with Schimpf, to 3, Sandy-street—I saw Rosenthal, and I asked him if he had any skins, brought there the previous day—he said he had—I asked who they were brought by—he said, "By that man" pointing to Schimpf—I asked if he knew who bought them—he said he did not know, unless it was some Germans who had been lodging there—I asked if he knew their names—he said no—I asked him what rooms they occupied—he said, "This," pointing to the front parlour.</p>

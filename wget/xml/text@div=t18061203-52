               <p>Q. On the evening of the 28th of October, did you leave your master's house. - Yes, about seven o'clock in the evening, and I was out till about nine; when I went out I fastened the doors, windows, and every avenue to the house; when I returned I found the door as I left it, but I found footmarks to the door. When I returned, me and my son were sitting in the kitchen, he heard a noise about half after nine. I went up stairs to let my son out; going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030048"></xptr> by the parlour door I found it open; I had left it shut when I went out. I went into the parlour, I found a tobacco pipe by the sideboard, the pipe was rather warm; there was never a pipe in the house to my knowledge when I was there. I was alarmed, I went out and brought in a watchman, we proceeded to search the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down the stairs did you perceive any thing on the stairs. - A. We perceived the dirt of men's feet, we proceeded up the stairs, we picked up a match and a candle, the candle appeared to have been recently lit; the man then sprang the rattle, and there were three more watchmen called in; they proceeded to search the house. In the two pair of stairs back room a bed and counterpane was taken away, and a ladies' looking glass, I had seen them there at four o'clock in the afternoon; I found in that room that all the closets had been forced open, and the drawers were all open; they were not locked when I went out, they were close.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out at seven o'clock you left the house without any other person. - A. Yes, I went into the two pair of stairs front room, I found the door, the drawers, and the wardrobe open; I missed out of that room a featherbed and a counterpane; in the top drawer of the wardrobe there was my own wearing apparel, that was all gone, and the sheets on the bed were gone, they were mine. We went into the garret; there was taken from there one feather bed, a coloured quilt; there was a large trunk that belonged to

In the dining-parlour a large pier-glass that was fixed between the windows, that also was gone.</p>

            ; examined by Mr. Alley. You live in the same house as the woman prisoner. - A. Yes, in Mary-bone-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house does she occupy. - A. The one pair of stairs front room.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is the woman prisoner. - A. She is a Jewess, I do not know any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the 28th of October did any thing particularly attract your attention. - A. I heard people talking, and things going up stairs, about eight in the evening; I was coming up from the washouse where I had been washing. I saw Mr. Simons standing at the door; he had been standing there a considerable time. I went up into my own room, and stopped some time, and afterwards I heard Mrs. Simons open the door and say hush.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know where the man Simons was then. - Q. He was helping up the men with the beds at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him helping the beds up stairs, - A. I did not see it, I suppose it must be them, it made such a hustling getting them up; they were helping something up very large, I did not see it. Then the door was shut to, and they were very silent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you know of your own knowledge they are man and wife. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. It is charged so in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did you hear this noise of carrying the things up. - A. I heard them upon the stairs about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the man Simons is. - A. I have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of the persons who were carrying these things up with Simons. - A. No.</p>

Previous to your going to the office you had the woman prisoner in custody at the public house. - A. I had; and while we were there the man prisoner came in. He passed two or three times to Mrs. Simons, and then he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of something that she said after he left the house, did you pursue him and take him into custody. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you brought him back did you repeat in his hearing and hers what she said before you left the room. - A. I did; I told him that she accused him, saying, that he was one of the party concerned in bringing the beds, and the other property to her. He denied it, and said it was false. She replied, you know you did, and at the same time you was in my room, you pulled an handkerchief or something out of your pocket, and you dropped a skeleton key. I asked you what it was, you said, it was your own; to this he made no reply.</p>

               <p>Simons left her defence to her counsel, and called no witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>Halsgrove called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

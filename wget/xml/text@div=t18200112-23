On the 5th of December I met the prisoner in New Round-court, and went with her to her lodgings in <placeName id="t18200112-23-crimeloc129">Vine-street</placeName>

I found two other women there, and one of them went out for liquor - the sight of the place put me into a tremble. I had drank two or three glasses of gin, but knew what I was about - it was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning. I had been out all night at a coffee-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. One of the women went out for gin - A. Yes; the prisoner was close to me. In about a minute she said she wanted to go down stairs, which she did immediately. I missed my watch which was safe just before, and told the other girl that my watch was gone. I went down, found the prisoner in the back yard, and charged her with it - she said I might search her, but I could not find it. She went up stairs with me, and remained about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after. I asked her for my watch? She denied it, and told me to go about my business. I fetched an officer, and gave her in charge about an hour after. I have never found the watch. I had been with no other girl.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was you not intoxicated and with another woman when you took hold of me - A. No.</p>

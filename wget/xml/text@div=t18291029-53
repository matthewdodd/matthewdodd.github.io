On the 15th of October I had been out at work in a barn, just opposite my house; I have three children, who were out, and my wife was out at work; I had left the house at breakfast time, locked the door, and had the key with me - the windows were all fast; when I returned, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I found the iron bar of the back window out - I unlocked the door, and went in; the back window opens into the garden, which has furze round it - I found the prisoner up stairs; I secured him, and brought him down - he said he was looking for his money; he had no business in the house - he had lodged there, and left on the Tuesday; this was Thursday; he had not left any money there, I am certain - I took him to Whittingham; we went before the Magistrate, and brought him to the Swan - Whittingham searched him there, and found a silk handkerchief of mine on him; I am sure it is mine - he said it belonged to me, but did not say how he came to take it.</p>

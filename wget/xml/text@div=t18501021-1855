                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Bennett; we are glass-manufacturers, in Montague-street, Whitechapel. The prisoners were in our service as day-men—Pardoe's wages were two guineas for five days—he had no authority to give orders; he was merely the best workman—I had not given these men orders previous to 25th Sept. to make glass-stoppers—I had given orders that they should not be made—the metal out of which these should be made was in No. 1 clay-pot—the metal is, in fact, molten glass; it is sand, red lead, potash, and saltpetre—it was, at the close of the day, the duty of these men to report to a man who attends all the goods that are made—Pardoe had the keys of some of the warehouses in his care—it was his duty at night to bring them up-stairs—in consequence of information, I obtained the assistance of two policemen on the evening of 25th Sept.; we placed ourselves at a short distance, which commanded a view of the gateway—about eight o'clock, Pardoe came to the gate—he stood at the top of the gateway, looked round, and returned down, I suppose, to the factory—he came up with Harrington, and they came out together—Pardoe crossed the road to deliver up the keys, I suppose, and Harrington wen: over to the public-house—I pointed him out, and the officers followed him—he was brought back to the warehouse and searched—126 glass-stoppers were taken from his two pockets, two cigar-tubes, and a glass bottle—I believe them</p>

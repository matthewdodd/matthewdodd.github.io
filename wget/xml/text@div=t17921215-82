             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was going through the Piazza's, one evening going to the play, and I could not get in, and this person picked me up, as I was with her I went to her lodgings, after I had been there some time, I took my watch out of my pocket, and lay it in the crown of my hat, the prisoner saw it, and ran down stairs with it, and I never recovered it. I advertised the watch, as it was a watch of value, on which I was advised to apply to some of the people at Bow-street, as in all probability I should get it; I thought to have prosecuted the receiver, but to my great surprise, I found I was bound over to prosecute the thief instead of the receiver; I was drawn into this prosecution; I have never seen my watch again.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the advertisement lead to the prisoner? - By describing the prisoner one of the people at Bow-street found her, and told me he would take her up, and did, and brought the person who had received the watch whom she confessed she sold it to for 15 s.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you with her? - Eight or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you take on you to say this is the same person? - I could not be mistaken, because I took particular notice of her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Pilleau you seem a gentleman pretty far advanced in life? - Young enough for this business.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray sir, what station of life are you in? - That is nothing at all to the purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. It is to the purpose Mr. Pilleau? - I belong to a public office, I belong to the Bank, I am a <rs id="t17921215-82-viclabel464" type="occupation">clerk</rs>

               <p>Q. A single man I take it for granted? - I am not a single man.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have children? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. How many children have you? - I have had a great many, I have six.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife living and six children at this time; so you was betrayed and seduced into this prosecution was you? - I did not mean to prosecute the girl, my motive was to prosecute the receiver.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you never knew this girl before? - I never saw her but once before in the Piazza.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you never see her before she accosted you in the Piazza? - Not in her room, I saw her in the Piazza as I came by.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath have you not had frequent conversation with her? Mind what you are about Mr. Pilleau. - Not frequent, no farther than told her to go about her business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this once or twice? - Once, about a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it, sir, that you as a married man going to the play, and finding this woman, thought proper to go to her lodgings with her? - Because most men do foolish things sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a disgrace to come with such a prosecution into court. And when you went to her lodgings they were in <placeName id="t17921215-82-crimeloc465">Parker's-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Do not you know Parker's-lane? - I did not know it before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150122"></xptr>Q. Now sir, when you went with this girl to these lodgings, did you agree to give her any money? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go for? - For a lunching as most men do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any thing? - She did not stand for that.</p>
               <p>Q. You put the watch on the hat before her face? - I did openly before her face.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never seen the watch since? - I have not, I wish I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how old the prisoner at the bar is? - I think I have heard she is about eighteen.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you never knew this prisoner before, and if any body was to come, and swear you had known her perfectly well a great many years, it would be a falsity? - It would.</p>
               <p>Q. You never went with the prisoner at the bar before to her lodgings? - No, nor to any house whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you went to the play? - The third of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet the prisoner as you went, or as you came back? - I met her first as I went, and told her I could not stay, and desired her to go about her business.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you returned from the play-house? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner then? - In the same place, or thereabout, somewhere under the Piazza.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you appoint the place? - No, I did not, nor did I measure the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. King's? - What Mr. King.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Crown-court? - I don't know what they call Crown-court, I know no such a place much.</p>
               <p>Q. Crown-court, Little Russel-street? - I don't know much or little either.</p>
               <p>Q. You are treating us with shuffling at present? - You shuffle with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Crown-court you don't know, out of Drury-lane, or out of Little Russel-street. Then you did not go with the prisoner at the bar, to a house in Crown-court a fortnight before this? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are still a clerk in the Bank? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live with your wife and children? - Suppose I do, or do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Answer my question, Sir? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they know of this? - They do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Ryder? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Union-place? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Union-place, Lambeth? - I lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say, that you did not know it; perhaps, now you have brushed up your recollection, you know a person of the name of Ryder, that lived there? - I do know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your wife and family live there? - They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Ryder had some family I believe? - He had.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there had been some complaints of very indecent conduct from that part? - What indecent conduct?</p>
               <p>Q. It is not fit for a court of justice to be disgraced with the recital. Has not the Mr. Ryder that you know, complained of no indecent conduct that you have practised? - Mr. Ryder and I were on very good footing.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps, I am putting a wrong term on the manner in which you thought proper to conduct yourself; you may not consider it indecent; you may call it decent? - I don't know what you mean, that has nothing to do with this.</p>
               <p>Q. I will tell you what it has to do: there are some pails between you and Mr. Ryder's house? - You are wrong informed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150123"></xptr>if they told you so, there are not; there are high walls.</p>

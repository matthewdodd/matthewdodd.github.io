                  </hi>. I am servant to Colonel George Erskine, of No. 1, Field Officers' Quarters, Woolwich. On the night of the 17th November, I saw this set of harness safe at 7 o'clock, in the coach house, of which I have the care—on the 8th, about a quarter-past 6 in the morning, I missed the harness—it is Colonel Erskine's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sadler, of Chapel-place, Belgrave-square—on 18th November, the prisoner came to me and said, "I see you are adver<lb></lb>tising for harness"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Will you purchase a set?"—I said, "Yes, if I see it previously"—he said, "What is your price?"—I said, "I cannot say till I see it"—he said, "I will forward it to you"—on 20th November, this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) arrived by post, and on the evening of 20th, a hamper arrived directed to me, and the day after, or two days after, I was at Aldridge's Repository—but previous to that I wrote a note to him offering a sum of money for the harness—he came to me at Aldridge's, and said, "I am the party that sent you the harness from Woolwich," and pro<lb></lb>duced the note which I had sent to him, offering 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the harness, and I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he said that it was his property, and that he had sent me the letter previous to sending the harness; and he said he hoped I</p>

On 23d January, I took the prisoner in custody, and told him the charge: he said nothing—on searching him, I found these three padlock keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), a box of lucifers, a piece of candle, and a quantity of paste, which is very often used in case of entries where they have to break glass, they paste a piece of paper over, and it makes no noise—the keys fit the door that Mr. Hammond's stable was fastened with, but did not fit Colonel Erskine's stable.</p>

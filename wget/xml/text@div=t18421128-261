                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Kendall, of Agar-cottage, Sid<lb></lb>ney-place, Clapham-road, in the parish of Lambeth. The prisoner came into our service on the 5th of May, and left on the Monday following—on the 14th of Nov., a little after seven o'clock in the morning, I missed the articles stated, which I had seen safe on Sunday night—when I went down in the morning three doors were open, which had been fastened over night—they had been opened from within—the prisoner was not living with me at this time—I had not seen her on the Sunday—I do not know how she got there—I made the house fast over night, at a little after nine o'clock—I am sure it was after nine—every thing was safe—I cannot say that I particularly observed these articles after nine o'clock—I was in the kitchen, and did not miss anything.</p>

On the 14th of Nov., about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner coining out of the Alfred's Head at the corner of the London-road, which is about two miles and a half from the prosecutor's—she had a bundle—I stopped her, and</p>

On the morning of the 14th, about half-past five or twenty minutes to six o'clock, I saw a wagon in the Clap<lb></lb>ham-road—when it stopped, a basket of apples fell, and the prisoner stepped off the path and picked them up—it was going towards town, in a direction from the prosecutor's house, and about a quarter of a mile from it—I saw a washing-tub on the rods of the wagon, but none of the rest of the property—I have not seen the washing-tub which the officer saw—it is not here—I asked the prisoner whether she was moving—she said from No. 50, Lark-hall-lane—I said there was no such number there—she said there was about half-way up the lane—I asked what the name of the place was—she said, "No particular name, Larkhall-lane."</p>

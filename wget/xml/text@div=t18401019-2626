                  </hi>. West was in my service as ostler; Cope lives next door but one, and keeps a horse and cart. On the 1st of October I did not authorize West to sell any of my hay or any other thing; he was not justified in doing so—I might have obliged a neighbour with a truss of hay—I have been asked by West whether he might, but that is months or a year ago—if any body came for a truss he should speak to me previously—Mears, the officer, arrived with a truss—my wife called me out of my parlour—there was I, West, Cope, and the officer together—West spoke first—he said, "Sir, I have just sold a truss of hay, and have got 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it in my pocket"—I said, "What business could you have to sell a truss of hay?"—he said, "It is to a neighbour; he has paid me the full value"—I said to him, "You know, Robert, it is not long ago since I charged you on no account to borrow, or lend, or sell hay; how durst you do such a thing?"—the officer said Cope had told him he gave 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it</p>

               <p>—I answered, "Why, Robert, you told me you received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—West then said to Cope, "You know you gave me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—Cope said, "Yes, I gave you 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but you was to give me 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I should say the truss is worth about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the load of thirty-six trusses—I gave both the prisoners in charge.</p>

On the 1st of October, at a quarter before ten o'clock at night, I was passing the Tyson Arms public-house, and saw Cope coming from the premises with a truss of hay on his back—he had come a few yards from the stable-door—I suspected it was not right, and watched them for a moment or two—West was at the stable-door watching—Cope turned round at different times for the purpose of watch<lb></lb>ing me—I then went to the prosecutor's bar to know if it was right—after that I pursued Cope, and asked him how he came by the hay—he said he purchased it of the ostler for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and afterwards said he had not given any thing for it—before we arrived I asked him whether he kept a horse and cart—he said, "Yes"—West was at the bar when I arrived with Cope—West said he had received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Cope answered, "Yes, but I was to receive 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out"—I searched West and found 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—he had not 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

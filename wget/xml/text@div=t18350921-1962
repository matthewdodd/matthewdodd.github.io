                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Jones, and live at Gravesend. On the 24th of August I was in London—I packed in a box the articles stated in the indictment, at Mrs. Simpson's Parnham-place, Ratcliff—I employed the prisoner to carry the box to the steam-packet—I had told him I would go with him, but he fetched it away in my absence—I had pro<lb></lb>mised to be back at half-past three o'clock to let him have it, but I could not come back till evening—I saw it again at the Thames police about a fort<lb></lb>night after, broken open, and the articles stated in the indictment gone—they were altogether worth full 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I had told him I would accompany him with it, but finding the packet did not go that day, I did not go home—I did intent to let him have it to take, except in my presence.</p>

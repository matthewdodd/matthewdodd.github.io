                  </hi>. I am a policeman—I live next door but one to the prosecutrix. On the 25th of March the prisoner left this bundle at my house unknown to me—she came about seven o'clock, and said she had left a bundle with my wife, and wanted it—she stood talking with me some time—my wife came in, and asked her to stop to tea—she said she had no objection—she went to the bundle, and got a little tea from it—I caught sight of the things, and thought they were not hers, and gave notice to the prosecutrix—the prisoner said at the station-house, that it was liquor had done it—she said the nursery maid had given her a pair of shoes, she did not know what was in the bundle, she was so intoxicated, she took all the other things but the pair of shoes—she was in liquor—she gave my wife 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. after tea to get some rum, but I did not allow her.</p>

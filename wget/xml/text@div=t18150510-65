            . The first attempt to take the chest was at the bottom of Skinner-street, just by Fleet market; I said to my fellow servant, there is something the matter. These chests were secured by a rope, well tied in, as soon as ever he put the chest on the truck, I said hold fast, because he was not used to it. I then went behind and saw the rope was cut, the top chest was off the truck, it might have fallen, or it might have been taken off, I cannot say which. I put the chest up well safe again, I fastened the rope, and was obliged to keep a sharp eye on it.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did you distinguish any persons near the truck - A. The two prisoners were the only, two persons that I saw, I cannot swear to their faces, they seemed to be the only persons that were watching the truck; then I got a lift behind a dray which pulled me up Holborn-hill. When I got to Middle-row Holborn, I said to my fellow servant again, there is something the matter, then I perceived that the rope was nearly cut through, there were still some persons near the truck, I could not distinguish who they were it was very dark, it was eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be the same two persons that were about the truck when the chest fell off at the end of Fleet-market - A. They did. We went on till we got to the end of Southampton-street, Bloomsbury-square, then I let go the dray, and turned to go up Southampton-street; I said to my fellow servant, there is something the matter now; then I went behind, and found the ropes cut again; the one who I think was Osborne, who had a white apron on, was watching me, whilst I tied the chest, leaning on a post, and his companion with him. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100041"></xptr>fastened the rope, and went on into Russell-square, I left the truck to go and see which way the numbers went; the instant I was going away from the truck, two gentlemen came up to me, and asked me if any thing had been the matter; I was not ten yards from the truck; I said, our rope has been cut all the way; they said, we are two officers. We then went, and delivered all our tea safe and well.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you never lost any one of the chests - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any chest lifted from the truck, though it was not taken away - A. I rather suppose so, at Fleet-market, but I did not see it.</p>

            . On the last day of the former sessions, I saw these two men, when I turned the corner of the Old Bailey, in Newgate-street, I observed Osborne follow the truck down Snow-hill; when they got about half way down Skinner-street, Osborne came to the truck, cut the rope, and took hold of the chest, but it being heavy, he let it fall; they after that, followed the truck up Holborn-hill, and when they got just opposite Red Lion-street, Osborne cut the ropes again, and pulled the chest nearer the back of the truck. When they got into a street near Russell-street, the men with the truck stopped, and one went away from the truck; I went to him, and asked him if he had not the ropes cut; he said, he had.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Osborne take hold of the chest near Red Lion-street - A. He put his arms round the chest, and pulled it from the middle of the truck, near the back part, so as to make it convenient to take off. Ellingham was not near the trunk at all, but all the way along went on the pavement. This was the top chest; he might have drawn it out about a couple of feet; this chest was a common size.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it out of the City of London - A. It was. I did not immediately lay hold of them; I followed them back. I am sure Ellingham was in company with Osborne at the time the ropes were cut. I followed them back into Holborn, and did not take them till I got into the City.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You say that Osborne had cut the ropes in the City of London; you did not take them then into custody - A. I did not; I knew well that he would follow the truck again.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a felony committed, and yet you did not take them - A. I thought it was my duty to follow him still further.</p>
               <p>Q. Ellingham was on the foot-path - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you saw Osborne attempt to move the chest - A. In Russell-square, he took a knife out of his jacket pocket, opened it, and cut the rope.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, you saw Osborne take hold of the chest, and remove it to other part of the truck; why did not you stop him at that moment - A. He let it fall.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean the last attempt - A. That was in Red Lion-street; I was close to him, not a dozen yards off; I kept my eye close upon him; he knew my brother officer, Matthews, better than me.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not take the chest off, or carry it away - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. There has been a consultation among the Justices, whether this was a felony in London or in Middlesex - A. Yes, there has.</p>

            . I am a constable of the City, I was in company with Johnson in Newgate-street; I saw Osborne and Ellingham looking in at a picture shop, I knew Osborne very well. I crossed the way, and then the truck came down Newgate-street. I kept behind Johnson, and followed it pretty close; I saw Osborne go up to the truck in Skinner street, nearly to the bottom of the hill; Ellingham was in the foot path; I saw two men having charge of the truck at the front drawing it, Osborne was dressed like a porter, with a velvet jacket and an apron about him. I saw the chest of tea tumble from the truck, and he went away, I did not see his arms about it then. I was not so near to the truck as Johnson. Osborne knew me well to be a constable, that was my reason for keeping more aloof. Osborne then joined company with Ellingham. The men stopped, and tied the chests on again; Osborne and Ellingham stopped standing against Fleet-market, the truck went right up Holborn-hill, tied behind a dray; the prisoners went up on the left hand side of the way, and I kept on the right. Just near to Red-lion-street, I saw Osborne go up to the truck again; Ellingham was then on the pavement; I saw the sides of the truck give out directly the ropes had been cut; I saw Osborne's arms around the chest of tea, and pull it towards the back of the truck; by the weight being increased at the back of the truck I could see the handle move up a bit, the man turned around, and Osborne left the truck, she went on turned up a Court, and came into the street again, and met Ellingham again and joined his company. They stopped there a good bit, and then walked up and down the path way, and stood against the railing while the men who had the care of the truck were tying the ropes again. The truck went on, and the two prisoners at the bar followed it till, it got to Russell-square, and then I told the men to keep one behind and the other before, and we would take care of the prisoners; the prisoners went down Holborn, and we took them in Holborn; Osborne had this knife in his night hand pocket.

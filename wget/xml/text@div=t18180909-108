On Sunday the 12th of July, between ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon, the prisoner came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090048"></xptr>to my shop in company with another woman, and bought a boy's corderoy dress, and a pair of shoes and stockings, which came to 1l. She gave me a 1l. note. I asked her name, she told me to put her husband's name on it, Conger, Golden-lane, but she did not know the number. She said her husband took the note for his pension. I wrote the name and address on it in her presence. She said it would not be long before she might return again, which she did in ten minutes, and bought a gown for 4s. 6d. and two pelisses which were to be 16s.; she paid 1s. deposit on them. She said she should prevail upon her husband to give her more money, or else he would spend all his pension, as she had left him at the public-house. She returned in a short time, inquired for the pelisses, and bought a man's blue jacket for 9s., she said it was for her husband. She owed me 15s., for the pelisse, she paid me a 1l. note and 4s.; I again asked the name and address, she said she had told me before; I wrote Conger, Golden-lane, on it. She was about a quarter of an hour each time with me, and tried one of the pelisses on. I have not the least doubt of her identity. (Looking at the two notes), They are the same she paid me.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see her again - A.Thirteen days after. I was cleaning the window, and my girl pointed her out to me. I followed her to the corner of Whitecross-street, and then lost her. Next day I saw her at the watch-house, and knew her to be the woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. There was no other customer in the shop. She came in three times, all before twelve o'clock. I did not see her again till thirteen days after, when Hudson pointed her out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned from following her, did you not ask Hudson if she was sure she was the woman - A. I did not. I have not the least doubt of her being the person. I followed her and looked in her face, and knew her; I did not take her, as I wanted to see where she lived. I lost her.</p>
               <p>Q. On Sunday you were told she was taken - A. Yes; Vann and Hudson came together. I wished to look at her again. I do not recollect saying I was not sure she was the person. She had a blue gown on, and a black bonnet with red ribbons.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Farrow. I remember the prisoner coming to his shop and buying the things; she came three times, I saw her each time. She gave the name of Conger, Golden-lane. Thirteen days after, I saw her passing the door, and pointed her out to my master as the woman who had laid out so much money. I did not know the notes were forged then. She was taken the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am fifteen years old. I was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When your master returned from following her, did he not say, are you sure she is the woman - A. He did. She was taken next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he went to see her at the watch-house, did he not say he should go and see if he knew her again - A. Yes; he asked me again when he returned, if I was certain of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say before he went to the magistrate, "I am not certain of her, and I wish you to be certain before you speak to her" - A. Yes; I am certain myself that she is the woman; she had a bonnet on. I pointed her out to Vann, in Crown-court, Grubb-street. He took her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell your master that the same woman was taken who had passed the door - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MARY FARROW. On the 12th of July I saw the prisoner in my husband's shop twice; I was not there the third time. I am certain she is the woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see her for a fortnight after - A. No. I never remember my husband saying he was not certain of her. We only had the door-shutter down on Sunday; the house is not very light.</p>
               <p>THOMAS VANN. I am a constable. I went with Hudson to look for the prisoner. She pointed her out to me in Crown-court, Grubb-street, I took her, and found she lived in Little Crown-court, which leads out of Crown-street. I went to her house and found a bonnet there. She was dressed in a blue gown.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I know a woman of the name of Driscol, she has been in custody, but is now at large. She lives in Farrow's neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she in size and figure something like the prisoner - A. I think her a little taller and more bulky.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find at the prisoner's lodging any of the things which Farrow sold her - A. No; I examined particularly for them, and found twenty-five duplicates, none of which related to them. I believe the prisoner has no son.</p>

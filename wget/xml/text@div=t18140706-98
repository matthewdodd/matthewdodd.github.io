My husband's watch was hanging up at the mantle-piece; I saw it at eleven o'clock. I then went to sweep the stairs, and a person of the description of the prisoner passed me on the stairs. I lodge in the two pair of stairs front room. I am quite sure the watch was safe when I went out of the room to sweep the stairs. I had been on the stairs five minutes. I looked at the watch when I went out of the room, and when I returned the watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the watch again - A. My husband found it the same day.</p>
               <p>MATTHEW MUIRE. On the 2nd of June, I went to work at six o'clock; I went home at twelve o'clock to dinner; my wife told me what she has told you. I suspected a woman in the house; I took up this woman; it proved not be that woman. The magistrates advised me to search the pawnbrokers. I found my watch at Mr Lane's, in Drury-lane. I then went and informed the magistrate. The pawnbroker informed me at five o'clock it was pawned, in the name of White, of Long Acre. On Monday the 10th of June, the pawnbroker informed me he had found the person that had pawned the watch. I went and found the prisoner in Steward's-rents, Drury-lane. I took her to the pawnbrokers; they said she was the person that pawned the watch. I then took the prisoner to the magistrate. That is all I know. The watch that I saw at the pawnbroker's is mine. The pawnbroker has it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HARTLEY. I am a servant at Mr. Lane's. I took in a watch on the 2nd of May of the prisoner, that watch was claimed by Muire. I think it was about twelve o'clock when I took it in. I advanced seventeen shillings upon it. Some time in the course of that day, Muire came; I shewed him the watch. After that, a man brought the, and wanted more money upon it. I told him he could not have more money upon it. I gave information, which caused this woman to be taken up. This is the watch, it is worth twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 2nd of May, as I was walking along the street, a woman was making a bargain with a man to sell a watch; they did not agree. I asked the woman what she wanted for it; she said, twenty-five shillings; I agreed to give her twenty-two, and as I had not enough, I gave her five. I went to Mr. Lane's, and pledged it for seventeen shillings, which made up the deficiency. If I had come dishonestly by the watch I should not have taken it to pledge where I was known.</p>
               <p>Hartley. I never saw the prisoner before, as I know of. She said the watch belonged to her husband. She came alone to the shop.</p>

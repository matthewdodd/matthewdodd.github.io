                  </hi>. I am a coal dealer and earn merchant of Lewisham—the prisoner has been in my service as gardener—he had charge of my barn and seed house—there were a number of building materials in the barn, and some carpets and coal sacks—after he left my service, I sold him some timber, in consequence of which he was working on my premises, taking it down, and he had the key of the barn, as I allowed him the privilege of keeping his tools there—in the beginning of May, I missed a chaise cart from the open shed, in consequence of which I examined the barn, and missed a quantity of cleft wood, ten coal sacks, a leaden pump, an ornamental flower stand, a sack barrow, and a pig trough—the flower stands were in the seed house—it was about four months since I had seen them, but I am sure they were there at the time—I gave the prisoner no authority to sell or remove them—they were my property.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a coal dealer of Perry-hill, Sydenham. I bought some coal sacks of the prisoner at Mr. Fearnley's barn; I had gone there to carry some wood for him—he offered to lend them to me at first, and then he said I might buy them, and I did so—he said he had bought them—he owed me money at this time—I bought eight sacks, and I paid him 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards gave them up to the constable—he had gives me a sack barrow about two months before this.</p>

I live at tie Two Brewers, Perry-hill—I remember the prisoner coming to my house; he asked me if I wanted to buy any flower stands, and said there were some in the greenhouse; I said I would see Mr. Fearnley, and see what he would take for them; he said, "Leave it to me, I can get them cheaper than you can"—he asked me what I would stand for them; I said, "a crown"—he afterwards brought them to me for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for himself—he also brought me a hog trough, and asked if it was of any use to me; I said I did not want it, I had three already; it was left on my premises—I afterwards gave the articles up to the police.</p>

I took the prisoner on 16th May—I told him that there was a quantity of articles missing from Mr. Fearnley's premises, and he was suspected of stealing them—he said he knew nothing about them, and that they were all there when he left—I went there with him—he said the key was kept over the barn, and other parties had access to it as well as he—the key was not there; Mr. Fearnley had got it then—the prisoner showed me where the things had been, and said he knew nothing about them—I then mentioned the pump and the coal sacks to him, but I had not mentioned them when he said he knew nothing about them—I did not mention the flower stands, as I did not know they were missing—I produce a coal sack which I received from Gilbert.</p>

               <p>Q. On the morning of the 30th of May, were you at the stables where the artillery horses are kept? - A. Yes; at about twenty minutes past six in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of them lost their tails, or manes? - A. A lad called to me to look at the horses' tails, there was one horse with the blood running from his tail, that gave me suspicion; and on looking further, I found thirty or forty of their tails maimed and shaved.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen these horses' tails before; were they perfect, had they lost their tails<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040057"></xptr>the over night? - A. No; I saw them safe about six o'clock the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at that time in Mr. Willan's service? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- FISHER sworn. - I am one of the drivers.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 30th of May, what time did you go to the stables where these horses are kept? - A. About a quarter before six o'clock; I found this man cutting the tail of a black horse with his knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cut the tail as well as the hair off? - A. He cut the tail and it bled; he had the hair in his left-hand, and his knife in his right-hand; and when I came up he put the horse's hair in his hat, and put his hat on his head, and said, I am so ill I must go home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the stables besides? - A. Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these horses long tails? - A. Very long tails; in about two or three days after we found a little bunch of grey horse hair, when we were cleaning.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Dirden.) When you found the horses' tails were cut, did you search the stables? - A. No; I do not know what became of the hair, we could not find out any body but this man, we had no suspicions before of any man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It was half past five when I went into the stable, I was very ill and shut up the stable; I came out of the Infirmary three or four days before; I went home to my lodgings, and when I came up again I was stopped at the accompting-house, I know nothing about it; I have been with Mr. Willan these two years, and never was charged with any thing in my life.</p>

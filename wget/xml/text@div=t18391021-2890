                  </hi>. I keep the Black Lion public-house at Bayswater. The prisoner was my pot-boy between two and three months—he took out beer, and was to receive money—Mr. Rochford, of Petersburg-place, was a regular customer of mine—the prisoner had a bill to deliver to him every week, and he said it was not discharged.</p>

On Saturday night, the 28th, he had 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. standing against him, and said I might take his week's wages, which was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but that had nothing to do with this—I sent the bill in to Mr. Roch<lb></lb>ford on the 30th.</p>

I took the prisoner—he said he had received the money, and paid it to Mr. Simpson, who scratched it out of his book, but he supposed he did not know what he was doing, as they were all drunk alike, as they had had an annual dinner that day—he was drunk when I took him, and very abusive.</p>

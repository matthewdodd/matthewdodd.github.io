                  </hi>. I am a printer, at Rathbone-place. On Sunday morning, 9th Jan., about three o'clock, I saw the prisoner in a coffee-shop, in High-street, St. Giles'—I gave her a cup of coffee, and went with her to a house in Church-lane—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had a sovereign and a half-crown in my trowsers pocket—I laid down on the bed with her, with my trowsers on, and felt her hand in my pocket—I laid hold of it—she ran out of the room—I felt in my pocket, and missed the money—I went into the street, and told a policeman—there was a woman asleep in the same bed—the pri-soner said it was her sister.</p>

On the 17th of July, about two o'clock, I was at the Three Compasses, public-house; I saw the prisoner and three other women there - I had seen the prisoner before; I remained there about half an hour: I had some gin and porter - I then went home with the prisoner, to some street near the <placeName id="t18270913-261-crimeloc1478">Commercial-road</placeName>

I saw her take my money, but not my watch; she went out - I then got up, and missed my watch: which I have not seen since - I lost 14s. I was about an hour and a half with her, and am certain of her; I was quite sober - I suppose the heat of the room made me sick.</p>

               <p>I live in the Hay-market. I have seen the prisoner Martignon but once, but the prisoner Villoni several times, because he used to visit a lady that lived with me: at half past nine at night Villoni brought Martignon to my lodgings; about six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>What passed between the two prisoners at that time, in your hearing? - Martignon told her he was going to leave Mr. and Mrs. Daubigny; that they were very much dissatisfied with him: Villoni said he had nothing to complain of, against Mr. Daubigny, that he behaved very civil to him, and had every thing he could wish; Martignon made answer, that he was not in the same case, for whatever he did did not give satisfaction. When Martignon and Villoni were sitting together, Martignon says to Villoni, I wish to be avenged of Daubigny; and Villoni said to him, there is no way to be avenged of him, than by doing what you know: Martignon sat about a quarter of an hour at the house, and then went away; they both went away.</p>
               <p>Did they, either of them say any thing more on that subject? - They said nothing more; and Martignon said, to-morrow at breakfast we shall meet one another.</p>
               <p>Did either of them say where they were to meet at breakfast? - He said, we shall find one another at breakfast, where you know very well; and we shall see one another about that locksmith that we were talking of; I asked what is the matter? oh, says he, that is not the business of the women; they have not discretion enough to keep a secret; he came the Sunday before he was guilty of that felony, to ask me whether I had heard any news from Paris; and said, he was going to Ireland, that he had taken a place to Ireland, and was going there.</p>
               <p>Did you see them afterwards at the Hay-market? - At half after seven the same night of the robbery Villoni came to her.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him at that time? - I had no conversation at all; he left me at the top of the Hay-market, and I went another way.</p>

               <p>I was on a visit to Mrs. Daubigny. I remember the time when this chest was missing; it was the third of April; I saw it on the third of April; and a few days before I saw it in the parlour, on the sofa; Villoni was in the house, a servant at that time; Villoni asked me how much there was in that chest? to which I answered, I did not know; says he, well, how much do you think there is? he took it up in his hands, and tried it, and said, oh, d - n it, it is very heavy, and if any body wanted to take it away it would be a very hard matter to do it. On the Saturday, the 3d of April, I was up stairs, in the evening, between four and five, in Mrs. Daubigny's room; it was the room where the chest was kept; the chest was safe then; I sat down upon it; Villoni came up stairs while I was in Mrs. Daubigny's room, and went into his own room; I believe it was about five o'clock; after he had locked his door he called me two or three times; I did not answer; my door was shut; then he opened the door, and asked me what business I had in the room by myself; I said, what is that to you? then he told me to come down to tea, that Mr. and Mrs. Daubigny were gone out; I said, by and by; a few minutes after Mrs. Daubigny sent for me to tea; I went down, and found this Villoni drinking tea in the parlour, with a cup of tea in his hand; I sat down to drink tea; after he had drank that cup of tea he got up, and asked for a drop or two of Marraskeen to make sweetmeats; then he went out; I know nothing more; I saw him no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240136"></xptr>more; in about five or six minutes I went to Mrs. Daubigny's room; I observed the door was shut and locked; then I came down and told Mrs. Daubigny that the door was locked; Mrs. Daubigny answered me I was a fool; I went up again and found it locked, and asked the maid for the key; the house maid came up stairs and found it locked; she tried to open it, and could not; then I got a key and opened it, and went in, and the chest was open; the hasp was not down; we went and informed Mrs. Daubigny; she came up with me; we looked into the chest, and the small iron chest was gone; I observed marks of force on the iron chest; it appeared to be opened by force; after that we went up stairs, all over the house, to look for Villoni; we did not find his clothes there; and likewise in his own room, nothing was there; it was all taken away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. Do you say that there was nobody up stairs but Villoni? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>You do not pretend to say that nobody was up stairs? - No.</p>
               <p>Is it a large chest? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose any body could open it without a hammer, or some great noise? - They could not have opened it without force.</p>
               <p>You heard no noise? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you hear Villoni go up stairs? - No; when I sat down upon the chest I am sure it was safe locked.</p>

               <p>I was house maid to Mrs. Daubigny. I remember being up stairs a short time before, in the evening, about candle-light; it might be twenty minutes or half an hour before the box was missing; I was in the room where the box was; as I was coming out of the room, from turning down the bed, I met Villoni at the top of the stairs, in the dark.</p>
               <p>How near did you meet Villoni to the bed chamber of your master? - Close by the door; he was in the dark; I had a candle; he had something in his left hand, but what I cannot say; I said nothing to him, but went into another room, to turn down the beds; he went into the confectioner's room, and opened it; there are three rooms together; I says to him, here Monsieur, here is a candle for you; and he said, in broken English, no, tank you, no, tank you; I went down stairs and told my mistress I had turned down the beds; she desired I would get the tea: I went up stairs in about twenty minutes after; when I went up stairs I found the door locked; I left it shut, not locked; I unlocked the door, and found the box of the lock broke, and the clasps were gone of the latch, like, so as you might put your hands in; I found the box also had been broke open, and the small chest had been taken away; Villoni was gone, and all his things were gone; he had not left my master's service.</p>
               <p>Mr. Best, another of Prisoners Counsel. Was this a very bulky parcel that Villoni had in his hand? - I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Was not the confectioner's room his place? - No, he was mostly in the kitchen, and did his work mostly in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Was not the confectioner's room chiefly his apartment? - Yes; but he liked to be in the kitchen for company.</p>
               <p>Did not he spend much more time there, than in the kitchen? - No; he never was up there in the dark; he never worked there.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose this large chest could have been opened without a large hammer, or something to make a noise? - The chest is abused very much; the rooms lay very backward, and we could not hear it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the small chest? - Yes; I carried it up stairs once, and put it into the box, but it is a good bit ago.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Daubigny. The great chest was in my own room; Mr. Daubigny had the key at that time; it is a chest that we keep our property in, in general; I was alarmed about this door being locked; the two servants came down and told me that their master's chest was open; I went up stairs with a candle; when I came up the chest<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240137"></xptr>was upon the hasp; there is a hasp to the chest; it locks with a padlock, as well as a substantial lock to it; that hasp was fallen on the side of the chest; I saw the lock broke; I conceived some depredation had been committed; I said, good God! I am robbed, the iron chest is gone; all the servants came round; every one was at home, except Villoni: I looked round my own room to see that every thing was safe; nothing else was missing; I searched every room; and Villoni's was the last; and when I came to his room, I found every thing that he had, was gone; he had not left the least thing in the world; I said Villoni must have robbed me; and then we pursued him: I went up stairs about one; I met Villoni at the door; he went to the confectionary room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You do not know what was in the iron chest? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Had not your husband and Villoni fallen out? - They had no words; I never heard he was to leave us; when I saw Martignon, his countenance was cast down, before Sir Sampson; he denied every thing: Villoni said he would confess every thing; Sir Sampson took it down; I was with him.</p>
               <p>There were no promises or threats to induce him to confess? - I said before Sir Sampson, if you do not confess, you will be hanged; but he did not confess after that.</p>

               <p>I keep the Subscription-house in St. James's-street: this small chest was lodged in my care; and placed by me or my wife, in the plate chest, of which one of us kept the key; I saw it there two or three days before, when I was writing; I had not taken it out for any purpose: when I locked the plate chest about the Wednesday before it was lost, I remember I saw it there; when I came home, I found the house all in confusion: on Monday I pursued Villoni down the river, to Greenwich; and from there I took a post-chaise to Gravesend; from there to Sheerness; and from there I took a ship to Harwich-harbour, where I took the man. I went on board the Good Intent, Captain Cook, bound for Helvetsluys; I was down in the cabin; and I looked down, and found him laying on a bed in the cabin, in his great coat; I desired him directly to deliver me the money; I first of all said to him, give me the money you have robbed me of? his answer was, Sir, I have got but twenty-two guineas and a half; and he gave me twenty-two guineas and an half directly, and four shillings with it: I promised to intercede for him, if he would make a confession: the constable took seven guineas out of one pocket, and eight out of another; I then told him that was far from the sum he had robbed me of; and if he would give it me, if there was any deficiency, if I could intercede with the gentlemen or the Court, I would; he gave me a ten pound note, and a certain number of fifty guinea notes of Hammersley, upon which I made memorandums: he put his hand into bed, and brought out a bundle wrapped in a handkerchief; I opened it, and there was a powder bag with four hundred and forty-eight guineas in gold: Villoni was then in my service; I had a great respect for him; I wished to keep him; I know nothing to affect Martignon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Did you know there was any money in the chest? - Yes, I did; I was present the last time it was opened; (I can certainly say there was money in it) which was the 10th of March.</p>
               <p>Do you know that there were not brass or copper, or some metal counters in that chest? - I never saw any but gold and roleaus, notes, and some gold: this money belongs to several gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At your club they do not play, as the gentleman supposes, for brass and counters, but for gold and notes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On the 10th of March, you saw there were cash and notes in the box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As far as you know, it never was opened again? - No.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner; I began to unbutton his clothes to strip him; and I pulled off his clothes and stockings, and found nothing there; then I unbuttoned his great coat, and his other coat, and his waistcoat; and he pointed to the lining of his waistcoat; and I pulled out the notes, and handed them to Mr. Daubigny; there were five fifty guinea notes of Hammersley; one twenty-five guinea of the same banker, and a ten pound bank note; that was all the notes; then he went to his bed, and brought out a bundle in a hair-dresser's bag, containing four hundred and forty-eight guineas, with a piece of ribbon round it, and a handkerchief round that; I searched every part of the cabbin, but found no more; then we brought him on shore; we handcuffed him, and brought him to town that morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. I believe you threatened him, when you accosted him first? - I took him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Court to Daubigny. Was this little chest taken out of the great box between the 10th of March and the 3d of April? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Who kept the key during that time? - I, myself; but sometimes I give the key to Mrs. Daubigny, because there are other keys with that key.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Daubigny. Do you know the last time it was used in the club? - It has has never been opened since the time it was put in, since the 10th of March; I am very sure it has never been to any gentleman since that; I was asked for it once; and I did not deliver it, because I had not the key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Was not it in your parlour sometimes? - Only when it was called for.</p>
               <p>But was it not on the sofa? - Yes; then it was in my care: Villoni came into the room, and sat down on the couch; and

            . I am an officer. I applied to Carpenter on the 22nd of November, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030095"></xptr>asked him to go with me to Westminster, and we went to the Feathers, where I searched him; he had no money - I gave him five good shillings; I told him to go and stand against the lamp-post opposite the Feathers, about six or seven yards off - I remained in the tap-room, and had a full view of him; when he had been there a quarter of an hour, I saw the prisoner come up with a pipe in his mouth - I saw them speak together, and then the prisoner pulled something out of his pocket; I saw it was money, but could not tell what coin - I saw it told out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It was not in paper then? A. Yes, it was - I could not ascertain what it was; I saw Carpenter telling it out of one hand into the other - I had seen Carpenter give the prisoner something into his hand; I saw it was money - I had no authority from the officers of the Mint to employ Carpenter on this occasion; I had no intimation at all - I did not see any money in Carpenter's hand, except what he told into the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q. Did you see any money told out by Carpenter except what he gave the prisoner? A. No, except the money he told out of the parcel; the prisoner then went away, and Carpenter came over towards me; I took him to a public-house, and found a score of shillings in his waistcoat pocket - these are them; they are in the same paper now - I took the prisoner on the Saturday following - I said "I want you for some bad coin which you have been making away with;" he said he knew nothing about it - he had nothing on him; I took him before the Magistrate, who detained him till I let the gentlemen of the Mint know of it; there was another person with the prisoner when I took him, on whom I found some utensils of the trade, but he has escaped.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came the prisoner to come to the corner of the street to meet Carpenter - had you made any arrangement to procure his attendance? A. No, it was pure accident - I did not in the least expect he would come there; I took no steps to procure his attendance.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q. Had you no knowledge of the prisoner's coming to the corner of the street? A. Yes, I understood he was coming there; I made a mistake when I told his Lordship it was pure accident - I had information where he was to come.</p>
               <p>JURY. We cannot rely on either of these witnesses.</p>

I went after him in consequence of what my partner said, and asked him what he had thrown over the pales; he said, it was corn he was allowed by his master to feed his horses. I asked if there was anything else in the sack - he said,</p>
               <p>"No;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Well, we will go and see what it contains," and as we went along, he said, there was a few potatoes which he dug out of his own garden, and had promised them to the hostler; he said afterwards, that he picked the sack up in the road. I found it contained three pecks of oats, and 50 or 60 lbs. of potatoes.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I saw the prisoner coming from the paling of the public-house. got over, and found the sack of potatoes and oats. Ellis brought him back. He said it was allowed him by his master for the horses, and he was going to leave it there till he returned, as he generally fed there, and he brought the potatoes for the hostler, as he had done him several favours. That the sack was his own. I asked if his master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100097"></xptr>had any waggon on the road. He then said he found the sack altogether as it was, and supposed it must have dropped from his master's waggon, which was gone on, and he left it there to be owned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say where he got the potatoes - A. He said he got them from his own home. I do not recollect his saying he had dog them himself.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—on 15th August, about 3 o'clock, the deceased was brought in insensible; we rallied him somewhat, but he relapsed into a state of coma, and died ten hours after his admission from fracture of the base of the skull and laceration of and hæmorrhage of the brain—that must be caused by a fall or a blow on the back of the head; falling with the whole weight of the body on the back of the head would do it, but a direct blow would not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of the Commercial Road—the deceased was a licensed messenger at Leadenhall Market—I had known him some time—the prisoner is a flower hawker—on 15th August, I saw the prisoner in the market with a pot of ale in his hand and a glass offering the deceased some drink—he refused, and said that he had had enough, and the prisoner threw the ale on Hutley, between his shirt and trousers—Hutley said nothing—the prisoner filled the glass again and threw it over him—the deceased then went to the prisoner's basket, took up a plant in a pot, and threw it down—I do not know whether it went on to the ground or into the basket again—the prisoner then struck Hutley on his mouth, and he fell down in the road on his head—he was insensible—the prisoner assisted me to pick him up, and we sat him on the kerb—the prisoner told me to hold him while he went to fetch some water, but he never returned—the deceased was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe they were friends—they were in the habit of drinking together—this occurred in the hide market, and the beer was brought out of the Lamb Tavern—the deceased was sitting on a basket with me, and he went over to the prisoner—he did not appear to have been drinking, he appeared to throw the flower pot to break it—he took it with both hands, but did not raise it very high—I will swear that he did not attempt to throw it at the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Gliddon—I was at my window upstairs, and saw the prisoner and the deceased—Smith asked him to have half a pint of beer, which he refused, saying that he had had enough—Smith left, and came back with a pot and a glass of ale, and offered the deceased a glass, which he refused to take; Smith then upset part of it over him, and then offered it to him again, he refused, and Smith upset the re<lb></lb>mainder—Hutley then turned round to Smith's basket, took out a flower pot with a plant in it, and was going to throw it down, but it fell back into Smith's basket—Smith then struck him a blow on the mouth which caused him to fall backwards—I went to my husband in the next room and told him.</p>

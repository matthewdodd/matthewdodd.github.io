            . I have been a gentleman's servant, but am now out of place - I live at Tottenham. I applied to the prisoner for employ, and he employed me to work in the garden adjoining the factory - on the 26th of July I was working there; he came to me in the evening, and told me to meet him at the gate, at half-past eight o'clock - I met him; he had a sack under his arm - he unlocked the back part of the factory, took me up stairs into the factory, and he put one end of some gas-pipe into the sack, and told me to put the other end in - I do not remember any being put into a basket; he came to me again on the 7th of August, about half-past nine o'clock at night, and told me to take a sack to Mr. Glover, the horsekeeper at the Red Lion, and to tell him that he should be there in half an hour - he told me the horse-keeper was to empty the sack, and I was to bring the sack back; I do not know what was in it - it was some sort of metal, and not very light; I saw the horse-keeper turn it out - it was some brass pipe and some gas-pipe; when I went back he sent me with another parcel, and when I got there with that, he came and ordered the horse-keeper to pack it up in a sack - the prisoner wrote a direction, and gave it to the horse-keeper, who gave it to me to tie on the sack - I cannot read, and do not know what it was; I tied it on the sack - the horse-keeper told me to wait till the errandcart came, and when it came I brought the sack out, and put it on the shafts of the cart; the prisoner was not there then, but he ordered the horse-keeper to put it on the errand-cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known him long? A. No, not till I went to work in his garden - I never saw his father; the pipes were not fixed, but laying loose about on his floor.</p>

            . I found some pipes in the factory - I have fitted some of these ends to them, and they fit exactly.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to NATHANIEL CHURCHILL. Q. Were all the things you put into the sack, pipes with ends, or some ends without pipes? A. Some ends without pipes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could the ends, which this gentleman says he fitted to other pipes, have belonged to the pipes you took away? A. I do not know; the chief of the things I took were pipes with ends to them; I cannot swear that these are any of the ends I took away.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH FORSTER. I took the prisoner on the 13th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060121"></xptr>August, at King's house; I read the warrant to him - he said he did not expect that; and on the 18th, when I was bringing him to Newgate he said he did it on purpose to be transported, as he wished to get out of the country; and if this did not do, he would commit forgery to a great amount, for he could do it as well as any man in England.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell whether these are what were taken on the 7th of August? A. No; many of these ends fitted to pipes remaining on the building - the pipes to which these fitted, were not taken away.</p>
               <p>MR. FIDLER. The manufactory and the property in it belonged to Mr. Trebout, Sen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came the prisoner to take charge of the garden? A. By consent of his father; he applied to me for part, and I would not let him have it - his father has had the premises for twenty years; these gas-fittings were not used in his business - they were in the lacemaking business about three years ago, and since then they have become useless - I live close by, and had a power of attorney to take care of the premises; there are some fields at the back of the premises to which persons may have access, but not to these premises - I supplied the prisoner with 10s. a week by his father's order, but I deducted 4s. a week out of it for the garden, which was worth a great deal more; he could get a good living by the garden - it was full of fruit; his father ordered me to give him 4l. more - I did not give it him at one time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know of any gates being taken away? A. No; that I swear.</p>

The deceased did not appear much hurt; they were both carried away in men's arms. Platt came into my shop about eight o'clock, and said he was as well as ever he was, except his face; he walked away eating oranges - he had been drinking; I cannot say whether he was sober or not - I thought he looked as if liquor had affected him. I saw him about half-past eleven o'clock again, he was then poorly; I stopped half an hour with him - he said he was better, and began to reach very violent.</p>

I opened his head; there was an extravasation of blood on the brain, which occasioned his death; I cannot say it was produced by the fight; it was too extensive to come from a blow, it might be from a fall - I think it could not be produced by intoxication; it appeared to be from great violence, and could not have happened above three days previous.</p>

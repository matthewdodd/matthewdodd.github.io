                  </hi>. I am an iron-plate worker, and live in York<lb></lb>place, Christ Church, Surrey—I rent the whole house. About a quarter to eight o'clock on the night of the 10th of March, in consequence of information, I went into Thorough-street, which is about one hundred and fifty yards from my house, and saw the prisoner and a lad about fourteen yean old—the prisoner passed me with some articles—I found nobody further on and returned, and then found the prisoner kneeling down—I nearly stepped on him—I looked over his shoulder—he asked me what I was looking at—I said, "Nothing particular"—he said, "You can go on"—I said, "I know that," and as he rose up I collared him, and told him I thought he had something belonging to me—I brought him towards the gas-light, and saw the tea-caddy and work-box shine through the hand<lb></lb>kerchief—I afterwards found the table cover in William-street, in the road—I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the night of the 10th of March, I heard a noise in the front-parlour, like the rattling of plates' and dishes—I had noticed the window between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, it was then down—I went into the parlour on bearing. the noise, and found the window and one blind open, and missed from the table a piece of beef, a tea-caddy, a work-box, a table-cloth, and a table-cover—I had fastened the blinds and shut the window down that day, and they remained so till I heard the noise—it would require a light to see into the parlour at eight o'clock—I took a candle with me—there was the appearance of a candle having been on the table, and a lucifer match, and a smell of sulphur.</p>

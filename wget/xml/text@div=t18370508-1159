                  </hi>. I live at Greenwich. On Easter Monday, the 27th of March, I was going through Clapham New Park, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, and a man came running to me with a heavy step—he met me—he seized me by the left arm, and seized my bag, but did not take it—I resisted—I had the bag on my left arm, it was a reticule bag—he put his other arm round me and held me tight, and said, "I want your money"—(I had said nothing more to him than, "What do you mean"?)—I said, "I have no money"—he said, "No money"? most emphatically—he came round behind me and clasped me with both arms—he felt round me for my pockets, and felt my watch, in a little pocket, fastened to my stays, under my dress—he put his hand under my dress, and found the pocket-hole—he tore the watch off by main force, upon which I uttered a shrill shriek—he tore the pocket and all off my stays—it was stitched on—it was a plain gold watch, which I have worn for many years—when I tried to shriek, he said, "Ah, do that again, and I will do for you"—and he brought an instrument round to my throat, and held it there for the space of a moment—I saw him afterwards suspend the watch for a moment in his hand—I saw the left side of his face for that instant—I did not minutely observe it, but his dress and person were remarkable—I had not seen his face before that time, for I was carrying a parasol before me, which prevented my seeing it at first—he had examined my glass before I felt him pull it out of my girdle—he returned, cut the string off my neck with the instrument he held to my throat, I suppose, and took off the glass—he came and took my bag after all, then touched my left shoulder, and said, "Now you may go on, don't make a noise"—he stopped for a moment to look forward, as if to see if any body was coming, and I saw the other side of his face completely—he had his hat on—he was in a dark coat, fastened in front, and drab-coloured trowsers—that is the man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the prisoner Young</hi>)—I have since seen the watch at Turner's the pawnbroker's—I had no opportunity of observing his front-face—I am positive he is the man who robbed me—I was calm, because I did not understand it at first—I have felt very much more since it happened, and have been very unwell—I felt some alarm and fright, and I felt much distressed about the man—I did not feel uncertain about his being the man—I had never seen him before—he was brought to me on the Saturday following by a policeman—I was then certain of him, but I felt such dreadful terror at identify<lb></lb>ing a man, and he perhaps being hanged through it—I was in a dread<lb></lb>ful nervous state, and fetched out of my bed to see him—I felt dreadfully nervous, and 1 therefore declined saying he was the man—I said I was afraid 1 could not say he was the man—I did not decidedly say he was not the man—it was not a taller man than him—that is the man who robbed me (<hi rend="italic">looking at him</hi>)—he was brought again at my request, for I was extremely angry with myself at saying I could not say he was the man, when I found it would not be a hanging matter, and I went to the station-house in Scotland-yard, when he was taken a second time—I saw him before the Magistrate, and identified him the first time—that was</p>

               <p>last Wednesday fortnight, the 26th of April; but on the Saturday after the robbery I said I was afraid 1 could not identify him—I went to the Hall again last Wednesday, and knew him then perfectly—he is certainly the man—I did not see his front-face till he was brought to me—he is the man, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Young</hi>. The first word she spoke was wrong—she said it was between one and two o'clock at Union-hall, and now she says between two and three o'clock. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Young</hi>. When I was taken up by the policeman, she said it was between one and two o'clock, and I told her I did not go out till between two and three—to-day she says it was between two and three o'clock—I was fetched out of the hospital, and brought to the lady, and she said I was not the man; that it was a young man about twenty years of age, rather taller than me, and no whiskers. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I said I dared not identify him—I guessed his age to be about twenty—I said nothing about his height—as to his whiskers, the hat might conceal them—I described his person at the request of the police, and said he was a middle size, rather short than tall—I did not see his whiskers—he was rather pallid, and I said I supposed he had not any whiskers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Young</hi>. She said I was not the man, and her sister gave me a shilling. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not say it decidedly, it is impossible—I did not say he was not the man—I did not give him a shilling, or desire any body to give him one—it was unknown to me—I did not see any shilling given him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Young</hi>. The lady went to bed when she said I was not the person, and the policeman said, "I cannot detain him, then," and she said, "Oh, no, don't detain him." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, I did not—the policeman had sent me word that ha could not detain him, before I came down stairs—I said nothing about his detention—I did not tell the policeman he need not detain him—I was informed he could not be detained unless I identified him.</p>

I apprehended Young on Saturday, the 1st of April, in Easter week—I told him I wanted him to accompany me to Brixton—he said, "No," and afterwards he said, "Yes"—I took him to Brixton station-house, and took him up to the prosecutrix's house on the same day—she was ill in bed—it was about half-past twelve o'clock—she came down, and saw the prisoner, and said he answered the description—he said he was innocent—she told him no, it could not be, for He was the man who had robbed her on Easter Monday—she asked him to turn side-face—he did so, and then she asked him to turn the other side-face—he did so—then she asked him to turn round with his back to her—he did so—then she said he was the man; but from the hesitation and fright, she said she should not like positively to swear to him, as she was so ill, and asked me if I could detain him—I said no, I had orders from the Super<lb></lb>intendent that unless she could identify the man, not to detain him—he again said he was innocent—the lady said she hoped he was, but she doubted it, for he answered the description in every point; and she said if there was any</p>

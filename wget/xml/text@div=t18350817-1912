                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Wallis Dare, a hosier and haberdasher, and live in Walworth-road. The prisoner was one week in his employ as a shop-boy—he had access to the till to put money in—on the 20th of July, I took a half-sovereign, at ten o'clock in the morning—I put it into the till and I missed it at five o'clock in the afternoon—there was a cash-bood and a memorandum-bood kept in the till—the half-sovereign was not marked, but it was the only piece of gold I gave change for that day.</p>

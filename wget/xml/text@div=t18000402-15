               <p>Q. And then you entered into a fresh engagement for the half-guinea? - A. Yes; he gave me a half-guinea with a bit out of it, and said he had no more; and then I said, let me have two more seven-shilling-pieces; he then gave me five that I left, and out of the five I took two seven-shilling-pieces, that, with the half-guinea, came to four shillings, and I gave him two half-crown pieces; I asked him for a bit of paper, which he gave me; and then I wrapped them all up in it, and put it in my right-hand pocket, and then Mr. Lawrence came in directly.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. On Thursday the 20th of March, I went with Mead and Clark to the Fleet-prison; Clark searched her, and she had no money about her, but the marked money that he gave her; I went up into Pougher's room, and found in Mary Mead's right-hand pocket, a paper, containing five seven shilling pieces and a half-guinea, and a half-crown, loose in her pocket; a half-guinea with a piece out of it, and a half-crown loose in her pocket, which I had seen delivered to her. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Mead. That is the money that I received from Pougher.</p>
               <p>Lawrence. I searched the apartments, turned up the bed, and between the sacking and the bed, I found this brown paper, containing fifty-seven bad sixpences, seventeen shillings, and three seven shilling pieces in a little bit of paper; I asked Mead how she came by them, and she immediately pointed to the prisoner at the bar, and said, she had them of him; she told me she gave one shilling a-piece for the seven shilling pieces, and two shillings for the half-guinea; after we had made the search, a man came into the room, which I understood was a prisoner in the same room; I asked him, in the presence of the prisoner, which was his bed, he pointed to a bed at the bottom of the room, where there was a bureau-bedstead, he said it was his bed; that was not the bed that I found the money under.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you stay in the lodge while Mrs. Mead went up stairs? - A. Yes, I searched her.</p>

            ; I was present when he was convicted in April Sessions, 1798.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking at the prisoner at the bar, are you sure he was the person who was convicted at that time, of what is stated upon this record, putting off counterfeit gold? - A. I have not the least doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Is that paper signed by Mr. Shelton? - A. I do not think it is his hand-writing; I did not see it signed at all; I had it from Mr. Fitzpatrick.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Fitzpatrick's name to it? - A.Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley objected that there was no evidence of its being a copy of the record.</p>
               <p>The original record was then produced by Mr. Shelton.</p>
               <p>Pawell. - Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When was that man tried? - A. In April 1798.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that - do you mean to say you recollect it? - A.Perfectly well, I had known him before.</p>
               <p>Q.Without having seen the record, and having an opportunity of refreshing your memory, could you have said, that that man was convicted in that April sessions? - A. I don't know that I should have recollected that it was April; I referred to the indictment which I myself drew.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Did you prosecute that man for the offence imputed by this record? - A. I did, I am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a man of the name of Rogers a witness upon that trial? - A. He was.</p>

I am one of the Police-officers, of Shadwell; I apprehended the prisoner upon a charge of felling counterfeit gold, he was tried for it in this Court, with a woman, who called herself his wife, and was convicted in April 1798; I am certain he is the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Powell then told you he was the man that had been convicted? - A. I have the day of apprehension in my book.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, could you undertake to say what the day was, without having had reference to that book? - A. I was positive it was either April or May, but when I looked at my book, I knew it was April.</p>
               <p>Q. But you were not, before that, certain whether it was April or May? - A. No.</p>

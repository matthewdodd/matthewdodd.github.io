               <p>I was at the Opera-house on a Tuesday, when this gentleman lost his watch, I was second chairman.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner, Did you ever see him before? - Yes; that night at the Opera-house, he put his hand to that gentleman, (the prosecutor) and took the watch out of the gentleman's pocket, the gentleman said he had lost his watch, I took hold of the man and told the gentleman, this man has got your watch, the man let it drop, Adams picked up the watch, I did not see him pick it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>I am an Irishman; it was about half past ten, near eleven, it was close to the opera-house door this happened, just as the gentleman came out; I was close to the Baron, and the two ladies by his side; there were about four people close together, I was plying for a fare, the coach ran up to me; I saw the prisoner take it, I took hold of him, I saw him take the watch from the gentleman's pocket, I was close to the Baron's shoulder, there was no croud on the lower side of the door between us, but there was on the other side; I saw him endeavouring to put the watch in his breeches, I delivered him to the constable.</p>
               <p>Yon would swear this on the Cross as well as the Evangelist? - I would swear it on any cross, I would swear nothing but the truth; I cannot say that is the case of the watch he took away.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a link lighter; the Dutchess of Bedford's coach was coming up, and another, two coachmen flogging their horses<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200010"></xptr> against one another; there was a great noise; I saw him touch the chain, I cannot swear he took it out of the gentleman's; pocket; I heard the watch fall, and the glass broke, I pick'd it up, it was very dirty, I gave it into the lady's hands, dirty as it was; by the glimpse of the link I saw it laying on the ground, the case flew from the watch.</p>
               <p>To the Baron. How long after the watch was found did you see it? - Very soon.</p>
               <p>Is that your watch-case? - I believe it is, from the general shape and appearance; I suppose it is my watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. HOUBLON sworn.</p>
               <p>Look at the watch case, did you ever see that before? - Yes; I will take out the lining, and I can tell better; (he took it out) I made up that watch, but did not make the case, I sold it to the Baron Kutzleben, there is the mark of the case maker; that is the case I sold to the Baron.</p>
               <p>To the Baron. Was that the case of the watch you purchased from that gentleman, and had in your pocket that evening? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination of Houblon.</p>
               <p>I have sold many cases of that sort and description; I judge of it by the maker's name; the watch was almost new, not made six months.</p>
               <p>It is impossible you can tell the case without some private mark? - It is the case of my making up, I am positive it is what I sold the Baron; I know it from being a larger pattern than common, like a mock repeater, a large hole; it was like a mock repeater, a large hole to wind it up.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon you to swear that is the case you sold to the Baron? - Yes; I am positive of it.</p>

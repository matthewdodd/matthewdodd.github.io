            . I was on duty in Clare-market last Sunday afternoon, about three o'clock; I saw the prisoner run very fast by me - I heard Stop thief! called, and I pursued him; he threw down this handkerchief - I took it up, and still pursued him; he was stopped some distance further, and I took him.</p>

            . Q. Where did this happen? A. In Drury-court - it is about 100 yards long; I was at one end, and this happened pretty near the other; the court is nine or ten feet wide - I was on the opposite side of the way to the prisoner, and could therefore see the better - I did not see any other boy in the court.</p>

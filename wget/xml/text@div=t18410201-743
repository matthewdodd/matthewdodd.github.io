                  </hi>. I am foreman to George Adam Young, a builder, in Harper-street, Red-lion-square—the prisoner was in his employ for about two months. We had a job in Gracechurch-street—on the 1st of February I called to the prisoner to stop as he was about leaving those premises—he pretended not to hear me, he went outside—I went out, and found him just turning round the hoarding—I said I suspected that he had some lead about him—he said he was sure he had not—I said I was pretty well sore be had, and I must search him—I told him to go back—he went up stairs—I followed him—he went partly up the second flight of stairs—I saw him take a quantity of lead from his person, and drop it down the well-hole which is there—he took it from about the waistband of his clothes—he had got it out in his hand before I saw it—I said I had seen enough, there was sufficient—I got a policeman, and then I picked up this lead, which turned out to be a piece of three-quarter lead, and some service pipe which we were using in the basement of the premises—part of it was for a water-closet—when I returned back from going for the policeman the pri<lb></lb>soner was gone—I saw him next day in a public-house in Tooley-street, and gave him into custody—he refused to go, and threw the policeman down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plasterer. I was at work there—the prisoner passed me with Robinson behind him—I heard a noise when the lead fell, and Robinson called out for me to look out that it did not fall upon me—it fell perhaps five feet from me—there was about 21lbs. —the prisoner escaped at that time—I went with Robinson and the officer to the public-house the next day—there was some scuffling, and I was struck by the prisoner's wife.</p>

I turned about and put it off my shoulder; I said, if it is your property it is not mine; if it is your's take it, or if it is your master's take it; he said, it is not mine nor my master's as I know of; I said, if it is not your's lend me a hand with it upon my shoulder, which he did; I went on with it to Benjamin-street, and rested several times; Rogers came up to me, and asked me where I was going with it, I said, if it was not his or his master's I was going to sell it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and have chambers in Grace-church-street. The prisoner was in my service about a month, as clerk—on Friday, 1st Aug., I left my chambers about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, leaving in a drawer three sovereigns, a half-crown, and seven shillings in a paper, and</p>

               <p>a blue silk purse with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note in it, and three or four sovereigns in sove<lb></lb>reigns or half-sovereigns—there were some postage-stamps in the drawer—I went to the chambers again on Saturday morning a little after 10—the prisoner had been in the habit of coming a little before 10—he had no autho<lb></lb>rity to remain away without my permission—this bit of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the paper in which the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was wrapped—the blue silk purse, with the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note and the three or four sovereigns, was likewise gone—this paper and some postage-stamps was found on the prisoner—it is of the same size, and precisely the same appearance, as that the money was in—on one side of it is a ragged mark, and close to it the paper is crumpled; and there is the mark of a half-crown, in wrapping the money in, I pressed on it—this paper had been in my drawer about ten days—I was frequently in the habit of going to that drawer—there was no one in my chambers but the prisoner—I found the drawer locked the next day—I had the key in my possession—I saw the prisoner again at 6 on the Saturday evening—he came to my private residence in Tavistock-place, and said, "I have come to tell you I have been away all day; I thought you might be angry, and I came to tell you"—I told him I knew it, and asked him to come back to my chambers with me—I did not say a word about my loss till I got to my chambers—I then gave him into custody to Edmonds—I told the prisoner I was very sorry I was obliged to do so, and I asked him to tell me what he had been doing with himself—he said he had met three <hi rend="italic">chums</hi> after he had been to the Eastern Counties Rail<lb></lb>way, and they persuaded him to go and dine with them, and he did; and they dined at some public-house between Bishopsgate-street and Whitechapel, but he could not tell the name—I asked him to give me the names of the three persons he had been with—he said he could not; but afterwards, on being pressed, he said one was named Thompson, and the other, Jones.</p>

I took the prisoner—he was sitting at his desk, and Mr. Sparke was looking in the drawer where he lost the money—I came to where the prisoner was—he could see that he was suspected, and he said, "So help me God, I have not touched the money!"—Mr. Sparke asked him to account for his time—he said be had been to see a relation, named Robinson, off to fiury St. Edmunds by the Eastern Counties Railway, and that he there met with some friends—I then told him I was a police-constable, and he had no call to answer without he thought proper—he said they were three young men from Bristol—he mentioned two names, but he could not give their address, and I did not notice the names—he could not tell what they had for dinner—I asked what be paid for his dinner—he said his friends stood treat; at the station, it was suggested by the inspector that he should show the place, and I took him from Aldgate Church to the Eastern Counties Railway—I pointed to one shop, and asked him if that was it—he said, "Yes"—we went in—he spoke to the roan, and asked if he had not been there, and whether he had not dropped a note—the man said he could not tell, but there was no note dropped—the woman said, "I am sure he was not here; for he is such a peculiar young man I should have known him again"—I searched the prisoner, and found on him a lot of papers, and this piece was among them—I did not produce this before the Magistrate on the first occasion; I did on the second—I did not know at first that it was con<lb></lb>nected with the robbery—I showed it to Mr. Sparke the first day after the examination—Sir Peter Laurie told me to look over the papers, which I did—there were six postage-stamps wrapped in this paper—Mr. Sparke showed this paper to the Magistrate on the second examination, and he swore to it—this was with other papers in the prisoner's pocket—there was no conceal<lb></lb>ment.

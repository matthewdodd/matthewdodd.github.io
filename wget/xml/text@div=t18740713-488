                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On 19th June I took the prisoner on this charge—he said "I know nothing at all about it"—I said "I wish to ask you a question, but you need not to answer it unless you like; do you wish to give any account of the oil ticket handed to you for your oil before you left Stratford Station?"—he said "I lost it in Stratford Yard"—I said "I wish to see your cap which you wore on the morning of the 18th, where is it <hi rend="italic">V</hi>—he said "At my lodgings"—I accompanied him to a beer-shop at Lynn and saw him take down a cap and hand it to Inspector Fisher—I pointed out to him that the knob at the top of the cap was missing—he said "That has been gone for two months"—I placed the knob on the top of the cap and said "That cannot be so, this is the knob of your cap, and it has been found in the truck close to the case which has been robbed, and likewise your oil ticket"—he made no answer—I took him to Stratford; the inspector read the charge; he made no reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He lives at Stratford, but he went to Lynn with an engine—I do not know that be has been ten years in the Company's service—he was discharged in 1868, and was not taken on again in that department."'</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse driver at Cambridge—on 18th June I was on duty at Cambridge in the yard at 6 a.m. and saw the prisoner and the driver of the train—the driver was sitting by the side of the engine—I thought he was ill at first, but afterwards I thought he was the worse for drink; I cannot say so much about the prisoner, but I came to the conclu<lb></lb>sion that he was the worse for drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been an engine driver in the employ of the Great Eastern Railway two years last April, and before that I was five years on the East India Railway—on 18th June I was the driver of the train of which the prisoner was fireman—I had to go nearly 100 yards at Stratford from the engine shed to the place where the train was standing for me to couple the engine on—I don't know when the train arrived at Stratford, but I know that my engine went out from the old engine shed at 12.55—I first saw Dobbs about 12.15—he was on the engine—the train was brought by one engine from Brick Lane to Stratford—the trucks are all mixed, and there is a shunting-engine which separates them—Dobbs had work to do, and he was attending to his duties from 12.15 till the train started—I cannot say whether it would have been possible for him to get to the truck, because I do not know where the truck was—he told me he had lost his oil ticket—I said "Never mind, mate, go and get another one, never mind so long as I have it before I go home"—I had to send it in with the engine ticket—before the engine can start he had to go under the new shed—we fastened on to the train, and it was 1.15 before we started—we ran to Bishop's Stortford without stopping, and he was with me the whole time till we got there; he then got down to get water for the engine—it is not true that I was the worse for liquor at Cambridge, nor was he—a man who is the worse for liquor is not fit to be on an engine—my duty on getting to March was to turn the engine round and get water and coal—there is a locomotive foreman there, and he saw me—it was not suggested that I was drunk that night—I never heard it till to-day—my cap formerly had a nob, the same as the prisoner's, but it has worn off; you would not know it from his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is all that remains of the knob of my cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—some months ago we had a conversation about this cap; he told me that it had been washed with soft soap, and he advised me to wash mine to get the dirt out of it, and in washing it the knob would entirely wash away—it took about an hour and thirty minutes to go from Cambridge to March—it is not true that I was the worse for liquor at Cambridge; I was standing up driving the train myself.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SANDERS sworn. - On the 11th of September last I was an officer of Excise at Yarmouth, and went to <placeName id="t18011202-79-crimeloc419">St. Olave's Bridge, in the county of Suffolk</placeName>

I suppose the pistol inlimidated them, as they seemed more peaceable afterwards. I went to the goods, and they all kept hovering round us; the prisoner was one. It was so light, that, before we stooped the goods, we could see them before we came up to them, being piled up very high; when we examined the harness, it was so cut that we saw there would be a difficulty in getting the goods to Yarmouth; it was cut, no doubt, by the smugglers, for if it had been cut before, the horses could not have travelled; the collar the shaft-horse was nearly cut away; seeing that, I called Mr. Milner on one side, and said, I was afraid we should have a difficulty in getting them to Yarmounth, and we had better put them in one cart; seeing a parcel of dry goods in one cart, and that they were light, I threw them upon the tubs of geneva; we took out three bales, which proved afterwards to be tobacco, of eighty-four pounds weight, which we put upon the cart that had two horses, and endeavoured to go on; we left the small cart, because we were afraid they would obstruct us in going up a very steep hill that we had to surmount; we were close by a public-house, and would have put the goods in there, if the people would have got up, but they would not; we drove about half a mile from the place, leaving the one-horse cart behind, and about eight or ten casks in it; when we had got about half a mile, we were stopped, on account of the harness, and the little horse being wounded; we en<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020057"></xptr>deavoured to push it up the hill, but finding the shaft-horse hurt, and would not draw, we unloaded twenty of the casks and the tobacco, to lighten the load; finding we could not get up the hill after that, we dispatched Mr. Share for assistance to the next country village upon the wounded horse; he came with two men and a fresh horse, with a spare collar; we then reloaded these goods, and proceeded for Yarmouth. The small cart we left in the place; we don't know what became of it; they did not go away when we did; I did not know Bensted or May before; I saw Hawke afterwards before the Magistrate at Beccles, where he was summoned as one of the smugglers, about a month after the seizure, and I had a full opportunity of seeing him, and he acknowledged he was there.</p>

               <persName id="t18011202-79-person671">Q. </persName>
            Did he say any thing when he came up to the Court? - A. No, he did not; before the Magistrate he first pleaded not guilty, but he afterwards said the goods did not belong to him, but that he was hired as a labourer by those smuggers to carry the goods home, and he said he only did it by way of getting a few shillings towards his support. After I knocked down the second man, Hawke came up with a stick or whip in his hand, that was the first of my seeing him, and, supposing he came to obstruct me, I struck at him before he ever offered to molest me; he did not say or do any thing but come from the goods up to the scussle.(Thomas-Frederick Share and Michael Milner corroborated the evidence of the last witness.)</p>

I locked the room-door, and the street-door was shut - I left the prisoner's father and mother in the house. I returned about twenty minutes before eight o'clock at night, it was quite dark; I tried to open the street-door, but could not. A woman came by, and said she heard a smash of glass; I looked, and found the shutters had been opened, and the glass, and frame broken. I called out to Mumford that I had been robbed; he came with a light, and I saw the prisoner in the room. He said,</p>

The articles stated in the indictment were all tied up in the blanket, and laid at the foot of the bed, ready to be taken away - the sheets and blankets were taken off the bed. The property is worth above 4 l. - the prisoner's father is a coalheaver; they had lodged about six months with me. They were not at home - they did not come home until twelve o'clock that night.</p>

I stopped to look at him; he saw me, crossed over, and looked up at the first-floor window. I left. I returned about eight o'clock, and met a little boy, who said there were thieves in the house.

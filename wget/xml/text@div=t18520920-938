                  </hi>. I am a tailor. I was present on 25th April, 1845, when the prisoner was married to my daughter, Sarah Jones, at St. John's Church, Waterloo-road—they lived together afterwards on and off two or three years—my daughter is in Court now.</p>

I pro<lb></lb>duce the register of marriages; here is an entry on 19th July, 1852, of the marriage of Edward Murphy and Elizabeth Ann Styles—I was present, and remember the marriage—I recollect the prisoner and also the female—I saw her at the police court, and yesterday also—that was the same person who was married who gave her evidence at the police court—after she had signed her deposition she fainted, and was carried out into the yard—it did not last more than two or three minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk of the works to Mr. Matthew Coates Wyatt, who is building some houses in Hyde Park-square. On the 17th of July I went into a yard in Hyde-park-square, and seeing a plumber go into Mr. Wyatt's shop, I went in—I saw the prisoner there, with his back towards me—he was endeavouring to button his waistcoat, with his jacket in his hand—I turned him round, and saw on his person 62lbs. of lead, attached to a strap which was round his waist, and attached to his braces with four other straps—the lead rested on this strap, by some nails which are in it, and the marks on this strap correspond with the nails—he did not give me any account of how he came by it—I gave him to two men to take care of, but he got from them, and ran some distance—they took him again—this was in Mr. Wyatt's plumber's shop—he had four plumbers there, and each of them I could have reached with my hand at that time—these nails have no business in the lead in the course of the work.</p>

I went to the station, and received charge of the prisoner—he said, "I know nothing of that," pointing to this lead, which laid on the charge-room table—I found this belt round his waist—it is a horse's belly-band—he gave me his address, "No. 46, Queen-street, Edgware-road"—I went there, and he was not known.</p>

               <p>Q. Which said so?</p>
               <p>Stern. The man that had hold of my right arm; he had a hammer in his hand, what we call a Payne hammer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he nothing else in his hand?</p>
               <p>Stern. Not that I saw.</p>

               <p>Stern. Not very light.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do?</p>
               <p>Stern. I said I don't know what you mean, gentlemen; as to money, I have very little, and no watch; the man on my left hand took the watch out of my pocket, and the man on the right hand took my money; he on the right hand was the tallest; he put his hand into my pocket, and pulled out what money I had; as near as I can guess there was a six-pence and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing else?</p>
               <p>Stern. Yes, my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take it from you, or you give it them?</p>
               <p>Stern. The man on the left hand reached across and took it. The watch had a steel chain and a cornelian stone seal set in silver; the impression was a man's head.</p>
               <p>Q. And a key, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Stern. Yes, a brass key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any thing from the women?</p>
               <p>Stern. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The women stood by?</p>
               <p>Stern. They went a little distance to call somebody, but saw nobody, so they came a little way back again.</p>
               <p>Q. When they had taken the watch and money, what followed?</p>
               <p>Stern. The man on my right hand, with the hammer, struck me on the side of the head.</p>

               <p>Stern. It did not come so heavy I believe as he expected, because I kept it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he discontent with his booty?</p>
               <p>Stern. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any resistance then?</p>
               <p>Stern. No, he said nothing; he gave me no more; it stunned me that I did not remember their going off; when I recovered I found they were gone; I struggled a-cross the way, and the two women laid hold of me, and kept me from falling; my watch was advertised by Mr. Heley who had it. (The watch produced by Heley, and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

            . On Tuesday the 9th of June, I went with Mr. Bond and Mr. Taylor into St. Giles's, to apprehend a man accused of a footpad robbery; we had been searching there about half an hour, and as we were coming away, I saw the prisoner with another young fellow, I don't know his name. I said to Mr. Bond, there is Astrop; Mr. Bond said, you must take him, for last night he went to pawn a watch and got off. As soon as he saw us come towards him, he run off; we pursued him, and took him in a court in Denmark-street, St. Giles's; when we came up to him, I put my hand in his coat pocket and found a hammer. ( Produces the hammer.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is such a hammer as he hit me with.</p>
               <p>Heley. At that time I did not particularly search him, but held his hand till I got him down to the Bear in Bow-street; when he came into the parlour, I saw the chain of a watch hang out; this is the watch (producing it;) he said it was his own; that he bought it at Gains-borough in Lincolnshire; accordingly the watch was advertised, and the prosecutor came and owned it; that is all I know of the matter.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my watch.</p>

               <p>I was coming from my father's house, the corner of New Round Court in the Strand, on Tuesday morning about eight o'clock; going up the Hay Market, I met two or three friends I had not seen sometime; they asked me to drink a glass of something with them; I went into an alehouse, and they asked about my going abroad, because they heard my father speak of it; I told them I was a going; I said I owed a little money and was going to settle it before I went. A shortish man, like a coachman, came into the company, and asked, if any body would buy a watch; I said, let me look at it. He asked a guinea and a half; I bid him 30 s. he said he was in distress; it was more than he could pawn it for, and he took it. As I was going past St. Giles's, three men run after me, and said, if I did not stop; they would knock me down; they took me to the Bear in Bow-street, and took the watch and other things from me. If I was the person, it is remarkable none of the three people know me; it is very improbable that I should strike a man with such a hammer. While I was in New Prison a man came and shook hands with me, and asked if I was not the man that bought a watch at St. Giles's; I said I was; he said he was sorry for me, knowing the justness of my cause, and if he could do any thing for me he would; he could not attend here, because, I believe, he was going out of town; he appeared before Sir

               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing happening at your mother's house, the 27th of October? - Yes, About a quarter past seven, I was up at work in a two pair of stairs room, next door to where my mother lives; but at that time my candle being just gone out, I accidently opened my front window, and by the reflection of the light which was in the lower apartment, I observed two men standing almost opposite, and I evidently heard one say to the other, now! now is the time! I see them both directly run across to my mother's door; and, as I thought they were going to do something that was wrong, I immediately ran down stairs, to go to my mother's door; and when I came to my mother's door the street door was open, and the outside door of the apartment was shut, which outside door of the apartment I am certain I double locked when my mother went out, which was about five o'clock the same evening. I put my hand to the handle of the ketch of the door, and it opened immediately; I went into the apartment and saw the prisoner in the front room, as if he was coming from the back room; I then immediately caught hold of him; on which a scuffle ensued, which brought us into the passage; he then called out, as if to his companions, murder him! murder him! murder him! I directly called out, and some neighbours came, and by their assistance he was secured till the officers, who were sent for, came and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the other man? - I see no other but the man that I saw before that gave are the suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other man when you went to your mother's? - No.</p>
               <p>

            Had he any arms? - No, I believe he had not; I am certain he had none, because he was searched by the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. When your mother went out at five o'clock, did you fasten the outer door? - I am not certain, I think not, because there were lodgers in the one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light in the room where you found the prisoner? - In the front room there was a very good fire, because my coat, in which I had been out with in the morning when it was wet, was hanging there to dry.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understand you to say that the prisoner at the bar was searched, and no arms found on him, nor any picklock keys? - There was a picklock key that was found broke in the lock, which the officer has got.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your mother live in this house? - She does, she occupies the whole of it, and lets out the upper part.</p>

After we took the prisoner into custody, and he was committed, I went to the house, and in the lock of the door I found this piece of a blank picklock; I was obliged to take the lock off to get it out. After that we went backwards into the yard, and saw the print of the feet of two men that had made their escape out backwards, as we were informed. Here is a knife and key, and brush, and this instrument, that I found on the prisoner, whether it is for shooting peas, or what, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So the prisoner was searched I understand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And nothing was found on him? - Yes, these things.</p>

               <p>Q. You know if this man is convicted there is a forty pounds reward, Mr. Thief taker? - Thief taker! I have done my duty.</p>

               <p>Q. You say you found the print of two persons feet in the yard, that you was informed had made their escape? - I did say so.</p>

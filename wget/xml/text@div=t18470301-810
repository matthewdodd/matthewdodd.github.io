                  </hi>. I am the wife of William King, a stationer in Rochester-row. About eight o'clock at night, on the 17th Feb., I was washing a little boy in a room near the shop—I saw the head of some boy in the shop, and I saw a hand that went towards the shelf—I hallooed out, and the person said, "A halfpenny worth of tobacco"—he did not stop for that, but ran away—I am quite sure it was the prisoner—I had not know him before, but I saw his face—I ran out directly, and missed a box of sealing-wax and wafers, which I had seen about three minutes before—I looked out and saw the prisoner and two more boys with him—they all ran away—I ran, and a man caught the prisoner—I have not seen the box and sealing-wax since.</p>

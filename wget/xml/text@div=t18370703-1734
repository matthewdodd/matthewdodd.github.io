                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Regent-street. In May, 1836, I was in possession of the copyright of "Pinnock's Guide to Knowledge"—the prisoner came into my employ at Christmas, 1835, and was there till 1836—he was the publisher of this work—he was engaged by young Mr. Pinnock, who was the editor—I ceased to employ the prisoner at Christmas, 1836—he has since been in my employ for about a month, arranging the work for the purpose of sale—this paper was principally in Charles-street, Covent-garden, and the remainder at a wharf, in Thames-street—the prisoner had the key of it—he had two porters to assist him—we did not agree on any salary, but I said I would satisfy him when it was over, which he said would be in a fortnight or three weeks—he used to send every Saturday night for me to pay the porters, and I was to pay him at the end of the time—I received this note for money—(read)—"17th June, 1837. <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR</hi>,—Have the goodness to send by bearer 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the men for the five days this week, and at the same time have the kindness to let me have a trifle on account, and you will much obliger.

                  </hi>. In 1835. I was the editor of a work called Pinnock's Guide to Knowledge, of which Robert Wilson had become the proprietor from Christmas 1835—the prisoner was employed as pub<lb></lb>lisher of it till Christmas 1836—it is my belief he knew Mr. Wilson was the proprietor—at Christmas it stopped—after that I published another work, called "The Guide to Knowledge"—Mr. Wilson had nothing to do with that—I never authorised the prisoner to sell any of the work after it stopped—before it stopped he was the mere vendor of it in the shop—he had no authority to sell it in pounds, as waste paper.</p>

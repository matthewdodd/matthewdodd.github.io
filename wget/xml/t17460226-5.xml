Afterwards, when I went to Dinner myself and came back again to the Keys, I heard that the Prisoner at the Bar was detected for taking of some Cotton out of my Bag.</p>
               <p>Q. How much?</p>
               <p>Jones. I reckon about 2 lb.</p>
               <p>Ebenezar Hartly. I am Constable of Chester-Keys . Coming on the Key the 5th of this Month, I saw this Woman and another at the Bag of Cotton. I came to her and ask'd her what she was doing. Said I, how came you by this? She said, the Porter gave it me. I said, she should go with me to the Porter, to know what Porter could give Merchant's Goods away. After that I found Mr. Jones out and shew'd him the particular Bag.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do farther ?</p>
               <p>Hartly. I carry'd her before the Alderman. She said, the other Woman was to have half of it. And the Porter that had given it her was run away. But I saw the Woman take it myself.</p>

            (to the Prisoner ) What have you to say?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I was coming along the Keys and picking up Bits of Chips, the other Woman said, will you let me put this into your Basket? The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174602260006"></xptr> Constable said, you shall go along with me ; so he let the Woman and Girl go, and he took me.</p>
               <p>But she could call no Witnesses to prove it, nor to her Character.</p>

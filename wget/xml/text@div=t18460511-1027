On the 5th of May, at nine o'clock at night, I was going on board my vessel, and called for my boat—my man answered me, and I sat down on the stairs—the prisoner came and sat alongside of me—he offered to take me on board—I thanked him, and told him my boat was coming—he asked me to give him some money—I said, "No money for you, go on"—he then struck me a blow in the eye as I sat on the stairs—I fell back on the stairs, then got up, took hold of him, and grappled with him—he took a knife from his pocket under his smock-frock, and hit me on the mouth with it—that knocked me down on the stairs—he then put his hand into my waistcoat-pocket, and took out three five-franc pieces, and tore my pocket—I got up and called, "Police!" but he escaped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am connected with the corn-market, in Mark-lane. Between eight and nine o'clock I was coming on shore, and heard a person hail a vessel—when I got to the top of the stairs I saw the prosecutor's mouth, bleeding, and a pool of blood round him—I said, "What is the matter?"—a person in a white smock-frock and cap immediately came up to me, and said, "This party came and throttled me, I <hi rend="italic">upped</hi> with my fist and knocked him</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the Thames-police. I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday, about half-past ten o'clock at night—I told him I took him on suspicion of attacking a French captain, and robbing him of three five-franc pieces—he said, "I don't know anything of it, it is hard the innocent should be blamed for the guilty"—I took him on board the vessel—the captain was in bed, and half asleep—I asked him as well as I could if he knew that man, but he said, "No understand English," and shook his shoul<lb></lb>der—I took him to the witness Murley, who said, "I am certain he is the same man"—I searched him, and found nothing—there were a few spots of blood on his frock, which he said was caused by a scuffle with some of the workmen, which made his nose bleed.</p>

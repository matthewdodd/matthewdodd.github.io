On the 29th of June, a little before three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come from the stable, and pass to the cart-shed—he had about two bushel's of oats and beans, and he put them in a cart—I asked him what he had got, he said, "Some corn for Mr.</p>

On the 28th of June I did not give out any corn to the prisoner, to be taken to Mr. Harvey's—this is the sample of corn which came from the sack—there was corn and oats of this description in the stable which the prisoner came out of—I firmly believe it is the same—I had on the Thursday before given him corn for his horses, to last him till the Monday following—he had no right to have this corn.</p>

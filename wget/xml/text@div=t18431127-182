                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. James Frederick Tindall, at the Lord Chancellor public-house in Great George-street, Edgware road. On the evening of the 21st of Nov., the prisoner came and called for a pot of the best ale, and went into the parlour, where there were several friends of his—he came out for several glasses of brandy-and-water, and had several pots of half-and-half—at half-past ten he came and bothered my mistress to lend him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—she would not—I knew him before—he used to work at Mr. Cross's—when I left the bar to go into the parlour the bowl was safe, irt a recess under the counter, under the beer-engine in the bar—there were some shillings, sixpences, and fourpenny pieces in the bowl—when 1 came back it was gone—the prisoner's hand was almost touching the bowl where he stood leaning over the counter—my mistress was serving a customer over the bar—the prisoner did not appear to be drunk—he could run very well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hearth-rug manufacturer, and live in Orange-street, Bethnal-green—the prisoner lived with me three or four months—on the evening of the 8th of March, I left my workshop about eleven o'clock—it is attached to the dwelling-house, and is part of it—I left every thing safe—I returned about a quarter before seven o'clock—my son did got there before me—I found the premises had been entered by three or four tiles being taken off—a pigeon-house had been forced open, and a pair of pigeons taken out—a pair of boots and an apron were taken out of the workshop—the person must have got in through the roof—(<hi rend="italic">looking 4 some things</hi>)—these are my property—the boots belong to my son.</p>

            ; on Tuesday the 26th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I lost the things in the indictment; I was in the fore-shop, I met Mr. Cundel coming out of the back-shop from the ladies; he desired me to attend to them; upon my entering the back shop, I observed Wheeler pull some muslins off the counter into her lap, they were both sitting close to the counter; she then concealed it under her cloak and muff, she had a very large white silk cloak on, trimmed with furr, and a very large muff.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay after that? - About a quarter of an hour; they bought a remnant of Irish, which they had asked for before, about five or six shillings, they paid for it, took the parcel, and were going away together; upon their approach to the shop-door, at the distance of eight yards from where they were sitting, I attempted to lay hold of the prisoner Wheeler's apron, and she immediately turned round, and returned to where she had been sitting before, the other followed her; I saw her drop the muslins; and the other immediately picked them up, and laid them on the counter.</p>
               <p>How far were they from the counter, when you saw them drop the muslins? - Close to the counter.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said by either of them at the time of dropping them? - Not till I charged them with it; Wheeler said she was surprised I should charge her with taking the muslins; Barnsley said her name was Williams, that she lived at Cold Bath-fields; Wheeler said she was acquainted with Lady Spencer, that she was a customer at the shop, and had frequently come with her servants; I sent for a constable and took them up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Those ladies came to your shop, bought a piece of Irish, and paid for it; what did they give you? - They gave Mr. Cundel a ten pound note.</p>
               <p>They bought some muslin as well as Irish? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never charged them at all with the theft, till the muslins were on your counter? - No.</p>
               <p>You shewed them a number of pieces of muslin? - The counter was littered all over with muslins.</p>
               <p>Then some of the pieces might have fell down? - No, there were none down.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Percival; on the 26th of February, about four o'clock, the two prisoners came into the further end of the back shop together; Barnsley desired to see some muslin, the same as they had seen last week, that it was ell wide at nine shillings a yard; I served her with three ells of muslin, which came to thirty-five shillings, and which she bought and put in her pocket; she said I must give her change for a ten pounds note; but she recollected before I gave her change, that she wanted a small quantity of Irish, the same that she had some of the week before, at four shillings and two-pence a yard, and added, that the little man, then in the front-shop would know the sort; I left the ladies and went into the front-shop; I met Mr. Percival in the front shop, I desired he would walk into the back shop to them; they were sitting about ten yards from where I met him; I looked among the remnants of Irish, and found one, which Barnsley bought, and gave six shillings for it; I then gave her her change out of the ten pounds note; they had got their parcels, and were going out, as they were approaching the back shop door, Mr. Percival attempted to take hold of Wheeler's apron; she then turned round, and went to the place where they had been sitting; she was immediately followed by Barnsley; I saw Barnsley pick up the muslins from the floor, and lay them on the counter; when Mr. Percival immediately took the muslin, and charged Wheeler with the theft.</p>
               <p>How far was it from the place where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270073"></xptr>they had sat down, to the place where Mr. Percival attempted to lay hold of Wheeler's apron? - Six or seven yards, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any muslin on the floor, before they turned back? - I did not; I think if there had been any, I could not but have seen it; Barnsley said that her name was Williams, that she lived in Cold Bath-street, Cold Bath-fields; Wheeler said that she was very well known, that Lady Spencer knew her; (the muslin produced in Court.) It is in four pieces, I marked the length of them on the muslins, previous to my taking them to Bow-street, (looks at them) upon this piece is marked three yards and five-eighths; the next piece is marked two yards and three quarters; the next is marked two yards and five eighths, and the other piece has ten yards marked upon it.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say they are your master's property? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the very property that were taken up at the time by Barnsley? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. These goods had been shewn to somebody, and were laying with great disorder on the counter? - Yes, in some disorder.</p>
               <p>Did you observe if any muslins were fell down? - I did not observe any down.</p>
               <p>There had been no charge made till the muslins were laid on the counter; where have these muslins been kept? - In the shop under the stairs.</p>
               <p>How many of you have had access to them? - Seven of us, masters and all.</p>
               <p>For how many days? - Ever since last Wednesday.</p>
               <p>They have not been kept under lock and key? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. What are your shop marks? - A, E, H, L, O, R, D, K, P,</p>
               <p>What is the value? - Six pounds.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I told the clerk of the indictments that it was not privately, and I desired him not to lay it capital.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. When Wheeler returned to the counter, was it not to look at a printed muslin, which she said if she had any, would suit her? - She certainly did.</p>
               <p>Wheeler. He said Ma'am, there is a very pretty print; that was the cause of his laying hold of my apron to shew me that, and on that account I turned back.</p>
               <p>Is the Constable here? - No.</p>
               <p>Why is he not here? - He saw nothing of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Barnsley. Whether Mr. Percival did not mark the muslin himself from a great number of other pieces? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>WHEELER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As Mr. Percival denies marking the muslin, I have nothing more to say; he marked them himself, from a great quantity in his own shop, before the constable, who could have proved it.</p>
               <p>Barnsley. I leave my defence to my Counsel.</p>

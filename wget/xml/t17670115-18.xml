               <p>Q. How long have you lived with the lady?</p>
               <p>E. Terry. I have been there twenty-one years; the waiter was missed the day he went away, on which day also he was taken in custody; I know the prisoner was very much concerned in liquor that evening; and he went the next morning to get it again, to put it in its place; we had company that evening; I went to fetch him from a public-house about ten o'clock, or a little before, to come home to light them down stairs; he was then very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been missing out of your lady's house?</p>
               <p>E. Terry. I cannot tell; he came home with me, but the company was gone; the next morning Mr. Robinson came, about ten or eleven o'clock; he had two keys in his hand, and asked me if I knew the key of the street-door and the key of the pantry; I said I really did not know: then he asked me if I missed a silver salver or waiter; I said I did not: he had taken the prisoner up before he came to our house: I did not see the waiter till before Justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How has the prisoner behaved the time he has lived with your lady?</p>
               <p>E. Terry. He has behaved well; he kept his time very regular; we never had one that kept his time so regular as he did; we never had a servant that behaved better, nor so well as he, till this unfortunate affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard of any plate being lost before?</p>
               <p>E. Terry. No, I have not.</p>

               <p>E. Terry. I do not know that he was.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live in Bond-street; (he produced a large silver waiter, about twelve inches diameter) the prisoner at the bar brought this to my house about half an hour after seven o'clock that night, and offered it to sale.</p>
               <p>E Terry. This is my lady's waiter.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner in livery?</p>
               <p>E. Terry. He is, but sometimes he wears a frock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in livery that night?</p>
               <p>E. Terry. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Robinson. I suspected it not to be the prisoner's own; I said I had not change, he must come in the morning, and I would pay him; I had not fixed any price; he said a lady, named Pickering, died in George-street, and she had left it him by will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be sober, or in liquor?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I did not observe him to be in liquor; he might, as I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in a livery or in a frock?</p>
               <p>Robinson. He was in a frock; after he was gone, I observed the waiter to be made by my master, when I was apprentice; here is my own mark upon it. The next morning I went to Mrs. Pickering's, and, upon enquiring, found there were no such things left the servants, they had all money left them; when I returned, the prisoner came; then I sent for a constable, and took him in custody; after which, he desired me to take the keys and carry them to his mistress's house, which I did.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How near do you live to Mrs. Vaughan's house?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I live about 20 or 30 houses distant from it.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Terry. Did the prisoner ever live with Mrs. Pickering?</p>
               <p>E. Terry. No, not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Aspley. I am a constable; I knowing the prisoner, said, Thomas, if you have done any thing amiss you had better acknowledge it now; he said, I did bring this piece of plate last night, and I am come for it now to carry it home again; I hear he was in liquor the night before; his character was universally good.</p>
               <p>Q. to Robinson. Did the prisoner say he was come to carry it back again to his mistress?</p>
               <p>Robinson. He did say he would carry it back again, but I thought proper to stop him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this salver worth?</p>
               <p>Robinson. It is worth about 10 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was very much in liquor, and do not know nothing at all about it.</p>

            . On the 3d of May, about twenty minutes past eight o'clock, I was in Elizabeth-terrace, Ball's-pond, about twenty yards from Captian Wilson's, and saw the prisoners together - Ram had a basket in his hand, with fire shavings; they were at a door in Elizabeth-place; I was going about seventeen doors down, and as I returned I saw them going towards Brunswick-place; I went into my master's shop, which is in Elizabeth-place, and was in there five or ten minutes, when Ram passed our shop at a kind of quick trot, without any basket; I ran out, looked towards Brunswick-place, and saw Milwood about twenty yards off - he beckoned to me; I ran after Ram, but followed him across the fields, and saw Stephens in the Tottenham-road, behind Ball's-pond, without a basket; they joined, and I followed them to Kingsland; but being alone I turned back.</p>

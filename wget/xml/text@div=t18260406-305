            . I am a watchman. I was called to this house by a female; I found the prisoner and the prosecutrix in the two-pair back room - her mouth was bleeding very much - she was crying; I was informed, by a female, that the man had been beating this girl - she said"He has robbed me, as well as beat me, and I hope you will take him;" the prisoner said it served her right, and we secured him. <rs id="t18260406-305-verdict1643" type="verdictDescription">

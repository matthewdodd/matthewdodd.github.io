On Monday morning, 12th Sep<lb></lb>tember, about ten minutes to 7, I was walking down Queen-street; I saw a man standing at the corner of Thames-street and Queen-street—he appeared to be watching me—I was on the left-baud side coming down, and he was on the opposite side of the street—I crossed Thames-street, and went down Three Cranes'-lane, leaving the man in the same place—I stopped there two or three minutes, came back again, and he was gone—I went up College<lb></lb>hill, looked down Maiden-lane, and saw Messrs. Franks' warehouse doors standing open; I also saw a horse and cart going down the lane towards Garlic-hill—there were two men at the side of the cart, and two more rather at the back—Church-alley is about twenty pieces from Mr. Franks' door, and runs parallel with Garlic-hill—I ran back into Thames-street in order to meet them—when I got up to Garlic-hill I found the cart standing, and the men had disappeared—I left a man in charge of the carl, and ran round through several of the courts, but I could not find the men—I did not run down Sugar-loaf-court—that is almost a continuation of Maiden-lane; the men might have gone down there without my seeing them—I then took the horse and cart back to the warehouse—I found that the cart contained six bags of tea and this horse-cloth—it was a chestnut horse with a few white hairs on its face, blind with one eye, and rather lame of it* near foreleg—there were five bags filled with tea standing in the ground floor of the ware-house, and on them were five <hi rend="italic">jemmies</hi>, a coat, and a hammer—I sent for the sergeant, and he came down, and examined the doors—one of the men I saw with the cart was without his coat—the prisoner appears to be about the height of one of the men who was behind the cart with the man without his coat—he appeared to be about the same height as the back of the cart, or rather higher—the tail-board was up.</p>

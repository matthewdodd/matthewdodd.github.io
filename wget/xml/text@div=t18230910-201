            . On the 11th of July, I was in Sun-street, and saw the prisoners go by me about twelve o'clock, towards Bishopsgate-street. I followed them in company for three quarters of a mile, they separated at Adams's shop; Stevens went in, and Knight waited at the corner, about twenty yards off, and when Stevens came out, I went in, and from what I heard I watched them - they went together to Morgan's milk shop. I saw Knight hand her something; he stood in a corner about forty yards off, while she went in, bought some eggs and got change - then they joined company, and went away together. I went into the shop and received a sixpence, which they marked before they delivered it. They then went to Bullock's shop, near Little Britain; Knight stood at the corner, while she went in and came out with a sheet of writing paper - I went in, Miss Bullock marked a sixpence and gave it to me. Reardon was with me, we took them into custody. I asked Knight what he had in his hand, he said nothing; I forced it open, and found a bad sixpence; I found ninepence in halfpence, and some potatoes in his hat, and some in his coat, and two or three good shillings about him. I found the eggs and paper in Stevens's hand, but no halfpence; she had no bonnet or shawl on. I produce the three sixpences.</p>

            , we live in Throgmorton-street. On the 11th of July, the prisoner came into the shop, between two and three o'clock, for two raspberry tarts, and begged me to give her fresh ones, as they were for a sick child. She opened her hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have only got these three-halfpence and a sixpence, which you must give me change for." On looking at it, I saw it was bad, and returned it; she said, she would return in half an hour, if I would put them aside. She went out, and Colton came, and I told him what had occurred.</p>

            . I live with my father, who is a stationer, in Little Britain. On the 11th of July, a woman came into the shop; I cannot say whether it was the prisoner; she asked for a sheet of black edged letter paper, which I gave her; she gave me a sixpence, I gave her fivepence change. Colton came in directly after, I gave him the sixpence; he marked it before I parted with it; this is it (looking at it.)</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know her name was Higgins? - A.From the intructions given me for the banns; I never saw her till she was introduced into the church to be married.</p>

               <p>Q.There are a great number of persons married at St. Mary-le-Strand? - A.No, it has never exceeded fifty a year, for one hundred years; I have counted them for the population act.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I lived with my first wife some time before I married her; Mary Weddon persuaded me to marry her, and said, she would be at the expence of it; I have been in the army several years; I did not know she was living; I had letters sent me, saying, she was dead six years ago; when I was about to marry my second wife, I fairly told her friends all about it, and they wrote to this very woman about it, before I married.</p>



               <p>Q.(To Weddon.) How long did your sister and this man live together? - A.About two years.</p>

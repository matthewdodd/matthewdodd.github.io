                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live at No. 219, Borough. The prisoner had been my porter for above 18 months—having occasion to suspect him, I desired him, on the 11th of June, to bring down his box—he made no reply, but brought down his box from where it was kept, on the third floor, to my sitting-room, which is on the first door—he opened it, and I found in it six pairs of stockings, which I considered to be my property, and one silk handkerchief with a character on it which I use in my business, and which was put on by one of the witnesses—a bag was af<lb></lb>terwards found on the landing even with my sitting-room, which contained twelve silk handkerchiefs and some other articles, which I believe to be mine; but five hours had elapsed between my finding this property in the bag, and the prisoner had been in custody. I had not seen the bag there before, and there was no dust upon it—it did not appear to have laid there long.</p>

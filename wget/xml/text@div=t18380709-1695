                  </hi>. I live with my father, Emanuel Moses. He keeps the Black Lion public-house, in Vinegar-yard—on Thursday the 15th, or Friday the 16th of June I was sitting with my father in the bar, when the prisoner came in and asked my father to discount him a bill—my father asked him to leave it, which he did, and said he would call in a day or two—this bill—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—looks something like it, but it has been out of my possession—I gave it to the officer, Blakesley—the prisoner said he was the drawer of the bill himself—I did not ask him who the acceptor was, for I took the bill from my father, and saw it was accepted in the name of Byden, and was addressed to Green Dragon-yard, Bishopsgate-street—I do not remember that the prisoner told me where the acceptor lived—I sup<lb></lb>posed the acceptance was By den's hand-writing—the prisoner might have told me so, but I did not suppose it was of any consequence—I was ex<lb></lb>amined before the Magistrate, but it was three or four weeks ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, did the prisoner give any account who the acceptor was, or whose hand-writing the acceptance was, and where the man lived? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he said it was accepted by Biden—he did not tell me where Byden lived—I do not remember, because it is on the face of the bill, where Byden does lire—I went down to the address on the bill—I did not know what might occur, and hardly knew what I was about at the time—I did not suspect any thing then—I have been examined on oath before—I think that some more conversation did pass between me and the prisoner, about the acceptance—I think he said it was accepted by Byden, and that Byden lived in Green Dragon-yard, or New Inn-yard, Shoreditch—I know I went there to inquire whether the bill was a bona fide transaction—the prisoner said that Byden lived there, and that it was made payable in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say it was made payable there, or was that an observation of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I do not know now for the moment which it was—I kept the bill in my possession, and told the prisoner to call again in a day or two, and he called the next day, Saturday—Mr. Byden was there when he called.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDEEGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not go. to New Inn-yard in consequence of seeing that direction on the bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember whether it was an observation of my own, or whether it was what the prisoner said—I do not know that he said the man lived in New Inn-yard—he said it was Byden's hand-writing—he was not asked whether he saw Byde, n accept it—he did not say it was Byden's acceptance—my father did not ask him, if he saw him accept it—it was left with my father for the purpose of making inquiry about it—my father gave nothing for the bill—he never asked for any thing—my father said he would not dis<lb></lb>count it till he saw it was a bona fide transaction—he would not discount it because it was not worth the price of the stamp—because Byden was not worth any thing—I understand the prisoner himself is a minor—I have known him for a twelvemonth occasionally coming to our house—the bill is not indorsed—when I went to Byden, he said, "If you had been here a new minutes ago you would have seen Joel"—he said, "I have seen Joel here a few minutes ago, and he said be was going to treat me with a bottle of wine if he got the money."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brush-maker, and lived at No. 19, New Inn-yard,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183807090052"></xptr>
               <p>at the time this occurred. I remember seeing the last witneii—I did not tell her, if the man got the money for the bill I was to have a bottle of wine—I have known the prisoner since October last—I went to Mrs. Reeve's, next door to me, and saw Miss Abrahams—she showed me this bill, with my name on it—it is not my hand-writing—it is quite differend—the prisoner told me he had put my name to a former bill, but not him to one—I had not authorised him to put my name on a former occasion—I had not paid the bill he put my name to before—I never allowed him to put my name to any bill—I was not to have a bottle of wine if he got money on the bill, to which he had put my name—he offered to lend me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not know any thing about a bill—he merely drew two bills up to get the money—this is not one of them—I allowed him to draw the two bills to get the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me, to lend to me, but not to use my name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was he to get them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not understand the nature of bills—I never saw one till I saw the prisoner—he was to draw on himself—I understood he was of age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then he was by bills to get you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he said be would lend me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and draw the bills up, and I could issue them if I liked—I have seen one bill of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., besides this—my name was not on both of them—the officer has one in his possession, and one I hold in my pocket—I was advised by the Magistrate to stop it—this was not one of the two bills on which he was to raise the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw those two bills is my house—this I never knew any thing of till J saw it in Miss Abraham's hands—the prisoner called at my house that day, and told me he was going to get the money for me on the bill—not on this bill—he said he had been down to Steven, the bill-broker's, and the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would come to me to help me in my business—he did not tell me he had been to Abrahams—no mention was made about a bottle of wine—I never said a word to Miss Abrahams about a bottle of wine—here is one of the bills on which he was to raise the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>.) <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This is not yet accepted—do you mean to say it was not to have your name put across it before he received the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not by my authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This bill is not drawn on any person—what did he bring it to you for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know any thing about bills—he said it was as good as money, if I liked to pass it.</p>

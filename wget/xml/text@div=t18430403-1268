On Thursday evening, the 2nd of March, I was in the par<lb></lb>lour at the back of the shop, between seven and eight o'clock—I heard a noise, as though some one stumbled over the cill of the door—I ran out instantly, and missed the cigar-case, full of cigars, from off the counter—I ran to the door, and observed the prisoner with the case about twenty yards from my door—(I am sure it was him, as I had seen him on the Wednesday even<lb></lb>ing,</p>

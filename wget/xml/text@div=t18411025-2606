                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Bance Burrows, of White Horse-yard, Drury-lane—we let out children's carriages for hire. On the 30th of August a boy came twice and inquired for a chaise—I asked him who be came from, and refused to let him have it unless the person who wanted it came—the prisoner afterwards came, and I let it to him for an hour, for which he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he drew it away from the door, and said be would return it in one hour quite safe—he did not return it at all—I found the chaise five weeks after at Black wall in the possession of Sladden.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of the pro<lb></lb>secutrix's husband coming to me, I went down to Blackwall—I saw the chaise' there, and saw the prisoner's wife—I told her it was stolen—she went with me to the station—I then went to Mr. Young's, a tailor in High-street, Poplar, and saw the prisoner—I told him I took him for stealing a chaise—he said he had bought it in Petticoat-lane—I went there with him, and saw the lady belonging to the shop—she said she had not sold such a thing for the last six months, or two years, perhaps, but peo<lb></lb>ple were in the habit of bringing things before her door, and she could not say whether it had been there or not—the prosecutrix saw the chaise, and claimed it—the prosecutor took me to where the chaise was to be found.</p>

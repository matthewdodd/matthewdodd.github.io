The officer brought the prisoner in, and said it was a case of smashing—the prisoner said, "Yes, for bad money; did you never have any?"—I took her into the cell, and searched her; she was very violent—I found in her hand a good shilling, and between her dress and her petticoat a bad half crown—I picked it up, and told her it was a bad one—I marked it, and gave it to the officer—this is it.</p>

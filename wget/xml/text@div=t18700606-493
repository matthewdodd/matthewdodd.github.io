                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman S R</hi> 47). On the evening of 21st May I was on the towing path of the Regent's Canal—I saw a boy named Walsh, the brother of the prisoner Walsh, bathing there—he could be seen by persons passing—there were two gentlemen's houses opposite—after he came out of the water I took him into custody—the prisoners Walsh, the two Proctors, and Cliff set on me directly, and threw me down on the ground—George Proctor was on me—I caught him by the scarf as I was lying on the ground—the others were kicking me, all four of them, and some others who are not here—I got up, still holding George Proctor, and drew my truncheon—I dropped it as I was taking it out of the case, and it was thrown away by one of the prisoners, and was found in the canal two or three days after-wards—I was then thrown on to the ground again, still holding Proctor—I gained my feet again, and was taking Proctor along the towing-path, when the others raised the cry "Throw the <hi rend="italic">slop</hi> into the water"—Proctor then renewed his struggles with me, and I was forced into the water—Proctor went in with me—I can't swim—whilst I was in the water they called out to Proctor to get me under, and threw stones and dust at me—the water was 4 ft. or 5 ft. deep—I was in the water upwards of twenty minutes—I went under when I first went in—I called for assistance, but no one came—when I got out of the water the others all ran away—I still had hold of Proctor—I took him along the towing-path to the bridge, where I saw a gentleman, and called to him for assistance.</p>

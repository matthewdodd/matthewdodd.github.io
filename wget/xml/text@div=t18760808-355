                  </hi>. I live at 2, Godfrey Place, Hackney Road—in Novem-ber, 1857, I was living with my wife in Willow Walk, Curtain Road, Shore-ditch—the prisoner lived with us, and my wife's sister, Elizabeth Brown, lived next door—one Sunday morning in 1857 I saw the prisoner and Elizabeth Brown go to St. John's Church, Hoxton, but I did not go in; they came back to my house in the evening, and he was asked in my presence whether he had married her—he said first that he had not, but after a deal of talk he acknowledged it and produced the certificate—they lived together as man and wife for many years after that in Clerkenwell—they have a son nineteen years old; they parted several times, but they lived together at the first onset twelve years—I can say that they lived together till 1868—they were very rarely parted, only for a month or two, and then they came together again—she is here now.</p>

I live at 77, Church Street, Mile End—I was married to the prisoner on 31st October, 1875, at Christ Church, Spitalfields; he said that he was a widower—I have known him since last March twelve months, after which he courted me for about six or seven months—I never knew otherwise than that he was a widower.</p>

            . Last Sunday was a se'n-night, between 10 and 11 at Night, as I was going along the <placeName id="t17340116-4-crimeloc18">Strand</placeName>

The two Prisoners coming by, pick'd me up, and ask'd me to make 'em drink; I said with all my Heart, and so I went with them to a Distiller's Shop, and bid them call for what they would, and I'd pay for it. - They call'd for something, and I paid something, I think it was Six-pence, but I can't very well tell, for I was hardly sensible. The Distiller not liking the Company I was in, advised me to leave my Watch with him, for fear I should lose it, but I told him I was able enough to take care of it myself; so I went out with the Prisoners, and in a Minute my Watch was gone, and they run away. The Distiller follow'd, and took Jones, but Clark got of. Jones told us Clark had got the Watch, and directed us to her Lodging, where we found her next Day, but she would not own she had my Watch, and so I lost it.</p>

            . As I was shutting up Shop, the Prosecutor (whom I knew) came in with the Prisoners, and said he had fell down, and they had pick'd him up, and therefore he would treat them as far as Six-pence would go, and I saw he was in ill Company, I desired him to leave his Watch with me, but he refused, and one of the Women taking him by the Arm, said, Come my dear let's go, as I brought you in, I'll take you out, and so they went away together, and I shut the Door; but thinking they might pick his Pocket, I open'd it again, and found them all three standing close together. I again desir'd him to let me take Care of his Watch. No, says he, I warrant ye I can take care of that myself; they must be cunning indeed, if they can get it from me. You shall see how safe it is; but putting his Hand to his Fob to shew me. Hah! says he, it's gone already! Upon that the Women both took to their Heels, I pursu'd, and seiz'd Jones but Clark escaped then, tho' by Jones's Direction I found her again next Day in St. Giles's.

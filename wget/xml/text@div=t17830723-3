               <p>How were the ladies dressed? - They had their hair just-dressed; and had large hoops on, one was in pink silk; they were in quite a different stile to what they are now; Richardson had a blue coat, round hat, and a pair of boots.</p>
               <p>Who had you that Carmelite silk from?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230011"></xptr> - From Mr. Proctor, and here is two pieces tied up in the same handkerchief with the piece that was sold them, this is a tobine, and the other is a Peruvian tissue, at the same time they were in the shop, I observed the Peruvian tissue on the counter, and I saw the tobine about an hour before they were there; all these silks were delivered to me by Proctor tied up in in this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the handkerchief? - I never saw it before as I know of.</p>
               <p>Can you say positively that the other three pieces that were lost was your master's property? - I am upon oath, they are Mr. Moore's property, here is one Mr. Evans who will likewise swear one piece to be Mr. Moore's property, and the tissue has my own mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. When they came in was this woman, who is not here, there at the begining? - Yes, she and Hill came in together first, I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the person who bought this silk, consulting that woman about the number of yards that would be necessary to have? - King asked me.</p>
               <p>Did not you understand that woman was the mantua-maker of one of these young women? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>To whom did you deliver this silk that was bought? - Hill had it.</p>
               <p>Was not it delivered to the mantuamaker? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear that woman say, I cannot purchase it till my mantua-maker comes, and was not it settled between the mantua-maker and her, how many yards would be necessary? - No, Sir, she settled it herself, she said, she would have a yard and three quarters, turning round to Hill and the other woman, and said, she always liked to have enough and to spare.</p>
               <p>Did not you see it delivered after it was paid for to that woman? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Nor hear her say any thing about her making it up soon? - I did not upon my oath, I have never seen the other woman from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Did not you charge that other woman, when you stopped Hill, did not you say, that tall woman, the mantua-maker has taken some silk? - I asked her what was become of the tall woman, because I had reason to suspect them all; I told her so at the time.</p>
               <p>I believe standing on the opposite side of the way you may see both the doors of the publick house? - Yes, I saw both doors, I saw Richardson coming out of one door, and King coming out of the other.</p>

               <p>Then they could not escape your notice by coming out of one door or the other? - Not at that time they could not.</p>
               <p>You went immediately? - I did.</p>
               <p>Had they any opportunity of going any where in that house? - They might go through the house.</p>
               <p>Could they go to any other part of the house? - One of them might run up stairs.</p>
               <p>Why you saw them instantly? - Before I got two yards from Hill I observed them coming out, and that was the time I gave her to the care of Mr. King, it was some time before Mr. King took care of her.</p>
               <p>Did these people desire to be searched? - Yes, Hill desired to be searched, but said, she would not go to Proctor's; she gave no reasons.</p>
               <p>I believe it is a house where all the basket people use? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Borough. About midnight on Sunday, 12th Jan., I was going home, and was stopped by four or five prostitutes—they surrounded me, and wanted me to stay with them, but I would not, and broke away from them—one of them called out "Bob!" and a man came out of a house with a poker in his hand, and threw it after me—it missed me, and he ran after me, overtook me, and knocked me down in the mud, hit me on the nose, and made it bleed—I felt him trying to put his hand into my pocket, and struggled—the females came up and pulled me by the hair—I had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some halfpence in my pocket—I struggled and broke away, and an officer came—it was a light night—there were no lamps—I was about 100 yards from him when he threw the poker; my face was to him, I saw him throw it.</p>

I was on duty, heard a dis<lb></lb>turbance, and saw Robinett running—I saw a poker thrown after him by some woman, who was from four to six yards from him—I went to him, he said he had been knocked down, nothing more—he was all over dirt and blood—he gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

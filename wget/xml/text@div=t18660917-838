                  </hi>. I live at 57, Castle Street East—on the evening of 20th August, about half-past nine, I was in Margaret Street, Cavendish Square—the prisoner came up to me, used abusive language to me, and struck me in the face—his three companions came up to me and took my watch from my pocket—they were with him at the time he struck me—my watch fell on the ground—I scrambled for it with them—one of them got it and ran away—I immediately caught hold of one of them and held him—another one came up to me, struck me in the back, and threw my cap away—then they all got away—I looked about for my cap, found it, and hallooed "Stop thief!"—I could not see any of them then—I saw the prisoner again on 27th August, a week after, at George Street—he Was mixed with twelve others, and I picked him out—I had never seen him before the night of the robbery.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman 23 L). On the night of 20th of August I was on duty in Oxford Street, near Berwick Street, in plain clothes—I was opposite Wells Street—I saw the prisoner and two other men named Day and Doyley coming up Wells Street—they turned up Castle Street into Adam and Eve Court, running—I then got near the end of the court into Oxford Street, and they passed me and went down Berwick Street—I followed them into a court in Little Windmill Street, and then left them—I afterwards heard of the robbery, and was then on the look-out for the prisoner and the other men—on 27th I ascertained where he was living and took him into custody—I said, "Prendergast, I want you for being concerned with three others in stealing a watch"—He said, "I didn't take it," or, "I didn't do it," I can't be sure which were the words—I then placed him at the station in George Street with ten or twelve others about his own height—the prosecutor was sent for by the inspector into the yard—</p>

               <p>he immediately selected the prisoner—he went up to him and said, "You are the man; I should know you from a hundred"—the prisoner said nothing—I have known the prisoner for years, ever since he was a boy.</p>

Sergeant Cole said he had a man on suspicion of robbing me—I went to George Street with him—I waited in a little room until they said, "It's your time to come"—I then went into the yard and saw eleven or twelve men standing all in a row—I imme<lb></lb>diately pointed out the prisoner—he was not pointed out to me by any one—I did not see any of the twelve men go in—I could not see anything from the room where I waited—there was only one little window, where a man was waiting—all the, men were of the same height as the prisoner. and appeared of the same position of life—some were not. as well dressed—at the time that the prisoner hit me and robbed me I noticed he had the appearance of a black eye; not properly a black eye, the appearance of one.</p>

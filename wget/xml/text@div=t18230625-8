The prisoner was one; I knew him before - he came, and asked if I had any money - I said No. He said he wanted 1 d.; I said I had none; he said he would have one. I felt in my pocket, and found three farthings, and gave it him, and told him he was welcome to it if he would go away - he said he wanted a comb; I said I had not one. On taking the three farthings out of my pocket, the silver in my waistcoat pocket jerked. I put the waistcoat under my legs; he snatched it from me, and took it away across the road, and took the silver out, and threw the waistcoat back - I put it on. I knew him by the name of Hacket. I told him he had taken a shilling and four sixpences - he swore, and said it was untrue, that there was nothing in it but a few buttons - there were some buttons, but I am certain the silver was there too. I put my things on, and pursued, but lost sight of him. I saw him on the Thursday night at a public-house in Orchard-street, and charged him with it; he denied knowing me.</p>

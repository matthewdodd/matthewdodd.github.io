               <p>- COVIN sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 25th of May, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw two boys following Mr. Andrews, at the corner of Billiter-Lane; his handkerchief hung a little out of his pocket; just as they were turning the corner, I caught the prisoner putting the handkerchief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030006"></xptr> in his bosom; I did not see him take it.</p>
               <p>[The handkerchief was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.]</p>

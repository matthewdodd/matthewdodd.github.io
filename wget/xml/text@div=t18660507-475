                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Payne, of Bloomsbury-square—I engaged the prisoner as cook—I had an excellent character with her, which I afterwards found to be a false one—she was about a month in my employment—she asked me while there what I should</p>

               <p>do if thieves came into the house—I don't know whether she asked me that more than once—on the night of 6th April, I remember the servants retiring to bed—I had two servants, a cook and a housemaid—the prisoner was the cook and Ann Bartley the housemaid—I went to bed about half-past 10—I remained up about half an hour after them—I was in the drawing-room during that time—I noticed that the room was perfectly free from fire—the fire was not quite out—there was a little spark, a few ashes left at the bottom, nothing more—there was no likelihood of any sparks flying out—I was disturbed by the housemaid next morning about half-past 7—she came and told me that the sofa had been set on fire in the drawing-room—I instantly went down stairs into the drawing-room, and found the sofa burnt in three places; the front of it, in front of the cushion, the back of the sofa, and the scroll at the end—that was burnt most of all—it was a flat cushion, not a round bolster—the sofa was stuffed with hair, and covered with a loose chintz cover over the canvas or sacking—I called in the police and went with them to examine the kitchen—we found a box of lucifers on the mantelpiece in the kitchen which was in the habit of being kept in the servants' bedroom—I had not given injunctions that it should never be removed from there, but it had never been removed for I do not know how long—there were lucifers in the kitchen to light the fire with, and there was a separate supply in every room in the house—I only lost some wine—I lost that on the Wednesday before the fire occurred on the Saturday—I never mentioned it to the prisoner—I had seen a man walking up and down before the house on two or three occasions, and I spoke to her about that, and asked her if she knew him—she said, "No," and she seemed rather anxious about it—that was a fortnight or more before the fire—I told her to look at the man; he was watching the house, and looking down into the kitchen, and I did not like the idea of it—I did not quarrel with her about it at all—I think she said that the man was after some servant lower down in the square—the prisoner's box was searched some days after she had left by the police—there were a quantity of rags in it—the box was not broken open—the keys were taken from her at the station—there is a fire-escape at the top of my house, the ladder of which is close to the servants' room, so that any one could get from that room to the neighbouring house in a moment—there are two floors above the drawing-room—the foot of the sofa was one foot from the mantelpiece, and four feet from the grate—I measured it yesterday—the chintz cover fitted the sofa quite tight—it did not fall over the legs, it only covered the seat—there was no valens.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid in the service of Mr. Payne—on the night of 6th April I retired to bed with the prisoner, we slept in the same room, but not in the same bed—our beds were close together—I was awoke about 4 o'clock in the morning by the rustling of paper—the prisoner was out of bed when I awoke—about two or three minutes afterwards she went down stairs, and was down stairs about ten minutes—she then returned up stairs, and took a drink of something, and got into bed, and in about five or ten minutes she got out of bed again and shut our bedroom door—she got into bed and began to snore directly—about twenty minutes or half an hour after that the room was filled with smoke—I thought it was a fog—the door was shut then—I did not smell the smoke, I only saw the darkness</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186605070036"></xptr>
               <p>like a fog—I did not know where it was coming from—it cleared away about 6 o'clock, and we got up at 7 and went down stair, and I found the sofa in the drawing-room burnt—the fire was out then—I went down stairs into the kitchen and told the prisoner that the drawing-room sofa was burnt—she said, "What a dreadful thing! we might have been burnt to death. Did you tell your mistress?"—the sofa had an antimacassar on it—that was burnt as well—I went and told my mistress—the night before this the prisoner had asked me if the plate was all marked alike—she did not ask me where it was kept—it was kept near my mistress's bedroom, in her dressing-room; not in a basket, but in a large chest of drawers—we had out what we wanted for use, and it was taken up at night, and taken down in the morning—we had the other plate out if we had company—we had no visitors while the prisoner was there, so as to call for the use of the other plate—the night before the fire the prisoner said that I had been very restless the night before, and she took all my clothes and put them on the bed before I got into bed—she asked me if any one could get out of the bedroom window—we could do so and get along the parapet—I told her the man who cleaned the windows got in there to clean them—the lower step of the fire-escape was near the bedroom—the prisoner once asked me why my mistress did not wear a watch—she did not wear one—I do not know where it was kept—there was a watch kept in the room, but I did not know whether it was what the mistress used—I think she used to wear it occasionally.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you lived with Mrs. Payne? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About nine months—I knew the cook who was there before the prisoner—the cook used generally to shut up the house at night—that was the case while the prisoner was there, and also in the time of the former cook—I used to help her in shutting up the house—we generally went up to bed together, and the door used to be fastened as we went up—the prisoner was down stairs before me on this morning—I cannot tell whether the street-door was fastened or not when I came down—I did not hear any complaint made about the door being unfastened, or any door.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you always fasten the front door at night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I helped you to fasten it, because you could not reach the top bolt—we were nearly always together when it was fastened—I am sure it was fastened on the night in question—I never wished the bedroom door to be left open at night—I may have remarked why did not the mistress come up to bed, because she always used to come up to bed with us—the door was not kept open till she came up—I hardly ever heard her come up—I did one night ask you to leave the door open until mistress came to bed, because I had not put the glass away, and I did not want her to know it—it was one night that week.</p>

I was called by Mrs. Payne to her house on 7th April last—I was taken up to the drawing-room and shown the sofa—I found it had been set fire to in three distinct places—it appeared to have been done by a lighted piece of paper or a lighted candle with a flare—at the end of the sofa near the fire-place was a small burn that had <hi rend="italic">mouldered</hi>, burnt itself out, about six inches further along the sofa there was a larger place, which was burnt—it was not on the seat, but on the side near the seat in front of the squab—the head of the sofa was nearly all burnt—it had <hi rend="italic">mouldered</hi> into a cinder—all the chintz was <hi rend="italic">mouldered</hi> right through, the hair and all—I should think about half the sofa was burnt—I felt the hair, and it was quite warm—I had both servants with me in the drawing-room at the time, and I questioned them to know whether they had heard</p>

               <p>any one about, or how it could have caught fire—the last witness then stated that her fellow servant had been down stain a little before four o'clock—the prisoner heard that, and she strongly denied that she had been down stairs at all—she could not give an account of how the sofa could have caught fire—I took her into custody—the kitchen was afterwards searched by the inspector and another sergeant.</p>

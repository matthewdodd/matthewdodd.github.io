                  </hi>. I am a French polisher, and live at 9, Phcenix-place, Somers-town. The prisoner lodged at my house between three and four months, she had two children, a boy aged seven years, and a girl about nine months, which was called Emily Harriet—on the night of 8th Dec., the prisoner went out at about a quarter before 9 o'clock, with a female companion—I went into the street, and followed them into Chapel-street, where they <hi rend="italic">picked up</hi> a man, and I watched them to the church way; I then returned home, and obtained the assistance of Pearce, 149 S—we went into the prisoner's room, the door of which was not locked, and there found the two children—the infant was lying on a bundle of dirty rags on the hearth, with nothing to cover it but the frock it had on, and an old cape attached to its body—there was no fire, but there was about a quarter of a cwt. of coals in the room; it was a very cold night—there were children's clothes in the room, such things as hoods, frocks., petticoats, worsted gaiters and caps, they would have been produced here, but they were too filthy to bring—these was some bread and dripping in the room—the boy was in one corner of the room, on an old flock bed with nothing to cover it but his own clothes, and both the children were covered with vermin—the prisoner did not return till 10 next morning—I had noticed before that the prisoner was in the habit of leaving the children, but had never before had an opportunity of getting into the room—the prisoner went out to work generally two or three days a week—I have noticed her go out at various times—I worked in the next room, and have frequently been at work till 3 in the morning, and she has not been home then—she generally went out about 8 or 9—I am not aware that any person was left in charge of the children when she went out, I never saw any one—I never saw her take the children out with her when she went out—about a week before this, I had applied at the prisoner's door for some rent, and I then said to bar, "Mrs. White, it is quite time we should part; if you do not get out of my place as soon as you can, I will bring down the law upon you for starving the child," and I was grinned at, and laughed at, and dared to do my best and my worst—on finding the child in this state, I carried it to the poor-house, Pearce went with me.</p>

               <p>at washing and charring, and when she was at work she came home about 9 or 10 o'clock—I was never in her room before this time—I do not know whether she left any one when she was out, but I was always on the listen—I occupy the back parlour and first floor front, I work in the back parlour—I cannot swear that she left no one there when she went out—when she was charring she went out at half-past 6, I used to call her myself—I do not know whether the prisoner had any covering for the bed, when she came I did not see any, the bed came in all rolled up—I do not know that she had to part with her furniture from time to time for food—I did not see any of it go out—I did not see a small box go out on the night before this, or any time before—there was a box in the room when I went about the rent on 1st Dec, and it was still there on the 8th—on 8th Dec. there were four chairs, a table, a box, a teakettle, a fender, a pair of tongs, a few ornaments, and a flock bed in the room—I am taking care of them now—I had seen the infant before this, out in the court in the boy's arms on a pouring wet day with nothing to cover it—it was not a large cape the infant had on on this night, it was thrown over it, attached to its frock—it was the usual sized cape for a woman's gown—it was merely placed over the child, the child was not wrapped up in it—it was made of a kind of merino, and I believe the child's frock was cotton—when I said I would bring down the law upon her, she said, "What do you mean by that?"—I said, "I mean what I say, I mean that I will bring down the law upon you for starving that child," and she said I might do my best and worst—I might have said when I gave an account of this before, that she smiled and made no reply—this is my signature to my deposition, it was read over to me before I signed it—(<hi rend="italic">this being read</hi>, stated, "I threatened to bring down the law upon her in respect to the youngest child—she said, What do you mean?—I said I meant that she was starving the child; she made no reply but smiled")—there was nearly a month's rent owing to me on 1st Dec.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the surgeon of St. Pacer as' Workhouse and Infirmary—I was at the workhouse when this child was brought there on the night of 8th Dec.—I examined it and found it in a very dirty, filthy, and emaciated state—it was covered with vermin, and was labouring under disease of the mesenteric glands, which are glands in the lining of the abdo<lb></lb>men, and have considerable influence on the digestion—the disease of these glands would cause the emaciated state of the child—from the state in which I saw the child, I attribute the disease to neglect, and want of proper food—want of cleanliness is a proof of neglect—the child was properly takes care of, all the vermin entirely removed, and in two or three days it appeared to have somewhat improved, but it died on 18th—I did not from the first anticipate its recovery—I opened the body after death, and then found the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202020069"></xptr>
               <p>mesenteric disease, and an effusion of serum in the pericardium, or bag of the heart—there had been no disease of the heart till immediately preceding death—there always is a trifling effusion in the pericardium, before death—the state of disease I found must have resulted from neglect, and want of care, and that must have continued for some considerable time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> if I understand you, you consider the effusion of serum to have resulted from the mesenteric disease? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it can exist of itself without other disease.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The effusion of serum is almost in the act of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—in this case I consider it the result of the disease—it existed in this case for a few hours before death—it is also a substantive disease, independent of other diseases—there was no sign in this case of a co-existing disease of the heart—this must have been in consequence of the disease.</p>

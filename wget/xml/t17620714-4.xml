She came to me for her husband as I thought. I paid her a shilling, out of which she spent a penny. The constable pays the watchmen quarterly at my house, and I know nothing but she was the wife of one Newman. She came again, and wanted some more liquor. I had been out: I came in, and was told the prisoner had been at my till. I sent for her; they brought her back. She had some money in her hand, we opened it, and there we found three shillings. I desired to know, how she came by that money? and said it certainly was mine. I sent for a constable, he took her into the yard. Soon after he called me into the yard, and told me, she had confessed she had taken seven shillings. This was the 28th of May.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to the prosecutor to take the prisoner in charge. They told me she had taken some money. She would not own it in the tap room. I took her out into the yard; she then owned she had taken seven shillings out of the till, and delivered three shillings to me, as part of the money. She was in liquor. I carried her before justice Welch, there she begged for mercy, and said, she never did such a thing before.</p>

On the 14th of September, the three prisoners came into my shop, a little before ten o'clock in the evening. Reynolds asked if I had a lodging - I said I should have a room to let on Monday, and he might take it then - while I was talking to him, I saw a hand pass over the counter, and in a few minutes I missed my scales - I saw them on the counter, but Griffiths's hand was over them - I said,</p>
               <p>"you have got my scales, I will not be robbed before my face" - and took them from him, and said,</p>
               <p>"he off this moment, or I'll have you taken;" they all went away - Colton came in, and spoke to me. I went after them; Griffiths had moved them a little way from where they stood, and got them under his hand. I cannot say he meant to steal them.</p>

            . I was with Colton, in Bedford-square, about half a mile from Pancras-street. I watched the prisoners into the prosecutrix's shop - one of them stepped out a little, while I looked round, to see if any one was looking after him - Beauchamp came to the door, and looked out. I crossed over, and saw the prosecutrix in a tussle with Griffiths, and called Colton; they walked out, and ran into Tottenham Court-road. I secured Griffiths.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Bailey and Newman Sher wood, builders, at Lambeth; they contract for the Eastern railroad. On the morning of Monday, the 4th of March, Mr. Davies came and said he had taken one of our men, and showed me some wood, which was <hi rend="italic">ours—</hi> we could not miss it exactly, as we have so much.</p>

                  </hi>. I met the prisoner at Great Ilford, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, about a quarter of a mile from the place where this was taken from—he had three pieces of wood on his shoulder—I asked him where he brought it from—he said a man had given it him out of a cart, to take to the White Horse, to leave there—I said, I thought it was a very strange thing, and I could not take his statement—I took the wood in my care, and Webb claimed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to John Pink Chambers, a pawnbroker, in Regent-street, Westminster. About six o'clock in the evening of the 15th of Oct., the prisoner came to our shop, and pledged a gown for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were several other persons in the shop—I missed a flannel petticoat, which I had seen safe not a quarter of an hour before—I immediately followed the prisoner, and brought her back—I accused her of taking it, and asked if she had it in her basket—she said she had nothing in her basket—we opened it, and found the petticoat that I had missed—it is the property of Mr. Cham<lb></lb>bers, I am sure of that—she said it belonged to her daughter, who is here.</p>

DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did this petticoat belong to any of the family? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is one we had for sale—it was the only one we had at that time—it hung up in the shop—there was a mark on it, but that was taken off, and was found on the floor—the pin must have been taken out—the pet<lb></lb>ticoat has the knot on it which was tied when it was hung up—there is no mark on the petticoat itself, but 1 will swear positively to it from having it in my hand so often—I know it by the fineness of the flannel, and the band—I told the Magistrate that the prisoner said it belonged to her daughter—I do not recollect that I said she denied having it in her basket.</p>

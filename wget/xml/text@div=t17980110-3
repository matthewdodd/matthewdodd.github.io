            , and the prisoner at the bar, respecting the duplicate, which he said he had not given him, of a coat that he had pledged; I pressed the prisoner very much, as it is very frequently the case, when we give a person a duplicate, that it falls over on their side;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100006"></xptr>I pressed him to look if it was there; he refused to look; I desired him to stand on one side and let me look; he refused; upon which I pushed him back, and saw the gown sticking between his legs; the push that I gave him pushed him back, and made him drop it from him; I immediately jumped over the counter, and seized him by the collar; says I, you rascal, you might well not move, when you had got this gown; says I, you are a thief, I shall give charge of you; I immediately sent for the watchman, Robert Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all perceive him take this gown? - A. I had not the smallest idea of it, I had had it in my hands not two minutes before; I had laid it upon a place that we have under the counter to be sent up stairs, and after we have done business the lad carries up the goods again; it was fetched down for a customer, it was the wrong one, and had not been carried up again.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there is an end of the capital part; it is not a shop, it is a pledge, not an article for sale, and cannot come within the statute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I thought so myself, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it within his reach? - A. Yes, just over the counter; I was going to the watch-house, I left him in custody of the watchman to go back for the gown; when I returned, I did not see either watchman or man, but was pursuing my way to the watch-house; just at the end of Chancery-lane I secured him, after a great deal of resistance.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very much wounded with that resistance? - A. Yes, very much; my hand is not well now, it was sewed up in four places; and he cut me very much over the eyes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hatter, and live at 83, Whitechapel. On Thursday night, 23rd September, I retired to rest about 11 o'clock—the house was at that time locked up and safe, in the usual way—about 6 o'clock the following morning I came down stairs and saw the pantry door open, the kitchen door and the window of the kitchen up stairs; that window opens on to a skylight at the back of the premises—the whole of the tin and metal articles on the mantel-piece were gone—the doors were all fastened when I went to bed; the skylight was fastened down—there is a part that opens for the admission of air, that was shifted away—I missed a great many things, amongst them the things mentioned in the indictment—in the course of the day afterwards I missed a coat, a hat, a handkerchief, and a pair of shoes; I also missed some printed books, table-cloths, and aprons—the books were taken out of the front room—all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185810250050"></xptr>
               <p>these articles were safe on my premises the night before—there was a dirty old waistcoat, and a ragged black silk handkerchief, and a check handkerchief with a poultice in it left behind—I immediately gave information to the police—I did not see the prisoner till he was at the station-house in custody—I went down to the station, and there I saw the hat which was safe in the house the night before, and a coat, and a pair of shoes which the prisoner wore; he had the coat on, and it was taken off him, and the shoes also—my house is in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel—I had not heard any noise—it was as near 6 as possible when I got out of bed; I think it must have been before 6 when I was dressing—I did not hear any noise during that time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 198). On Friday morning, 24th September, I was called in to Mr. Hart's house—I examined the premises, and found an old waistcoat and two old handkerchiefs with a poultice in one—I found this poker, it has been a part of what they put into a fender, or stand, the end of it is flattened out—I had seen the prisoner in Whitechapel the day previous to that on which I received the information, about a few yards off the prosecutor's house—his apparel was very ragged and dirty—I noticed him particularly; he wore a dirty cap and a dirty pepper-and-salt coloured coat, ragged, a waistcoat of the same, and corduroy trousers—the waistcoat found on the premises was a similar one to what he was wearing the day before—I saw a handkerchief on him—I noticed him with his hand in a sling—I saw that his hand was wrapped up in something, but as to that handker<lb></lb>chief I could not swear to it; his hand seemed to be wrapped up in another handkerchief—it was on Thursday morning that I saw him dressed as I have described, and on Friday evening I saw him dressed very respectably—I took the prisoner into custody on the Friday evening, and sent information to Mr. Hart—he came to the station and identified the hat, coat, and shoes which the prisoner was wearing—the prisoner had this small scarf on (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He says he had seen me about for six weeks, and I can prove that I was in Spitalfields workhouse part of that time, and the night before I was taken I had the workhouse clothes on, and my mother has taken them back since I have been here—I bought these clothes in Petticoat-lane, out of money that I earned when I was in the country last August. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am sure I saw the prisoner on the Thursday morning dressed in shabby clothes—I had seen him about Whitechapel for about a week previously; I had seen him about for five or six weeks, he was always in dirty ragged clothes—the coat was very ragged about the pockets and tail; it was made of the same sort of stuff as this waistcoat—when I took the prisoner in custody he was in Whitechapel, walking along about twenty or thirty yards from the prosecutor's house; he had no waistcoat on then—he had a cut on his right hand; he had no bandage on, but the palm of his hand was white as if he had just left off a poultice.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 105). I saw the prisoner in Whitechapel on 23rd September, between 10 and 11 at night, nearly close to Mr. Hart'shouse—his dress was very shabby indeed; that waistcoat is similar to the one that he wore when I saw him—he had a pair of corduroy trousers on, and a coat nearly the same colour as this as far as I could see; it was something of the same sort of material—he was carrying his hand in a sling; he had this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185810250051"></xptr>
               <p>handkerchief wrapped round his right hand—that is one that was found on the premises; it was a handkerchief of that pattern—there appeared to be a poultice within the handkerchief—I helped take him to the station—he was dressed very well indeed at that time—he had a coat on, but no waist<lb></lb>coat—the hand looked as though there had been a poultice on, but there was no poultice on at that time—I had seen him about for about six weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I bought the clothes with my own money in Petticoat-lane, which I can prove.

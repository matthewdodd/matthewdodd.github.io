On the 1st of November, I was in Great Russell-street, about one o'clock in the day—my arm was suddenly seized by a stranger, who said my handkerchief was gone—I missed it—there was a cry of "Stop thief," and I saw a man running away—the pursuit was so quick, that he dropped my handkerchief, which a gentleman took up and gave me—in about two minutes a policeman brought the prisoner up from an adjoining street—I cannot say whether he was the man.</p>

I was in Great Russell-street—I live in Bedford-row—I was on the opposite side of the street to Mr. Robinson—my attention was called to the prisoner and another young man walking very close to the gentleman's coat pocket—I saw the other one put his hand into his pocket, draw the handkerchief out, and give it to</p>

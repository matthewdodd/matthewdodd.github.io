                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On 10th May, about 12.30 at night, I was in Bear Lane, Gravel Lane—I saw the prisoner, who I had known before, with three others, dragging a drunken woman along the pavement—I crossed the road and turned my light on, and said, "Where are you going with this woman?"—the woman said, "Oh, do policeman take me away from these fellows; I live in Union Place, Edward Street"—I said "Let go of the woman," and they dropped her on the pavement—I lifted her up and put her against a house—one of the men said "A policeman gave her to us and we were taking her home"—I said, "It is my place to look after</p>

               <p>drunken people, not yours"—we got round the next turning, into Church Street, and a constable came up—I said "Did you give this woman to those fellows to take home"—he said "No, I did not"—I then said to the prisoner and the others "Get away out of the street"—I stepped off the kerb on to the road to follow one of the men—the prisoner walked behind, within two or three yards of me—when I got about seven or eight yards up Bear Lane, I received a blow on the right hand side of the face from behind—my hat was knocked off at the same time—I looked round to the left, and saw the prisoner spring past me—I said "Halloo, my lad, I know you"—at that time I came over giddy—he did not say a word—they all four went off as if there was a signal—there was no one else but the prisoner near enough to strike me—I am certain he is the man—I have known him five or six years, and I could pick him out of 5,000—it was a heavy blow in the face, and almost knocked me down; I thought it might be a life-preserver, it came with such force—it was a weapon—I was not aware I was cut till I got to the station—I made" my way to the pavement and recovered myself—I picked up my hat and went back to the constable, who had remained with the woman in Church Street—I went to the station with him, and the surgeon came and dressed my wound—I have got my great coat here which I wore that night; it was cut through the collar and through the brass plate which fastens the number to the collar—I bled all the way to the station, and till the surgeon arrived—I am under the care of the doctor now—I was confined to my bed a week—I saw Fuller and Knowles in custody at the police-court, but I would not say that they were there at the time—I declined to identify them—the prisoner I am sure about.</p>

On the morning of the 10th May, about 12.20, I saw the prisoner with three other men in Southwark Street, under the railway arch—they had a woman—she was very drunk—I walked up and asked them what was the matter—they told me the woman was drunk and they were going to take her home—I asked the woman where she lived, and she told me Union Place, Edward Street—I asked her if she could walk and she could not—I said to the man "If you don't take her away I shall," and they walked away towards Bear Lane with her, and I next saw them with Lane in Church Street—I never saw them after—they went round the corner with Lane, and about two minutes after he came back to me and I saw his face was bleeding—Knowles and Fuller were two of the men—I said so before the magistrate—I have not seen the fourth man since—I did not know any of them before.</p>

               <p>Lane on the 10th May in Bear Lane—he said "I was, not there"—coming from the barracks to the railway station, he said "I shan't suffer for what others have done"—the same day, before we went before the magistrate, he said "I will tell you who the two are that did it, that is Fuller and Knowles; they are both now at the militia at Kingston, and if you search Knowles' clothes you will find a white-handled knife that I saw him stab the policeman with; if it is not in his private clothes you will find it in his uniform; he wetted the knife with his tongue and stabbed the policeman"—I went back to Kingston and apprehended Knowles and Fuller, and brought them to the Southwark Police Court, and in the prisoner's presence they said they were there but they saw nothing of the constable being stabbed; they went away when they were told to go—they were remanded, and discharged as there was no evidence—I did not find any knife in Knowles' clothes—there was a knife taken down to Kingston by Fuller.</p>

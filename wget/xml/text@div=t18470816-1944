                  </hi> I am a tailor, and live in Tothill-fields, Westminster. The younger prisoner was in my service up to Thursday evening, the 29th of July, about seven o'clock, when she left without notice—she wanted to take a gown to her mother to be altered, and I let her go—I missed a pair of trowsers about eight o'clock, off a gas-branch over the window—I had seen them all that week—these produced are them—they are new—they are mine—there is no mark on them—there is stain inside the pocket, on a piece of plaid—they are my own work—they were bespoke, but they were not called for in time—no one assists in my shop—my wife was at Gravesend at the time—the prisoner lived with me ten days—I had a character with her.</p>

I produce a pair of trowsers, pledged on the 29th of July, at a little before eight o'clock, by the elder prisoner—I am quite certain of her—I have known her seven or eight years—she said, "David, these are not mine, they belong to Mrs. Mansfield; put them in Mrs. Mansfield's name"—Mrs. Carter wrote the ticket in that name—the younger prisoner was at the door.</p>

On the 30th of July I took the elder prisoner into custody—she asked me if her daughter was found; I told her, "No"—I took her to Mr. Carter's, and Chambers saw her—as I was taking her back to the station, she said to Mr. Lyons, "Do not say any-thing about them, you will have them all right by twelve o'clock"—she said, "The law can take no hold of me, I only took the parcel into the shop; it was pawned by another woman"—On the 4th of August I took the younger prisoner, on the Surrey-side of Westminster-bridge—I took her to the station, said she was charged with stealing trowsers, and that she had got her mother into trouble—she said, "Serve her right; if I stole it, she had no right to pledge it, and I hope to God she will get two years for it."</p>

He denied having seen the gown; then I took him before a justice of the peace; before the justice he said, my servant in the shop gave him the gown, and bid him run away with it.</p>

             . I am servant to the prosecutor. The prisoner came into my mistress's shop to sell a stock, which I bought of him, about five in the afternoon, on the 9th of September. I went to the next door for change; I left him alone in the shop; I gave him the change; he seemed to be in a great tremble ; when he went away I turned round to see if he had got any thing; I missed a gown; I ran after him, calling out, stop thief; he was stopt in a wheeler's yard, Newtoner's-lane ; he was taken to the justice; there he told the justice I gave him the gown, and bid him run away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the gown ?</p>
               <p>Ash . No; I did not. I never saw him before. The gown was found where he had thrown it.</p>

            . Do you know this gown?</p>
               <p>Ash. It is my master's property, and had been in the shop just before the prisoner came.</p>
               <p>Hallowday. I heard an out-cry of, stop thief, last Tuesday; I saw the prisoner run with a bundle under his coat: he ran up my mistress's yard; I went to him; I saw him throw something away; I looked where he flung it, saw it taken out; it was this gown; we went with him before the justice; there he said the maid gave it him, and bid him run away with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing at all about it; it is not the gown I had.</p>
               <p>- Plunket . I have known the prisoner about seven or eight years; he has been a gentleman's servant; he always bore a good character.</p>

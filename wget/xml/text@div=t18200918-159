On the 18th of September, I had a shutter put up to guard my meat, the defendant came home at five o'clock in the afternoon, and instead of going into his house, came straight to my door, and insisted I should take the shutter down, or he would knock it down. I perceived he was in a state of intoxication, and therefore made no reply, but stood before my door serving my customers. It was Saturday, he was not deprived of his senses; he began to push the meat and the stall-board about. I merely laughed at him; he turned himself round, and attempted to take the shutter down, it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180074"></xptr>very slightly hung on a hook. He pulled it different ways, but could not get it off, turned round, and swore at me. He had some crumpets in his hand, his wife was at the door; she begged him to come in, and not make a fool of himself, and took him by the arm to pull him in, but he thrust her away from him, came back to the shutter, and pulled it violently; he at last saw how it hung, and lifted it off; he walked fourteen or fifteen feet towards the road-side, and pitched it into the road with all his force. I went to pick it up, and as I passed him he said,</p>
               <p>"There, d - n you, I will serve you the same." In pitching it down he fell himself, that was before I went to take it up. I was on the footpath, not within reach of him, when he fell, standing with my hands tucked between my waistcoat and apron, his wife came and picked him up, and begged him not to make a fool of himself. Instead of going in, he came before the shop, and pulled the stall-board and meat about, swearing he had bought the whole of the ground, and the house was all his, he had paid for it, and I had no business there; he swore by all the oaths he could make, that d - n his eyes, he would make me shut up shop, and run away. His wife and some one took him in doors. He had not been long before he came out with a great coat on, and went down the road, he returned in about twenty minutes, with his arm in a sling, and d - d and swore how he would serve me, and make me spend every shilling I had. He pushed me away from the front of the shop, caught up a chopper, and swore he would split my skull with it. I took it from him, and told him to go in doors. As the people came up, he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n it, do not buy any meat of that b - dy butcher; whoever buys meat of him, ought to go to eternal damnation." He collected a mob before the door, I sent for a constable. Just before the constable came he ran up stairs, opened his first floor window, abused me from there, and advised the people not to buy of me, saying I gave short weight. Essex, the constable, came, he abused him in the same way, and set him at defiance.</p>
               <p>Q. In the whole course of the transaction did you strike or kick him - A. No; I never touched him except to take the chopper from him; I never struck or threw him down. I was afterwards taken before a Magistrate by him, and put into Giltspur-street Compter, and was served with the summons which Mr. Leigh attended on my behalf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. His wife keeps a haberdasher's shop - A. There is a shop of that description. I did not go near him till after he fell. I snatched the chopper out of his hand; I did not trip up his heels or push him.</p>

            . I am a cooper, and live next door to Lloyd. On the 18th of September I was coming out of Mr. Fuller's house, six doors from Lloyd's; the prisoner passed, he seemed in liquor. I walked behind him past his own door up to Lloyd's; he desired Lloyd to pull his shutter down, Lloyd said he would not, and told him to go in. Derry immediately swore, and said</p>
               <p>"These premises I have paid for, and you have no business here," and began to pull his meat and cloth about. His wife came and said,</p>
               <p>"Come in, and don't suffer yourself to be laughed at." He gave her some crumpets out of his hand, caught hold of the shutter, and endeavoured to wrench it down, but did not succeed, and began throwing the meat about again, threatening Lloyd how he would serve him. He turned again to the shutter, got it off the book, and carried and threw it into the middle of the road, as far as his strength would admit, and in turning round from throwing it he fell. Lloyd followed him with both his hands tucked in his apron, as he had stood all the while, picked up the shutter, and gave it to me - I took it in doors. In the mean time Derry was picked up by his wife and a man; he was using very bad expressions all the time. I went away, and saw no more. Up to that time Lloyd had not touched him.</p>

I was buying meat at Lloyd's, and saw Derry come up and abuse Lloyd in a most shameful manner about the shutter - he had not said a word to him. He made several attempts to take it down, he succeeded the second time, and threw it into the middle of the road; the force he threw it with threw him down - Lloyd had not laid a finger on him; his hands were in his apron or breeches, and could not possibly touch him, he was as cool as possible - he went and picked the shutter up, and gave it to Mr. Eldridge.

He then attempted to pull it down, went away, returned in a moment, and got it down; he took it out, and threw it into the middle of the road - as he turned round he fell. My master went and picked the shutter up - I think this was before Derry was down. My master never touched him, his hands were in his apron. He gave the shutter to Eldridge, who took it in. A woman picked Derry up, and he went in doors. He came out again, went away, returned in a quarter of an hour, and abused my master very much. He had his hand in a sling. He took a chopper in his left hand, and said he would split my master' skull with it; my master took it from him without any violence, and sent for an officer; when he came the prisoner had gone in, and he abused the officer from the window.</p>

I saw him kicking up a row about the shutter, which he endeavoured to take off, but did not succeed; the second time he got it off, turned and threw it down, and by throwing it he fell himself. Lloyd was two or three people from him at that time, and not near enough to strike or kick him. I saw every thing that passed. Lloyd went out and picked the shutter up. Derry's wife and some one came and took him in; he came back before the shop, and used most horrible language; Lloyd sent me for a constable, I returned with one; Derry was then up at his window, abusing Lloyd. After the constable was gone Derry walked before the door, and said if he had a knife he would stick him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Bethnal-green-road. On the 18th of September, between five and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner sent for me - he had a sling round his shoulder, which appeared to have had his arm in it, but he was in a violent passion at this time. He threw one arm down violently on the counter, and held a knife in the other, swearing he would stab Lloyd if he could get at him. He used both arms with great strength; if he had been hurt it would be impossible for him to have used them in that way - by the action of his arms they could not have been injured. I saw him nine or ten days after, putting up his shutters with both arms.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS addressed the Jury on behalf of the defendant, and called four witnesses to contradict the case, but they confirmed the evidence for the prosecution.</p>

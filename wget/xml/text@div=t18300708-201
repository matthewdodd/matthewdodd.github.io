               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was it not raining? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH KING. I am a baker. I was passing, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket - the prosecutor turned, and asked if I saw any one take it; I pointed out the prisoner, who was running- he followed, and called Stop thief! I understood the prisoner dropped the handkerchief, but I did not see it -I am confident the prisoner took it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How near were you to him? A. Close to him - I was passing; he tucked it into his pocket, and ran off - I was not momentarily prepared to take him - it was raining fast.</p>
               <p>JAMES BROOKS. I took the prisoner. This handkerchief was given to me by a strange woman, who picked it up - I found nothing on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see him drop it? A. No; I ran over it; it was raining.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

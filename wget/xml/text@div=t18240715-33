On the 27th of June, about half-past ten o'clock at night I marked eight shillings, eight sixpences, six shillings in penny-pieces, and six shillings in halfpence. I marked a few of them, and my son marked the rest - we saw each other do it - my wife and son saw them put into the till, when I was locking-up the house. I left the key in the till. When I got up next morning, about seven o'clock, I found my bar-door open, which had been locked on the night before, and the key taken up with me. It was evident that the lock had not been picked, but pressed open. I went to the till in the bar, and missed two sixpences and one shilling. I then called my son down, and, in the presence of him, I counted the copper, and missed nineteen halfpence and seven penny-pieces. I got the officer, and then asked the prisoner what she had been doing in the bar - she denied having been there that morning. I asked her if she had not taken some money - she said she had money, but not mine, it was what her brother had given her on the night before to buy shoes - she then pulled out her money, which was one shilling and sixpence and three halfpence, not marked, and all the rest she had was marked. I said I knew them to be mine - she said she wondered how I dare say so, she could not tell how I should know one piece of money from another.</p>

I am the landlord of the Pembridge hotel, westbourne-grove, West—on 13th December, the prisoner came in for half a pint of beer—my daughter served him—he gave her a shilling—I looked at it, told him it was bad, and doubled it up—he said, "I took it at the Round House in change for half a crown"—I laid it on the counter, and went for a constable—I did not see the prisoner do anything with it—I do not know what became of it—I told the constable it had disappeared off the counter while I was giving change—the prisoner said that I had got it——I told him I believed he had swallowed it.</p>

We had 2 Quarterns of Brandy, which were brought up by another Creature that belong'd to the House; I paid 6 d. a Piece for 'em as they came in; the Prisoner call'd for a Third, but when I went to pay for it, I found but a Penny in my Pocket, and I had a Crown but 2 Minutes before Missing my Watch too, I desired to have it again, but she said, she had none of it. Then I call'd for a Watchman, who was a long time a coming; and then she told me, if I would go up again and lye with her, she would help me to my Watch; so I agreed to do as she desired me, and sent the Watchman away, in hopes of getting my Watch again, but she would not give it me for all that. Then I call'd for the Watchman again, and we made shift to get her to the Watch-house.</p>

Court. Was the Watchman in a Surprize too? Why did not he search her? Barter. Lord bless you! she kick'd and beat the Watchman and Constable like any thing. But I was told afterwards, that the Watch was in Pawn. Court. And did not you go to the Pawn-brokers to inquire for it? Barter. No, I was advis'd to the contrary, for they said, she would play the Devil with me if I did. She was Wife to Frasier who was hang'd in Chains; she has been twice cast for Transportation.</p>

He took hold of me, and said, he was going home to Grosvenor-Square, and if I would go with him, he would give me half a Crown. No, says I, if you will go to my Lodging, do and welcome; Well, says he, and so I will then. When he came into my Room, he gave me a Shilling to be familiar with me, and then he pull'd me and haul'd me to Pieces, and nothing would serve his turn, truly, but he would needs lie with me all Night, and because I would not let him he has sworn this against me. As for his Watch I saw none that he had, I had but a Shilling about me when the Watchman search'd me. I could have had a great many good House-keepers to my Character; but not thinking he would be so Vile and Wicked as to swear this against me, I never sent for them. There's

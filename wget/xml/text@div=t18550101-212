On the night of 27th Nov., as is my usual custom, I saw that my house was properly fastened up—the next morning I found two of the doors and the back window were open—they had forced the moulding off one door, and pushed the door open, and by the use of a chisel somebody had opened the window—there was a hole cut through the second door, by which a person could introduce his hand and undo the bolt—I missed twenty-four engravings, worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a glaziers' diamond, and some money—some of those engravings were valuable—three of them were worth four guineas each—these are them—I know Gibson—he worked for Mr. Cook, who has the lower workshop—he could get a knowledge of my premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Red Lion, in Wilson-street, Finsbury. On Thursday, 21st Aug., the prisoner came about mid day for half a pint of beer—he tendered me a sixpence in payment—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change; he took the change and drank the beer, and left the bar hastily—I exa<lb></lb>mined the sixpence and found it was bad—I placed it on a shelf and sent for the policeman, and gave it to him—he returned it me, and I kept it in my possession till the 23rd—on that day Mrs. Perry, my daughter, was in my shop, and she called my attention to the prisoner, who was then outside my window—my daughter had a sixpence in her band at the time—I went out and brought the prisoner in; I said he was the party that passed the sixpence on me on the Thursday—he denied it, and said he had never been in the house before—I am positive he is the man; I gave him into custody, and gave the two sixpences to the policeman.</p>

On 23rd Aug., I was assisting my father—the pri<lb></lb>soner came in between 7 and 8 o'clock that evening—I served him with half a pint of beer, he gave me a sixpence which was bad—I told him it was bad, he said he did not know it—I kept the sixpence in my hand, and afterwards gave it to my father—he went after the prisoner—I had seen the prisoner three weeks before—he came then with a bad sixpence—I gave it him back—he was not given into custody then.</p>

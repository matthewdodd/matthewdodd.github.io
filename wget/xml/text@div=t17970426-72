            ; the prisoner at the bar came to our house about three weeks before this happened, by the Portsmouth coach or mail, I cannot say which; he acted the part of a gentleman all the time he was there, which was a fortnight or three weeks, he slept there every night; on the 15th of March, in the morning, he came down rather sooner than usual.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was his room to that in which Mr. Diamond slept? - A. They were two different ways; this gentleman's room went up one flooring to the left, and the prisoner's went up another flooring to the right; he came down and desired me to get his breakfast, I did not get it immediately, and he asked me two or three times for it; I got it him, and after he had had his breakfast, he desired a coach to be called; there was one of our hackney coaches in the yard going out, and he went with it, his portmanteau was brought down, and he went away; about an hour afterwards, this gentleman came down and said, he had been rob<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260060"></xptr>bed. I was going through Great Russell-street that evening, between six and seven o'clock, and met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that earlier or later than he usually returned to his lodgings? - A.Earlier; I looked at him, and he at me, and he asked me if I had any letters at our house for him, I told him, no, there was not, but I would wish to speak to him; he said, what do you want with me? I said, I do not went any thing with you, but my master does; he said, he was going a little way, and he would come down in the space of five minutes; upon that, I said, he could come down there, and go where he wanted afterwards; he said, he must go there first; then I said, I would go there with him; as we went past the Hummums, he tried to run away; upon that, I said, if you behave like a gentleman, I will not collar you, but if you do not, I will; with that, he walked by the side of me; we went through Tavistock-court, and when we got to the bottom, there was some beer letting down into a cellar at a public-house, and we could only go over one at a time, he stepped over the rupes first, and then be took to his heels; I followed him into Maiden-lane, and there I told him he should not go another step without me; I delivered him into the hands of the patrole, and there was a seal found upon him, and some money which the patrole has got.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hastings—I was staying at the Bolt-in-Tun public-house, in Fleet-street. On the 27th of December I went to dine a friend, and got drunk—I left my friend's house about seven o'clock—I had one friend with me part of the way, intending to go to the theatre—I lost my friend, and went to a place which I understood was the Lowther-rooms—there was dancing and music going on—I sat with the musicians—I was so drunk I did not know what I was about—I was put into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> from the Lowther-rooms, and the <hi rend="italic">cab-man</hi> put me down a short distance from Bow-street, as I bad no money to pay him, he put me into the hands of a policeman—I was not quite senseless drunk—the jumbling about awoke me—I went to the station, and told them the situation I was in, and if they went to the George Inn, in the Borough, they might have the money for the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I had lost a ring, a watch, some money, a pocket-book, pencil-case, and knife—I recollect pulling my watch out in the street after leaving my friend, and I pulled out my purse in the Lowther-rooms, to pay for some stout and gin—there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in the pocket-book, and another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in my pocket—I had them in the Lowther-rooms—the gin and stout <hi rend="italic">finished me</hi> completely—I missed them all when I went to the station at Bow-street—that was about four o'clock in the morning—I then went to a friend's in Lower Thames-street, and he advised me to go to the station, and to the Lowther-rooms also—we got some little information, and he begged of me to endeavour to find the man—I did not go before the Justice till the 4th of January—I was sober then.</p>

The purse he swore to is my own. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was only one ring on the purse—I found the other broken in my pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband; he has not bean in any business since I married him; we live at 28, Lower Belgrave-street, Belgrave-square. My husband had been for some time past under medical care—he had had nothing to eat for nearly a week, excepting jellies and beef-tea; but on the 9th of Dec. he asked for a little meat for dinner—he had some sent up by his daughter by a former wife—he sent for more—I went up with, a little pudding, and, on entering the room, he was walking up and down, as he had been the whole morning—that day he appeared ex<lb></lb>tremely restless, and never sat down at all—he bad had a very restless night the night preceding, and was pacing up and down the room all day—I ob<lb></lb>served that the dinner I had sent up to him was all consumed—I said, "How did you like your dinner? but I need not ask you, as you ate it and sent for more"—I did not say that in any way to provoke him in the least—his daughter was present—he had been ill for three weeks—I had been nursing him, and doing everything for his health—I had been on good terms with him upto that time—I said, "The doctor, perhaps, would not have allowed it</p>

               <p>you, inasmuch as you have not taken your medicine for three days," which was the case—I did not say another word—I turned round to open the door of a third room, into which I was going for my bonnet; in doing so I looked to the right, and saw his daughter hastening to leave the room—I never saw anything more till I received a blow across the back of my head with a poker—he had not said a syllable before I received the blow—it was an ext<lb></lb>remely violent one—I then received another blow as soon as it could be repeated—I was trying to get out on to the landing—he then put his left hand together, and nearly closed the door—as I opened it I received another blow—I put my hand up, and the poker, I think, came between my fingers—I then saw that it was a poker that he had in his hand—I was making my way to the landing, and received another blow with the same poker on the left arm—I was endeavouring to make my way down—I put my hand on the landing, to enable me to jump off the four remaining stairs—he then came down the first landing, met me, and aimed a blow in front, but this arm, being on the banister, received the poker; I rather think it came in contact with the banister, which broke the poker—this arm was lacerated by the blow—I walked to the bottom of the stairs—two or three of the females of the house met me—one of them set me on the steps, and I remained there till Dr. Griffiths came—I had given the prisoner no provocation; I had said no<lb></lb>thing to him but what I have stated.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What had been the nature of hit illness before this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had been very low-spirited—he generally had very good health—he had passed very restless nights, and when I have asked him the reason he has said they were coming to take him away to prison—five or six nights before this occurrence he attempted to get up in the bed—I asked if he wished for anything; I had jellies to give him—he said he required nothing but to get up; and he put his arms across his head, and said, "lam requested by my Saviour to pray naked as I came into the world"—he stood in that position for a length of time—he was quite naked—I then told him he had been a long time, he must be very cold, he must allow me to put something on, and I would call his daughter to send for some one to get him into bed again—he never left the bed; he was standing upright on the bed all the time—after I had put something about him he dropped on his knees, and I called his daughter, who was lying on a sofa in the adjoining room—I said, "If you will, come and assist me; your father, I think is in a very strange way"—I believe I related this circumstance to Mr. Griffiths, one of his medical advisers.</p>

I am the prisoner's daughter, by former wife—I believe he is fifty-nine years old—he has been up to a certain period a very good and affectionate father, and was of a quiet disposition—for the last six Of seven months I have observed an alteration in his demeanor and habits—he did not talk so much, and he used to come into my mom, and walk up and down the room, without talking—that had not been his usual habit—his spirits were very high, and he was always laughing and talking—about six weeks ago, we thought at dinner-time that he was much better—he was reading the Bible all that morning—we took him some rice pudding, and said, "Come, hate a little rice pudding; put that book down, and you will be better after "—we tried to give it him once or twice—he seemingly shrunk back—I said, "Come, father, have a little rice pudding"—presently he snatched it out of my hand, and devoured it in two minutes—he threw the plate down at the bottom of the bed, and tried to get hold of me, but I shrunk back—on the Saturday in question he said his dinner was neither hot nor cold—on the day before, he asked me to taste some jelly—I took a spoonful—he said, "Now take an<lb></lb>other"—I</p>

"—he did not tell me the reason why—I was in the room with Mrs. Caffyn when this matter began—I did not know that the poker was on the fender—I was up stairs all that morning—he was sitting shut in the room about five minutes alone with me—he said, "Maria, she is going to swear against my life"—that was the first time he had hinted anything of that kind. <hi rend="italic">to</hi> me—I had dose nothing whatever to provoke him—I did not see him take up the poker—I heard a scream from Mrs. Caffyn, and flew to the door, and as soon as I was there she was—we both ran away—William Sanderson had the care of my father.</p>

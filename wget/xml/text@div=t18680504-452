I live at 20, Langham Street, Regent Street, and am a newspaper editor and proprietor—on the 7th April, about 7.30, I started from Charing Cross Railway Station—I was put into the same carriage with the prisoner—he entered into conversation with me, and asked my name and country—I told him my name, and said I came from Con<lb></lb>stantinople—the prisoner said he was from America—he then told me he was going to Belgium, and then to Constantinople, and he would like to know the name of an hotel, or a place where strangers generally stopped—he then took a pencil and piece of paper out of his pocket, and I wrote my name, my address in London and Paris, and the place I recommended at Constantinople—there was no one else in the carriage then—at the first stopping place after the train left Charing Cross, three men got into the same carriage—when it had started again, one of the persons pulled out some playing cards from his pocket, and commenced to play—the prisoner said to me, "See what I have done; I have turned the end of the card that will be the winning card; if you place money on it, we shall gain"—he then put a bank note of France on it—the prisoner seemed to gain a good deal of money—he then said, "See how much money I am gaining, why do not you join?" and he turned the end of the card down—I said repeatedly I did not know how to play at cards, and that I had no money, such as they had, and it was not lawful in my religion to play any gambling or game—before we got to Dover, he put a large quantity of money on a card, and then turned round to me and said, "See how much I have lost"—he then said, "You told me to play, and you are my partner; you must pay part of the money, and he seized me by the chest—the other persons took no notice of what he was doing—seeing that I was in such company, I leaned back in the carriage—he then took from my side pocket a purse containing six Napoleons and a few francs—in the side pocket of my coat there was a small portfolio, with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in it; he took that also; and he took all my papers from a courier bag I had—he did not examine them then—the cheque was amongst them—the train stopped near Dover, and the four men got out—I do not know the name of the place—I had this cheque with me, loose, and that was taken—I had left my cheque book at home—before I left my house, I had written the 7th April on it, and the word "two"—I wanted to write hundred, but I did not know how to spell it, and I left it in that state—as soon as I left the train, I went into the telegraph office, thinking I might send a telegram, but I could not write it in the English language—I then went out of the telegraph office, and walked to the pier, and caught the boat to go to France—on my way to Amiens, I was in the carriage with a gentleman, and with his assistance I wrote this telegram—I received a communication from my clerk on the 10th April. telling me of the occurrence, and I returned to London the next day, and made a communication to the police—on the 14th I went to Cannon Street Station, with two police officers, and I pointed out the prisoner to them—the</p>

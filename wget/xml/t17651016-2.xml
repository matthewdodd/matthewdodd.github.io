            . On the 29th of July, when the child had given an account how she came by the injury, I went and asked the prisoner how he came to behave so? he confess'd he had acted with the girl twice the week before; that is, he had had carnal knowledge of her.</p>

               <p>Dermot. He told me he was concern'd with the child twice the week before; and pointed to a place, which was on the corner of a board, by the window: he said, he did it; I said, did you really? he said, yes, I did, and only twice.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you charge him with?</p>
               <p>Dermot. I charged him with lying with, and ravishing the child; and he confess'd he did it twice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an interpreter, and live at 26, Crown-court, Covent, garden. I am a Frenchman—I have been seven years in this country—on Wednesday night, 2nd July, about half-past 1 or a quarter to 2 o'clock, I was walking through the Haymarket, towards my home, and on getting into Brewer-street the prisoner and another man came up to me, kept me by the hand, and asked me "Which way you <hi rend="italic">go</hi>? how do you do?"—I said, "You are quite strangers to me, what do you want of me?"—he kept so tight hold of me, that I could not take my hand off—I did the best I could, took my hand out, and went away—they came after me, and the prisoner gave me a Mow in the head, which knocked me down—they kept me by the coat, and</p>

               <p>the other one put his hand about my pockets—I called, "Police! police!"—two or three policemen came up, and I gave the prisoner in charge—I put my hand into my pocket, where I had had two sovereigns and a half, and one sovereign was gone—I know I had it safe five minutes before, when I bought a cigar—I had counted it—I had never seen the prisoner before—I did not lose sight of Km.</p>

On the 2nd of November the prisoner and a woman came in; I was up stairs - I heard an alarm; I came down - the prisoner was pointed out to me: I followed him across the road - he saw me, and turned to the right, towards Broad-street; he fell down and I took him back - he had taken one piece of print entirely away, and another piece was removed; they had both been within the door - here is the piece that had been moved; the other is lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.You know nothing of the transaction, but that he had been in the shop? A. I did not see him there; this piece was on the floor in my shop, it was removed two or three feet from the shelf it had been upon - my daughter was serving; it was about six o'clock in the evening.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter. The prisoner came to the shop while I was serving a woman with some tape; he took two pieces of print, and while he was giving them to some person, one of them fell - I called my father; the prisoner staid till he heard him coming, and then ran off - I am sure he is the person; he spoke to the woman I was serving.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it rather dusk? A. Yes; I had never seen him before, but I saw his face, which was turned towards me - I am quite sure he is the man; he could not take them to look at the pattern.</p>

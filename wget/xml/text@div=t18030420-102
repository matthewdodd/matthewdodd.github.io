               <p>Q. Now, after you had made this discovery about the stable-door, did you go into the rickyard? - A. I went straight into the rick-yard, and I had my lantern in my hand, I saw a man lay under a stack of wood; he was stooping down, apparently to conceal himself; I endeavoured to lay hold of him; immediately he saw me he ran away, and jumped over the paling; I had no opportunity of observing his face, only his back; he was not very tall, he was a middling size man; he did work for Mr. Willian at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the stack of wood, under which the man was standing, from the stable-door which had been broke open? - A. About one hundred and fifty yards, as near as I can guess; I followed the man, and tried to catch him, but could not; I came back, and I found the tub with about half of the horse-shoes gone out of it, and likewise a sack, with three pair of horse-shoes in it, under the stack of wood; I found a pitchfork by the side of the tub, with the times bent three or four ways; they were bent in breaking open the door, to my belief.</p>
               <p>Q.You mean the prongs, don't you? - A. Yes; I informed Mr. Clark about ten minutes after; the horse-shoes are here.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am foreman to Mr. Willan; from the information of the last witness, I went immediately to the lodging of the prisoner, at the Coach and Horses, in Graston-court; I took the sack down with me; it is about three quarters of a mile; it is kept by a person of the name of Backston.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Mr. Backston give you any shoe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up into the prisoner's room to take him? - A. Not till the next morning; the landlord gave me the shoe the over night; I reckon I got in about twenty minutes after he had got in; he was sitting in the tap-room of Mr. Backston's house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long might that be after the robbery? - A. It might be about twenty minutes, or half an hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Was that a left shoe, or a right shoe? - A. A left shoe (a man's shoe produced) this is a left shoe.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean a shoe that has apparently been worn upon the left foot? - A. Yes; I had seen the stable-door as late as five o'clock that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time where were the horse-shoes that were found by Tuck under the stack of wood? - A. The inside of the door of the stable there was above 200 weight in the tub, it was nailed down, and the stable-door was locked; the pitch-fork was laying close by the tub, it was in the cow-shed about four o'clock in the afternoon; the cow-shed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200111"></xptr>is close to the stable, the prisoner had worked in the cow-shed. (The horse-shoes and pitchfork produced.)</p>

               <p>Q. Is the pitch-fork Mr. Willan's property? - A. His mark is there, T. W.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the horse-shoes Mr. Willan's property? - A. I don't know; the horse-shoes that were in the tub were Mr. Willan's property.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they match exactly? - A. I think verily they be the same; the tub had been broke open, and horse-shoes taken out.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I keep the Coach and Horses publichouse in Grafton-court; I remember the prisoner coming on the evening of the 10th of March, he might have been home twenty minutes before the last witness came; as soon as the prisoner came in, he asked me for a pair of shoes which he had left in the bar; I gave them to him; he then asked for a candle, and the key of his room. On giving him the key and candle, seeing him agitated, and out of breath, I had the curiosity to look over the bar-door, and I saw he had but one shoe on; I watched the man to the landing-place of the stairs, and saw him pull off the left-foot shoe, and put it behind the shutters; he went up stairs, and put on the shoes which he had in my bar; when he was gone up stairs, I took the shoe, and locked it up in my parlour cupboard, and when Mr. Clark came, I shewed it to him; I kept the shoe that night, but the next morning I gave it to Mr. Clark.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you remember this affair of the horse-shoes being stolen? - A. No; I heard that the man had lost a shoe, and I found it early on the Friday morning about seven o'clock; I heard of the robbery the night before; this is the shoe which I hold in my hand, it is a right foot shoe, (produces it); I found it about too yards from the pales which divide the cow-yard from the rick-yard.</p>
               <p>Jury. I have compared it with the other shoe, and they do appear to be fellows.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Are they with strings or buckles?</p>
               <p>Jury. A. With strings, both.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was at home at nine o'clock, and I know nothing of it; I went down to the cook-shop to get my supper, I had a pair of old shoes on, a man slepped upon it, and tore my shoe; I threw it away into the road, and went home with one shoe.</p>

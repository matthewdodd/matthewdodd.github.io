On Wednesday the 3d of January, about five or ten minutes after five, as I was in discourse with the warehouseman I heard the warehouse door shut, I saw a man going out whom I followed to the top of the Old Change, and I discovered a piece of print under his left arm, I instantly made to him; he attempted to escape and ran across Cheapside, I followed him with the cry of stop thief, before I seized him he dropped the print, a lady passing at the time picked it up and gave it to me, she said, there is the cotton; I had hold of the prisoner, a witness came up and secured him.</p>

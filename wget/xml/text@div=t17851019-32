               <p>Was she in bed with you when she waked you? - No, she was not.</p>
               <p>Did any other people lodge in the same room? - No, it is a room by itself? when she told me the things were gone, I asked her, what is become of them; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190058"></xptr> said she did not know, and if I had any suspicion of her, I had better call the watch; I gave charge to the watchman, and she was committed; I have never found any thing at all, she declared herself innocent of the affair.</p>
               <p>Do the people of the house let rooms to other people? - No, it is a room on the ground floor by itself, there is no passage through the room.</p>

               <p>Does that window open directly to the street? - Yes, Sir, it is about as high as from this board from the ground; I do not know where he put the clothes, I had been drinking, I was really so much in liquor I could not tell; he laid across the bed, with his breeches and stockings on.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She had not been into bed o my knowledge, I locked the door before I went to sleep, there was no window open at all when I waked; when I went to bed I fastened the door myself, and locked it, and put the key in my right hand coat pocket.</p>

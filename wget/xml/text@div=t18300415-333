            . I am a constable of Chelsea. On Monday, the 12th of April, I went to William Lasham's house, No. 30, George-street, Chelsea, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; I did not see him at home - I went again at night, and saw him - I assisted in searching the premises after taking Lasham, and found a fiddle answering the description in an advertisement; I went again in the morning, and in a dark closet under the stairs leading to his room, I found a basket full of men's new shoes - he sleeps in a room at the end of that passage; I had taken him into custody the night before, and on searching him at the watch-house he took something from the lining of his waistcoat, and dropped it behind him; I took it up - it was two duplicates of men's shoes, one pair of which Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150141"></xptr>Gould swears to - before I took him into custody, as I went up stairs I heard him and his wife quarrelling; she said to him, "Did not you sharpen two knives yesterday to cut Mr. Gould's shutter open?" and in the further progress of the quarrel I heard her say, "If you strike me I will call Murder!" then she said, "What business had you to go and get drunk with the money produced by the stealing of Mr. Gould's shoes?" he said, "You d - d old wh - e, you had as much of the money as I had;" she said, "Mr. Hughes and Brown are coming for you, Mr. Lasham - you will be locked up, Mr. Lasham; you will be hung, Mr. Lasham! Mr. Hughes has got the fiddle;" we then went into the room - Lasham was sitting there naked; I said, "Mr. Hughes is come. Mr. Lasham; do you know any thing about the fiddle I got here to-day?" I then asked if he knew any thing about the shoes - he said No; I asked for his clothes, and found 3s. in his pocket, and 2s. 6d. on his wife - I took Morgan, (who was in custody.) to him at the watch-house, and said to him, "I have been told that you said this morning that Morgan brought the shoes to your house" - he said, "Yes, Morgan brought them;" I took young Lasham into custody first - he denied the charge; he said he had been at the coffee-shop at Knightsbridge on Sunday night with Morgan Sage and young Lee; I asked what time they came back - he said about twelve o'clock; that they had some coffee of Brown, the watchman, and afterwards spent the night under a butcher's pent-house till another watchman drove them away - Morgan was brought to me in custody; I said, "Where did you spend your pay last night?" he said he had been to Knightsbridge; I asked who with - he said nobody; that he came back at half-past ten o'clock, and slept on Mr. Leach's stones all night - they are in Manor-street, near old Lasham's house; I said that was a lie, and told him he had been with the others - he denied it; I found Sage at a house of ill-fame, in Westminster, on Friday.</p>

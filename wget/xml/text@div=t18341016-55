               <p>RICHARD NEVILLE. I live at Limehouse. In March last, I lived in <placeName id="t18341016-55-crimeloc310">Park-street, in the parish of St. Anne</placeName>

            . About last Easter, the prisoner came and asked me for a lodging, about eight or nine o'clock in the morning, and he came to lodge with me - he brought a small red-coloured chest to the house about an hour afterwards - I saw it opened afterwards, and saw some clothes in it - he asked me, when he brought the chest in, if I had any old keys that would open it, as he had lost the key of it - I tried a few old keys - none would open it, and I sent for a smith who opened it - he was afterwards carrying out things to sell - they appeared to be clothes - he stayed with me about eight or ten days - he offered to sell some things to the lodgers - and when he went away he said he was going on board a man-of-war, and should take the rest of the things with him, but they would not allow the chest to be on board of a man-of-war - he left in my possession an old oil-skin pair of trowsers, and an old hat or two in the chest - I gave him 3s. or 4s. for them - I sold the chest about two days afterwards, and gave the other things to the policeman.</p>

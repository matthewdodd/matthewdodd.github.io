On the 22nd of March I left the prisoner, who I knew before, at my house, about nine o'clock in the morning, when I went to my mother's; I returned at seven in the evening - she was then gone: I missed some Irish linen that night, and the next day I missed the shawl and these other articles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Her daughter has my shawl, and wears it now - she had her own washed in the hospital, and I lent her mine to put on. Witness. The prisoner had been in Bartholomew-hospital, where my daughter is now dying; this shawl is my daughter's, but was at my place.</p>

             (Police-constable L 84.) I took the prisoner - she was wearing this shawl at the time, and had this basket in her hand, containing the tablecloth and other articles - she was then in Blackfriars, more than a mile from the prosecutrix's.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She asked me to go and help her wash the next day - I saw her the night before, drinking with a man in a public-house, and that morning she said she had been out all night, drinking, and was not able to go to washing - I took the things to get washed by Sunday.</p>
               <p>MRS. FRUCHARD. I did not ask her to help me - I was going to wash on the day I lost these things; she came to me that morning, and I asked her to have a cup of tea, because she was in distress - I had asked her the night before to call on me: I left her taking breakfast, while I went to my mother's, in Compton-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know where she lived? A. No; I had no conversation with her about washing - my daughter had not desired her to get them washed; they were in a pan where I keep dirty linen - I had been out to try to get my mother into the poorhouse; my husband was at home, and at work.</p>

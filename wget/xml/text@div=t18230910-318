            . I am an officer. I was going out on the 7th of September; and at the watch-house, I found the prosecutor, the prisoner, and two more - he gave charge of her for robbing him of seven sovereigns, and a 5 l. note, and shewed me the note, saying he took it from her mouth; he was a little fresh then; I asked her what she did with the sovereigns; she said she did not take them; I asked her what she did with the note - she gave no answer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met him about half past one o'clock at night; he said, he wanted a girl who lived in St. Catherine's. I said, perhaps I might know her - I went to look for her - he had 5 s. or 6 s. worth of rum and water, and was very much in liquor.</p>

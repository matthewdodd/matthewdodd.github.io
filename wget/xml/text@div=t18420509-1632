                  </hi>. I keep the Windmill at Gravesend. On Tuesday, the 3rd of May, I employed the prisoner, at Gravesend, to do some work for me at No. 6, Clerkenwell-close—I knew nothing of him before—we had a written specification of what he was to do—he had nothing whatever to do with the roof of the house—I went to the house on the 11th, in consequence of receiving a letter—I found the lead was gone off the roof—I had not observed it for some length of time, but the lead was on the roof when I saw it last—some lead was missed, beside that on the roof, from</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Lakin, and live at No. 7, Clerkenwell-close. On Tuesday evening last, about seven o'clock, I was in my back yard, and saw the prisoner taking the lead off the side of the window, at the back attic of No. 7—I asked him what he was doing—he said he had orders to look to the smoky chimneys—I saw him come into the street, between seven and ten minutes after, out of the door of No. 6, with a bundle of lead under his arm—I asked him to bring it into my back yard—he said he had orders to take it away, and put sine in its place—I again told him to bring the lead back into my yard—he brought it back, and laid it in my yard, he then went away—he insisted on finding it when he came for it—I gave it to the policeman.</p>

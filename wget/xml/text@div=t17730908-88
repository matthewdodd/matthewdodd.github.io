               <p>Q. Is there a passage to go to your room without going through the shop?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. Yes; it was often left on the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Which room was the bureau in?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. The fore-room: there were three notes of 100 l. and about 130 guineas and the silver watch. When I came to London I was just come from France; I desired one Mr. Collier to take a draught to Mr. Child's, the banker, for 200 l. it was paid in two hundred pound back notes; he gave them to Mrs. Atkinson, his mistress, and she gave them to me; I had these notes several times in my hands: I am no great scholar, I can write my name, and know a little about figures. I did observe upon the back of one of the notes, close almost to the edge, there were some figures and writing, that in the midst of those figures and writing there was a figure of 3; I think I should know it again if I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss those things?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. The last time I saw them was Wednesday July the 21st: on Thursday and Friday, not wanting money, I did not go to my bureau; on Saturday I wanted some money; when I put the key into the bureau I found it unlocked; it startled me; I looked for my money; it was gone; I went to Collier, about eleven in the forenoon; I told Mr. Collier I had been robbed of a sum of money, particularly those two notes I took of Child the banker; Mr. Collier and I went to Mr. Child's; they gave me the number of the notes; I went to the Bank, to the Secretary's Office; I told him I had lost two notes of that number, and begged he would search the books to see if they were paid; he searched the books and said they were not; I begged if any such notes came that he would stop them; he said he would: I went to the Bank again in six or seven days, and asked Mr. Martin if they had either of these notes; I went and examined the books again, and there was one of the notes come in letter C 125; and he told me it was brought in by one Mr. Latimer. I told Mr.

             I thought it was not good usage to pay it; I went and enquired for Mr. Latimer, who I found to be a man of reputation; I went down to Hammersmith to him; at last I found him; I asked him if he did not take a note a few days ago to the Bank and get it changed; he said he did; I asked him if he knew the number; he pulled out his pocket book and shewed me the number; I asked him how he came by it; he said he took it in part of payment for a draught at Lee and Ayton's, in Lombard-street; this was on Thursday. On Friday I went with a friend to Lee and Ayton's; I had their book examined; they took it of one Mr. Roebuck, a wholesale grocer; I went there; he took it of one Mr. Knapp, of Reading, in Berkshire; I took a post-chaise to Reading; I found Mr. Knapp; he took it of one Mr. White a neighbour of his; Mr. White took it of one Mr. Guy, a dealer in horses, at Reading;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080070"></xptr> Mr. Guy took it of a man that bought two horses of him, that he never saw in his life time before; I asked if he was a horse-dealer; he said he was sure he knew nothing about horses for one of the two horses he sold him had broken knees, but he could not tell any thing of the man; he said there was one

               <p>Q. You are a considerable dealer in horses I believe?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. I buy a great number; I furnish the court of France.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you very sure that the two notes you received of Mr. Atkinson, as the produce of the draught of 200 l. were in your bureau?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. Yes, I am sure of it.</p>

               <p>Kendrick. There is a passage without going through the shop to go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to lock this door when you went out?</p>

               <p>Atkinson. Yes; two of Mr. Kendrick's, two or three days after he came from France; I saw the draught given to Mr. Collier; Mr. Kendrick gave me two single 100 l. notes; I put them into my bureau and delivered them to Mr. Kendrick.</p>
               <p>William Gardner, one of the cashiers of the bank, produced a bank note.</p>

Bank note, and 29 l. in cash; Claxton shewed me the note, it was for 100 l. before he saw the horses. I rode the horse all the way to London by the order of Claxton; I took the horse to the King's Arms on the 25th; I fetched him away the 28th, about twelve o'clock, Claxton took a stable; I took the horse there; he had it advertised; on Thursday the 29th it was sold.

I have known Cox between two and three years; I think it was yesterday was seven weeks, I am no scholar, I was at the three Tuns in New-street Shoe-lane, by where I work; I saw Cox going by; he had been there before with me; I spoke to him; he asked me if I would go to Bristol along with him; he had asked me to do that before; I said it would be very expensive to go there, and I could not very well afford it; he said if you will go, I will pay your expences; I said it would be very dear; he said he would have a post-chaise; I agreed to go with him; he said he had got a 100 l. bank note; he took it out and gave it me into my hands; I agreed to go, I think as the next day; I kept the note in my custody; we set out next day, and went from the White Horse, in or near Grey's-inn-lane; it was about six in the afternoon that he came, on a Friday; we went from the White Horse in a post-chaise to Hounslow; we set out about three o'clock in the afternoon; from there we went to Maiden-head; we got to Reading the next morning between ten and eleven o'clock; we intended to stop there; seeing a fair there we proposed to buy horses; Cox said he was going to Bristol to see his uncle. We put up at the George at Reading; sitting in the parlour, I said to Cox, here is a horse fair I believe; I asked the man belonging to the inn whether there was not a fair; he said there would be on Monday; I went out and saw one

            's people took him; I believe Cox rode the grey poney himself.</p>
               <p>Q. You bought the grey horse; did you buy it upon your own risque?</p>
               <p>Claxton. No; I bought a black one about an hour or two after that, upon my own risque.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of the same money?</p>
               <p>Claxton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you money besides this 100 l. sufficient to pay for this horse?</p>
               <p>Claxton. I had seven or eight guineas; I would hardly set out on a journey without some money.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you could not go; you could not afford it?</p>
               <p>Claxton. I could not afford to lay out all my money.</p>


               <p>Q. Had you money enough to pay for it?</p>
               <p>Claxton. I think it cost 9 l. or nine guineas; I paid it out of my own money, all but about two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Cox for that two guineas?</p>
               <p>Claxton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the money in your pocket, or had you returned it to Cox?</p>
               <p>Claxton. I had returned it; but had two or three guineas of Cox's in my pocket, notwithstanding that; besides the 100 l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you the other two or three guineas?</p>
               <p>Claxton. When we set out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Cox deliver to you the two or three guineas?</p>
               <p>Claxton. When we set out at first of all; sometimes I paid the reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy the grey horse for Cox?</p>
               <p>Claxton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the stable for him?</p>
               <p>Claxton. I took the stable, I took it for myself; I bought it to put my horse in; the grey horse was put there to be sold according to an advertisements.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the grey horse there?</p>
               <p>Claxton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the black horse?</p>
               <p>Claxton. No; it was at the Bull at Hatton Wall, I put it there while Cox had sold this horse.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take a stable in your own name to put Cox's horse in?</p>
               <p>Claxton. I thought it was better to be sold there, than in a livery stable.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. Did not you see Claxton take a stable for the horses himself?</p>
               <p>Jones. He said he had taken a stable that was in Hat and Tun Yard; the grey horse went there; it was a little stable would hold but one horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Cox afterwards in London?</p>
               <p>Jones. I saw him at breakfast in Claxton's house once.</p>

               <p>Warren. I brought it from the Bank book; I made the entry, and filled up the note at the time of delivering the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make that extract?</p>

               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. My Lord, That is liable to the same objection.</p>
               <p>Court. I think not; considering the nature of the Bank, and how necessary it is every moment to want to refer to books, in cases of public companies, where the books are necessary for all the world to have recourse to, it alters the case.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fill up these notes?</p>

            . I am a constable: when Cox was taken up I was sent for to the Blue Boat Inn, in Holborn; the man put this warrant in my hand, and desired me to search his lodging; I knew where he lodged, at his uncle's, just in the neighbourhood with his uncle, a room up one-pair-of-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Between them both?</p>
               <p>Morgan. It was the old man's room, but he used to make it his home. I found these six notes upon his uncle, one West; two of them are in the name of Claxton. (The last witness looks at them.)</p>
               <p>Warren. These are my filling up; here is one 20 l. and one 10 l. No. 8 the 20 l. No. 9 the 10 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, on the 23d of July last I came to Mr. Claxton's house; he asked me to sit down and have some breakfast; he said he was going to a sale to buy some trunks; I was to have one for 13 s. he had bought some; I sat down a little while; at last he asked me whether I would go down with him as far as Reading; I said yes; I said I did not know how to go because<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080076"></xptr> I wanted to be at home; he said he wanted to go down to buy a couple of horses; I said if he saw ever a one that would suit me to buy one, and I would pay him when he came up to town, for I had but five guineas about me; he bought a little poney; I rode up to town upon it; I carried it to one Gidding's at Hatton Wall; when I came up to town I gave him eight guineas for a little grey mare. I had not the 100 l. note, I never saw it; he did not shew it to me.</p>
               <p>Morgan. The uncle (West) before the Justice said he had some of them by him three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Claxton ever lodge there?</p>
               <p>Morgan. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Where do you lodge?</p>

               <p>Mrs. Delestrac was sent for, she being a French woman, and not being able to speak English, an interpreter was sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married woman, and what is your husband's name?</p>
               <p>Delestrac. I was married the 4th of February 1766, in Paris: my husband's name is Dominique Delestrac; he is living, and under the employ of his Majesty in France, My husband has been two years in England; it is about eight year since he went abroad.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the gentleman's door kept locked in general?</p>
               <p>Delestrac. Yes; the gentleman always gave me the key, and I never let any one have it but an old faithful servant whom I could trust with it.</p>

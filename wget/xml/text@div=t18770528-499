                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the London Court of Bankruptcy I produce the proceedings in the bankruptcy of Robert Shaw Pitkethley, 21 21, Gresham Street—the petition was presented by Mr. Parren and Mr. Cunningham, on 15th May, 1877—he was adjudicated on the 25th. (The <hi rend="italic">act of bankruptcy was read from the proceedings</hi>.) On 13th March, 1877, Mr. Hazlitt, one of the Registrars of the Bankruptcy Court, was appointed trustee—I also find upon the file of proceedings a copy of the "Gazstto," in which the adjudication of Pitkethley appears—the last examination on was on 17th April—from the file it appears that the bankrupt never appeared at all.</p>

Neither the eight nor twelve months' bills have matured yet—the four months' one has been paid—some time after the signing of the deed I met the prisoner in the street; it might be a month or three or five weeks after—he said he had not received the money for the furniture—there was some dispute with Houston as to the amount to be received for the furniture—that was about the only thing that tran<lb></lb>spired when I saw him at that time—he said he had sold the stock on the <hi rend="italic">round</hi>—when I called at his office I saw no notification on the door—the last time I made inquiry in the ground floor office about the middle of Novem<lb></lb>ber, and a lad said he had not been there for some time—I had not made inquiries before downstairs—I never left any message for him—there was no one to leave it with and the door was locked—I did not see a letter-box in the door, I did not look for one—I could not swear there was no notice on the door, I saw none, nor a slate—generally speaking, before a dividend is declared the accountant makes up his charges against the trustee—the system is that when the accountant has realised the estate it is his duty to hand the proceeds to the trustees—I have acted as trustee very frequently—I first of all deduct the accountant's and solicitor's account and divide the remain<lb></lb>ing portion <hi rend="italic">pro rata</hi> amongst the creditors—it must be a very small estate where only one dividend is declared; I call this a moderate one.</p>

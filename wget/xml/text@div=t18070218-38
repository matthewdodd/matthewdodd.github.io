            . I am a watchman, I was going my round at twelve o'clock at night, on the 26th of January, I stopped the prisoner with a sack of coals, I called two watchmen to my assistance; they took him to the watchhouse, and I took care of the coals. The prisoner told me they were his own property, and that he had left them at a public house till he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180037"></xptr> took them home, I told him it was not a proper time to take coals home.</p>
               <p>- I was constable of the night on the 26th of January; the prisoner was brought to me by the watchman, and a sack with a bushel of coals in it. The sack had bursted at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Hurst. That is the sack I took care of; I went and picked the coals up. I went to Mr. Pocock's wharf, I examined the tail of the loaded cart; I found the hind sacks tumbled about, as if one had been removed. When I was taking him to the counter his hands were tied, he said he had a knife in his pocket, which he was feeling for; he said if he could get it, he swore he would cut me, that he should know me and one of the watchman again, and he would prostrate us. His pockets were searched before I untied his hands; I took this knife from him.</p>

The prisoner was a compositor—he came to live with me about three weeks after Christmas, and in Easter week I found the petty cash-box broken open—there were fifteen or sixteen persons on the premises, and who to suspect I did not know—I did not suspect him—he charged other persons with it—I then went to look after my property, and missed seven composing sticks out of fifteen—the prisoner having absconded from my service, I went after him, and met a person who told me where he had gone to work—I went and found him—he denied it, but I went up stairs, and found the duplicates of the two composing sticks—I went with the officer, and found these two sticks, which I can swear to as being mine—he had no right to have them.</p>

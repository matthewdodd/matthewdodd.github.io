               <p>ELEANOR FITCH. I live in Harcourt-street, Skinner-street. Somer's-town, and am an ostrich feather maker. I was going to the Minories to purchase some feathers, and saw the prisoner there; I have known him three or four years - he was alone; I saw a handkerchief taken from this gentleman's pocket, but by whom I cannot say, except that it was not by the prisoner, for I had hold of his arm - I had asked him to assist me as far as he was going, for I was taken ill, and was confined at five o'clock that very day, with the baby I now hold in my arms; if he had taken the handkerchief I must have seen it - I swear he did not take it; it was thrown alongside, on my basket, which I had in my hand. but by whom I cannot say - I saw the gentleman lay hold of the prisoner, and heard him say,"If you will let me go I will point out the man who took the handkerchief;" I did not tell Mr. Price what I had seen, for I was taken bad at the time, and was confined in three hours - a gentleman standing by saw that I was taken ill.</p>

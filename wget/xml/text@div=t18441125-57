                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, and live at Hayes, in Mid<lb></lb>dlesex. On Old Michaelmas-day I went to Uxbridge—I put up my donkey at the Park-gate beer-shop—I had a bridle on that donkey, and I tied him up to the rails—I sent a little boy for the donkey—it was there, but the bridle was gone—I heard that somebody had fetched it—another donkey which I lost was in a field at Hillingdon, about two miles off—I went there for it, and it was gone—I went to Southall, and gave information—the donkey came home the next morning be<lb></lb>fore I was up—I believe this is part of my bridle—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is not all here—I can swear this part of it is mine—this bridle was on the donkey, which was not lost—I knew the prisoner perfectly well.</p>

About half-past seven o'clock in the evening, on the 11th of Oct., the prisoner came and asked me whether I wanted to buy a donkey—I went to look at it—he asked 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I offered him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and agreed to buy it—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at the time, and was to give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, and to return the bridle—I put the donkey into a field, and the next morning it was gone out of the field—I had marked it by cutting its tail and fore<lb></lb>top—I took the bridle to the policeman—I saw the donkey the day before yesterday, and again to-day—I can swear to it by the marks on the tail and fore<lb></lb>top—it is the same I bought of the prisoner—the pri<lb></lb>soner did not come again for the shilling, or for the bridle.</p>

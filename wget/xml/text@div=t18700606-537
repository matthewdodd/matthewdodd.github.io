                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Charles Morgan &amp; Co., wholesale stationers, Cannon Street—Garrett was is our employ about twenty years—his principal duty was to receive paper brought into stock—where paper is sent out an invoice is sent and the delivery book—Carter was in the employment of a person we employed as carman—I do not know Parkins—he was never a customer—I have my books here—when goods are sent out I expect to find entries in the books—it was Bank's duty to make the entries—our premises ran out from Cannon Street to a street at the back of Cloak Lane, where there is a place in which the vans are laden—it was Garrett's duty to be there when goods were brought in—the goods were sent out from that place also—I identify this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as my property—the wrappers have my name upon them—the value of the paper is 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per ream.</p>

Morgan at various times—it was usually smaller paper than that—Carter did not come with that—it was another carman in Mr. Morgan's employ—there were no invoices brought with the paper.</p>

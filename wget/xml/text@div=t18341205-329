                  </hi>. I keep the Lord Nelson, in East-street, Trafalgar-road, Greenwich. The prisoner was my servant for about four months—I had suspicion, and on the 3rd of December I marked fourteen half-crowns and one crown-piece—I put them into a bag with some other silver in a cup<lb></lb>board, which I locked, and put the key in my pocket—I went to the cup<lb></lb>board again the next evening—I missed nine of the marked half-crowns and four shillings—the shillings were not marked, but I knew how much there was—this was after eleven o'clock—the prisoner was gone up to bed—I went up and met her at her bed-room door—I said I had come on an unpleasant business, I wanted to see the contents of her portmanteau—she hesitated—but I said, "You had better do it, for if you do not, I will send for an officer"—she then turned out the contents of her box, and put her hand into her pocket, and gave me these nine marked half-crowns—she said they were mine, and the money in her portmanteau also—it all amounted to about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 193.) I heard of this on the 9th of December—I went to the prosecutor, and asked him what he had lost—he said a great deal of money, and some clothes as well—he said he had, discharged her, and should have taken no more notice of it, but she had been walking past his door, and had annoyed him in every shape—I went and apprehended the prisoner going towards her home—I told her I wanted to speak to her—she went with me, and gave up the keys of her trunk—I saw her putting something away—I asked what it was—she said linen, not proper for me to see—I said I would see it—I found it was a purse with 29 half-crowns in it.</p>

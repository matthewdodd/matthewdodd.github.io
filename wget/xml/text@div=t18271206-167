I put my reticule down on the bench by my side in the room - I went into the shop, leaving it there; I saw through the window the prisoner's arm over the table, and the reticule in his hand; I directly went into the parlour, and the man who had been with him rushed past me. I accused the prisoner of having it - he said he had not got it; the watchman was called, and he was taken - nothing was found on him; he said he did not know the man who was in his company; next morning he offered me 5s. to say nothing about it, and then three half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Do you go by any other name? A. No; I get my living by needlework, and no other way; I had not been at work that day - I had been to the theatre, with a gentleman who lives at Woodford - he left me at Red Lion-street; there is another Cornwall-street, inhabited by loose women, but I do not live there; I never said I saw the prisoner give it to the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner call out, that the man had taken it? A. He did not; he went to the door; I do not walk in the Commercial-road.</p>

            . I keep the cook-shop. Bowditch came in and laid her reticule on the bench - I went into the shop; she came and said she would have some pudding, and as she returned to the room, another man rushed out; she exclaimed "I have lost my reticule;" that is all I heard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she accuse the prisoner of it? A. I did not hear that - ours is a narrow shop; the man who ran out had paid, and so had the prisoner. I never said the prosecutrix was a street-walker.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Aylesbury-street, Clerk<lb></lb>en well. On 25th March, the prisoner came, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, for a penny mince-pie. I looked at my wife, she went up-stairs and brought down two counterfeit pennies—the prisoner put down a penny—I told him it was the same sort as what he had uttered before—(I had seen him before)—I cut the penny he put down before his face, and told him I would give him in charge—he said, "For God's sake, don't do that; I will give you anything if you do not give me in charge"—I told him I wanted nothing but justice, and I called the policeman—the prisoner made great resistance, and struck me twice in the ribs with his elbows—I gave the penny-pieces to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman,</hi> G 208). I took the prisoner—when we got about ten yards from the shop, he dropped four counterfeit farthings—I picked them up—he proceeded about twenty yards further, and he dropped three bad penny-pieces—I picked them up—he resisted very much—I found four counterfeit pence in his trowsers' pocket, a quantity of good farthings, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—worth of good halfpence—there was one counterfeit farthing with the good ones—I received from the prosecutor one penny, which he had offered at that time, and two others that he had given him some weeks previous.</p>

I locked the door and gave the key to my wife, who sat in the Broadway, selling vegetables; she fetched me about half-past eight o'clock.

            . I am wife of the prosecutor; he brought me the key about eight o'clock, and told me to go home soon, and in about ten minutes I went, and found the door wide open; when I first came in I saw a man about three steps from the street door. I came out finding my child safe, and followed the man to the top of the street, he then asked what I was looking at, I said, at him, for my place was broken open and I suspected him as he was near the door; he said he would go any where with me; we went into a public-house - he turned out his pockets and had nothing - it was not the prisoner; on returning I missed the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 27th of September, as I and Pople were going to the prisoner's house, we saw him and his wife crossing Great Tothill-street into Dartmouth-street; his wife had a bundle - we stopped them, and said we were going to execute a search warrant, and they must go back with us; the wife said she suspected they had got what we were going in search of, and they were afraid they should get into trouble about it when they bought it; we went to the house, and asked who they bought the property of - the bundle was then open, but we did not know the things in it, not having heard of this robbery. Naylor afterwards claimed them, the wife said they had bought them of a man named Morgan; the prisoner agreed with her, and said his wife had given a sovereign for them, and before she agreed to pay for them had called him down stairs to ask if they were worth the money, and they agreed to give the 1 l., and that it was on the Saturday night previous. I asked the prisoner if he had not given more, and who paid the money, the answer was that they gave 1 l. on Saturday night, and he himself gave the man 2 s. 6 d. more on the Sunday morning; we afterwards found Naylor who identified the things; they knew that I was acquainted with Morgan. I have since taken him, but they could not satisfy the Magistrate that they had them from him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Monday, the 27th of September, I and Cooper were going to execute a search warrant at the prisoner's house - we met him on the road with his wife; we said we were going to search their house for stolen goods, the wife said</p>
               <p>"I dare say I have got what you are going to look for, I dare say we shall get into trouble about it;" he said</p>
               <p>"I dare say we shall;" she said she bought the things of a young man named John, and described his person which answered to one Morgan, and when they got to their house; they recollected that his name was Morgan, and said they bought them of him on Saturday night, and I think they said it was about nine o'clock; that Morgan brought them there and left a dark lantern, that they gave him 1 l. and a half crown. I found two dark lanterns in the shop, one on the mantle piece - he keeps an old iron shop. I opened the bundle, and asked if any thing else was brought with it, she said a silver watch which she pulled out of her pocket and gave me, and said that was all, and they had given 1 l. 2 s. 6 d. for the whole - all this was in the prisoner's hearing; we took them into custody, and on making a second search half an hour after I found a shirt in the drawer answering the description of one lost. I went and shewed it to Mrs. Naylor with a cotton bed-gown - she claimed both. Morgan was taken that afternoon, and I think Mrs. Naylor said she had seen him about the neighbourhood.</p>

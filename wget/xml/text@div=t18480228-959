                  </hi> I am a lamplighter, in the employ of the South Me<lb></lb>tropolitan Gas-works Company, Kent-road—I have lived in that neighbour<lb></lb>hood nine years. On 17th Jan., between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was in Upper Grange-road, near the yard of the Bricklayers' Arms station—I saw the prisoner at the corner of Willow-walk, lurking about—I kept my eye on him some time—I believe his hand were in his pockets—it was a wet, cold night—he went down Willow-walk, and then to a recess, which leads to the company's fence—he went to the fence—I watched him on the opposite side of the way—there is a little hillock at the bottom of the recess, and when a man was on that, the fence would be about breast high—I saw something at the top of the fence—I withdrew, and stood about fifty yards off, and saw the prisoner come out of the recess with a can in each hand—he went down Willow-walk to the Grange-road—I followed him about a quarter of a mile, met a policeman, told him, and he said to the prisoner, "What have you got here?"—he said, "I brought it from home"—I said, "That is not true"—he said, "You are a false man"—the policeman said, "Where are you going to take it?"—he said, "Home," and said, "Come with me, and I will make it all right"—I policeman took him—I took him back to where be brought the property from—he denied that he had been there—on the way to the station he said he came from Clerkenwell, and was going to take it to a man at Camberwell—he was asked again at the station where he was going to take it—he said to a man named Oldham, at the Swan, in Old Kent-road—he said he had got about two quarts of turps—the policeman said, "Could you swear to these cans if I were to take them from you, and produce them to-morrow? are there any marks on them?"—he said, "None whatever."</p>

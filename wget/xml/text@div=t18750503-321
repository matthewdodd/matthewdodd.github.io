I am a clerk in the employ of Pfeil, Stedall &amp; Co., iron merchants, of Broad Street, Bloomsbury—on the 27th; March, some time between 12 o'clock and 12.30 in the day the prisoner came to the counting-house—I had known him well previously—he asked me for payment of a bill for some horseshoes; this is the bill he presented—"Messrs. Pfeil, Stedall &amp; Co. Dr. to Wm. Pavey, veterinary surgeon, Mason Street. 6 cwt. of hind shoes, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Paid W. Pavey." I asked him who signed the bill head—he said Williams; Williams is our store-keeper; he would take in these things, but he has no authority to sign bill <hi rend="italic">'</hi>. heads, that would be the duty of Mr. Watson, our buyer—I don't know any one named Pavey, we have had no transactions with him—we did not owe</p>

W. Golding &amp; Son—we had had frequent transactions with them; the prisoner, had called for bills from them—I saw him on the Tuesday; I did not speak to him—our Mr. Child, in my presence, asked him whether he was at our place on that day—he said that he was but he did not come upstairs—I have made inquiries in Mason Street, but cannot find that there is any person named Pavey there, nor has there been for the last three years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Child asked the prisoner whether he presented the bill in the counting-house—he said he did not go upstairs, he met Williams in the passage—there are eight clerks in the counting-house—there is a nar<lb></lb>row passage leading from the street to the back and a large yard at the end—the passage is about 6 feet in width, and an old skylight at the end—there is a door on the left of the passage just before you get to the yard, leading up to the counting-house; there are about twenty steps up to the counting-house, and then there is a door to go through—my desk faces the door; the other clerks' desks are a short distance from mine; the room is very light—I know it was after 12 o'clock that this occurred, but it was not so late as 12.30—when the prisoner presented the paper he asked me to pay in the usual way, he simply handed me the bill head—I don't think he made any remark; I am not sure about it—it did not occupy above two minutes—I went to try and find Williams, but did not find him for twenty minutes—I gave Williams a description of the person who had' been with the bill—I had seen the prisoner constantly, but did not know his name—I described him to Williams as a slim, fair young man; I did not tell him how he was dressed—Williams said that Golding had been there that morning—I did not mention Golding's name until Williams mentioned it to me; I did not know that he came from Golding &amp; Son, I knew that he came from a farrier's.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Agar-street, Strand, and am a chemist. The prisoner was my servant—all the money he received in the shop he was to put into a small box, and enter it in a book—I marked two half-crowns, three or four shillings, two sixpences, and a few fourpenny</p>

               <p>pieces—I sent two or three persons in for different articles, and after that went into the shop myself, and found some of them had been entered in the book, and some had not—I then referred to the desk to see whether the cash was there, thinking he might have omitted putting some articles down, but I ascertained there was one half-crown, one shilling, and three fourpenny-pieces, that I had marked, not there—I gave the money to Crann, Brooks, and Wheeler—I went and spoke to a policeman—I then asked the prisoner if he had any money about him—he said, "None of yours'—the policeman followed me in, and requested him to put out what money he had on the table—I then said, "If that is the half-crown I missed, it has such a mark on it, and is of such a year and such a reign, and the shilling also," and these were found among the money the prisoner put down.</p>

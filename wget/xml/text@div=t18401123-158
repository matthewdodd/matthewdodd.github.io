I had some sheep in the neighbourhood of Ealing, on the left-hand side of the bridge—I saw them safe on Monday, the 2nd of November, when I bought them, between five and six o'clock in the evening, in the place to be marked by my man, and they were driven out to the meadows oppo<lb></lb>site, in Perrivale, close to Ealing—I saw them marked myself—I had bought them of Mr. Smith, a farmer—I saw a skin of a sheep at Brent-ford, on Tuesday, 10th of November, and knew it again—I missed one of them on the 10th—I had not seen it after the 2nd, as I left them in the care of Smith.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the barracks, Castlebar-hill, near Ealing; Lemon was a tenant of mine, in a cottage there. On Monday, the 9th, he came to me about a quarter after seven o'clock in the evening—he called me out of the house, and asked if I had been to the ice well during the day—I said I had not—he then requested the loan of a lantern, for he said he saw two men, on Sunday evening, coming from the ice well, and they had thrown something into it, which was there in the morning, and he discovered that the door had been moved—I was going to give him a candle—he said, "I will go and see if it is there now, and will come and inform you"—I said, "I will go with you"—we went and discovered something in the well—I got down, and said, "Dear me, Lemon, it is a sheep; here is the whole carcase of it"—the prisoner Smith came up to the well, and said the sooner it was got away the better—I said, "Who put it there must get it away"—I said I would have nothing to do with it, and brought the ladder away—Lemon came with me—I said I should go and inform the police, that nobody here might be blamed for it—I found Sergeant Pascoe, and returned with him and a policeman to the ice well, about a quarter after eight o'clock—Lemon was afterwards taken into custody.</p>

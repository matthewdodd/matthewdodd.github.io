I am a printer, and live at 11, Hilliugham Street—on Sunday night, 2nd February, about half-past ten, I came out of the Clarence public-house, Cainberwell—some men were in the bar—the prisoner is one of them—they left the bar before me, and when I got out they all got round me, and two of them rifled my pockets and took what I had, and my hat and stick, and about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they gave me one or two cracks with their fists on the head—the constable came up and the others ran away—the prisoner remained last, he seemed very intent on my pockets—I was sober—I had had some drink, and might have been a little affected by it—I was conscious of what was passing—the men may have spoken to me in the public-house and asked me for some beer, but I do not recollect—I had two half-crowns among my money.</p>

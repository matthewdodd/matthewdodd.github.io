On Saturday, the 9th of February, I made the house up fast, and went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock - I was the last person up, and left every thing safe; I got up at seven the next morning, and found the shop door wide open, the pannel of the door was taken out, and the lock forced off - I missed five pairs of boots, one pair of spectacles, five silver spoons, a brass microscope, a pair of guinea scales, about 1 lb. of tea-dust, and a small quantity of two sorts of tobacco - I could not judge whether one or more persons had been in the house; I found a phosphorus-box, and matches, a latch-key, another key, and a pair of old dirty Wellington boots wet; I took off the clapper of the bell part of an old pocket, which had been put there as if to muffle it - I gave it to the officer Cooper with the other things; I had seen the bell at night - it was not muffled, for I unmuffled it that night - I always muffle it by day, and unmuffle it at night; I saw some of my property on the Sunday afternoon, at the station-house at Westminster - (Bugbud here produced the property) - I know these top boots - I never wore them; I have sold boots - I know them, and here is another pair of boy's boots which have my own writing on them; here is a pair of scales which I know, and another pair of boots and an odd one which I know - they are what I wore myself; when the bell was not muffled it would give an alarm if any body came in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What bell is it? A. One which we fix to an inner shop door; they got in at the outer door first - the shop door was locked the night before, and I found it wide open; the box of the lock was broken all to pieces - that is the inner door; the bell slips into a piece of iron - the outer door was not broken; they must have let themselves in by a latch-key, and forced the inner door - they could get to the bell by taking out the pannel; a hand could then reach it very easily and unfix it if they chose, but in taking it out it would make more noise than being muffled; I particularly recollect unmuffling it that night - I muffle it with a piece of linen, and that linen laid on a table close by; I will not swear whether that muffle was there in the morning, but to the best of my recollection it was.</p>

            . I am a Policeman of the B division. I was on duty on the morning of the 10th of February in Duck-lane, Westminster, about a quarter before five o'clock - I saw Still, who gave his name as Richards; his pocket looked very bulky - it was rather dark, and I turned my light on; I said, "What have you got here, my man?" he said he had got some tea which he was going to take to his mother - he turned his back to me; I said, "You must go to the station-house with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140016"></xptr>me;" he said he would, and on getting to the end of Duck-lane we had to go through some posts - he went through first, and then ran away; I pursued, and never lost sight of him - he was stopped by Faulkner; I did not lose sight of him for a moment; I have not the least doubt of him being the same man - he was then taken to the station-house in New-way, Westminster, and searched; as I was pursuing him he threw several things away - a screw-driver, a pair of boy's boots, another pair and an odd boot, and a pair of scales and a case - Faulkner searched him at the station while I went to where he had ran, and picked up these things; I have had them ever since - I have not the least doubt of their being the things he threw away - I picked them up about five minutes after he threw them away, or less: Faulkner gave me the other things which I have produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not a very dark morning? A. It was; he ran up Orchard-street - he ran up Little and Great Dean-street - there is only one turning, which is from Little to Great Dean-street. I did not stop him - I did not see his face, - I could see his clothes; it was not so dark when I turned my light on - I saw part of his side face, because he turned it half round - but did not see his full face.</p>

            . I am a Policeman; I heard the cry of Stop thief! five or six times, and stopped Still - I had him in custody four or five minutes before Bugbud came up; as soon as I saw Still, I saw Bugbud with his light - the prisoner had come out of Orchard-street into Great Dean-street, and stopped in Little Dean-street - he had run fifteen or twenty yards; I saw Bugbud directly I stopped him turn his light - Bugbud was then about a dozen rods off; when I stopped him he put his hand in his pocket, and turned out a quantity of tea in the street; then Bugbud came up - he was running pretty fast; we took him to the station-house - I searched him there; I found a pair of spectacles, some tea; a snuff box, and four phosphorus matches in his pocket, similar to those found at Cramp's, and he had this pair of boots on his feet - I delivered the boots and spectacles to Bugbud; I was sent for on the day in question about two o'clock, to the station-house, and while there, the prisoner Bassett came - he did not see Still; he asked if Still could have any dinner brought him - he went away out of the station-house to go to Worship-street; I went and brought him back to the station-house, searched him, and found on him a tobacco-box full of tobacco, and a small purse with a lancet in it, and I found his right-hand trousers pocket was cut or torn out; the inspector asked where he lived - he said No. 5, Off-alley, Strand - I went there and found he did not live there, or I should have searched; I took his trousers off his legs, and Cooper, the Policeman, produced a pocket, which I saw corresponded with the trousers; I have not the least doubt of its being the pocket of these trousers, the trousers and pocket are here- I found nothing on him belonging to the prisecutor, unless the tobacco was his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far was Still from the corner of Orchard-street when you stopped him? A. Thirteen or fourteen rods; I looked up when I stopped him - I heard Bugbud's voice calling Stop thief! and saw his light before I stopped Still; it was three or four minutes before he came up, I think.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Bassett came to the station-house voluntarily? A. Yes; the inspector asked where he lived - he took his address down, and gave it to me; I inquired at two Nos. 5, in Off-alley - there are two Off-alleys; I inquired at both - many persons there take in lodgers for a night, I understand; Bassett's pocket had been cut or torn out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How soon after you stopped Still did you see Bugbud? A. He was in sight when I stopped him; he was about sixty-six yards off, and came up running fast.</p>

            . I belong to the F division of Police. I got this pocket from Mr. Cramp - I got the trousers from Bassett at the station-house; he was wearing them - I saw the pocket and the trousers compared; they corresponded exactly; they are both here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Was the pocket in the state it is now? A. The very same state; the fear at the top would cause the tear below - I know nothing about the small tear, the smaller hole might be mended, and then the pocket would be good.</p>

On Saturday night, the 9th of February, I saw both the prisoner, about half-past twelve o'clock, at the same table in our house - I do not know whether they came in together - I went to bed at a quarter before one o'clock; the last time I saw them was at half-past twelve.</p>

                  </hi> I am a bookmaker, and live at Kensington New Town. On the 1st of April I was going to measure a gentleman in Wellclose-square for a pair of boots—I got out of an omnibus at the Bank—I continued my way, and offered to give a person drink if he would show me the way—it was about six o'clock in the evening—I know I had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi> when I met some one—I had three half-crowns, eight or ten shillings, and some sixpences—I recollect nothing more till I got to the station—when I found my recol<lb></lb>lection again I was locked up in the station, and I had no money—the prisoner is the man whom I asked to show me the way, and whom I offered something to drink—I am sure he is the man—I can swear to him, but he had a fustian jacket on, not the same jacket that he has now.</p>

                  </hi> I am a lamp-lighter, and live in George-yard, St. George's—I was at the George public-house, in the New-road, on the evening of the 1st of April—I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner, and two others with them, drinking rum—I saw a great dead of whispering and nudging going on between the prisoner and the other men, for nearly half on hour—I watched them—the prosecutor seemed overcome all at once—he partly sat, and partly fell on the seat—he was not able to sit down—the prisoner sat down instantly</p>

               <p>alongside of him, and the other two persons placed themselves so as to screen him—I saw the prisoner put his left hand into the prosecutor's left<lb></lb>hand waistcoat-pocket—a woman who was sitting there called out—the pri<lb></lb>soner got up to run away—I ran to follow him—my foot slipped at the door, and he got out—I still followed him, and never lost sight of him—I caught him about fifteen yards from the house, up the gateway—after I had hold of him he said, "Come on <hi rend="italic">old cock,</hi> I will make it all right, you shall have half"—we went to the top of the yard. which is I suppose some sixty yards long—he offered me half this money three times before we got to the top—there used to be a wicket-gate there—he went there and found an obstruction—he there offered me the whole of the money—I would not take it, we returned down the yard again, and at the third arch of the railway there is a wall where a person might escape over—he went there, but found way was blocked up with carts and wagons—there was a struggle between us there, and he jinked the money in his hand—when he got to a dunghill he was thrown down, and left the money there—I saw the money in his hand three times—two or three persons came to my assistance, and the prisoner was secured.</p>

                  </hi> I live at No. 35, St, George's-terrace. I was sitting along<lb></lb>side the woman who called out—I heard the prisoner say when he first came into the house that he had shown the man from London-bridge to Wellclose-square—he said he had come two miles out of his way to conduct him; that he had given him two glasses of rum for showing him, and he did not seem satisfied—the prosecutor said, "I behaved as a man to you—I live at No. 7, Kensington New Town—I want no further correspondence with you"—they went our together for ten minutes or quarter of an hour, then came back with another person who had some salt fish, and that person said, "I will treat you now"—they had something drink—the prosecutor sat down on the bence—the prisoner sat alongside of him—a woman was sitting alongside of me, and she said something—I saw the prisoner put his left hand into the prosecutor's waistcoat-pocket, and draw out something—I do not know what it was—the woman called out, "Don't go to rob the man, he had been treating you all the evening"—the prisoner then rushed out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went into drink with the prosecutor; there were three men in company with these two who have come as witnesses; we sat down and had something to drink, and these men had some of the rum that we called for; I and the prosecutor had some more rum, and a pint of half<lb></lb>and-half; we then went out—one of them followed us and said, "If you come back, I know the prosecutor, I will treat you with a pot of beer;" we went back and had a share of the beer; when it was out, the man that gave the beer asked if I was not going to stand anything; I pulled out a shil<lb></lb>ling and gave it to the man to pay for beer; they got shuffling about the prosecutor; I got up, as I had an occasion to go out; this witness fol<lb></lb>lowed me, and demanded money up the yard; a tustle took place, I was knocked down on the dunghill, and the money rolled out of my jacked-pocked; whether the prosecutor was robbed I could not tell; he was gone, and because I was a stranger and intoxicated they gave me into custody to escape them<lb></lb>selves;</p>

            , and payable there. There was a woman behind the counter; I asked if that was Mr. Smith's; she said it was, but he was not at home - I shewed her the bill, and she sent a child to tell him he was wanted - I delivered the bill into her hands. The child went out and returned in two or three minutes with the prisoner. The woman in the interim beckoned to some person in the street. When the prisoner came, I asked if his name was Smith, but got no answer - the woman immediately put the bill into his hands, and he put it into his pocket, and then gave me his card, with the name of</p>
               <p>"Bynon, Little James-street, Gray's Inn-lane," on it - he said he should detain the bill, and that it had been got from him in an improper manner. I said I wished him to accompany me to our counting-house, in Holland-street, Blackfriars, and he went willingly - Mr. Devey was from home; I went to the Coal-exchange, Thames-street, for him, but before I returned the prisoner was gone - I had told him I was going there to enquire for him; it is about a mile from the counting-house. He had not said he would wait until I returned. I did not see him him again till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>MR. DEVEY. I took the bill of Johnson's and Co., coal merchants, at Vauxhall, for goods sold and delivered; it had their endorsements on it, but I cannot say to whom it was payable, whether to the drawer's order or not. I think it was made payable to the drawer's.</p>

            . I live with Mrs. Smith as servant. When Wright came in, mistress sent me for Mr. Bynon, whom I had seen before; mistress told me to see if I could find Mr. Bynon. I found him standing at the butcher's shop nearly opposite; I think it was between one and two o'clock; when we got in, Wright held the bill in his hand, he asked Mrs. Smith, if that (Bynon) was Mr. Smith, she said</p>
               <p>"No, that is Mr. Bynon," he then held the bill in his hand towards Mr. Bynon, who took it out of his hand, folded it up and put it in his pocket; as he put it in, he asked Wright where he brought it from, he said from Mr. Devey, coal-merchant. Mr. Bynon, then took out a card, and said Here is my card; I shall detain the bill, as it has been fraudulently kept from me; he then went out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090012"></xptr>shop; Wright turned to Mrs. Smith, and said, he should look to her for the bill.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 28th of November, I placed this bill in the hands of Mr. Hatch, who offered to get it discounted by Johnson, a coal-merchant; he came to me and said, it was not convenient for Johnson to give the cash that day, but he would give a cheque for it next morning. Johnson avoided it for four or five days, and at last wrote to Hatch, stating that he detained it in part of 50 l. due to him from Hatch. I applied at Union Hall, for a summons, but the Magistrate would not interfere, but refered me to a solicitor, but Johnson took no notice; I therefore waited at Smith's. When it became due the girl fetched me; Mrs. Smith, handed it over to me; I put it into my pocket, and gave the young man my card as he states.</p>

            , I live in Nile-place, New Kent-road. I received this bill from the prisoner to get discounted. I went to Mr. Johnson, who had previously offered to discount for me, he asked me to endorse it, which I did; he said if I would call on Saturday, he would do it. I went, the clerk desired me to come on Monday, which I did, and Johnson said it was not convenient; he made the same excuse five times. I at last asked him for the bill, he said he was going out of town, and would leave it with his clerk. I went next morning, he said, if I would go down to Vauxhall-walk, it should be sent. Bynon and I went, and in half an hour the clerk brought me a note. I have never received the bill or money.</p>

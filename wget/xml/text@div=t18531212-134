                  </hi>. I am inspector of police of the <hi rend="italic">G</hi> division. On 25th Oct., in consequence of instructions I went to William's Rents, Angel alley—I went to the first floor room of a house; there is only one room on a floor—I found the door locked, I believe—I broke it open with a sledge hammer—I saw the three prisoners standing at a table, on which was a galvanic battery charged, and apparently at work—there was a fire there—on our entrance, the male prisoner kicked the table over, and kicked the battery out of the jar, and scattered the solution all about; part of it went over my great coat and burnt it, and part of it burnt my hands; and at that time a dog sprang at me; he was hissed on by the male prisoner—I pushed the dog back with the sledge hammer, and he seized the constable Neville, and tore his trowsers, and then he seized Evans, and tore his trowsers—they succeeded in beating him off—I saw a number of sixpences on the table; some were scattered on the floor—I found this battery, and this is a small portion of the fluid which I took from the table; it was spilt—I found this file on the table; it had at that time white metal in it, but in consequence of the solution, it is rusty—in the corner of the room, near the bed, I found two moulds, one for casting sixpences, and the other for shillings—I found four counterfeit sixpences—there were seventeen sixpences in the whole produced by the various officers; they are all finished.</p>

Fred, you are badly off if you will comply with my wishes, I will relieve you; allow me to leave these things, and I will call at half past 7 o'clock; if I don't call, you bring them down to me at the <hi rend="italic">Cat</hi> public house, and I will put you in a good way; when he was gone, I said to Sarah, Bring me these things, let me see what he has brought me; I had the jars on the table, I looked in, and there were these counterfeit sixpences; I said, Sarah, here is some money; she said, You don't say that! I said, Yes, but they were bad; I had scarcely replaced them in the jar, when the door opened, and the door opening, upset the table, and threw the things off; I can produce the little dog; it would not fly at anybody, it is too harmless.</p>

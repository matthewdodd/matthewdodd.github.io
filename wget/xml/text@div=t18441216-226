                  </hi>. I keep the Barnard's Inn coffee-house in Holborn. On the 4th of Dec. I saw the prisoner at my house, in company with another person named Stubbs—I had not known either of them before—they came after twelve o'clock, and stopped till the clock struck three—they were drinking gin and water, and running backwards and forwards in the passage, which is not very long—the front of the bar comes into the passage—these coats were in the spare room up stairs on the first floor—at half-past two o'clock I went up stairs to wash, and was up for a quarter</p>

               <p>of an hour—when I was coming down I heard the lodger's door go—I called, "Mr. Still, is that you?"—I received no answer—I looked down stairs, and saw the green door, at the bottom of the stairs open, and some person go out, but I could not see who it was—his back was to me—I could see the glimpse of some person go—in less than two minutes I missed a close bodied coat, and a top coat—I had not seen them myself after the morning—they have never been found—they were worth more than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I value them at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bar-maid at Barnard's Inn coffee-house, On the 4th of Dec. I saw the prisoner there—I did not see him come in—he was there when I came home at half-past twelve o'clock—a man, named Stubbs, was with him—I believe they had had one glass, and they were then standing conversing, and quoting poetry, and different things in front of the bar—they asked me to shake hands with them, which I refused—at nearly three o'clock my master went up stairs, and I was left alone in the bar—the prisoner and the other man were repeatedly leaving the bar, and going towards the end of the passage—I then heard the pri<lb></lb>soner say to Stubbs, "She is not there"—Stubbs said, "Yes she is"—the prisoner said, "No she is not"—then Stubbs said, "Go, go," and the prisoner left the bar, and came round to the bar-door, as I thought—I had bolted the door, as I did not choose to be annoyed by them—they ap<lb></lb>peared to be tipsy—I did not see any one, but I heard some one running down stairs, and he stumbled—I ran out and saw the door open, which gave a light—I saw the prisoner come out of the green door, and going out of the street door with a coat on his arm—I am quite certain it was the prisoner who went out—I could not see that he had two coats—he had one coat—he had no coat on his arm when he was standing at the bar, nor had the other man—I immediately ran to the street door as quick as I could, but the prisoner was gone—I came back and made some inquiry of Stubbs—I had seen Mr. Castle's coats safe at half-past twelve o'clock, when I came home—I did not miss them, but Mr. Castle told me they were gone.</p>

Q.</hi> I think you said "a coat?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I would swear I saw one—there was one great coat and one body coat missing—I could not say what was the colour of them—I believe they were both olive green—they were both my master's coats—I have seen him wear them many times—I had not no<lb></lb>ticed them particularly—I am certain the close-bodied coat was not a light<lb></lb>coloured one—I am almost certain it had not brass buttons—the prisoner and Stubbs began to talk to me as soon as I came in—they were quoting poetry when I came in—they wanted to shake hands with me several times when I went into the bar to serve a customer—I was in and out the whole time nearly—they were drinking gin and water, and I considered their conduct rather annoying—I did not complain to my master—he saw some of it—they offered to shake hands with him—he did not order them out; there was nothing to order them out for.</p>

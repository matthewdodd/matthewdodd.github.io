               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long were you at the public-house? A. About an hour, not more-there is a singing club held there, but there was no singing that night; we had a pint of half and half between four of us, a 1d. worth of gin, and part of a glass of rum and water - as I came out I had another 1d. worth of gin; I left my companions at the door; they were old friends - I was robbed two or three minutes walk from the house; I did not cry out when I was tripped up - I did not see the prisoner at that moment, because I could not see behind me; I do not think there is a lamp in the street - it was a very moon-light night; the prisoner did not say he had come up, hearing the alarm; the greatest distance he got from me was from the kennel to the middle of the road, not more than a yard and a half - his back being white enabled me to keep him in sight; I was as sober as I ever was in my life; as soon as he broke my chain he turned his back to me.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was in the neighbourhood, and came up, hearing Watson, my brother officer, spring his rattle, and saw the prisoner struggling with him - he was charged with stealing a gold key and part of a chain; the prosecutor was close by him, and appeared perfectly sober; some persons were near, who came round, as if to rescue the prisoner, but I told them not to give me occasion to use violence - they then desisted, and I took him to the station-house; his back had whitening on it - as I took him along he said the prosecutor was a friend of his, and this was the way he always served him when they came out together - that was not said in the prosecutor's hearing; I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.There were men round when you came up? A. Yes; the rattle had attracted persons - I suppose they belonged to his party.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) - On the night stated in the indictment. I had been spending the evening with a friend - I left about half-past twelve o'clock, and coming down Pelham-street, in my way home, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I was intoxicated, and I was some distance from the place where the person, was robbed; and when they came near me, I mixed with the mob; I was knocked down and taken into custody - I have been in a respectable business as a publican, and business run so bad, that I was obliged to give up my house at a sad loss of all I possessed, and ever since I have supported my wife and child by honest industry; I have always borne the character of an honest, sober, industrious man; I now throw myself on your mercy, for I am innocent of the charge.</p>

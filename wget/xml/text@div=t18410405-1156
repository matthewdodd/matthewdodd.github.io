                  </hi>. I am a traveller. On the evening of the 5th of April, I was in St. Paul's Churchyard, and met the prisoners just opposite the Goose and Gridiron public-house—they asked for something to drink—I gave them a shilling—I had at that time eight sovereigns loose in my pocket, and a purse containing four other sovereigns, and a sixpence—as soon as I left them I beard a sovereign drop, I picked it up and put it into my pocket, with the other seven—I then missed my purse containing the four sovereigns and sixpence, which was a cracked one—I have seen the sixpence and the purse since.</p>

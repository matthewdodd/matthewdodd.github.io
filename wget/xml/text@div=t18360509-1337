                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Glover, and live at the Coach and Horses, at Little Ilford, in the parish of Ilford in Essex. On the 6th of April I went to bed at eleven o'clock at night—I fastened the house up at eleven, but our lodger was a after me—my husband had gone to bed before that—I was called up next morning about a quarter before six o'clock by a person who was going by the house—I got up came down stairs—I found the bar-door wrenched open, and the lock lying on the floor—I am certain I had locked it the night before, and I had the key in my pocket—I missed 3lbs. of cigars from the bar, and 120 half-pence, 60 penny pieces, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and six silver tea-spoons—I am quite positive they were all there when I went to bed over night—I also missed three great coats, two neck-handkerchiefs, and a silk umbrella, from the her parlour when I had seen them the night before—I saw the prisoner a few days previous to the robbery—I served him with beer at our bar about eleven o'clock in the day—he was not above a quarter of an hour in my presence—I am certain of him—I have since seen the umbrella which belongs to William Webb, our lodger.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Lambert-street. In conse<lb></lb>quence of informations, I took the prisoner in Elbow-lane, Shadwell, on Sunday the 11th of April—in his room, and found the umbrella, which I now produce, there—I asked him whose it was—he said, it belonged to the woman below—I supposed he meant the woman who kept the house—I was going down stairs to her, and he called me back, and said, "It is of no use; in fact, the umbrella is my own"—on putting my arm through a a hole in the ciling of his room, I found a bunch of skeleton keys, a crow-bar, an old screw-driver, a dark lantern, and a pistol—the prisoner said to me directly, "You have sprang my plant, "meaning, we had discovered where he concealed things—I afterwards applied the crow-bar to the prose<lb></lb>cutor's bar-door, which had been forced, and found it correspond with the marks on it.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer of Hatton-garden. On the 28th of February, in consequence of information which I received, I went, in company with Edwards and Lee, to Crick's-fields, Paddington; I found a cottage there - it had only two rooms and a kitchen; they were all on the ground floor; the cottage is but one story high, and stood alone - there is a small garden all round it. I entered the house in company with Edwards, at the back door, which was shut, and on the latch; I went through the little kitchen into the parlour, on the right hand, and there I saw the female prisoner, Price, sitting by the fireside, with her back towards the window - she was close to the fire; there was a fire in the grate: on my going in she shrieked out, "Oh, my Lord!" or "Oh, my God!" we seized her and secured her.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you secured her, did you see her do anything? A. I saw Edwards take some money out of her hand; she had this cup in her hand - she tried to throw it into the firs- it hit my hand, which broke the fall, and it did not break - it fell on the fire; I took it off the fire, and found in it the paste which I understand they use to colour base money - it is now in the cup; I saw Edwards try this stuff on a penny-piece, and it gave it the colour of silver.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Edwards went in at the back door? A. Yes; Lee came in at the front; I saw Edwards take some money out of her hand, but what money it was I could not see; we then examined her hands, and her right hand particularly was very much stained with a dark green colour; her right thumb and fingers were stained. I have tried the stuff in the cup, and it turned my own thumb and finger green; we sent for Mr. Powell, and when he came we searched the room - he was at hand, and came almost directly; nothing had been disturbed but the cup before he came; on his coming I found what appeared to be a shilling on the bar of the grate - this is it (producing it) and under the grate I found these two half-crowns and a sixpence, which I produce. I found a saucepan on the floor of the room, close to her side, with three shillings and a half-crown - I produce them; the saucepan at that time had something wet in it; it was some liquid, but nothing that would save; it was a few drops of liquid; I found a piece of sand paper by the side of her; it had the appearance of having been used; I found a glass bottle by the side of her, in a little recess on her left hand, by the fireplace, and there was aquafortis in it; she sat with her left hand to the fire; I found a pair of bellows there, with the appearance of something having been rubbed on it: there is something white - it has been nearly rubbed off; I went into the bed-room, and found a table there; here is the drawer of that table; it has the appearance of a stain on it, and of brass filings. I saw nothing of the male prisoner in the cottage - I went out, and got information from a man outside, and ran in company with him across the fields, as he had directed me: I did not myself come up with the male prisoner, but I saw Edwards bring him back without his coat, in a direction of the premises I had not seen him before. I went on in a direction pointed out to me and found this coat, which the male prisoner afterwards claimed; he desired me to let him have it to put on, and said it was his - he was without a coat when he was brought back, and his breeches were all over mud and wet; he was then secured: the articles found in the house are here.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100032"></xptr>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. When did you receive this information? A. I received several informations.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. A person in Coldbathfields had his liberty given him to give information; the house I believe was not fastened at all. Witness. No, it was only on the latch. I cannot say whether there were curtains to the window of the room in which I found the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. There are very low windows, I believe such as can be seen from the road by anybody passing? A. Yes, but the cottage is some distance from the road: I am sure a person walking in the road could not see into the room; the road is not finished; the footpath in the road is low down, as low as their window nearly; the cottage stands quite back - I had a great deal of trouble to get along the foothpath, by laying hold of the rails, and then I could not see what was doing inside the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe anything particular on my wife's face? A. I did - it appeared to me as if she had had a beating; she had a black eye: she fainted, and struggled a good deal. I seized her the moment I entered the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you assert on your oath that she could throw a cup into the fire? A. Her fainting was after she was handcuffed.</p>

            . I am an officer. I accompanied Limbrick and other officers on the 28th of February, to Crick's fields - I entered the cottage with Limbrick - it is only one story high; we went to the front room - I saw the female prisoner sitting by the side of the fire; I directly laid hold of her, with Limbrick; she was then throwing a tea-cup into the fire; this is the cup, (producing it) and from her hand I took these five sixpences, which were quite wet (producing them) - they were wet, as if they had been put into the pickle, as they call it, and her hand was wet likewise; the sixpences were white, and had the appearance of having been recently coloured; I dried them myself with rag, and since that they have changed their colour; they are a brass colour: we secured her; I was given to understand the male prisoner had run across the fields; I pursued across the field - I did not know the male prisoner before; I saw him crossing one field, and jump into a wide ditch; I then saw him get out of the ditch again - he had a light coloured coat when he was running in the field; he threw it off as he was running, and jumped into the ditch - I saw him get out of the ditch - I saw some men at work in the field, and told them I wanted him for murder; they brought him back to me; I took him back to the cottage again - we secured him and the woman. I then tried this powder or paste in the cup on a penny-piece - here is that penny-piece; it has given it a white colour. The prisoners were put into a coach, and conveyed to the office. I asked the male prisoner how long he had lived there - I did not say anything to induce him to tell me - he said it wanted a month and one week to the half year.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went in pursuit of the man did you examine the person of the female prisoner? A. I did; the finger and thumb of her right hand particularly were stained with a kind of yellow cast. I made a further search after taking them to the office; Limbrick and Mr. Powell had remained in the house; I found them there when I returned. I found nothing particular afterwards, except a brush, which I gave to Lee - it appeared greasy, and I found a brown powder - here it is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. When you brought me back as a prisoner, did you not say to a man who was at work near the house, "I am much obliged to you for giving the office?" A. I did not. When I first went into the house I asked Lee where the man was.</p>
               <p>Q. You had just received information then that I was in the house? A. I expected to find you in the house, and went into the other room to look for you.</p>

            . I am an officer, and accompanied Limbrick and Edwards to apprehend the prisoners. I got in at the front door of the cottage; I found a key outside the door - I turned the key, and opened it; I found the female prisoner struggling with Edwards and Limbrick; I assisted in securing her; I had her in my care while Limbrick and Edwards went after the man. I went into the bed-room, but saw nobody there - there was only one bed in the house- Mr. Powell came in in a very few minutes. I saw a half-crown in the ashes, and a shilling on the flat upper bar of the stove - I found on the tea-board eight half-crowns and eight shillings, which are here; I also found a tooth-brush, which had the appearance of some black stuff in it, soot or something, and I found a fire shovel, which I produce - it had the appearance of having been smoked over the fire, and there is a sort of acid, which I suppose to be cream of tartar, on the inside of it; I did not taste it then, but did after I got to the office - it has been in my possession till just now. I also produce the eight half-crowns and toothbrush.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. I believe you searched the place minutely - did you find anything secreted in any of the drawers? A. The things were all open in the room- every thing I found was in one room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all close by the table where my wife was sitting? A. Yes - she was not sitting when I entered, but the things were near the table, which was near the fire, with the breakfast things on it; I think there was only one table in the room.</p>

               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. Have you had the contents of the shovel analized? A. No; there was a grate with a fire in it, but whether the grate was set I do not know.</p>

               <p>JOHN LIMBRICK re-examined. The grate was not set; I saw no mortar on it; the male prisoner said at the time that it was mortar on the shovel - but the shovel was all black, as if it had been on the fire to melt something.</p>

            . I am a plasterer. On the 28th of February I was in Crick's-fields, and on passing the cottage the prisoners live in I saw Limbrick, Edwards and Lee; I saw the male prisoner outside the cottage, at the side of the cottage - I did not know him before; he had on a white rough coat; I think he had a hat, but do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100033"></xptr>know; I did not see what he was doing; he seemed as if he was doing some pales outside; he had a nail box in his hand. I saw the officers go into the house, and when they had gone in I heard a female scream inside the house; the male prisoner then came up to the corner, and looked on one side, towards the front of the house - he then dropped his nail box, and ran across the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. When he looked round could he see the officers? A. No, they were inside: he ran across the fields at the back part of the house - I saw one of the officers run after him; another man stopped him, and brought him back to the officer; I did not run after him: when he ran across the fields I had a view of him, and could see him run right down the field - I saw him pull off his coat, and throw it through a hedge, into another field; I afterwards saw that coat - I picked it up, and brought it to Limbrick. I saw the prisoner brought back, and am sure he is the man who ran from the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. Which way did I leave the house at first? A. You ran down the side of the field, by the cottage; the place you were taken in is behind the cottage; I saw you brought back - I heard no observation made by Edwards. I had not been near the cottage five minutes, when I saw the officers, and did not see you till the officers were there; I did not see you at work outside for those five minutes.</p>

I was employed on Thursday, the 28th of February, in building a cottage near where the prisoners live; I was at work, and saw the male prisoner come out of the cottage, with a few palings under his arm; he was nailing them up to the fence. I saw him in the garden for about a quarter of an hour before I saw the officers - before I got sight of the officers I saw Price running away down the field, without his hat, and in a little time I saw Edwards run down the field, and in a short time I saw him bring the prisoner back.</p>

            . I live at No. 15, Chapel-street, Paddington. I know the prisoner Hambry Price; I let him a cottage in Paddington fields - I believe the place is intended to be called Little Weston-street; I let it to him previous to Michaelmas day, last year; he entered two or three days before - he has paid me rent for it; I saw a female with him after he got into the cottage, and believe it was the female prisoner: I asked him what business he was - he said a writer; I asked of what - he said he wrote for the press.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. Have you any reason to disbelieve that the female prisoner is my wife? A. No, you always represented her as your wife - I had no reason to suspect your honesty at all; you paid my rent regularly - that is all I can say.</p>

            . I am assistant to the Solicitor of the Mint. I was at the cottage in Crick's-fields on the 28th of February; it was twenty minutes after one o'clock when the officers entered the cottage; I was close by, and went in in five minutes - when I got into the house I found the female prisoner in the custody of the officers, Limbrick and Lee; the male prisoner not being found in the house, Edwards went out backwards, to look for him; he was soon afterwards brought into the house by Edwards, accompanied by a witness who had secured him; a search then took place by the officers, who found the counterfeit money, produced; the colouring materials in the cup were produced to me - I desired Edwards to try the effect of it on a piece of copper, which he did, and it gave it the colour and appearance of silver. The prisoners were secured and taken away - I remained in the house.</p>

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint, and have been so many years. (Examining three half-crowns, four shillings, and a sixpence, produced by Limbrick) these three half-crowns are counterfeit - the shillings are counterfeit, and the sixpence also - the half-crowns appear to me to have undergone a preparation to fit them for a more regular state for circulation, than when they come from the coiner; by rubbing off the roughness of the die, then re-silvering, and rubbing them with grease, to give them the appearance of having been in circulation; here is the glass-paper produced - it appears to have been used on some sort of metal; the paper is generally used for polishing wood; nothing would rub the half-crowns so well as this paper. [The witness here wetted the contents of the cup produced, with plain water and rubbed it on a piece of copper] this powder has produced an appearance of silver on the copper; the powder is a strong nitrate of silver. Here are the five sixpences produced by Edwards - they are all counterfeit; they are in such a state now that I cannot tell what has been done with them; they appear to have been left in acid; the application of the stuff in the cup would give them the appearance of silver - (rubbing it on) to complete the process, it wants to be washed with a slight acid; I presume these sixpences have been once coloured, but I cannot say so - they are silvered before they are struck in the die, then rubbed, and coloured a fresh, but whether these have been re-coloured a second time I cannot say; but the half-crowns, shillings, and sixpence have undergone all that process.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100034"></xptr>Q. Now examine the eight half crowns and eight shillings produced by Lee? A. These are all counterfeit - they are just in the state in which they came from the original coiner - just as they come from the die; they have not been rubbed nor re-silvered; I have examined all the apparatus produced - it is all the apparatus which is generally used on these occasions; here is the nitrate of silver, aquafortis to be diluted with water, to make the acid, or for the purpose of making the nitrate of silver; here is the paper to rub the money down - a small saucepan, which is very commonly used, to neal it, to heat it to give it a better ring; it is generally done in a fire shovel.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do all the half-crowns appear to have been struck from the same die? A. They do, my Lord, and the shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. There is a brown powder produced, what is that? A. Here is a powder which appears like marble dust, but I cannot say what it is.</p>
               <p>MR. FRANKLYN. I am a moneyer of the Mint. (Looking at the three half-crowns, four shillings, and a sixpence) these are all counterfeit - I cannot say what the metal is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HAMBRY PRICE. Q. Are any of them fit for circulation? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. FIELD. I have examined the coins - they are brass, washed with a slight degree of silver before the die is struck.[Here the witness broke a shilling, and produced it to the Court.]</p>
               <p>HAMBRY PRICE'S Defence. I scarcely know how to defend myself, having been, by various circumstances, unable to employ a legal gentleman; but, as far as relates to the articles produced, I have no knowledge of them. About sixteen months ago I became acquainted with one Antonio, an artificial florist; he lodged with a young man, who is since married - a man named Harvey, who has been tried for passing these things and acquitted: as soon as I discovered this I ceased to have any connexion with them. About six months ago I met Antonio, who said he understood Harvey was in Coldbath-fields for passing bad coin; I saw nothing of him for a fortnight or three weeks, when he knocked at my door - I expressed my surprise at seeing him, as I understood he was to have twelve months imprisonment; he said he had got his imprisonment remitted for his good behaviour, and had got a situation with a baker; I knew he was a baker by trade. I begged of him not to come to my place, but he being in a deplorable situation I invited him to dinner (I believe) which I was having when he came; he came again two or three times - I repeatedly begged of him not to come. On the morning in question he came while we were at breakfast - my wife and I had had a quarrel, and we again resumed the quarrel; I went out of the house and never entered it again till I was a prisoner, which was in an hour. Harvey had promised four days before to bring me some seeds to put in my garden, and after I went out of the house it seems he said he had brought me the seeds for the garden, and my wife would have brought them to me, but was fearful of resuming the quarrel; I had previously given her a black eye. When the officers entered the house I heard her exclaim, "Oh, my God!" - a man came and told me to go, for my wife had sent for the officers; I ran away, and hearing a cry of Stop thief and murder! hastened me, for I was fearful I had done my wife a serious injury. I at last sat down on a barrow, reflecting that I could not have done my wife such an injury; I was brought back, and saw Mr. Powell and Edwards in the room examining the papers. I have brought a certificate of my marriage if it will have any effect.</p>
               <p>MARY PRICE'S Defence (written) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I have very little to urge in my defence; for, comparatively speaking, I know nothing of this transaction. The parcel that was found by the officers had been left about twenty minutes before, by a young man with whom my husband was acquainted, of the name of Edward Harvey. I, my Lord and Gentlemen, solemnly protest that I did not know there was such a thing as a counterfeit piece of money of any description in the house; nor did I ever see them at all before they were produced at the Magistrate's, and then, from the state of my feelings, only partially; the saucepan that was shewn I had boiled two eggs in for breakfast, and that only. My Lord and Gentlemen, - Had it not been for an unfortunate quarrel between my husband and me, this calamitous circumstance never could have happened; for, Gentlemen, I should have carried to my husband, or have examined, the supposed parcel of seeds myself, and then the villainy, of this worse than villain, would have been detected. Of the transactions of that day, from the entrance of the officers to my committal at night, I have no recollection; for, on being seized by the officers, I fainted, from the effect of their behaviour and manner, thinking that, seeing me alone, they had entered for murder or plunder. My Lord and Gentlemen, - As I expect Divine Mercy, so do I assure you, that the whole is the contrivance of the villain Harvey, the informer; for purposes that must be obvious; by himself, or, as I firmly believe, with the assistance of others. Should we, or either of us, this day obtain our liberty, I am confident we then shall be enabled to produce the full proof of his or their superior villainy. Confidently relying on your discriminating judgment, my Lord, and on your cool deliberation and reflection, Gentlemen, I cheerfully resign my fate to your keeping; almost certain of the verdict that I anticipate.</p>

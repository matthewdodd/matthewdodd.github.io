On the 23d of last month, I saw the prisoner, about five o'clock, on the outside of my door, where my boots hang, with a pair of boots in his hand; he then went about two yards from where I first saw him, and then I saw him take another pair of boots off the rail; he put them both into one hand, paused a bit, and then walked away; I followed him about as far again as the end of this Court, and overtook him; I took the boots out of his hand, and took him to Marlborough-street; when I stopped him, I told him one pair of boots might do, and he smiled.</p>

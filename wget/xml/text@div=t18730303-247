                  </hi>. I am manager and partner in the firm of Messrs. Williamson, carrying on business at 42, Cannon Street as gunmakers—on 18th February Mr. Brown brought the prisoner into the office, and left him there—I was writing—Mr. Brown left him, and said he would be back in a few minutes—I told the prisoner to take a seat, and he did so—he sat within</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187303030039"></xptr>
               <p>about a yard from me—I did not speak to him then—a bag was placed on the table, which he afterwards moved on to the show-glass adjoining the window; two or three feet from the window—as soon as Mr. Brown left he sat down and rose up again—we kept some of our revolvers in the show glass, and others are on the window-ledge—the prisoner reached across my back, and then I turned round and said "If you wish to see the revolvers I will move, I am in your way," and I heard him remove the revolvers in the window—I afterwards heard something from Gibson, and on 20th February I went to Mr. Vaughan's, in the Strand—we did busines with them, and I went there by accident—I saw a revolver first, which was brought into the shop during the time I was there—I recognised it immediately as our revolver—I saw the prisoner, and I told him it was one that we missed, and that he was in our place on the Tuesday—he said it was one that some one had given to him to ask the value—I telegraphed to Bow Lane; he was detained, and then taken into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not in partnership, I am manager—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a tolerably correct representation of the office—there is a table close up to the window—the prisoner occupied a chair at the end of the table—the show-glass runs from the window; it does not go the whole length of the office—there is a chair between the table and the show-glass—he would reach over the chair to get at the show-glass—that revolver wag in the window, on the window-ledge, so that it could be seen from the street—I had not seen the revolver at all on that day—the prisoner did ask at what price we could supply rifles and guns, and such things, but there was not much conversation about the price of revolvers—he mentioned revolvers, and I showed him one out of the window—that was a nipple revolver—I placed them back in the window myself—my attention had been called particularly to this pistol; it is a liege action, it is twelve barrelled, and has been in stock for two years—it was the only revolver we had of that kind—it has a defect which I can swear to—the firm that manufacture our revolvers would manufacture a large number of the same kind, but I don't suppose you would find half a-dozen of this kind in London—the barrel of this is loose, I can shake it; that is how I know it, and it has the Birmingham proof—that is not always usual for foreign pistols; it is not an uncommon thing—the whole of the pistol is made abroad except the stock part—the prisoner came to our place on the Wednesday following the Tuesday—I believe he came on business, and was there for some time—we do business with Mr. Vaughan—it is a well-known house in the gun trade—I saw the information of this pistol there—they have notice when anything is stolen—I believe it was Mr. Vaughan who gave him into custody—I wanted him to tell me where he got it from, but I should have given him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He was sufficiently near the glass to have reached the pistol where he was—it is a peculiar kind of pistol—I could not swear that the stock was made by us, but I believe it was—we have had it two years in stock—the pistols are not moved from the window every night—they are left there.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Williamson—on the 18th of February I saw the prisoner there—it was my duty to examine the revolvers every morning and evening, and clean them when they required it—I identify this one—I saw it last on Tuesday morning, the 18th—I went to the window at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and missed it, it was the largest</p>

               <p>revolver we had, and it had been two years in stock—I gave information to Mr. Williamson and a description of the revolver, and I was afterwards called to Mr. Vaughan's, where I identified the revolver—I saw the prisoner there—he said something about a man had given it to him to get pledged—I had seen the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have seen him at our place several times; he called to see Mr. Brown—I think I went into the office once on the Tuesday when the prisoner was there—he had been in the office a long time before I went in—he was there when I went in—I went out about once previous to missing the revolver—I was not in and out—the pistols were kept in the window—I was in the room when the prisoner went out with Mr. Brown—I had not been told to take any pistols out of the show-case and put them back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the show-room manager—I remember the prisoner coming on the 18th of February, and I took him into Mr. Williamson's office—I had a conversation with him, and left him in the office with Mr. Williamson; he was then standing by the side of the table—he had a bag with him, and he put the bag on the table—I went away for about a minute, and when I came back the prisoner sat on the table, and the bag was on the case opposite the table—the case was close to the window—I saw some pistols shown to the prisoner, and I saw him go away with the bag—after he had gone Gibson gave me information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was the person whom the prisoner went to see—there is a show-case besides the window that is used for firearms also—this pistol came from the window—Mr. Williamson would be sitting between the prisoner and the window, and in order to get to the window he would have to reach over him—he could not pass—the prisoner came on the following day with his daughter—nothing was said to him then.</p>

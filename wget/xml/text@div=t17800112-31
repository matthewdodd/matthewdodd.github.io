            . These are the things I received from Hyams; I put them by themselves; the women's clothes are Mrs. Arnett's; the rest belong to my father; they were in the bottom drawer of the bureau, in the one pair of stairs room; I saw them there that day before the robbery.</p>

               <p>I did not know the name of the building; I did not live far from it; I heard them cry, stop thief! as I came through the alley; I ran and I was knocked down; I kicked the keys before me going along Petty France, Westminster; the person who saw me pick them up is at Portsmouth.</p>

            . When you went out was it before or after day-light? - It was about dusk; it was between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Moore. When you saw this man come out of the house, was it before or after day-light? - It was after daylight; it was dusk, between five and six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was there day-light enough to see the people that came out of the house? - Not to discern the face of any man so as to know it without the assistance of lamps; it was too dark to identify the person of a man.</p>

               <p>I sell bacon for the company at Bristol.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - I have known him fifteen years; he never bore a bad character to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you know him intimately? - Yes; and never knew any bad of him in my life time.</p>
               <p>ANN MAYFIELD sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known the prisoner these three or four years; I never heard any thing bad of his character in my life, he is a biscuit baker; I kept a public house some time ago and he lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Court to Lindsey. What is the value of the things that were taken out of your house? - I reckon them about 42 or 43 s. they were worth above that.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutrix. On the 9th of March I went to bed about half-past nine o'clock at night; there were four lodgers in the house, who were gone to bed. There are three doors, which I bolted myself and fastened the windows, Mrs. Slade unlocked her bedroom door, and found two chests of drawers opened and emptied - I had seen all the property safe in them that day; I found the window half open, and half a pane out of it. This window opens into the back garden - there is a gate which leads into the back garden; the window is five or six yards from the ground - there was no ladder against it. We had a ladder in the garden which had marks of wet on it - it was a rainy day; the ladder was near the shed where it had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120010"></xptr>left - there appeared only one footmark. We found five or six table-cloths, a new cloth, a timepiece, and five or six pair of sheets left behind in the shed.</p>

On the 9th of March I was in my room about six o'clock in the evening - the property was safe then; it was scarcely light. I did not go up again till I went to bed - I was principally in the bar; the bedroom window is exactly over the taproom; we could not see a person in the garden. When I went to bed I missed the property stated in the indictment, and about 11 l. or 12 l. in silver money. I had written the names of the persons of whom I took the notes on them. I have seen my gowns, watches, and notes since.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information which I received, I went to Colebrook, which is about eight miles from Twickenham, on Thursday, the 16th of March, about a week after the robbery, I got there about three o'clock in the afternoon, with Jefferys; we went to a house where I understood Perks lived - I did not see him there, but I saw a woman, whom I understand was his wife.

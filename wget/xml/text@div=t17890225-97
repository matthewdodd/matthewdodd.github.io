               <p>Court. Did he say of the same sort? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you understand by that, that he should have some more on Monday next at market? - Yes, I said, I do not think they are your own property: yes, said he, they are; he began to tremble, I took hold of him by the coat immediately; there was a man behind in the pens said he knew the sheep; we took him to the King's Head, and sent for a constable, and sent the sheep to the Ram to be locked up, and taken care of; I saw them afterwards at the Ram, they were marked in a rundle upon the rump I N; an I in a rundle on the side, and marked on the head and back; I saw them at the Ram in about half an hour after they were carried; I did not see them carried there, I saw the same sheep on the Monday; the prosecutor was at the Ram; he said he knew them to be his property, he described the marks in the market, before he saw them at the Ram, and said he lost six.</p>

               <p>On the 30th of January I was at Smithfield, I saw those sheep, and suspected them to be stolen, I thought I knew them, but could not recollect where; the prisoner said he brought them from Reading in Berkshire; I said it is a small lot to bring so far; he said he had got some more on the road; turning the sheep round I said I knew them, that they were bought at Kingston fair; I asked him who he bought them for; I told him they were sold to a gentleman at Edgeware. I bought them for two gentlemen at Edgeware; they were marked I. N. on the rump with a rundle, and red on the head; I sold none in the fair but what were so marked; the prisoner was committed; I saw those sheep at the Ram afterwards.</p>

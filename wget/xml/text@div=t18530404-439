                  </hi>. I have been blind since 1829. I know the defendant by his having worked for the gentlemen I dealt with eighteen years, and I have dealt with him since—I carry on the business of a matmaker, at No. 1, Red Lion-passage, Red Lion-street, Holborn; the defendant is a ropemaker, in North-street, Limehouse-fields; I have dealt with him about four or five years—in the course of last year there were disputes between us as to the amount I was indebted to him—he claimed an amount from me—I remember his calling on me on the evening of 17th Aug. last, he brought me some goods—he had previously sent me an account or two that were incorrect; I told him that they were so, and I did not owe him anything, I believed he had rather overdrawn the amount, and that he was a little in my debt—on the 17th, when he brought the goods, I said, "Haveyoubrought me a proper account?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Why not bring a proper account with you?" He said to his boy, "Thomas, have you got a bill with you?"—he said, "Yes; I told you 1 bad two bills of Mr. Stone's"—he produced one of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I said, "I don't owe you this or any part of it, I believe"—my wife then went and fetched some receipts which I had by me; they were bills which I had paid Mr. Allen at different times, I believe there were as many as ten or eleven, or more—my wife brought them, and put one into Mr. Allen's hand, and he denied that he had receipted it—I said, "Why, man, you must be mad to say such a thing as that, you don't suppose that I would be guilty of getting any one to receipt it, of course I could not do it myself, because I am blind"—he said, "I did not sign it"—I</p>

Allen, April," (<hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>, I am no scholar, I cannot read)—he read that to me—my wife was present—after he read it to me, he gave the bill to my wife, and said, "That will do"—and I said, "All right, Mr. Allen, hold your hand for the money?" he held his hand, and I put the sovereign into it, and put my hand into my pocket, and took out 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and gave</p>

I know the defendant—in the autumn of last year there were disputes between him and my husband as to the amount that was owing—I recollect his coming there on 17th Aug., and there was an altercation between them respecting the amount of money—I was not in the room the whole of the time—I fetched some papers down to convince Mr. Allen that there were bills that had been paid and receipted—I think there were six or eight papers—I brought them down for them to convince each other which was right and which was wrong; with that T had nothing to do—I told the prisoner that that bill had been paid—that was one which he held in his hand—he told me he had not signed it—I told him he had—my son, Joseph Edridge, was there; he is my son by a former marriage—that was all the part I took in the matter—I afterwards left the room to attend to my business—directly after the prisoner was gone 1 missed the papers, within a very few minutes—I have never seen them since—I was present when the prisoner called again—I cannot say how long that was after 17th Aug.—he said he had called for some money, he wanted some money—my husband said, "Then you will have none of me till I have a right account; bring me a bill of that which I do owe, not of that I don't owe"—Allen said, "Can you show your receipts?"—my husband did not make any answer to that, only told him he should have no more money till he brought a right account; he was sure he owed him nothing if things were made correct—I believe he afterwards called again—my husband was afterwards summoned to the County Court—I heard Allen sworn and examined—I know this bill (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—that is one of the bills that was paid; it was produced at the County Court; that bill was paid in my presence—I know this <hi rend="italic">bill</hi> (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>); it is for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was shown to Allen, and he denied receiving the money, or signing the bill, on his oath; but eventually the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was allowed to my husband—it is in Allen's handwriting, the whole of it—I cannot say that I remember the payment of this 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as there had been various payments—I cannot write, but I can read any writing in the English language—I mean, either written or printed—I know this to be Allen's writing, because he wrote it in my presence—I have seen him write repeatedly, and heard him repeat what he has written; his general way was to sign it, and say to my husband what he had written, and ask him if that would do—I believe these receipts at the back to be Allen's writing—I remember the payment of this 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it being on a particular day—there was no one else in the room but my husband, myself, and Allen—my husband told me I must fetch him some money down stairs—I said, "How much?"—he said, "If you fetch a sovereign that will do, as I have a little silver in my pocket"—I fetched the sovereign, and placed it in my husband's hand, and he held it while Allen signed the bill—I handed the pen and ink to him, and saw him sign the bill—after he had written it he read it to my husband; and he paid him a sovereign, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, the odd penny was to be settled in a pot of beer; that was the way in which it was paid—I am quite positive that on that occasion my husband paid him the money, and that I saw the prisoner write that, and read it after he wrote it—I was present in the County Court—I was not examined; I was there, ready to be examined, and my son also—I do not know how it was that we were not examined, there was no witness called on either side—Allen was called, and put on his oath—there was no person called but Mr. Allen—I cannot say why we were not called—I did not hear any parti<lb></lb>cular</p>

                  </hi>. I am a friend of Mr. Stone's. I went with him to the County Court—his wife and her son were there, ready to be examined—Stone was examined partly—I paid great attention to what passed—Mr. Cheer, the clerk of the Court, stopped the case—he said to Mr. Nuckey "It is no use to go on like that; we shall stop here all night; the Court must decide this;" and he said, "You must pay 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per month"—all that came from Mr. Cheer, the clerk of the Court—the Judge sat there, and made no observation whatever.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who was being examined when Mr. Cheer said, "It is no use going on in this way?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Stone—allow me to say that Mr. Cheer asked whether there were any witnesses for the defence—Mr. Nuckey said "Yes, Mr. Stone's wife, his son-in-law, and another friend," which was myself—Mr. Cheer made no observation then—he asked about the witnesses after he said the Court must stop it.</p>

PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Nuckey was acting for Mr. Stone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he did not insist on the witnesses being examined—I remember the questions put to Allen—I heard him say that the receipt was not in his handwriting, and I heard him deny ever having received the money. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner received a good character.</hi>)</p>

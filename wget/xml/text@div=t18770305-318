I had charge of the prosecution of the prisoner Cohen, at the Worship Street police court, when he was charged with receiving a piano—on the 4th November I went to 4, Minories, which had the appearance of a boot and shoe shop—Cohen was then in custody—I saw a man minding the warehouse I searched the premises and found some bicycles, steam gauges, musical instruments, saddlery, gimlets, cash boxes, frying pans, tin ware, copying presses, gum brushes, an anvil, sewing machines, four sets of harness, three pianos, and some augurs—one piano was at the back, packed in a case, which I opened and found some steam gauges and an invoice, with a list of the contents—I afterwards went to the premises with other officers, named Dedicoat, Finnis, Thompson, and Cliff, some of</p>

               <p>the goods were afterwards removed by their owners, and some by the police—on the 8th I saw Cohen there, who was then on bail—his daughter said "This is an inspector"—he turned and asked me my business—I said I had come to take the invoices and the goods—he said "You will take nothing away. Mr. Besley ad vises that you have acted illegally in taking the pianos away, and if I had been there I should not have allowed it"—Francis' name was not then mentioned in Cohen's presence—on seeing the daughter on a former occasion, I said I would withdraw the men if she would produce the invoices for goods purchased, and she did so—on November 10th I went to 18, John Street, Minories; the name, "J. W." Francis&amp; Co." was on the door—there was an outer and an inner office—on searching I found some iron and copper ware and some papers, which are not evidence—I afterwards went to 12, Wells Street, Cripplegate, and saw the woman Trayford through the wicket in the office; her head only was visible—I asked if Gardner was in—she said "No," and enquired my business—I told her I was sent there by a person upon an account, and "I suppose he has a warehouse here"—she said "Yes"—the name Gardner was on a zinc plate on the outer door, and the word "Factory" on another door—on the 15th I went again with constable Thomas and saw Trayford, who said Gardner was not in, but would be shortly; he had not been there that morning—I watched the premises till 12 o'clock, and then left constable Waller and another officer there and went away—when I came back Gardner was detained by Waller—Waller said to Gardner "Here's the Inspector," and we went in the office—while there, Gardner said "What is it all about, come with me this way" and he took me into a little office—I told him he was charged with conspiring with Francis, to obtain goods; he said "Francis has money to pay for all the goods he has; he has 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>'—I asked how long he had known Francis—he said two years or more—said "Are you sure?"—he said "Let me see, I won't be certain"—he crossed the room, took up a book and appeared to refer to it, and said "I think it will be about fifteen months"—I afterwards examined the book and found all the leaves had been torn out—he was then taken to the station and charged—I went again, Trayford was still there, having been left with other officers—Laurie came in, and said "Good evening," and asked if Gardner was at home—Trayford said "No"—he asked if Gardner was expected that evening—she said she did not know—Laurie then said he would sit down and wait—three other officers were present, Holt, Waller and Thomas—after a while I said to Laurie "What is your business with Mr. Gardner?"—he said "Oh, nothing, I have just called to see him as a friend"—I said "Then you are in the habit of calling on him"—he said "I was here last night and we had a glass together"—I told him we were officers, and should require him to account for his presence on the premises—he said "I will satisfy you very soon," and he took from his pocket a number of memoranda—he said "I am a commission agent and travel for Crowther&amp; Son, soap boilers"—I examined the memo<lb></lb>randa, they were addressed to him by Crowther&amp; Son, one was a complaint of the customers Laurie was introducing to them—it was getting dark and we obtained a candle; I was sitting opposite Laurie who dropped a piece of paper from his pocket-book, which he held in his hand; I asked him what he was doing—he said "Ob, nothing, it is a piece of paper I picked up from the ground"—I took it from him, Laurie said "It is only an advertisement</p>

               <p>relating to starch"—afterwards he said he had not seen Gardiner for some<lb></lb>time, and it was only lately he had discovered where he was—I said "Then you knew him at Commercial Street?"—he said "Yes"—I said "He was trading as Anderson then"—he said "Yes, but people trade under all manner of names"—I asked him if "he knew Francis?"—he said yes, he gave him an order for soap, but knowing what kind of a man he was, he did not deal with him—I told him that he would be taken into custody and charged with conspiring with Gardiner—I have the pocket-book, Francis' name appears in it—Laurie said he had been in business with a man named Wood, but the partnership was dissolved, and he had now no fixed place of business—when I mentioned the charge, Laurie said "I think you are rather premature," and Trayford said "John, a' rent you sorry you came in"—Laurie made no reply; I then told Trayford that she likewise would be taken into custody on the same charge—one of them, I think Trayford, gave me the address 6, New Street, City Road, and I found the keys of that address in a bag which Trayford had at Gardiner's house—I went there on the following day, and found a number of papers relating to Gardiner's transactions, some in the name of Wright, some Anderson, and some Gar<lb></lb>diner—I have given up the papers to Mr. Wontner, among them was an invoice for brandy delivered by Storey&amp; Co., at Well Street—a label was pasted on the door accounting for Gardiner's absence—at New Street, I found these documents marked "Bo" and "Bp," they relate to the brandy from Storey&amp; Co., 46, East Cheap, agents for a company in Paris, to James Anderson &amp;Co., 73, Commercial Street, one amounting to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the other has the same heading, and amounts to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at John Street, I found Br and Bs, By, and Bz, the two last with the name of Johnson on them and addressed to Francis—I also found at New Street Ca, Cb, and Cc, they relate to starch, "Cd" is the paper Laurie dropped—on 6th December, I went with Waller to Capland Street, Lisson Grove, the house occupied by the prisoner Parker—nobody resided on the premises and the key was left at the landlord's house opposite—the name Parker&amp; Son was painted over the door, the windows were browned 3 feet high, and above the colour a few bandboxes and caps were visible—there was no appearance of business being done—I went there first on the 5th, and watched from 3.30 till 8 o'clock, the shop was closed all that time—next day about 6 o'clock, Parker entered by a side door, re<lb></lb>mained about a minute and then left with a bandbox, Waller watched at one end of the street and I the other—afterwards Waller came up with Parker and said This is Parker"—Parker denied at first, but he now admits that he is the man—he opened the door and we went in—I showed Parker the paper marked Bn, which is a memo<lb></lb>randum headed "James Parker and Sons, wholesale and retail hatters," at the end there is "Please note removal from 3, Capland Street, Lisson Grove, established 1859;" it is addressed to Messrs. Barman and Son, Huntingdon, and states that Messrs. Francis and Co. were customers of theirs, and they considered them safe for a reasonable amount, their account with them being 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, and they had always found them prompt in payment—it also stated "We are making up our Christmas stock of son-westers and water-proofs, and shall be glad to receive samples of same"—I showed him this document and he said "Yes that is my writing, Francis and I had some dealings, and I gave him that reference"—I then produced the printed paper marked Bn, which is a memorandum from Buxton, Abbott, and Co., mer<lb></lb>chants</p>

In reply, we have to say Messrs. Francis and Co. have for some time done business with us satisfactorily, having always been prompt in keeping faith, and we do not hesitate in saying you are safe in doing business with them, certainly to the extent you name. Yours faithfully, Buxton, Abbott, and Co."—Parker said "That is my writing, but I wrote it as the clerk of Buxton and Co.—I then searched the premises and found a number of crates with paper outside so as to make them appear to be packed full, but they were empty—I also found a large number of empty hat boxes and about three dozen hats—Parker was taken to the station and charged—he refused his address, stating he did not wish to compromise his son—on December 15th I went with Detective Holt to 16, Water Lane, Eastcheap—there were several offices, and on the third floor the name Jackson and Co. was painted on the glass on the door of an office—I entered and saw Jackson—I said "Are you Jackson?"—he said "Yes"—I said "You obtained some soap from from Messrs. Crowther and Sons"—he said "Yes," they have put in an execution and that is all done with"—I said "You are reference for Buxton, Abbott, and Co."—he said "No, I know people who have used my name, but without my authority," and that he never gave them a reference—I told him he would be taken into custody and charged with conspiring to obtain soap—he said "Very well"—I then examined the papers lying about—a man named Mootham then came in and said "Good morning" to Jackson, and sat down—I asked him his business with Jackson—he said he merely called as a friend—I said "Then we can dispense with you"—he stood up and was about to leave when Jackson said "There is a letter-book of yours there, you may as well take it with you," and produced this book—I said I should search it, and did so—it is a letter-book of Mellor, Green, and Co., and I found some papers relating to trans-actions with that firm—I asked Mootham if he belonged to that firm—he said "No, and there is nothing in the office belonging to me but a shirt, that is not my book"—Jackson then said "I want him to take it to a friend to whom it belongs"—I took Mootham into custody—Batson then came in and said "Good morning" to Jackson and walked into the office—I asked him his name and business—he said "Batson; I sometimes sell goods for Jackson on commission"—I said "Do you know Taylor, a shirt dresser, Old Street Road 1"—he said "Yes,"—I said "Do you trade as Batson and Co, Iron Bridge Wharf, and Buxton, Abbott, and Co., Hop Exchange"—he said "No"—I then showed him some letter paper, headed Mellor, Green and Co., and' asked if he knew them—he said "No"—I said I felt satisfied he was Buxton, and took him into custody for conspiring with Francis to obtain goods from Pinson and Evans, of Wolverhampton—I do not remember whether he replied—I left Holt in charge and went away for assistance—on returning I noticed some torn up papers in the grate, and Batson was standing with his back to the fire—I said "You have been tearing up these papers while I was away"—he said "No, I have not"—I then examined his books and found some paper correspondiug with the pieces—this marked Dg is from Oliver Lodge to Jackson and Co., asking for the address of Francis and Co., formerly of 18, John Street, Minories—Dq is addressed to Francis&amp; Co., asking for the payment of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I also found the papers marked Dr to Dz; Dx and Dy are pawn tickets, I one in the name of Mellor, Green, and Co., and the other of John Oates—</p>

               <p>Dx is pledged with John Eltham, Bishopsgate Street, and Dy with John A. Russell, Fore Street—Dz is a writ against Jackson by one Carver—I also found Ea to Ef 5; two are pass-books, one of Jackson and Co. with the Aldgate Branch of the City Bank, in which appear the names of Batson, and Mootham, the other was that of R. Jackson, with the London Provident I Bank, and contained the names of Laurie, Hudson, Jackson, Prendergast—I I know Parker's handwriting—Eq is in the same hand—Dw is a printed label from W. Chapel's Botany Works, Botany House, Ashton-under-Lyne—I on the evening of the day Jackson was apprehended I went to Bow Lane I police-station with Butters, the office-keeper of Gracechurch Street, and saw Jackson and Batson in the cells—Butters identified Jackson as the man who I had taken offices as J. D. Mellor, and Batson as the man who called himself Green—Jackson said nothing—Batson said "Mind, I did not tell you that I I did not know them," meaning Mellor, Green and Co., "but that I had no I business with them"—I said "You denied all knowledge of them"—in consequence of something I found amongst the papers at Water Lane, I went to Ord's house in 2, Queen Elizabeth Street, Tooley Street, on the 22nd December—I saw a woman—I asked if Mr. Ord was at home—the woman said "No," and enquired my business—I asked if Ord would be in during the day—she said he might be; and I said I would call again, and I went I again with Waller—Waller called, and I waited near, and in consequence of what he said when he returned I went to the house with Waller and Holt—I saw the prisoner Moore—I passed into the work-room, and asked, in Moore's presence, if Ord was in; the woman said "No"—I said I would I call in the morning—I asked Moore if he was Ord—he said "No; my name is Moore"—I said "Are you connected with the business?"—he said "No"—I asked him his business there, and his address—he said he lived at Shakespeare House, Forest Hill, and that he had merely stopped there the night previously, and that he had been minding the house in the place of Mrs. Ord—I said we would go to his house—he said "Nobody lives there now, the place is closed"—I asked him again if he was connected with Ord—he said "I sometimes assist him in his business"—the woman then said "What is your business with Mr. Ord?" and, pointing to the doer, "No admittance is marked on the door, and you have no business to be here"—I said "I have called on behalf of a man named Lodge, who sold goods to a man named Francis in the Minories. Mr. Ord was reference for Francis, and as Mr. Lodge had received no payment he looks to Mr. Ord for payment"—she said "Could not Mr. Lodge have written?"—I said "He has done so already"—she said "Well Mr. Ord is not here"—I then said "We will wait till he does come"—the prisoner Ord then came down-stairs and said "What is all this about? come with me, and let us not have any bother about it," and he took me into his office—Moore went in also—I said "You gave a reference to a man named Francis, by means of which he obtained goods from Oliver Lodge"—he said "Yes, I think I did, Francis had some business with me, and he now is indebted to me to the amount of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "You are also a reference for obtaining goods from McDonald and Co., of Birmingham"—he said "I do not remember that I was"—I then shewed him the reference in favour of A. R. Welham, and asked him if it was in his handwriting—he said "No"—I then said "Is it Moore's, the name resembles his?"—he considered for a time, and then said "1 don't think it is"—I then handed it to Moore, and said "Is it yours?"—Moore looked at it a short time and said "No; it is not"—I then told</p>

               <p>Ord that he would be apprehended on the charge of conspiring with Francis to obtain goods from Oliver Lodge, and also from McDonald—I then pro<lb></lb>ceeded to examine the papers, and found some envelopes addressed to W. Moore, 17, Wells Street; I also found the day-book produced, which is lettered Hg, and shows transactions between Holmes and Co. and Francis and Co. with Ord—I also found on Moore the list of articles marked Ho and Ho 1 to 3, which consists of pieces of paper—I know Fenn, the carrier—he employs four men, named Driscoll, O'Brian, Relton, and Robinson—in consequence of what I heard from one of them, I went, on 6th of January, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, to 9 and 10, Wellington Road, Holloway—one is a private house, and the other is an office and a warehouse—I entered the premises and saw a man who said he was Burden—I asked him if he knew Francis, who had an office in the Minories—he said "Yes, he was introduced to me by a friend of mine, a respectable man"—I said. "What is your friend's name?"—he said "Gentles; he was at one time in my employment as traveller"—I said "Do you know where "he can be found now?"—he said "No, I have not seen him for some time"—I said "You had some trans<lb></lb>actions with Francis?"—he said "Yes, I bought some borax"—I said "Anything else?"—he said "No, nothing that I can remember now"—I said "Perhaps if you refer to your books you will be able to see"—he said "I have no entry of anything I purchased from him"—afterwards he said "Let me see, Francis told me that he was removing from his premises in John Street, and he wanted to leave some goods somewhere till he could find another place; he left them with me and I afterwards lent him 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them"—on asking what they were, he said some shovels and some things in cases that he had not opened and which were over his stables—I asked him if he had any document showing that transaction, and he said he did not think he had or that he could not find it, I am not positive which—I then said "I know a number of goods have been delivered to you, have not you got any receipts and papers relating to them?"—he searched his desk and handed me the paper Ja—it is all manuscript and says "18, John Street, Minories, City. Messrs. Burden and Son. Received 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of goods delivered"—then there is a list—I took up one of his printed memoranda which was lying on the desk; it is this: "J. W. Burden and Son, dealers and oilmen, 9 and 10, Wellington Street, Holloway"—having seen bicycles mentioned in the list spoken to I said "Surely bicycles do not come under grocer's sundries"—he said "I would buy anything"—at my request he then produced the two other invoices marked Ja 2 and Ja 3, and two others were found further down on the file—they all relate to purchases from Francis and Gentles—I then asked if he had the goods in his possession which were doposited on the loan—he said "I have sold the bicycles"—he had made no entry of the sale and could not give the name of the buyer, but he thought his name was Meyer—he said Francis told him if he did not get the money he might sell some of the goods—I said "You have seen the account about Francis in the papers; how is it you did not let the police know these goods were in your possession?"—he said yes, but he did not think it was any part of his business—he said he did not know where Francis or Gentles was—I found the pass-book produced at Burden's. (<hi rend="italic">This contained an entry on</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st November, "Francis</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>") I pointed out the date of the entry and reminded Burden that a report of Francis'</p>

               <p>case appeared a week before—I also noticed more than a dozen taps on the mantel-piece marked DMD, and asked him about them—he said "I think I bought them of Gentles"—I then went to the stables in Victoria Street, and found under a quantity of hay, forty-eight bundles of coal shovels, and six cases, five of them being closed and one partly open—I afterwards found them to contain waterproof composition—on seeing the boxes at first I remarked to Holt in the prisoner Warren's presence "Perhaps some of old Jones' composition is here," and Burden said none was there—there were cards on the boxes and I asked to look at one, and I did look—"Yes," he said, "Francis advertised this composition in the 'Grocer'"—I said "I thought you told me you did not know the contents of the cases'?"—I do not remember his reply—I went to some other stables and found several gross of brass screws in opened packages and four gross of toy pails, and in a case not then opened I found a patent screw making machine with the name "J. Shine," and an address in Paris on it—Mr. Shine had previously written to me that he had lost one—the invoice Ja relates to the toy pails—I had previously remarked it was strange he should lend money on cases if he did not know the contents, and he replied "I thought there was enough for my money in them"—at the office of Buxton, Abbott, and Co. I found several cards—one has on it "E. Kemp and Co., 3, Adelaide Place, London Bridge," another "Jackson and Co., Holloway Road," another "Frederick Ransom, of Ransom's Bank," and others—Mr. Shine identified his screw machine in my presence, and Mr. Jones, of Gloucester, has identified his composition.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Longport, Staffordshire, and am a merchant—on 1st October I received a letter dated 30th September, and marked Dn 1, from Francis and Co., and sent a sample—I afterwards received another letter, marked Dgh 1, and dated 27th October, containing an order—I had a letter with two references, Ord and Co., white lead, paint, and colour works, 9, Queen Elizabeth Street, Tooley Street, and Jackson and Co., 16, Water Lane—I applied to Jackson by letter, through Mr. Thomas Salmon, and in answer to my application to Messrs. Ord and Co: I received the following: "We have done business with Messrs. J. Francis and Co. for some two years, and have always found them prompt in meeting their engagements with us, and we would not hesitate to credit them to the extent of from 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—in consequence of these replies I supplied goods to the amount of 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but received not a farthing in payment—it was agreed to be paid in a month, and at the end of that time I made inquiries and found Francis and Co. had disappeared—then I wrote to the reference and got this reply from Jackson "I neither know you nor Francis'—the answer from Ord and Co., marked Gn, was "I do not know the present whereabouts of Francis and Co."—it was through the reference and believing the goods were wanted for his trade that I supplied them—I sent 1 ton 1 qr. 9 lbs. refined borax, in three casks of 7 cwt. each, to Canon Wharf, Lower East Smithfield—I sent a delivery order and they came to Carron Wharf to my order—I have not seen any of it since.</p>

Francis and Co., but knew the firm, and from what they knew of them, if they gave an order to the extent of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they certainly should let them have the goods—I reported to the person who asked me to make the inquiries.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Crowther and Son, soap-boilers, Liversedge, Yorkshire—we advertised for a London agent for our business last year, and received a reply from Messrs. Laurie and Wood—on 9th February, 1876, we received the letter marked Ce from Mr. Wood, of 24, New Broad Street: "To Messrs. Crowther and Sons. I am calling on all the first-class oilmen's shops and stores; if your prices are low I could do a first-class and safe trade for you"—that is signed "John Laurie"—we replied to that—subsequently we received this: "London, 29th February. Dear sir,—Replying to your letter of 24th January, I beg to say, at Mr. Laurie's request that I should reply on his behalf, as he has been laid up by a serious illness for seven weeks, that as we are jointly interested in calling on grocers, &amp;, I should like to know whether you are still open to appoint an agent and allow the usual commission. Yours obediently, William A. Wood"—we subsequently appointed Wood and Co. as our agents, and corresponded with them—they changed their name from Laurie and Wood, to Wood, Laurie and Co., then to Wood and Co., and then to Snelgar, Wood, and Co.; they also changed their place of business from 24, New Broad Street, to 69, Leadenhall Street—we supplied them with goods altogether to between 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has gone to the dogs—on coming to London I called at Broad Street, also at Leadenhall Street, and discussed business with Wood and Laurie—on the 26th May I received Ch from Anderson and Co., of 73, Commercial Street: "Gentlemen,—Yours of the 24th to hand. We are surprised at your asking payment prior to delivery. We do not make your goods a specialty"—that was in reply to our letter to Anderson and Co. in cones<lb></lb>quence of what we had heard from Wood and Co.—we also received Fg from Ralph Victor and Co., of Aldersgate Street: "We beg to confirm our letter and order of the 6th inst., and shall feel obliged if you will at once supply the goods."—We also received Ci and Cj from the same persons we did not supply Ralph Victor and Co. with goods—in September I received Ck and Cl from Gardner and Co., of 12, Well Street, Cripplegate-one is an application for a price-list—we sent a price-list, and afterwards received an order for 10 cwt. each, of domestic and brown soap, with a reference which I have not got—we did not execute that—we also received an order from Francis and Co., of John Street, Minories, which is not here—we did not execute that—the letter Fr came from Wood, Laurie, and Co., after we had received an order from Jackson and Co., and is headed 69, Leadenhall Street: "We have seen Mr. Jackson, who has agreed to take his order this time in firkins, you will therefore send them 25 firkins as soon as possible. We have many orders, but the present stock is going off slowly. On account of the dulness of trade we cannot now give you further orders; but, as business is looking up, we hope to do so"—we supplied that order to Jackson and Co., of 16, Water Lane—the amount is 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—we were never paid—I saw Jackson about it two or three times—we put the matter in the hands of our solicitors—I saw Jackson talking to Wood when I was speaking to Laurie in Leadenhall Street—we did not supply any soap to Prendergast and Co.—we had an order from them through Wood and</p>

I know this firm to be safe, and will pay you at maturity, but you must send it on at once"—the firm is Mellor, Green, and Co., of Gracechurch Street Buildings—the reference was to Messrs. Law Brothers, of 110, Cannon Street—we communicated with them, and got Fv, in these terms: "In reply to your inquiry as to Messrs. Mellor, Green and Co., you may safely credit them to the amount of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as we believe them to be respectable people"—I went with Laurie to 16, Water Lane, but I forget when, to see Jackson—I saw him, but do not recollect the conversation—that was after we supplied him with goods—about June or July I went to Wood's office in Leadenhall Street, and met Wood and Laurie at the door—I caught a glimpse of seven or eight others, Gardner amongst the rest—I am not sure whether Jackson was there—instead of letting me pass in as I had done before, they kept me on the stairs for a few minutes, and then they went—I saw the almanack produced with the name of Prendergast and Co. at Jackson's premises, 16, Water Lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been manager of the Aldgate branch of the City Bank since May, 1876—I know Cohen, he has an account there—Francis and Co., of 18, John Street, were also customers—they were intro<lb></lb>luced by a customer of our head office in August, 1876—Cohen's reference was from the National Provincial Bank, and a gentleman who had known aim for twenty years and gave him an excellent character, and who intro-Qced him personally—Cohen made inquiries about Francis and Co. at our and—the cheques produced signed by Cohen in favour of Francis, Aarons, and Hart, were duly paid and entered—this is Maurice Cohen's pass-book, 11 the entries are there—the dates referring to the pianos are 22nd Sep<lb></lb>tember, 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and then there is 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the cheques are made payable to art—I have noticed the working of Cohen's business account, which oppeared to be a proper legitimate trading account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never saw Hart and do not know him—the cheques ere paid in gold—Francis' account was only a small matter, amounting to rout 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and existed only for a short time—my answer to inquiries about rancis was that we knew nothing of his means, but that he was respectably introduced—I knew of the charges against Cohen; I went to see Mrs. Hardy out it—I did not tell her that if she did not prosecute, the money would paid—I went to Mrs. Gautier's twice—I did not tell her if she did not prosecute, the money would be paid—I told Mr. Oliver that he was a straight<lb></lb>forward, honourable man, and would allow no one to suffer through his in<lb></lb>discretion—I said nothing about expenses—15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not mentioned—I saw Oliver at Mr. Beard's office—I referred these people to a respectable solicitor, in order that they might act wisely with respect to Cohen, whom I believe to be innocent—T do not remember Mr. Mullen's name being men<lb></lb>tioned—I do not think I said "I would not go to him, he is not a criminal oyer, go to Thomas Beard, of Basinghall Street;"—other persons were pre<lb></lb>ment; I do not remember that being said in my presence; I would not con<lb></lb>diet anyone who stated that it was said—a Mr. Danziger was with me—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187703050112"></xptr>
               <p>I did not say to Mr. Oliver in his presence "This young mail can deposit 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me and you can have it from me when the case is over"—the in<lb></lb>terview with Mr. Beard took place before I arrived—Mr. Beard, junior, saw me afterwards and said that he had advised the parties what to do—I did say I hoped Mrs. Hardy would see her way clear to withdraw from the prosecution of an innocent man—I cannot say if Mr. Danziger was present—I did not tell Danziger to give three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes to Mr. Oliver to give to Mrs. Hardy when the case was over—I went to Worship Street, but I do not recollect when, as I did not attend all the examinations—I did not tell Mr. Oliver at the police-court that the money would be all right—I went to Mrs. Gautier, once in the day time and once at night, to induce her not to prosecute—I did not say "We do not want you to do this for nothing, "not "Of course, you have had a lot of trouble and anxiety about the matter, but we will pay you all expenses and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the price of your piano," nor anything to that effect—I do not remember using such an expression—I should contradict anyone who said that I did—the charges of the Continental Company were referred to, but I did not say to Mrs. Gautier "Yours is the only case, we have settled with the Continental Company, and they won't prosecute;" I do not recollect anything of the kind—Miss Cohen was with me, on one visit to Mrs. Gautier, I think the first—I urged Mrs. Gautier to refer to her husband, she was not the presecutor—she might have said "How about Mrs. Hardy?" but I do not recollect replying "Oh, she is all right, we have seen her, and she will apply to with<lb></lb>draw in the morning"—I told Mrs. Gautier that Mrs. Hardy had said that she was desirous of withdrawing on the account of the respectability of Cohen—she or her daughters expressed sympathy with Mr. Cohen—there were two ladies in the room.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. I might have seen Mrs. Gautier again at the police-court—I might have said to her that there was no occasion for her husband to prosecute this man, because I thought so—I do not say I did—I do not know the exact point of the case where the Treasury took it up—I do not think I knew at the time I made that statement that the prosecution bad been taken up by the Treasury—I do not remember when I made use of the remark which I might have made use of—I did not know at that time that Mr. Bushby, the Magistrate, had refused to allow the case to be withdrawn—I might have done so—I was present in Court when Mr. Wontner appeared for the Treasury, once I believe—I do not remember saying to Mrs. Gautier "Have you seen any of the police? if you bare not had your subpoena you need not appear"—I might have—I did not say "We will pay for your piano, and pay for your expenses, and your lawyer'—I said that no man would suffer loss through any improper or unwise conduct on the part of Cohen in purchasing from these thieves, he was too honourable a man to allow them to suffer—that was certainly said with a view to induce them not to prosecute—I believe Mr. Cohen would have paid for the pianos twenty times over rather than let a poor woman suffer like Mrs. Hardy, I know I would myself—I knew from the beginning that the police were in possession of Cohen's premises—I said what I believed, that Cohen would not allow Mrs. Gautier to suffer from any imprudence he had committed, not crime—I very likely said "You will not lose anything by it—I believed it if I did not say so—I very likely said "Mr. Cohen is shipper, and ships a good many pianos, and he would probably want one or two in a week, and it would be a very good thing indeed for you—I</p>

               <p>thought so if I did not say so; I meant that I should not be surprised if Cohen gave Gautier a large order—I never offered money to anyone to settle the case, or offered to put the money in someone else's hands until the case was over—I said nothing of the kind, upon my oath—I did not say so to the best of my recollection—Mr. Gautier was not in when I called and I waited some time; I think he came in; I think I left Mr. Danziger there—he saw Mr. Gautier if I recollect—I have gone into the matter with Mr. Gautier and told him what I thought of it—I saw him in a neighbouring court several times while the case was before the Magistrate—I should think I said to him words to the effect that Cohen was a respectable man and suggested that he should withdraw from the charge—I did not say that the Anglo-Continental Company had with-irawn, and that he would be left alone in the case if Mrs. Hardy withdrew—the first part is right—I will" swear I have no recollection of saying that he would be left alone in the case, and that it would cost a lot of money, bat they would get the case remanded week after week, and he had better withdraw—I don't recollect saying anything like that—I know I suggested to withdraw from the case on account of the respectability of the man—I very likely said "As soon as Mr. Cohen gets out of this, he will certainly business with you and recommend you to his friends or other persons and merchants"—.I believe Miss Cohen had made use of a remark which I adorsed, on that subject—I don't recollect making any second communi<lb></lb>'tion to Mr. Gautier on the subject of his applying to withdraw from the prosecution—I heard one application made, and Mr. Bushby said he would not allow it to be withdrawn, after an intimation that the Treasury were being, to take the matter in hand—I am not positive, I may have heard or not—I do not recollect asking Mr. Gautier after that to renew his application to withdraw, and telling him that no one else would be there Mrs. Hardy was not coming—I do not recollect saying anything of the kind at the period you refer to, or at any subsequent period; you are mixing up the various times—I don't believe I said so after I knew that he Magistrate would not allow the case to be withdrawn—I think the general point of my conversation might be this: once or twice or thrice I spoke to Mr. Gautier and his wife as to the respectability of this man, and their duty of withdrawing, looking at the facts, not in a policeman's point view, but with the view of a man of business—I had no authority to take any offer of money—my remarks were remarks of a generous nature wards a man in trouble—I might have made this statement to Gautier I knew that the Magistrate had said that the case should not be with<lb></lb>in and the Treasury had taken it up, but I do not recollect—Callaghan called at the bank on several occasions in reference to the que drawn by Francis in favour of Dedicoat—I wrote a note to Callaghan asking him to call and see me at the bank, and he called next filing—I might have said to him "You must, of course, do your duty, do not press him more than you can help," or words to that effect—I wed to Mr. Cohen's innocence according to my judgment—I very likely "There are plenty of people like Cohen who buy goods without asking questions, and he has done nothing more than others do every day"—deputy was in the room when we discussed the matter—I was never at Minories with a pencil and note book—I never made a memorandum in section with this matter of any sort—I was not ticking off the goods as were taken away—I went with the accountants on business to average</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187703050114"></xptr>
               <p>financial matters, and documents and other matters were presented to me purely financial matters—I had nothing to do with the goods taken away under the search warrants—I was not ticking them off as they were taken away—I was taking an account of certain transactions in leather, Cohen's property, that was about to be sold—I saw the police taking the goods under the search warrant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I knew Cohen had to meet bills to large amounts—he had to use a considerable sum for that purpose, and it was necessary to realise a considerable quantity of his stock—I was present on some of these occa<lb></lb>sions inspecting the stock <hi rend="italic">so to</hi> be sold—the police were in charge of the place at the time—the goods were taken away, sold, and the money paid—there were other financial matters in connection with ourselves that had to be discussed when this matter first cropped up with reference to these pianos—I enquired into it with the family, and then it came to my know<lb></lb>ledge that he had bought the pianos of a man named Hart, and that he paid those two cheques through the bank—the cheques were cashed over the counter—with reference to Mrs. Gautier's piano, it is in the hands of the police—he never paid for it—Hart never had it—it was sent to his place, and in consequence of that he was taken into custody—Mrs. Hardy's piano was also taken to his place, and subsequently taken away—I know this from hearing the evidence at the various examinations—after having heard it, I went on one occasion to Mrs. Gautier's and stated what I hew of Cohen—I had come to the conviction that he was an innocent man in the matter, and suggested to them that they should not proceed with it—I think I was in Court when Mr. Wontner made an intimation that the Treasury had taken up this matter—I do not recollect whether at that time there was an examination of a certain number of these prisoners going on at the Mansion House—I saw Cohen at the Worship Street police-court, and afterwards at the Mansion House—I believe an intimation was made to Mr. Bushby, and upon that statement Mr. Bushby said the matter must go on—I have' not the least interest in this matter except loss of time and money—the prisoner has only one creditor—his account was one I dis<lb></lb>counted bills for—when first apprehended he owed me money—there were a considerable number of bills, but we held valuable securities—we held the deed of the house in which he lived—I have since examined into ha affairs myself on behalf of the family; they are perfectly straight in every way—I have never been to the Anglo-Continental Piano Company when I went to Mrs. Gautier I put before them all the facts I knew in connection with the matter—I knew that two cheques in favour of Hart had been cashed from our bank—I have never seen the invoices.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright at Hannibal Road, Stepney—I have been there five years, and have known Cohen between five and six years—I remember his speaking to me about bicycles some time in the autumn of last year—he told me he had got one for a sample in his place, would I come and value them?—there were three of them—then he called for me, and brought me up in his cart—there was one in a case—he asked me the value, and said the other two were like them—I told him that, considering the bad season was coming on, the three were not worth more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I should not like to give more than that for them—according to my judgment that was a fair price for them, considering the time of year, and that he had to get rid of them as best he could—he asked me if I thought they would do in Australia—I told him I thought they would—I know he has</p>

               <p>for some time been shipping goods to Australia—I knew a man named Aarons, he lived opposite my gateway for about twelve months—I recollect Cohen coming to me about harness—he asked me if I knew anybody likely to buy it—I suggested Aarons—he never tried to sell it to me—that was some time in September I think—I had not heard of the trial of Aarons, Francis, and Solomons, or that Aarons had been convicted.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper of Coleman-street Ward - about nine o'clock in the evening of the 9th of January, I called at Mr. Phillips's house - I saw the prisoner there - she answered the door - I knew her to be Mr. Phillip's <rs id="t18340220-157-deflabel912" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You went with the beadle and constable to Mr. Phillips about nine o'clock in the evening? A. Yes; I went with the parish authorities - she said she had been poorly, and she looked worse than ever I had seen her before - she said she was better - I had seen Mrs. Cox some months before that time, but never had any communication with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend with a surgeon and have the prisoner examined? A. It was done at my house by her own request - she had the offer to go to the infirmary and the Compter, or to my house, and wished to go to my house to be examined - I sent for Mr. Culverwell, and he came - he is not here - I went there with a view of bringing Mr. Phillips before the Lord Mayor, but she answered the door herself, and I questioned her - Mr. Phillips has been indicted, and the grand jury threw out the bill - I do not know what was the charge against him - I went to her the night I heard of it - I saw the box, but did not see a cap on the child's head then - I cannot say what was on it when it was found.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many children have you had? A. Nine - I never attended any friend in her lying-in - I never suspected in the least that the prisoner was with child before that time; but where I lived all the people in the neighbourhood suspected she was - I believe none of them knew it - it was talked about the neighbourhood; it was suspected by many people - I had not the slightest reason to believe that she was with child before I performed this office for her in the privy, because I always took her part, and said it was not so - I went to Blue Hart-court with her for a bricklayer, where she was sent by Mr. Phillips, the same day before she was taken ill - nothing happened on the road there or back; but she said to me as she went along, that she was not willing for me to go with her; but I said I should; she made a stop in the alley, and seemed as if she was poorly - she said she felt herself very poorly, and she had been so for many days - I accompanied her to the bricklayer's, that was, going to the bricklayer's - she said, "Shall I go so and so, and order something to drink" - I said "No; I shall go with you" - she told me to stop and not go with her - I said, "I shall go with you" - I did not like to leave her in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not you expect her to be confined in the street? A. No; I did not - I went with her, came back again, and we had the drink - I did not wish to go into a wine-vaults by myself, she did not make any objection to my going; but she said, "You do so and so;" but I said,"I shall go with you" - I did not go with her to help her in case she was taken ill in the street - I have been in custody myself - I am not aware of anything particular happening to her in the court; she stopped and looked round, but said nothing, and I said nothing - I never suspected her to be in the family way, for she said, it was quite a different thing that was the matter with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have asked her about it then? A. No; I said to her, "If you are an innocent woman stand your ground;" but I never suspected her - when she made the stand in the court, I saw no water - I did not look - she said she was ill - I did not know what was the matter with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200095"></xptr>her - I was taken into custody as an accessary to the concealment of the child in the box, and remained in gaol from the Wednesday afternoon until the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came into the kitchen, was there any blood there? A. Yes; I washed it up, then went up stairs - there was blood all the way up stairs - I washed that up - I found the substance in the pail, and had heard the conversation with the neighbours, that they thought she was with child, but I never suspected she was with child - I did not poke the substance down the privy with a stick - I pulled the handle up - the water filled the pail up the first time - there was nothing in the pail the last time, and the first time there was water in it - I cannot say whether there was blood in it - I washed up the blood on the floor and stairs - the pail leaked water only - I cannot swear there was not blood with it.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, was not blood and water running down the stairs from the pail, to the spot where Mr. Phillips called you? A. I cannot say - it did not look like blood at all - I have said there was blood on the stairs, in the bed-room, and in the kitchen; and the after-birth was in the pail - but, I declare, I did not suspect she was with child.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Not when you saw the contents of the pail? A. Yes; then I did, but not before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take away the box? A. No; I never saw the box or the child in my life - I was before two different coroners on the inquest on the child - I did not give a different account before one of the coroners to what I gave before the other - as near as possible, I stated everything to my knowledge - I was not asked as to the date on which she said she had had a child.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on this day, when she did not want you to go with her, and she was taken ill in the alley, did she tell you she was so ill, and she hoped you would come in the evening? A. No; I did not tell her I would come in the evening - Mr. Phillips came for me - I had not promised to go - she never put the question to me.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. Had not the prisoner stated to you that she was not in the family-way? A. Yes; it was in reference to that statement, that I said to her, "If you are an innocent woman, stand your ground" - she had said so to her mother - I was kept in custody for the purpose of giving evidence.</p>

I am matron of the Compter - on Sunday morning, the 12th of January, in consequence of my hearing the prisoner wished to see me, I had her called into my room - she said she wished to relieve her mind respecting the charge she was brought in for - I neither threatened nor made her any promise - she said that during the time she was in service she was pregnant; and on Friday, the 3d of January, she was taken very ill, and could not do her domestic work - her master seeing she was ill, asked what was the matter with her - she said she had violent pains in her limbs from cold - he recommended a warm bath, which she declined, and wished to have a woman to do her work, and named Mrs. Cox, being an honest woman; that he went to fetch Mrs. Cox, and directly after he was gone the child was born - she heard a slight noise, but not a cry - she found it attached to her by something, which she pulled from herself - she was flurried, and took it in her apron, and laid it on the bed - she found her pains as bad as ever; and the afterbirth came from her - she put that into the slop-pail - Mrs. Cox came soon after, took the slop-pail, and emptied it down the water-closet - that she had no opportunity of doing anything to the child till the Sunday following, when she washed it, and put it in the box, which was too short for it; and she turned its legs up - that she then told Mrs. Cox she was very uneasy, and wished the child to be interred - she saw some men at work in the church-yard opposite, who, she thought, would bury it for her, which she named to Mrs. Cox, who took it away, and got it buried for her - she did not say where the child had been placed, until she desired Mrs. Cox to bury it - she gave no further account of the child.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not she state that the child was dead when she took it up from the floor? A. Yes; there was a letter intercepted from her at the Compter - it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200096"></xptr>not addressed to Mr. Phillips, her master, but to another Mr. Phillips (relating that the father of the child's name was Franks) - when she heard Mr. Phillips was in custody, she was very much agitated to think he was in custody, as he knew no more than the babe itself, and she wrote to his brother - she said she told Mrs. Cox the child was in the room, and Mrs. Cox told her for God's sake not to say the child was in the room.(Mr. CLARKSON addressed the Court and Jury on behalf of the prisoner.)</p>

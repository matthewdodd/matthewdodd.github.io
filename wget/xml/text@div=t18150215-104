               <p>SAMUEL MILLER. I am an officer. On Wednesday, the 15th of February, I met the prisoner in Church-lane, Whitechapel, he had two pots of paint; these are them; they were tied up in this apron.</p>
               <p>COURT. You can go into only one taking - A. I asked him what he had got there; I stopped him, and afterwards went to his house; there I found a stone bottle, and two wooden casks; I went to Mr. Parkin first with the paint. Mr. Parkin went with me to his house; Mr. Parkin claimed the casks and stone bottle. The prisoner said, he had bought the casks of a man he did not know, the stone bottle Mr. Parkin's young man had given it him, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150044"></xptr>paint he had had upwards of two years, that he had a horse and cart, and that he had worked at the Circus, he had left the paint in the cart, instead of delivering it at the Circus.</p>

            . I am a oil and colourman, in Whitechapel, High-street. The prisoner formerly had been my servant. This took place on the Wednesday; I had discharged him on the Friday before, he never had been in my service after; he had only been with me two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of his keeping a horse and a cart - A. I never heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, supposing oil to have been in that paint, could it be in the state that was found - A. No, it would have dried up. The officer, Miller, brought the paint to me. I went with him to the Police office, and then to the prisoner's house; there I found two oil casks, and several other articles, which I could not exactly identify. The brown paint has my young man's mark upon it; I know that to be mine; I was present when he marked it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Parkin was taking stock in the colour room; his foreman said this is a damaged bottle, he told me to go and break it; instead of breaking it, I put it on the dunghill; the next morning, I said to 
               <persName id="t18150215-104-person882">John</persName>
             I will take the bottle with me; I saw it would suit my purpose; I put a patch of pitch upon it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The bottle is not faulty; I could use it.</p>
               <p>JURY. The bottle is faulty.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is my young man's mark upon the brown paint; I can swear to that.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>When? - It was some time in the month of April. I went to her lodgings about ten o'clock. I had been there a few days before; I was upon the bed with her; I fell asleep; when I waked I missed my watch and buckles.</p>
               <p>Was that the next morning? - No, it was three or four hours after I went in. I heard the watchman cry past one o'clock; I got up and acquainted the watchman that I had lost my watch and buckles.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober when you laid down? - I was neither drunk nor sober; I had been drinking a little.</p>
               <p>Was there any light in the room? - No, it was on the ground floor. When I waked the prisoner was gone. I went out into the street and called the watchmen and told them I had been robbed; they showed me to the guard-house. The constable said be thought he could find the prisoner and get my property again. The prisoner was taken the next morning; I was not present when she was taken. She sent a woman to me in the morning to let me know she was willing to resign the things.</p>
               <p>Was that before she was taken? - I cannot say whether it was before or after.</p>
               <p>Is that woman here? - No, she was quite a stranger to me. I laid down with the prisoner one night before; she behaved very civil to me as any woman could do.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Thursday the 9th of April, being constable of the night, Moore came to me and told me he was robbed. I found the prisoner the next morning about eight o'clock in a room in Newtoner's-lane, up two-pair-of-stairs.</p>
               <p>How came you to look for her there? - In consequence of an information from the woman with whom she lodged. There were two other women in bed with her; she gave me the watch out of bed; the seals were taken off; another woman gave me the seals. I asked the prisoner how she came to do such a thing. She said a landlady of her's blamed her because she had not robbed the man before.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose house it is in which she lodges? - It is a house let to girls of the town.</p>
               <p>What is the landlady's name? - Field.</p>
               <p>Was it Field who blamed her for not robbing the man before? - No; Billings, her former landlady. I took her before a magistrate and immediately she confessed taking the things.</p>

             came and called me again, and said, why did not I rob the man? I said, because he was a particular acquaintance of mine. Billings gave me some beer, which intoxicated me more. In the morning I waked and found myself in another girl's lodging between two girls, and I found the watch in bed. I sent a girl, who went of my errands, to the prosecutor to let him know I had the things and would return them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I met the girl coming to me, she had been to see for me and could not find me, that was about nine o'clock; I do not wish to hurt her she did her business so well; I love her too well to think of hurting her.</p>
               <p>Did she appear to be in liquor? - I think she was more so than me.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

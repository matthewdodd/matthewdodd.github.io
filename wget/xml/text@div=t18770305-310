                  </hi>. I am a Gustom House officer, of 28, Charles Street, Commercial Road—on 7th February, between 4 and 5 p.m., I had just alighted from a tram car at the Commercial Road, and opened my great coat to take out my ticket, a lad, about twenty, ran by me and snatched my guard and watch—I captured him and laid hold of him, when the prisoner took hold of me from behind and put his knee in the small of my back, which forced me to let the other go—by the manner in which he pulled me I was forced to stand over him and I could see him—he flung me down and hurt my right knee and hand—I pursued him, and was in the act of taking hold of him, when a handful of mud was thrown in my face—on the next Sunday night I identified him at Leman Street station—he was dressed differently then—I have seen no more of my watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should know the boy again who snatched my chain—I caught the one who threw the mud into my face, but not the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Commercial Road—I saw Mr. Cooney get Out of the tram—the prisoner put his leg before him and another one snatched his watch—Mr. Cooney caught the thief, and the prisoner went behind him and put his knee behind him, and he had to let go of the thief—they all ran across Whitechapel Road and passed the prisoner, and in Grey Garden Street I saw the prisoner in the crowd—I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was dressed in a big frock coat like twill, and a different cap—I was about the length of this Court from him when he pulled the prosecutor down—his back was to me but I got in front of him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I took him in custody from the description given by the prosecutor—he was dressed then just as he is now and wore a wide-a-wake hat, not a cap.'</p>

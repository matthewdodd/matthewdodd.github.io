                  </hi>. I am accountant to Edwards and Radcliffe, of Dela<lb></lb>bay-street, Westminster—the prisoner was their managing clerk—he had a sum of money every morning, from which it was his duty to defray the expenses of the day, and it was his duty to account to me next morning for the sums paid—on 28th April he gave me this memorandum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the sums he had expended—there is in it a sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as paid to Mr. Serjeant Channell as a retaining fee, in the cause "West Cornwall Rail-way <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Enthoven"—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Parrot Love<lb></lb>grove, who keeps the Fladong hotel—the prisoner was in our service—I had occasion to attend the police office, where she was to be examined on another charge, and saw she had my silk umbrella—I had her keys taken from her—the officer went to where she stated she lived, and then I saw some cravats and napkins of mine—I had missed the umbrella some weeks.</p>

               <p>Jane Ford. I am servant to Mr. Roberts. I have seen the prisoner several times on the wharf. I was standing on the wharf on Sunday, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; I saw the prisoner with a large bundle under his left arm, wrapped in a blue coat the sleeve of which hung down; he was, when I saw him, about fifty yards from Mr. Warcup's house; I could not see his house where I stood; if I had been about ten yards further, I should have been in sight of the prosecutor's house. The prisoner, when I saw him, appeared as if coming from Mr. Warcup's house; this was while the family was at church. I had stood there about ten minutes before I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other person there?</p>
               <p>Ford. No; I saw no other person whatever. Mr. Warcup came home between seven and eight o'clock; he came to my master's, and called for a candle, and said his door was broke open: I went with him, and I saw that the staple was forced out, and the padlock was gone. Mr. Warcup said a blue-coat was go; then I mentioned to him that I had seen the prisoner go out of the yard with a bundle wrapped up in a blue coat. I saw the prisoner that evening at the Hat and Feathers; and I am sure he is the same man that I saw with the bundle.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Gastleton. I keep the White Hart in Goodman's Fields; the prisoner and another man came to my house on the 29th of September, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoner had a bundle upon his arm, with a blue coat upwards; he laid them down on the table in the tap-room; they sat and drank about half an hour, and they had a piece of beef, about pound or a pound and an half, on the table before them: the prisoner desired me to take care of the things till the next day. when he would call for them : he said that his wife and he had had some words, and he had brought some of his own things, and a few of her's: he gave them me: then he said there was a gentleman that lived in the neighbourhood, who would lend him a guinea, but he was not at home, and asked me to lend him 6 s. which I did, and he said he would bring me the money in the morning, and would take the things away. When Mr. Warcup came with the prisoner, I asked him if the goods, were stolen he said, No; it was only a little quarrel. One of the gentlemen said, No, don't deceive any one; they are stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you say it was only a quarrel?</p>
               <p>Warcup. I did say so as the prisoner desired I would not expose him.</p>

               <p>I went to a vault by the wharf; a man came by the place with a bundle under his arm, which he asked me to carry to Whitechapel or Goodman's Fields; he said he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230020"></xptr> give me half a crown to carry it for him. I took the bundle and carried it up Milford Lane: the man staid about five minutes, and then followed me: he came up the same way  - I did the things fell at the upper end of the lane; he tied them up again, and he took a neck cloth out of the bundle, and gave it me, and bid me tie it about my neck. I carried the bundle for him to Whitechapel; when I came there, he asked me if I knew any house where the bundle could be left; I mentioned the White Hart; we took the things there, and asked the woman to let us leave them there for a few shillings till the next morning, which she agreed to: it was that man that pulled out the beef that was upon the table, and he gave me two shillings and the neckcloth. Is it not likely that I should go at noon, and break open a house in my own neighbourhood, where I had been working so long. </p>

                  </hi>. I am the Deputy Clerk of the Peace, at Westminster. I was present on the trial of a person named Webb, before Serjeant Adams at that Court, on Tuesday, 6th Nov.—I produce an examined copy of the Record—the prisoner was called on the part of the defendant—I saw him sworn, and heard what he said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you speak from your own independent recollection? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well; before I challenged my memory on the subject I was requested to make a copy of the Judge's notes; and I then saw what the Judge had taken down—I can state the purport of the prisoner's evidence from my own recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Give what you can pledge yourself to recollect Witness. I recollect that the prisoner said that be accompanied Webb to be enlisted; and that the sergeant asked Webb whether he was married or single; that Webb said that he was married, that the prisoner said that he him self was single, and the sergeant then enlisted both of them; that when Webb said that he was married the sergeant said, "All right," or some<lb></lb>thing to that offset, and gave him the shilling.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You hear a great many trials, you sit there the whole day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, unfortunately—I do not recollect everything said by witnesses—before I was asked about this, I made a copy of the notes, and then saw the exact words that the sergeant had taken down, but I dis<lb></lb>tinctly remembered the facts of the case—as far as my recollection goes, Webb was undefended—my impression is that he interrupted the Judge in the process of summing up, and stated that he had informed the sergeant that he was married, and had witnesses to prove the fact, and gave the names of the two persons—the two witnesses were then called, and were asked what they knew about it, and they stated it—I recollect the prisoner distinctly saying that he heard Webb say to the sergeant that he was a mar<lb></lb>ried man—I recollect his saying that the conversation took place at the bar of a public house, and that there were other persons there, but he did not say anything about a noise—he pointed to a distance at which he said that he was from the sergeant—I recollect the other man's evidence, it was to the same effect—the prisoner said that he came to be enlisted with Webb, the other man said that he went with Webb, but not to be enlisted, and was not asked whether he was married or single, but that the prisoner was asked—he said that they were drinking at the bar—I do not recollect his saying that it wag in the evening—some persons were called, but I do not think Mr. Bodkin, who conducted the prosecution for the War Office, cross-examined them—I think the questions were put by the Judge—the sergeant who had enlisted them and another sergeant were then recalled, and Mr. Bodkin then made a short statement to the jury.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the 23rd regiment, and have been employed lately on the recruiting service—on 29th Oct. a man named Webb, came with sergeant Clary with the intention of enlisting—Webb, Adams, Watts, and Clary all came together—Watts was another witness for the defendant at the trial—I did not say much to Webb—I knew that they came to enlist, and asked them, but they did not feel inclined to at first—I was there two hours, and afterwards Clary came to me and said, "I think they are in the mind for enlisting now"—Adams and Clary were in the box—I asked Webb if he was married or an apprentice—he said that he was not married, but was living with a girl—Adams must hare heard that—on that I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we are not allowed to enlist married men—if we do, the bounty money comes out of our own pockets—when we got to the police court next day a wife turned up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> They were two hours in the public house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they were playing at bagatelle and drinking—I cannot say what they were drinking—there were not a great many people there—the public house is in the Broadway, Westminster—I believe the men came from Kingston—I thought they were fit for the army, and was very anxious to have them—they were not anxious at first—I did not persuade them, but it is my duty to get every one I can—I asked them to enlist, but they did not feel inclined—I cannot say exactly how long they remained after that—they knew as well as I did whether it was a glorious thing to be in a battle, as I have never been in one—it was not a large box that I went into, it holds about four people—this was in the afternoon—I did not sit down in the box—I stood up, they were sitting down—no conversation had passed before that about their being married—I had enlisted the prisoner before that—I had asked him if he was married—the men were not drunk, they might have drunk a quart of beer in. the two hours—I never enlist persons that are drunk, I treat them to a glass or two—I should have asked them before I did whether they were married or single, but they did not seem inclined to enlist—I thought they came there to enlist—the sergeant afterwards came and said, "I think they will enlist now," and then I went to the box and asked whether he was married or an apprentice—we are not allowed to enlist apprentices or married men, if we do we have the loss—the question I put was to Webb—Adams was sitting in the same box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he made the answer and you paid him, was he or was he not drunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was not—I think they then went and got something to eat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the Surrey militia, and am employed in recruiting for the militia.

               <p>way, and got some more porter for them, and they played at bagatelle for two hours—I got them into a little box in front of the bar, and at the time they enlisted Adams and Webb only were together—I got their minds made up for enlistment, and sergeant Handicott came and asked Webb if he was willing to enlist—he said "Yes"—he asked if he was married or single, and they both said that they were single men—he gave them a shilling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You seem to be the person whose business it was to ply them with porter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You mean to encourage them to enlist, my captain sent me out on that duty—I cannot say that I gave them more than two pots of porter—there were two of them—they had some more after they enlisted—in my opinion they had not had four pot before they enlisted, but I will not swear it—I have not to give an account of what I spend for beer—it comes out of my own pocket—I do not know whether, when I had got their courage up, I said to the sergeant, "They are all right now, go at them!"—I do not know the exact words I said—I heard the words "married or single"—I was in the box at the time—I will swear that they both said that they were single men.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

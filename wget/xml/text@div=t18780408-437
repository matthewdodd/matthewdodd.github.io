I live at 6, Victoria Grove, Kensington, and am a gardener—on 16th February I went to bed at 10.30 p.m.—all the doors and windows were secured—on the 17th about 3.15 a.m. I was aroused by the barking of a lodger's dog—I went downstairs and found the area door open—I ran into the street and called "Police!"—I examined the premises and missed a mustard-pot—this is the lining of it—this dagger is my lodger's—I have seen it in his possession—his name is on it—the hasp of the area window had been forced—it was left shut—I found a pair of boots that did not belong to me, also a chisel on the man<lb></lb>telpiece—I also missed two coats and a waterproof—I have only seen this portion of the mustard-pot and the dagger since.</p>

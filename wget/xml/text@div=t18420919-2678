On the 24th of August the prisoner rang at the bell, about ten minutes past two o'clock, and I answered the door—he asked if my husband was at home—I said "No"—he said, when would he be in?—I said it was uncertain—he said, "Tell him I will call in an hour, and tell him to wait to see me"—he then went away, and I shut the door—the outer door does not shut, it stands open—there is an inner door in the centre of the passage, which opens with a small key—that was shut when the prisoner was gone—this cloth was in a room directly opposite that inner door as you go along the passage, and there is another door to the room—I went down again about twenty minutes past two, and closed the door of that room, but I did not lock it—I then saw the cloth safe—the prisoner had frequently been in that room on former occasions, and knew it perfectly well—I came down stain again in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and found the doors all open, and the cloth was gone—there was a piece of brown, two pieces of black, and one of blue—when the prisoner was there, he said he would call again a little after three—he did not call again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a pawnbroker's shop in Exmouth-street. On the 24th of August, some cloth was brought to me by a tall stout man—he was alone in the box, and there were two persons outside—there was one piece of black cloth, one of brown, and one a mixture, pepper-and-salt, I believe—there was about ten yards of it the person who brought it wanted 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I offered 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—the prisoner was not one of the persons who came—I attended at Hatton-garden, and said he was not the man—the person who brought the cloth was much like Nesbit, the officer at Hat ton-garden.</p>

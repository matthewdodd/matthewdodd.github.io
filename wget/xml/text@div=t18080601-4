               <p>Q. Are you the butler. - A. Yes; I heard him walk out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your master's plate kept. - A. In the pantry; the pantry door goes out immediately from the kitchen; it was open, the plate was in the pantry, it laid on the table; when I heard this man walk out, I was in the back kitchen; I went into the front kitchen, then I saw the prisoner at the top of the area steps: I went into the pantry to see what I had missed; I missed eight silver table spoons; I went directly after him, and caught him; I brought him back into the kitchen; he denied he ever had been in the kitchen at all; I could see the print of spoons through his coat, at his breast; I asked him to unbutton his coat; he did not give me any answer, but walked directly into the pantry; he asked me where the plate was; he id not take it away, he did not know where it was; I took hold of his coat and pulled him back from the pantry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010006"></xptr>door; then he directly pulled the spoons out, and laid them down on the table and said here is your spoons, be friends, and let me go and say no more about it; I told him I could not let him go; an officer was sent for, I gave him up to the officer; these are the spoons; I have had them in my possession ever since; there is my master's crest upon them; they laid on the table in the pantry; they are my master's property.</p>

               <p>Q. And the pantry door was open. - A. Yes; the area kitchen door was shut; I heard the door shut after the man came in the kitchen, and I heard it shut when he went out; I had seen the door about two or three minutes before; the door shuts of itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say that when you went into the back kitchen you shut the door. - A. Yes, I had, but whether it latched I cannot say; there was nobody down stairs but me and the cook, she was in the back kitchen with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the back kitchen before you heard the door shut, and heard a person walk across the kitchen into the pantry. - A. About half a minute</p>
               <p>Q. You and the cook were in the back kitchen - what other persons of the family were in the house. - A. Mrs. Twining was at the top of the house, and the house maid was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of these spoons. - A. They are worth five pounds at the least.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Bloomsbury square, to the colonel of the regiment, that I belonged to; and when I came from there, I came to this gentleman to get my pension; I have been a soldier in Germany; when I came up to the house, this man came up to me; he says I beg your pardon, was not you in our house; I said I did not know; he said he wanted me to go with him; I told him I would, I asked him who wanted me; I followed him, he said the gentleman of the house has lost some silver spoons; I said, I was sorry for it; when I went in there was an iron door, I could not open it; he opened it, and when I came down in the kitchen he opened a drawer; out he runs again, and ran up stairs; he looked very hard upon me, I thought it very comical, I thought of no harm; when he came down stairs, he said open your coat; I did, there was three and sixpence which the colonel's lady gave me, and he found an old German letter on me; I said my good man here are your spoons, they were laying under the table; the woman took the spooms, she gave them to him: he ran up stairs, he came down, he said send for a constable; the constable came I was taken in custody; I never was before any judge or jury before.</p>
               <p>Q. to Britten. I heard you say positively that when you brought him back and took him into the pantry, you saw the print of the spoons on his coat. - A. Yes, and he took the spoons from under his coat and laid them down.</p>

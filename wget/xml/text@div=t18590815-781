                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor—on 5th August I had in my possession a bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn by myself and accepted by Reed, Johnson, and Co.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was not torn at all when I last had it—I and the prisoner had been to a Mr. Cameron, of Clifford's-inn-passage, who the prisoner introduced me to in August, to get that bill discounted—it was not discounted, and Mr. Cameron returned it to me—on 7th August the prisoner and I went to the Green Gate Tavern, Hackney-road—it was the evening of the day on which the bill had been returned to me by Mr. Cameron—as we stood at the bar between 9 and 10 o'clock, the prisoner asked me to let him see the signature of the bill—he immediately took it up, and attempted to run away with it—I caught him, and asked him to return it; he refused to do so, and I called the assistance of the landlord, Mr. Burleigh, but he did not interfere—the prisoner and I scuffled together, and my coat was torn by the prisoner in the scuffle—the prisoner got away from me; I pursued him, but did not catch him—I after<lb></lb>wards went to Spital-square police-station, and gave information—they directed me to find a policeman—I got one, and went with him to the prisoner's house—I knocked at the door, and the prisoner's wife opened it—asked her if Mr. Russell was at home—she said, "No," and shut the door—I walked to the parlour window, looked through a blind which did not quite cover the window, and saw the prisoner asleep on a table—I again knocked at the door—Mrs. Russell opened it, and I walked in with the policeman, and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

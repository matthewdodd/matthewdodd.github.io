               <p>Q. Did they drink with you. - A. No, nor I with them; I went out of the door about half past four in the morning to make water; Beasley and Price came out immediately after me, Beasley came up to me and asked me if I would go home with her; I refused it; I had my watch in my fob when I unbuttoned my smallclothes, I am positive I had it then; when I buttoned them up I missed it; I laid hold of Beasley immediately and told her she had got my watch; the prisoner Price was at her back; she went away; I took Beasley into the public house; I told the landlord of the house she had got my watch; the prisoner Beasley undressed herself, I did not see any thing of my watch; I did not search her at all, I took her to St. Martin's watch-house and gave her up to the constable of the night; the constable of the night, I believe, got directions from Beasley where to find Price; we went to No. 6, New Exchange-court, in the Strand; we met the Price and Branch coming arm in arm together; the constable took Branch and the watchman took Price; they conveyed them to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were the prisoners to you when you went out of the public house. - A. Beasley came up close to me and Price was in the rear of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them touch you. - A. Yes, the prisoner Beasley laid her hand upon my breast; I did not feel her hand go to my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she near you when you discovered you had lost your watch. - A. She was close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your fob turned down so that your watch might fall out. - A. No, the fob was fastened at the bottom so that it could not fall out.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch was not fastened, might not that fall out when you unbuttoned. - A No, it could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, you did not feel it go. - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you had much liquor. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.What made you out at that time. - A. I attended the Opera House as a soldier; I went to this house to get refreshment before I went to my quarters.</p>

            . I am a constable; I went with the last witness to New Exchange-court; I took Branch into custody; going along to the watch-house. I said to Branch, I believe you are the person that has got the watch, I think you had better give it me; he said he could tell me all about it; Beasley had informed me before that Price and Branch lived together, that made me suspect that he had got it; he gave me the watch, he told me Price gave it him to keep till the morning.</p>
               <p>Beasley's Defence. I know nothing of the man. I work in Tavistock-street and round the neighourhood; going out in the morning I met with this woman; she said, she was going out to work at the upholstery work at Mr. Trotter's; I said, I am going to the same place; it was rather cold, she and I went into this house to get a pint of beer; Price went out while I was warming the beer, I thought she was gone long; I went to the door, I met this man right at the door; he told me his watch was gone; he seemed very much in liquor; he took me into the tap room, and made me undress myself all to my linen before every one.</p>
               <p>Price's Defence. This woman and I were sitting together at the public house drinking a pint of beer; the soldier beckoned me out; I went out after him, not knowing what he wanted; I walked a little way with him, he asked me to have something to drink; when I got to the corner he wanted to be indecent with me; I stood a while with him; I perceived him pulling his small clothes down; he asked me to hold his watch while he eased himself, he asked my pardon, he told me not to go away. When he stooped I walked away, as I thought it not very decent; I met a young woman at the Sun, she was going into that house; there I met this man. I asked her to hold this watch while I took out the money to get something to drink. On going to my lodgings to clean myself, we met the constable. I meaned to take the watch back again to the public house. This woman is innocent.</p>
               <p>Branch's Defence. I am a <rs id="t18080217-35-deflabel196" type="occupation">watchman</rs>

Coming off duty after six o'clock I met with a man; we went into a public house; I was warming myself by the fire. Price came in, she asked me if I would have something to drink; I said, I did not care if I did. We went to the Man in the Moon the corner of Vine-street; she gave me a handkerchief, with the watch in it, to hold while she got the halfpence out to pay for the gin; I did not know then what was in the handkerchief. Coming out I looked in the handkerchief; I said to her in the name of God which way came you by this; she said, a man in Hemmings's-row gave her the watch to hold while he did something. I do not know what he was about, I was not nigh there by three quarters of a mile. I said if you mean any good to yourself go and give the property up to the owner, and I insist upon it you shall before I part with it. I thought it my duty to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on duty that night as watchman. - A. I was; she begged of me to go home with her to her apartments to get her a clean apron. When I came to the door the constable took me and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170025"></xptr>watchman took the woman.</p>
               <p>Branch called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

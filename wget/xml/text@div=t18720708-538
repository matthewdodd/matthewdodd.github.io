                  </hi>. I live at 104, Cromer Street, and keep the Rose of Denmark beer-shop—on Saturday, 8th June, about 6 o'clock, the prisoner was there—the deceased came in and sat down, and they spoke to each other—the deceased was very drunk—he called for a glass of ale, I refused to serve him—he was very abusive, to me, and was going to drink other people's ale—he told me not to interfere, and said he would knock me all to pieces; I put him out, returned in and asked one of the men inside to hold the door to keep him from coming in again—I did not see what occurred outside—I saw him almost directly he fell, for I picked him up and set him against the front of the house; he was insensible—before this, when he wanted to drink the other persons' ale, the prisoner took hold of him and put him down on the seat and told him to keep his own company, and not interfere with other people, as they did not want anything to do with him; that was done in a friendly way—the deceased was very violent then, and wanted to get either at me or the other persons, for not letting him drink the ale—he struck at me several times and kicked very violently—after putting him out at one door he went round to the other, and as I was opening it to go out he made a kick at me; I pushed the door to avoid the kick, and when I pulled it open again he was lying on his back outside with his head on the paving stones, the prisoner was standing close to him, and there were several persons against the door.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. The deceased was brought to me on Sunday, 9th June, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, suffering from symptoms of compression of the brain—he died at 8 o'clock the same evening—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there was an ordinary black eye on the right side—on removing the sealp on the left side, I found a fracture immediately above and behind the left ear—there was also a slight graze below the left knee—the cause of death was effusion of blood within the skull cap—the description given by Wilmot and others of the fall, might be sufficient to account for the fracture—I could find no other cause.</p>

I have no means of knowing whether the injuries I saw were inflicted in the evening or between 1 and 2 o'clock, the fracture would cause a bleeding which would be so profuse that he would not be sensible for any Length of time afterwards; that would depend in a great degree upon the nature and extent of the fracture—the vessels might have been injured easily in the affair, but not so as to rupture them com<lb></lb>pletely, and then any further excitement might cause them to burst, with or without a fall—their, tendency, to burst would be increased by the fact of his being drunk.</p>

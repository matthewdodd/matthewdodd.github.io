               <p>Q. What are you? - A carpenter. On Thursday morning, the 15th of this month. I went down to the house that the prisoner lodged at; I went and asked whether the prisoner Alice, lodged there? he said he did, and was sorry for it; I asked what it was for? he said he was a very bad man, and there was a person there that told me that he brought a sack of hair there the last night. I went down and see the sack of hair there.</p>
               <p>Q. At whose house was this? - No. 9, Blandford-mews, the person's name is Hale that keeps the house, the back of East-street, Manchester-square. I went up to Mr. Thomas's and asked them if they had lost any hair? they said they had; Mr. Thomas was not at home. I went and got a warrant for the prisoner; in the mean time I went for the warrant, the prisoner went away; but I met him on Thursday, the 15th, the bottom of Oxford-road, took him and called for a coach, and took him to the Apollo, at Paddington-street. When we got into the coach, he said to me, Mr. Dixon,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280069"></xptr>what must I do in this mess I said, the only thing that you can do is to acknowledge where the hair is gone. He sent his wife for the hair the same day, and I took the hair from off her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know from the prisoner whether they were his lodgings or not? - I did. I conveyed the hair to the justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate. You met the prisoner in Oxford-road, you say; that is not far from where he works? - A great way.</p>
               <p>Q. In the day time, walking about in public? - I believe he wished to be hid, he tried to get away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass between you and him besides what you have told his lordship? - He told me that he took it out of Mr. Thomas's house where he saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you that he was directed by his master to take it out? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Court. I have heard from another witness that this hair was at Mr. Wilson's, at Paddington-street, was that the Apollo? - It is.</p>

               <p>I lodged in the same house where the prisoner lodged.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lodged there? - About four months. I was washing on Wednesday the 14th, in the kitchen; I heard a noise coming down stairs, thinking it was my husband I called out, and no answer was made; I took the candle and went up, and Mr. Alice threw down a sack into the yard, an old sack with patches in it, and tied with lift.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing in it? - Yes, hair for mortar. I looked into it after the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - Near eight o'clock in the evening. It was carried away the next morning; I don't know by whom, I was out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see that sack afterwards? - Yes, I see it when it was brought to the Apollo public house by the prisoner's wife, by his order. Dixon had the conducting of it to Marlborough-street, and I brought it here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, James's Street, Seacombe, and am a charwoman—I did some washing for Mrs. Steele, and she paid me the first time 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the second time 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mrs. Ohlsen, a different woman, engaged Mr.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was going there backwards and forwards from the <hi rend="italic">back-end</hi> of September to December—Mrs. Ohlsen paid me for minding Mrs. Steele I think four times up to Mrs. Steele going away—the first time the other woman paid me was the <hi rend="italic">back-end</hi> of September—when I attended on Mrs. Steele Mrs. Ohlsen was away attending to a lady—I knew Holt as Holt—he was not living there then—he was living in Church Street, Egremont, but he came there two or three times—Ohlsen asked me if I would come and speak the truth about a week ago—I have never seen her but the once, and never saw Mrs. Holt till I came to London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Mrs. Ohlsen was away attending to the lady three days at first and two nights another time, and I slept in her bed—Holt was not there.</p>

I did not see the invalid lady every day—I never went inside the house—I have seen Holt many times—he came once at about 8 a.m.—I did not know him as Mr. Steele—I did not know the sandy<lb></lb>whiskered gentleman as Steele—when they left I did not know where they went—Holt asked me to come here, I dare say, a month ago—he asked me if I saw him come to the Yale, and I said "Yes, I did."</p>

                  </hi> I am an engine-driver of Liverpool—I lived at 37, Tranmere Yale, for 12 years till October last—I saw the invalid arrive in a cab on the 16th or 17th September, 1877, at 8, Tranmere Vale Terrace—Ohlsen is not the woman—she was thin—I did not see the furniture arrive—I saw the woman on a Sunday evening going up the street—there were two men and two women</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I cannot say whether it was the invalid I saw on a Sunday in the street—I misunderstood the question—I only saw her once—I did not know her name—I did not ask their names—I cannot say how often I saw Holt—I did not know who he was—I think Mr. Lloyd asked me to come here first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Mr. Lowndes, solicitor, of Liverpool, Registrar of the High Court of Justice—I have had the manage<lb></lb>ment of Holt's case, and it was important to endeavour to find Mr. Steele—I have advertised for him, and have sent to the different mercantile marine offices in Liverpool and to various shipping offices and to the London Registrar for Seamen without effect—I don't know whether Mrs. Steele is in an asylum or not—I have exhausted every means as a solicitor to obtain their presence—Steele's Christian names are Edward Sheppard—I have seen a man who works in the docks, in Liverpool who says he has seen a man answering his description.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Of course, that is told and told again—the man said his son had told him he had met Mr. Steele in London, and he had shipped by the same line of vessels as himself—I am satisfied he lived at one time at 14, Thomas's Buildings, and I trace him to 8, Tranmere Yale Terrace, and then I lose all trace of him—Mrs. Steele's names are Elizabeth Louisa—I know Ohlsen's name is Elizabeth—I do not know that Elizabeth Steele, of Dock Cottages, was Mrs. Ohlsen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. As I understand, Mr. Edward Sheppard Steele and Mrs. Ohlsen's first husband were brothers—I telegraphed to the owners of the vessel, and in consequence Mr. Ohlsen came over to this country.</p>

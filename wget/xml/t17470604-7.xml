             . The Prisoner came to me to look for a Smock she had in Pawn. I laid my Watch upon the Counter. I stoop'd down to look after what she ask'd for, and when I arose again she took my Watch and went out; and the next Day I took her, and she confess'd she had pawn'd it for 20 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Who produces the Watch now.</p>
               <p>Picknell.

               <p>Prisoner. I had it out of his Fob, he gave it me out of his Pocket to pledge; he was to give me Half a Crown to be concerned with me.</p>

            . I am Headborough in Whitechapel . I took the Prisoner, and she confess'd she had pawn'd the Watch in Winfield-Street .</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the Watch?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes, my Lord; the Pawn-broker brought it before the Justice, and the Justice delivered it into my care.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Have you any Thing to say, or any Witnesses?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was none but he and I in the Room; he thought his Wife was coming, and he told me I should come again for the Shift.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this chucking under the Chin?</p>

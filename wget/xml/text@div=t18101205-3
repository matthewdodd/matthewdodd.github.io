The man told me he saw it done, and he would fetch them. In an hour he brought me the stockings, the stockings he brought me were like the stockings I had missed, but I could not swear to them; the mark had been taken off, and the thread that stitched them together; they were separated.</p>

            . I am a journeyman coach-maker,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050004"></xptr>I work for Mr. Mitchell in Tottenham-place. On the 16th of November I was going from Bedford-square to St. Giles's, I was coming down Charlotte-street, I observed the two prisoners at the bar standing against the shop window of Mrs. Clarke in Great Russel street, the boys were in Russel street, against the window I observed that as I came down Charlotte-street; I am sure the prisoners are the boys, I knew Berry before. On my crossing the street, from Charlotte-street to Great Russell-street, I observed Glover making a hole in a pane of glass, I saw an instrument in his hand, I imagined it to be a knife, but was not nigh enough to see what it was, I found this knife on him afterwards; at the time that Glover made a hole in the window, Berry with a piece of wire, drew out this pair of black silk stockings that I have in my hand, Glover took them and put them in his bosom, they walked away together. I was crossing the street at the time this was done, it was done in an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day might this be - A. Between eleven and twelve at noon.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a morning might it be - A. To the best of my knowledge a dullish morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people walking along the street - A. Yes. When they walked away I went and told Mrs. Clarke of the loss, and that I would get an officer to take them as soon as I could; I followed them into George-street.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that you went to tell Mrs. Clarke did you lose sight of them - A. They crossed the street and went towards St. Giles's, they went down the lower part of Charlotte-street, and then they went into Dyot-street, it is now called George-street. I kept them in sight the whole time; in going there they met with

             and searched him, I found this knife in his pocket, I locked him up, and went in search of Berry, and coming down George-street we saw Berry, he was turning into Church-street, he was walking we pursued him, I thought he then mended his pace in walking, Gerrard ran before him and stopped him, I laid hold of him, I searched him, and found nothing about him. We went in search of Tooley, I could not find her I thought she might come to the strong room where Glover and Berry were, and there found her sitting in the strong room with the two prisoners; she told me her name, and Gerrard told me she was the person; to be perfectly satisfied, I took her up to Mr. Hinckesman, he told me I had the right person.</p>
               <p>Berry's Defence. That young man wants to swear our three lives away, I never saw this young man or woman before in my life.</p>
               <p>Glover's Defence. That man while I was at St. Giles's pump came and collered me, he took me into Mr. Hinckesman, the pawnbroker, where this young woman was standing behind the counter with a pair of silk stockings in her hand, he took the silk stockings away from her, and took me to Bow-street, and called Mr. Blackman, I was then searched, they took a bread and cheese knife away from 
me, and two small boxes, and locked me up.</p>


               <p>Tooley's Defence. On this morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was going out to get two pounds of potatoes, I live in a cellar in Buckeridge-street, and just as I came out of this cellar, met a young man, he asked me to pawn these silk stockings, he said he would give me a shilling, I was to pawn them for six shillings, I opened the stockings, I said they would not lend six shillings, he said they would, this gentleman rushed by me and almost knocked me down, I said holloo, cannot you look before you, I took the stockings open in my hand to Mr. Hinckesman, and held my hands on the counter, there were four people in the shop, no one came to serve me; one, this young man came in with this young lad, he had hold of him by the collar, he pulled the stockings out of my hand, and said to Glover, where did you get these stockings? I said, the young man that I had the stockings of is out of door, it is not him; Mr. Hickesman said, take them all together, I followed them up Bow-street, I met Mr. Blackman, they passed me, this young man's sister saw me at Bow-street, she said I had a right to be there to clear him if I could, he said she was his sister. Mr. Blakeman came there and took me to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050005"></xptr>pawnbrokers, I said I was the person that had the stockings from a young man in a blue coat and check pantaloons, and while Mr. Blackman went for the mother of the child I had in my arms, this young man took me into Mr. Britten's and gave me a glass of liquor, he said, if you will tell me who gave you the stockings, he would be a good friend to you, with that they took me off to Bow-street.</p>

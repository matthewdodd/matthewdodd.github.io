               <p>Wood. No, I shall be called to the bar speedily. On the latter end of March last, my house at Hampstead was broke open, and a great many things lost; it was on the 28th or 29th of March, Monday or Tuesday; I had been at Kingston Assizes; I came home on Monday;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180034"></xptr> my housekeeper came to town on Monday night, and did not return again till Wednesday; she left every thing safe when she came away; she came away I believe on Monday; there was no servant in the house when it was done; on Wednesday the 30th I went to Hampstead on horseback, and my housekeeper and servant girl went by the stage coach; we got there about eight at night; they had just got there; they told me they found the street door was bolted on the inside, and they were afraid the house had been robbed; I went to the door and found it to be so; then I ordered one of them to go to one of the servants of Mr. Sewel, and go in the back way at my back garden, and get in at the back door; the servant did go; there was a little alarm made, and some of the people might hear we were in a consternation; Mr. Sewel's servant got a ladder and got into my back garden; the back door was shut but not locked; he unbolted the door and I went in with the housekeeper and servant; I found somebody had been in the house and committed great devastation, broke many things to pieces and plundered the house; the pannel of the parlour door was very near broke; there was some china in a beaufet, and other things; they had broke the glass and cut down by the side of the lock so as to get a poker in which was there, which seemed very much strained by attempting to break open the door; there were a great many drops of blood upon the floor, so I suppose one of the thieves cut themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did they get in?</p>
               <p>Wood. They had begun untiling part of the house, but finding the timbers too close, they desisted; they got in at the cellar window of the adjoining house which is unoccupied, got along a parapet wall and in at my garret window. I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment ( repeating them); I had seen some of them about a week or ten days before; I left Mrs. Pettit and the servant in the house when I went away; some of the things were found in the possession of Mrs. Ripley, at Wandsworth; I had a search warrant to search Everett's house; Sir

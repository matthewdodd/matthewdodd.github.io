                  </hi>. I am a sailor—on the morning of 22d September, I was standing against the Red Lion, at the corner of St. George's-street, Rat<lb></lb>cliff-highway—the prisoner came along and butted me in the breast with his head—I said to him, "If you want fighting, I will fight you fairly"—we went into the Back-road to fight; we had a blow or two, and the policeman came along and stopped us—the prisoner struck me in the nose, that was all and we parted—I asked him to have something to drink with me, to make good friends, but he would not—about 7 o'clock the same evening, I saw the prisoner in Neptune-street, standing talking to a woman who was outside the door—he got hold of both of my hands—he had a knife, and he out me down my cheek; I have the mark here—he then cut me twice in the back of the neck, and once in the left arm—he also bit me in the chin—I cried for mercy, and after that I became insensible, and did not know where I was until I found myself in the London Hospital—I saw the knife in his hands as I was coming along Neptune-street, before he struck me—it was a clasp knife—he was sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not cut the man—I had two fights with him in the fore<lb></lb>noon—there were four of his shipmates with him, and they would not go away; I told them to several times—I know I bit him in the lip, and he tried to bite me, but I never took a knife to a man. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I never saw the prisoner before—I had just been paid off, and these were a set of Ameri<lb></lb>can sailors, lurking about, and pouncing upon all they could—I lost about 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. amongst him and his party.</p>

               <p>of Neptune-court—the prisoner came up and said, if he saw Williams he would take his life—I said to him, "Don't be foolish, you might make it up together again"—Williams came round the corner—the prisoner caught hold of his two arms—I said to him, "Let go of him," and Williams pulled his arms away from him—I said to him, "Come and have a pot of half and half, and make it up together"—Williams said, "No; we will have a pint of gin," and he turned to go up Neptune-court—as he turned, the prisoner ran after him, and pulled his knife out and pulled it across Williams's mouth—I screamed, "Murder!" and "Police!" nobody came—the last stab I saw was at the back of the neck—he cried for mercy three times, and said "Spare my life," and fell down—I followed the prisoner, but missed him, as I could not keep up with him; and I went to the station and stated the case there—the inspector sent a man with me, but we could not find the prisoner then.</p>

About 9 o'clock on the night of 22d September, I was on duty in New-road, St. George's—the prisoner was pointed out to me—I followed him into the Back-road, stopped him, and told him to consider himself a prisoner, as I should take him into custody for stabbing a man in Neptune-street—he said, "It is very hard for me to be locked up for stabbing the man; if I had not stabbed him he would have stabbed me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—I attended the prosecutor when he was brought there on 22d, between 7 and 8 o'clock—I found an incised wound about an inch and a quarter in length, extend<lb></lb>ing outwards from the left angle of the mouth, dividing the whole thickness of the lip, and half its length—at the back of the head and neck were two small superficial incised wounds, each about a quarter of an inch in length; one on the scalp on the left side, and the other on the right side of the neck—there was also a lacerated wound of the chin, penetrating nearly through its whole thickness; it appeared as if it had been caused by a bite; there were the teeth of the upper jaw upon it—there was a very small superficial wound on the left arm above the elbow, merely penetrating the skin, about a quarter of an inch an depth—there was a great deal of bleeding from the incised wound on the mouth; that was the worst—he was in the hospital about three weeks—he will not suffer any permanent injury.</p>

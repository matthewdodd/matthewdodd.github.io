            . I am the prosecutor's sister. On the 29th of August, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was sitting at work in the shop - some ear-rings were in the widow for sale - I heard the cracking of glass in the shop-window - I immediately looked up, and saw the prisoner, Johnson, looking through the broken glass as sted fastly at me as he possibly could - the ear-rings were quite close to the window - there is a wire against the window for the card of ear-rings to hang on; the prisoner, Luckhurst, was in conversation with a woman - he was two or three paces from Johnson, but he left the woman, and came on the other side of Johnson, who was only looking through the glass, with his arms quite straight down - a piece of glass was cut out, and fell on the tray of ear-rings; the hole was large enough to admit a man's finger, so as to reach the ear-rings - my little brother was in the parlour; I called to him, and said, I thought that man had cut the glass; he immediately run out - both the prisoners were at the window when he got outside the door; he tapped at the window, and said, "Yes, Jane, it is cut;" upon that, the prisoner, Luckhurst, looked in and went away - he one way, and the woman the other - Johnson remained at the window; I went out and laid hold of him, and told him it was him who had done it; I had missed nothing then, but some of the ear-rings were disturbed - Payne came up, and Johnson seeing him, walked away, and Payne after him - he laid hold of him, and brought him back; I saw the ear-rings in the shop afterwards - they had been only partly got out of the window - I have no share in the business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Has your mother any share? A. No. It was quite light.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old. I was in the parlour with my mother - my sister called me out; I had seen the window quite sound shortly before - I ran out, and saw Luckhurst at the window, where it was cut; I saw his fingers inside the pane of glass which had been cut; he had a pair of coral ear-rings between his fingers - he had got them half out, but not quite - he left them lodged in the pane of glass, half in and half out - he went away, and I after him - he went to the corner of Golden-lane, and crossed twice; I lost sight of him for about two minutes, but am quite certain he is the same person - I laid hold of him - he came with me, and said upon his word he was not on that side of the window; I am sure I saw the ear-rings between his fingers; I went for Payne, and my mother went out to Johnson, and he abused her very much, in my hearing when I came back, as she charged him with being concerned - he was at the window when I first went out - I said to my sister, "Yes, it is cut," and Johnson said, "So it is;" Payne took them both into custody; I cannot be mistaken in Luckhurst's person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you went out you saw Luckhurst? A. Yes; his fingers were full half of them inside the window - the ear-rings were between his fingers - he left them half in and half out - I pushed them in - they had laid close to the window - the breaking of the window would nearly have moved them - I saw them between his fingers - he was pulling them, but when he saw me, he went away; the breaking of the window could not have let them out, unless he had taken them out - they were supported by a wire, they would have fallen down flat, but not have gone outside - the bottom of the card was on the wood-work of the window, and the rest on the wire - but when he had them, they were quite off the wire - he walked away - I was soon after him - if he had offered to run, I should have hallooed out - if I had stopped to tell the people, he would have got away; when I took hold of him, I said, "You have cut the window;" he said, "No, upon my word, I was not on that side of the window;" he had got about three houses up Golden-lane, (our house is seven doors from the lane) he came back quietly, but I held him tight - a child, two years old, might have brought him back, he was so frightened; when I went out I saw a woman at the window - Johnson was by the side of the window, Luckhurst and the woman were talking together, and they walked different ways - the woman was near both the prisoners; Johnson was about two panes from Luckhurst, and the woman about one pane from Johnson, when I saw them - I did not see them speak - I saw the woman walk away, as I came out, before I got to the window - I was out in a moment - she was gone before I said the window was cut, but my sister watched them more than I did - Luckhurst saw me coming, and walked away just as I got to the door; when I got to the threshold of the door, I stood at the pane, and saw the ear-rings in his fingers, which were within the glass.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JOHNSON to JANE TYAS. Q. You said you laid hold of me when you came out - was it not your mother? A. We both laid hold of him; my mother, seeing Payne coming up, let him go; he walked away, and Payne after him; the woman was next to Johnson; Luckhurst was at the other side of the window, and he was a few paces beyond Johnson.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper. I was sent for, and found Luckhurst in custody, in Tyas' shop - I found on him a knife, a tooth-pick, and this piece of wire, turned round as it is now - a piece was broken out of the window; I tried the knife to the putty, and it fitted the marks, as if it had been used to break the glass. Richard Tyas pointed out Johnson, who was running towards Golden-lane; I ran, and brought him back - he said he knew nothing about it - he had only heard the boy say the window was broken; I found nothing on him. The ear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140064"></xptr>rings were left in the shop; I knew nothing of them till next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any thing particular in the knife? A. No, it is a pen-knife. The wire does not appear to have been used.</p>
               <p>JANE TYAS. The ear-rings were marked 17s. 6d.; they cost 12s.</p>
               <p>Mr. TYAS. The window was safe when I went out - the ear-rings were supported on wire; if that fell they must have fallen backwards.</p>
               <p>LUCKHURST's Defence. I am innocent. I never saw this young man till I was taken.</p>
               <p>JOHNSON'S Defence. I was passing the shop, and happened to look in; a woman and two young lads stood there - directly I came to the window the two young lads walked away - this boy came out, and said the window was cut; I looked at it, and said it was cut; they came and took this young man into custody. This girl's mother came and laid hold of me; I said I had nothing to do with it, and the people round said, "Young man - you had better walk on;" Payne came and laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>JURY to WILLIAM PAYNE. Q. Was Johnson running? A. Yes - he tried to escape from me; I only live twenty yards from the place; Tyas pointed him out to me - I ran immediately, and stopped him.</p>
               <p>JANE TYAS. My mother's name is Mary. The pane of glass which was broken is the one Johnson was looking through; I and my mother seized Johnson, but, on seeing Payne, we let go, and he popped off. When the pane was broken nobody was at the window but the prisoners and a woman; Luckhurst spoke to the woman, then separated from her, and came round.</p>
               <p>Six witnesses gave Luckhurst a good character.</p>

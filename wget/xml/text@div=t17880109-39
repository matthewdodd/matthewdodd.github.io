               <p>Look at the prisoner? - I do; I know him; he was convicted in February Session, 1784, for a highway robbery; I was here when he was tried; that is the man.</p>
               <p>What became of him after he was ordered to be transported? - He received sentence for seven years; I was present then, and brought him to the bar; after that there was a warrant of discharge, on condition that he should transport himself for five years in fourteen days.</p>
               <p>How did he get out of Newgate? - He was discharged by a warrant from your Lordship, dated the 29th of September, 1786; to leave the kingdom for five years, in fourteen days.</p>
               <p>See if that is the warrant? - I believe it is; Mr. Newman keeps it.</p>

               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen; I humbly beg leave to lay myself at your feet, to implore your mercy, not being guilty of returning from transportation, pursuant to my sentence; I received his Majesty's most gracious pardon, on condition of going abroad for five years; I immediately shipped myself on board the Jane, captain Walker, bound to the coast of Guinea; I was out in her most of the time, but was ill, and not able to do my duty when the ship was at Liverpool; I could not go on my second voyage; I was obliged to part with all my clothes, and being in a strange place, I was reduced to the greatest distress, and in want of necessaries; in this deplorable situation, (in a very sickly state) I came to London, in hopes my friends would assist me, that I might go out with the India fleet, which would have been done, if I had not been detained; but I hope I may be restored to liberty, and proceed to sea in the next fleet; when I shall as in duty bound, ever pray.

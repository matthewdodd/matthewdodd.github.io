               <p>Q. On the 23d of September were you in your warehouse? - Yes, I went there by desire of my master; it is about sixteen or twenty yards from the stable, and has a command of the stable and the hayloft; our first going there was about a quarter past six, Friday last, the 23d of October, I went up into the left of the warehouse, and the carman was then just bringing the cart round, and I heard somebody in conversation with Jessop whom he called to him.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark then? - It was; apparently the moon was young. Then he drew the cart up, and before Jessop took his horse out of his cart, Jessop and another went into the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same person as he called to him? - I cannot tell. They staid in five or six minutes, thereabouts, and Jessop came out and stood in the middle, of the way, as if looking out, and somebody past by the stable; then I came down and communicated what I had heard to Mr. James, and then we pursued and went round to meet them.</p>
               <p>Q. You returned again before you met them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you returned back again? - About ten minutes.</p>

            , my master's son. Then Mr. James and I went up into the lost; we had been there about three quarters of an hour, or something less, and a man came along; I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280034"></xptr>not perfectly see who it was that passed along; then I discovered Benwell go and look behind some hogshead opposite the lost where we stood; the hogsheads were in bye way.</p>
               <p>Q. Near the stable? - Yes; and then he went opposite the stable left door, and said, now! he was saying that seemingly to Jessop in the last; and Jessop said, are you ready? then Benwell said, down with it. Accordingly Jessop lowered the hay down to Benwell by his hands, to ease it on his back. The lost is some where about ten or eleven seet high; it was seemingly two trusses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Benwell take it? - Yes; and Mr. James, I and Thomas Weatherhead pursued him; Mr. James went on first and took him; when I came up he had hold of him, and I took the hay from Benwell by the desire of Mr. James; I deposited it under lock and key, and put a seal on, in a house belonging to Mr. Weatherhead. Benwell went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was he apprehended? - Saturday, the next morning. We let him go, because he gave us a reason; he said our carman had borrowed the hay of him, and that was to return it.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of the night was this that the hay was lowered down? - About a quarter to eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether your master had borrowed any hay? - Not to my knowledge. I got a warrant that night and took Jessop up that night, and Benwell the next morning, and they were taken before a justice and committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate. Where abouts is this lost situated with respect to the house, over the warehouse? - No, nearly opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. When this transaction was going forward, what distance might you be from the lost? - About sixteen or twenty yards. It lay aslant.</p>
               <p>Q. The premises both belong to the prosecutor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened a few days ago. You could see the person of the prisoner? - Yes, perfectly well; there was a lamp a little way from the stable door, and Jessop had a light in the lost; they were between us and the light.</p>
               <p>Q. That light was in a lanthorn, I presume, was it not? - They had a light in the lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not been watching for that purpose, should you have been able to have discovered alone that this was the prisoner at the bar that you see there? - Yes, perfectly well; I should have known him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any other of the prosecutor's servants access to this hay lost but the prisoner at the bar? - There was nobody had any business there but himself.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose they could get in occasionally? - If they did, they must get in from inside of the premises, because it is all surrounded with buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you see both the prisoners at the time that the hay was taken away? - Yes, as plain as I see you.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be before you came up with the parties in this transaction that passed at the hay lost? - Somewhere about sixty or a hundred yards. When I came up, as far as I heard, Benwell asked Mr. James if he thought he was coming to steal his hay? and told him that he had got that hay in return for some that he had lent the carman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Jessop been in the service of Mr. James and the other gentlemen? - I think about eight or nine months.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other person concerned in business with him? - Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You knew these persons before? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the night was this? - Just before eight o'clock.

            , the prisoner at the bar. I collared him, and he let down the hay; he had got the hay on his shoulder; I said, what I have got you at last; he seemed confused, and he said, I only came for two trusses of hay which your man owed me; I told him it was a very odd time of night to come for it; he said, very impudently, he had a right to come for his own when he liked; I asked him if he did not know the way to the counting house? he said, he knew nothing about the counting house. Jeremiah Keys came up, and I gave him the hay; I went into the house to see if Mr. Weatherhead was come home, to see what I was to do in the business; he was not at home.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that hay the same as you see him lift out of the lost? - Yes, it was. I went up to justice Staples and took out a warrant, and took Jessop up that night; I met him in a street in Old Gravel-lane, coming out of a public house. Previous to that, when I came back again, I went to the stable where Jessop was; he came out, and said, O, it is all right, it is two trusses of hay which I borrowed when Mr. Crowder's people were here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of hay being borrowed? - No. On the contrary I told him never to borrow any thing without coming to the counting house to propose it. The next day the officer apprehended Benwell that I gave the warrant to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate. You speak of this man coming slily down the lane. What do you mean by that? - A man's coming down in a skulking manner, more like a thief then an honest man, in a fly manner altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he walk fast? - Sly, in a creeping manner.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that he spoke in a low voice; don't you think the tone of voice was sufficient to be heard? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed this person and collared him. Don't you think if a person was to follow you, and collar you, would it not alarm you a little? - I don't think it would alarm me.</p>
               <p>Q. I am rather inclined to think it would. However he told you that it was hay that he had borrowed? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you pressed the business he seemed angry? - He did not seem to be the best pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. When you see Jessop in the stable, or hay lost, or cooperage, or somewhere, it is not material where, he told you the same story, and that he had repaid the man again? - He did so.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose at this time both the occupations of this Jessop and the other prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280036"></xptr> was ended? - Jessop had got to clean his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no partner but Mr. Weatherhead? - Nobody else.</p>
               <p>Jury. Will you take on yourself to say, that your lost was so well furnished with hay as to have no occasion to borrow any about this time? - I suppose there was then about ten or twelve trusses in.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you wanted any hay for any time previous to this? - I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have bought that hay? - The 2d or 3d of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there before this any occasion for borrowing any hay? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate. Did either of the prisoners state to you as to the time of the loan of the hay? - William Jessop told me that he had lent it about five weeks ago the last Thursday, and he said it was a time that a particular friend was at our house; and that was on the 5th of October, and on the 2d or 3d we had the load of hay in by our books.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jessop. Six weeks ago last Sunday morning I borrowed two trusses of clover hay of this man, and last Friday night this man came for it, and I paid him. I have witnesses that I borrowed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Benwell. I lent Mr. James's and Weatherhead's carman two trusses of clover, on the 13th of September, and I went to claim them the 23d of October, and Mr. James stopped me with them, and I told him it was for two trusses that I had lent his carman.</p>

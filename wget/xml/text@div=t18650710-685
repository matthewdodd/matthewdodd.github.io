                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 696). On the night of the 5th or morning of the 6th of June, a few minutes after twelve o'clock, I was on duty at the station in Arbour-square—Mr. Debenham came there—he came very hastily—he was running—he said to me, "Policeman, can you send one of your men to my house"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "I was in bed, I heard a noise as if a brick fell at the rear of my house, I got out of bed, opened the window, looked out, and saw a figure crouching down in a corner close to my kitchen window, I called out several times, 'Who are you, what do you want 1' but received no answer, I then went and called my assistant and we both looked out at the window together, I said, 'Do you see a dark figure standing there?' he said, 'Yes, 'I then called out once or twice, 'Who are you, what do you want? if you don't speak I will about you,'—I then fired and I think he fell"—I said to Mr. Debenham, "You had better go inside and speak to the acting-inspector"—he did so in my presence I then went with the prisoner and 697 <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> to his house—I said, "Where did you fire the pistol?"—he said, "I will show you"—I then passed through the house till I came to a back door that leads on to the lawn, that was barred and bolted—I unfastened it and there I saw the deceased lying on some flag stones, about three feet from the kitchen window—I said, "Here is the man, but I do not think he is dead"—his feet were just about the same distance from the window as his head—I felt him, he was quite warm—the prisoner then examined him and said, "He is quite dead"—I said to the other constable, "You remain here with the body till I come back"—I asked the prisoner where the pistol was, he said it was on the counter and he gave it to me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is a six-barreled revolver—I then took the prisoner to the station and handed him over to Inspector Hayes and gave him the pistol—the window from where the shot was fired was about forty-two feet from the place where I saw the man, it was in a slanting direc<lb></lb>tion—it is a bow-window, the man was on the flag stones—there is a lawn surrounding the house, that is divided by a little bit of wall and then it</p>

               <p>comes gradually up to the house; the lawn runs on to the flags—in order to get from the road a man would have to go through the front gates lead<lb></lb>ing from the Commercial-road, or climb over the wall and fence leading into the stable-yard—I did not myself ascertain which way the man came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This is a large house fronting the Commercial-road, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> it is—I do not know that it originally belonged to Mr. Ward, the great ship owner—there is merely a little carriage drive in front with an iron railing and gates—there is a very large plot of ground behind the house, some small houses abut on the right, in one of which the woman Keys, who has been examined, lives—Mr. Debenham's house is protected from that alley by a very high wall—a drop from the high part of that wall would be serious—I do not think it could be climbed from Mr. Debenham's side—I think the easiest way of getting in, supposing the gates were closed, would be over the iron railings in front of the house, he would then have to bear to the left and climb over a little low wall—any one might then get into the stable-yard—I should say that wall is about four feet high—he would then have to get over a small door or gate, not very high, in order to get to the back of the house—he would have to skirt along the back of the house until he got to the spot where I found the body, that is in direct propinquity to a win<lb></lb>dow, on a level with it; probably the spot of all others which a person would try if he wanted to break in; that would be the easiest way to get in—I have not been upon that boat, I was on reserve duty at the station—I have not heard of attempted burglaries at that house; I have been away for three years—the pistol is a breech-loader.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). About twenty or twenty-five minutes after midnight on Whit-Monday I saw Mr. Debenham at the station—I had previously had a communication from Stretch—on entering the station he said, "The man is dead"—I said, "You must consider yourself in custody, sir, any statement you make to me I may have to give in evidence against you"—he said, "My statement is quite voluntary, what I say to you I will say to a magistrate"—I then went with some constables and a stretcher to the deceased, leaving Mr. Debenham at the station—we went along the public road to Mr. Debenham's house—there were a good many people about walking in the public road—it was the night of Whit-Monday—those per<lb></lb>sons knew nothing of my business—when we got to the house I went through the surgery to the back of the house—I there saw a man lying on the ground, dead—I noticed a wound in his left temple and a great deal of blood on the ground where he was lying—I saw a hat, which I produce—I examined his pockets—he had a brass tobacco box with "T. Solomon" en<lb></lb>graved upon the lid, a short clay pipe, a latch key, the half of a rule, 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers, and eight lucifer matches—that was all he had upon him—I noticed the kitchen window; it was unfastened, I lifted it up; there were no marks of entry—it was an ordinary sash window, with the fastening between the two sashes not shut—there were shutters; they were closed and well secured inside—I found some of the inmates of the house up when I got there—I went back to the station and told Mr. Debenham that the body of the man had been sent to the workhouse—he then made a statement to me—I ex<lb></lb>amined the premises—I found a slate had fallen from the roof of the wash house, and within two feet of the deceased—the roof of the washhouse is about eight feet high—I examined the part where the slate had been dis<lb></lb>placed; I noticed no recent marks on the roof but that—I subsequently examined the palings adjoining the side of the washhouse—the tops of those</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186507100027"></xptr>
               <p>palings are very sharp and the tops were indented as if some one had stood upon them—those palings are a little over four feet high, about four feet two or three inches, and the paint looked as if the feet of some one had been scraping against it—I was shown the window from which the shot was fired; it is forty-two feet from where the deceased was standing—I noticed a chip from off one of the bricks of the wall—I first noticed that after the first examination at the police-court; it was on one of the bricks of the wall, which projects about three inches; it was about eight or ten feet from the ground—the wall falls back there about three inches leaving a sort of plinth or foundation, that was where the chip was—it is the wall of the house—it was very little distance from where the man was lying—the chip appeared to be recent—I found no indication of any attempt to break into the house—I am pretty well acquainted with the house—the front gates are left unlocked at night, but closed, only fastened with a latch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> With regard to this chip on the wall; was it between the window from which the shot was fired and where the man was found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; in that direction—the wall projects—behind where the deceased was standing there is a narrow alley and a corner leading round to the surgery—there is space enough there for more than four or five persons to stand, without being visible—it was rather darker at that time than it had been previously; it was rather cloudy; the place would be very much shaded—an entry might be made into the drug-room as well as through the kitchen window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Debenham—he is a sur<lb></lb>geon in practice—on the night of the 5th June I went to bed about twenty or twenty-five minutes to twelve—I don't know what time Mr. Debenham went to bed, he went before I did—after I bad been in bed some little time I was aroused by Mr. Debenham coming to my room—I went back with him to his own room—his window was open at that time—he told me that he had heard somebody in the garden and that he bad spoken to this person or persons ever so many times—he then pointed out to me where he thought the persons were and I certainly thought I could see an object against the wall—I could not make out what it was, whether it was a human being or not—Mr. Debenham called out very loudly indeed, "Come, who are you? if you don't speak I will shoot you"—he then cooked the pistol—there was a slight pause, and he fired—I looked out again and I could just see a white shirt on the ground, but it was so dark I could hardly see—I dare say what passed after I got to the window only occupied about a minute—Mr. Debenham then put on his trousers and went off for the police—at the time he was putting on his trousers he said, "I fired high; if I had thought I should have hit him I should not have fired"—I think he said, "If I had thought I should have <hi rend="italic">killed</hi> him, "but I have no doubt he meant hit him—I think <hi rend="italic">killed</hi> was what he said—I was down in the surgery walking to and fro till the police returned with Mr. Debenham; I did not go out, I did not think he would have been so long, the distance to the station is only four or five minutes—I think I was the last person to go to bed that night—the establishment consisted of Mr. Debenham, myself, and three female servants—the house stands back about fifteen yards from the footpath of the main road; there are windows fronting the road—there was nothing to prevent our going to the front windows and calling out to persons in the main road</p>

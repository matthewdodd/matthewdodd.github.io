                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of 65, Minories—on Saturday after-noon, 1st March, I was in Trafalgar Square, at 4. 50, when a stranger accosted me, entered into conversation, and we both walked along the Strand and into a public-house, where he asked me to take a glass of wine—the prisoner came in and spoke to us there—we were there five or ten minutes—the prisoner said that he had had a legacy left him, and that his lawyer's idea of a gentleman was the man who could show the most money—he showed some 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and wanted me to show my money—the third party showed his money too—I did not do so, but I said "I will pay for whatever you like to ask for"—after about ten minutes we all three left together, and went into two other public-houses—I drank a little in each of them, and then we went to Anderton's Hotel, Fleet Street; that was the fourth house we went to—we sat down in the coffee-room, and the third man wanted the prisoner to lend him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at five per cent.—the prisoner said he would do it, and went out to get a Government stamp—the third man was left in the coffee-room with me—the prisoner returned in two or three minutes, and said that he could not get a stamp—he said "I have bought two bags of an old woman, and I don't know what to do with them"—the third man said "I will have one to keep my money in," and he asked me if I would have the other—I said "Yes," and then the third party put his watch and his pocket-book into his bag, and the prisoner said to me "Put your watch and chain and purse into the other bag"—that was in order to show my confidence in him—I did so—mine was a gold watch and chain,</p>

               <p>I don't know the value of it—the prisoner tied the bag, and while he wag tying it the other man put his hat before my eyes, and when it was taken away there was a tied bag before me with something in it—I put it into my pocket, and they then wanted me to go out and buy a hat—I did not want one, but they were going to make me a present of one—I accepted their offer, and they wanted me to go to the shop and get the hat myself—we came out to get it, but there was no hat shop near—the prisoner then gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and wanted me to go into a hosier's shop and buy a scarf, but I refused—he then tried to get away, but I held him by the arm and ran him into the passage of the Portugal Hotel, which is close to the hosier's shop; there were two gentlemen there, and I told them I had been robbed—the prisoner tried to get away but I kept hold of him, and during the scuffle he dropped a bag containing my watch—there were three of us, and I had to give him a blow—a policeman was sent for—I had the other bag with a watch and chain in it in my pocket—I don't know what became of the other man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had come from on board a ship, and had been walking about for about an hour and a half—I had no refreshment before I met the stranger—we drank stout and bitter—at the hotel I had one Irish whisky, which the prisoner paid for, and I pitched away a second glass because I thought they were trying to get me <hi rend="italic">tight</hi>—they would not let me pay for any of the drink—we had cigars at the place we were at before going to Anderton's, which they paid for—we had nothing to eat—the bags were empty on the table, they were both alike—I knew it was a bag which the prisoner handed to me, but I did not know what was in it—we walked out together arm in arm, and I was in the middle—the bag was in my pocket—I do not know what the prisoner did with the other bag, it was not in his hand—I pushed him down in the passage of the hotel, and Í struck him once or twice—he has a black eye now—there was not much scuffling, he was made fast immediately.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was at the police-office that I found I had not got the bag containing my property—when I was holding him I did not know whether I had got ray own watch or not, but I believed I had not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the proprietor of the Portugal Hotel, Fleet Street—on Saturday evening, March 1st, I saw the prisoner and pro-secutor in the passage—I did not see the other man—I sent for a constable, and, before he came, I saw the prisoner drop this bag—I picked it up and gave it to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The scuffle took place near the stairs, and I was nearer the door—the prisoner was put down on the stairs, and he was knocked down afterwards by the prosecutor in the parlour—I picked up the bag, and gave it to the prosecutor, who said "This is the duplicate"—he said that before I gave him the bag, and he pulled one out of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> pocket—the one the prisoner dropped was opened in the parlour; the other wag opened at the station—I have no doubt the prisoner dropped the bag; I saw him drop is.</p>

Bank of England notes, a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Belfast note, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money; also a satin purse, containing a sheet of blank tissue-paper, folded up, to represent bank-notes</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tragedian; I reside in Nelson-street, Camden-town; I perform at the Princess's Theatre. On Friday night, 2nd May, before 12 o'clock, I was in company with Mr. and Mrs. Brazier, and Mr. Cook, leaving the theatre—on reaching the gateway in Oxford-street, I saw the prisoner—she stepped forward, and presented a pistol—Mr. Brazier instantly said, "Good God, she has got a pistol!"—a snap was heard immediately—she presented the pistol towards me; as far as I could judge, it was towards my breast, or my face—I think she made an exclams<lb></lb>tion, but I cannot recollect it—a policeman came up, and the prisoner was taken—she had formerly lived with me—I have been separated from her about two years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am engaged as an actor in the same theatre. I was leaving the stage door that night with Mr. Graham, as he has described—I saw the prisoner, in about three or four seconds, coming towards him, and with her hand she presented a pistol—I heard the click of it decidedly, and at the station I saw it unloaded—there was in it a ball, some powder, and other matters.</p>

I was on duty in Oxford-street that night—the first I saw was Mr. Graham and Mr. Brazier had hold of the prisoner; one had hold of each arm, and she was struggling on the footway—I went towards them, and I beard some one say, "I heard the click"—I went on my hands and knees—the prisoner's petticoat was nearly off—I at last found this pistol under her knees—I took it to the station, and saw the inspector draw the powder and ball from the pistol—the cap was not exploded—some one said, "I don't think the pistol would go off"—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "Oh, yes, it will; go to my place, and you will see where I have tried it on a door."</p>

                  </hi>. I believe I am illegitimately related to the prisoner. I had been in the habit of visiting at the house where she lived for the last three weeks before this occurrence—I am a reporter—this pistol belongs to me—I was in the habit of practising with this pistol in the yard of the house where the prisoner lived, for several days before this took place—on that Friday I was practising with it in the yard—I left there about half past 4 o'clock—when I left, I left this pistol on the table—I did not say anything to the prisoner about it—she was not there at the time I left the house—the detonating powder is still in this percussion cap—if the trigger had struck the pistol, with this cap on—the nipple, it would have exploded.</p>

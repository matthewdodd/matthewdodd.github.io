I live at 235, High Street, Shadwell, and keep the Britannia beer-house—about six a.m. on 19th October I was awoke, and in consequence of what was said to me I examined the house—I had fastened it all securely the previous night, the door with two bolts and the window with a latch—I found the window and door both open, and in the back parlour I found a square file, and a knife bent, neither of which belonged to me—I missed about 2lbs. of tobacco, some knives and forks, a table cloth, and a shawl—they were all safe the night before—three chests were broken open, and some coats, trousers, and shirts taken frome them—they did not belong to me—the amount of what I lost was about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was afterwards shown Joseph in custody at Newgate—he had lodged at my place for five or six nights, about six months ago—he was wearing a pair of trousers that I identified as belong<lb></lb>ing to a sailor who had lodged with me, and another man was wearing a coat that I identified—that man is not here—I can swear to this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>.)</p>

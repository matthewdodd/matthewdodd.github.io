               <p>Q. I believe he was recommended to your house by a friend of Messrs Bonds? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any bills being brought to your house, by Mr. Bennett, and when? - A. There were bills brought by Mr. Bennett, and deposited in Mr. Bond's hands, on the 13th of January last, they were three bills of exchange.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and tell me if that is one of the bills? - A. Yes; this is one that was left at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose were they left there? - A. They were entered short to Mr. Bennett's account.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Mr. Bennett again? - A. The 16th, three days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what passed between you and Mr. Bennett? - A. When he came in, he filled up two drafts for the sum of between three and four hundred pounds; I said, the account was overdrawn, and desired him to walk into the counting-house; I turned to his account in the ledger, and found it was as I supposed; I went to him in the counting-house, and told him the account was much over-drawn, he seemed surprised, and said, why, are not those bills that I left with you the other day, discounted? I told him, no it was not agreeable to discount them; he pressed very much for the money, and said, that some other securities that were at that time in Mr. Bond's hands, would cover more than the sum he wanted to draw.</p>
               <p>Q. What other securities were those? - A. They were India warrants; Mr. Bennett was very pressing for the accommodation, he said, it would only be for a day or two, I have the cheques. (Produces them.) The amount of them is 3761. 13s. 8d.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had not left those bills, and the warrants that you have described, should you have let him have had that sum of money? - A. It is a difficult question to answer what I might have done, but I rather think I should.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Mr. Bennett again? - A. On the 24th of the same month, nothing passed then respecting this bill; I saw him afterwards, at the Poultry-Compter, on the 31st of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation respecting this bill, previous to the 31st of January? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260058"></xptr>Mr. Fielding. Q. You visited this young man, I believe, pitying his distress; how long did you continue your persuasions to him to disclose the truth of the transaction before he said any thing upon the subject? - A. I made use of no persuasions to induce him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Tell us exactly the conversation that took place between you and Mr. Bennett in the Poultry-Compter? - A. I deplored his situation that he should be in such a place as that, and told him his account was considerably over-drawn; he said, the warrants which we had in our hands sufficiently covered Mr. Bonds from any loss; I told him we had discovered that the warrants were forgeries; Mr. Bennett said, if you know that, I am a dead man; Mr. Bennett was certainly very much embarrassed at the time he said that; I immediately added, after saying that the warrants were forgeries, that I supposed the bills were of the same description; he said, they were; he pressed me very much that those things should not come forward; I told him it did not rest with me; Mr. Bennett mentioned a person that owed him some money, a Mr. Asbee, he told me the amount, which he said was six hundred pounds; that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that note in your hand again, look at the indorsement, and tell me whose hand-writing that appears to be? - A. I believe it to be Mr. Bennett's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him write? - A. Oh, frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. From the knowledge you have of his handwriting, do you believe that to be his? - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the acceptance of that bill, and tell me whose hand-writing you believe that to be? - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fidding. Q. You have told me, very honourably, that you rather think you might have let him have the cash he required without regarding any security? - A. Not any but those securities.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 13th of January last he brought the three bills? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You entered them, you say, short; that is, that you did not look upon his deposit of these bills as equivalent to cash? - A. No, not at the time I made the entry, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact, you did not give him credit for having paid in so much in cash as would have been the amount of these bills? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q.These bills you had no idea of discounting? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him it would not have been agreeable to have discounted these bills at all? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you, when he wanted this three or four hundred pounds, that the India Bonds deposited with you would cover the whole of what he had over-drawn, and the advances you were about to make? - A. He said, it would cover the account.</p>
               <p>Q. Not at all adverting to these three bills of Exchange that he had deposited on the 13th? - A. I had my mind in contemplation that we had those bills, and though we did not chuse to discount them, they certainly might be considered as an additional indicement to advance money.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact, you did not discount them, nor had you any intention to discount them? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. And he left them there without asking any money at all upon them? - A. I do not recollect particularly what passed; only I remember receiving the bills, and entering them short.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, on the 16th, he said, the India warrants would cover the whole? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you advanced the money, and nothing more was done; were these bills at any time, to your knowledge, put into any channel of negociation? - A. There was nothing took place respecting these bills from that time till the forgery was discovered, they remained in our house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw this unhappy young man in his confinement, you are correct in the language he used, he said, if you had discovered them to be forged, then he was a dead man? - A. I would not say so if it was not so.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not say that he had any connection with the forgery of them? - A. No.</p>

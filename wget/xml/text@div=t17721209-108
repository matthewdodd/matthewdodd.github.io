I was at the Yorkshire Grey, Bond's Stables, on Saturday the 7th of November, in company with some friends; at half after one I got into a coach to go home, the coachman stopped about three yards on the other side of the May-pole; I was asleep being very much in liquor; I was waked by the coachman, who is the prisoner, who was in the coach; I said what do you do here; he said he made bold to come into the coach to wake me, to know which way to drive; I told him to drive down old <placeName id="t17721209-108-crimeloc513">Gravel-lane</placeName>

I told him I thought it was too much; he then agreed to take 5 s. I felt in my pocket and missed my money from both my breeches pockets; I said d - n you, you rascal, you have robbed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177212090063"></xptr> me; he said, Sir, you forget, you picked up a woman in St. Paul's Church-yard, and bid me set her down at the May-pole; I was inflamed with passion; I knocked him down with my fist; I charged the watch with him, and he confessed he stole the money out of my pocket, when I was asleep: we searched the coach and found five guineas and a half in the boot; he said when I waked he was in a flurry and might drop some of it.</p>
               <p>- Hayes, the watchman, confirmed the prosecutor's evidence, of what passed when the coach arrived at his own house.</p>
               <p>- Townsend deposed that he heard the prisoner confess stealing the prosecutor's money.</p>

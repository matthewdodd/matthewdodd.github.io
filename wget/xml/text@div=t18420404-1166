                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the night of the 21st of March, about twenty minutes to ten o'clock, in High-street, Hoxton, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—just as I came within six paces of Goodwin's shop, which is in that street, I saw the two prisoners (<hi rend="italic">I knew Cheek before this, but not Tabor</hi>) I could see their faces—they were standing with their faces to the shop, as close to it as they could, within a foot of it—I was on the same side of the street—there was a gas-light at the opposite house, and one in the window of the shop, or on the counter—just as I had seen them they separated—Cheek walked towards me, and the other in the opposite direction—as I came to the wind<lb></lb>dow I observed it had been cut or broken—I immediately turned round and called to Cheek—he did not pay any attention to me—I followed, caught hold of him, and brought him close to the shop-door, thinking to get him inside to secure him—the door was closed, and as I attempted to get him in, the prisoner Tabor ran away—I let Cheek go and followed Tabor, and as he ran away he put his hand in his left-hand trowsers pocket, and threw some sealing-wax away, more than once—I saw it as be threw it away—I caught him by the collar—he immediately cringed towards the ground, with his hand in his pocket, with the sealing-wax now produced in it—he drew his hand from his pocket while I held it—I caught the hand with the sealing-wax in it, and picked up some which fell from his hand at the time—I called to a boy to pick up what I had seen him throw away, and saw him pick it up—he gave it to me—I took Tabor to Mr. Goodwin's shop—Cheek was gone—I found nothing but a knife upon Tabor—I took him to the station—on my return I found Cheek looking into a shop-window in Robert-street, the next street to the prosecutor's—I asked him if he was not the lad who was down at the window that had been broken—he said he was—I searched him and found a knife and 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him, which I have—I examined Goodwin's window the same night—the panes of glass were set with putty—the window had a piece broken or cut out of it—I have got it here—there was marks of a knife on the putty, which appeared quite fresh—I applied two knives to the putty next morning, and found they both agreed with the marks.</p>

               <p>stick-liquorice you saw thrown away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there was some missed from the window—the points of the knives answered to the marks on the window, which appeared fresh—I could not see the prisoners' faces when I first came up—when they turned round I could see their side faces—they were both equally close to the shop-window, standing side by side—I was on the same side as they were—the prisoner Tabor was nearest to the pavement, but equally near the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Goodwin. I re<lb></lb>member the night in question—there was some Spanish-liquorice, sealing-wax, and slate-pencil, inside the broken pane, close by the glass—the hole was large enough for a small hand to be put through and to reach the sealing-wax—I do not know that anybody had been in the shop that night—I remember Hungerford coming with the prisoner Tabor—I had Dot missed anything before that—I had not looked—I keep a young woman, but she had not been in the shop since the afternoon, as she was nursing my baby—I fasten the door of the shop because the parlour is a good distance from it—I have a gas-light in the shop—I had some sealing-wax like that pro<lb></lb>duced in my window, of the same colours and the same size—I cannot say is mine—I also had some stick-liquorice—when Tabor came it was all gone from the window—I bad seen it there in the early part of the afternoon—I had not sold any after that—my husband was out all day—I never saw either of the prisoners before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am groom to Mr. Smart, of Park-place—the prisoner was his valet. Last Saturday night I was with the prisoner in my master's kitchen—he was partly intoxicated—I had had no quarrel with him then—(we had had a few words a fortnight before, but it had passed over)—on Saturday night he struck at me twice in the side with a table-knife—it penetrated my clothes, but did not affect my person—I called a police-man, and he was taken—he said before the officer that if he had got the third he would have done for me then—that was in consequence of my say<lb></lb>ing that he had stabbed at me twice.</p>

                  </hi>. I work in the stable. I happened to be in Mr. Smart's kitchen—I saw the prisoner attempt twice to strike the prosecutor—he had not given him any provocation that I heard—I picked up the knife and gave it to the policeman—the prisoner was tipsy.</p>

I was called in and took the prisoner—I received this knife from Brewer—the point of it is turned, as if by something that resisted it—the prisoner had been drinking, but he walked very well to the station-house—the prosecutor asked him what reason he had for attempting twice to stab him—he said if he had had the third he would have done it then.</p>

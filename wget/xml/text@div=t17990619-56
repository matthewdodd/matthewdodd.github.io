             sworn. - I am the wife of Thomas Fenn: I was robbed of a feather-bed last Monday morning before eleven o'clock; I did not see him take it, but was informed of it by a little girl that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190053"></xptr>minds the shop, she called to me; I pursued the man, and got the bed of him, he was about two hundred yards from my door with the bed; he stopped when I called out, but said nothing, but that he found the bed; I keep a broker's-shop, and it was by the side of the shop, on the pavement; I am sure it is my bed, there is no particular mark on it; the tick was mended, it is a very indifferent tick, but a good feather-bed; I have not got it here, but have kept it from that time to this; he was going from the shop, to another court, called Blue-bear-yard, in Eagle-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found the bed laying in the street, I took it up, and the girl told me to stop, for it was her mother's bed; I said, then she should have it; then I saw that woman, and said, if this is your bed you shall have it, and she took it from me; she said, now for your pains you shall carry it back again; says I, if it is your's I will carry it back with all my heart.</p>

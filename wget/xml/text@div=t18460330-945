                  </hi>. I live at Walham-green, and am an auctioneer. About half-past one o'clock in the morning of the 24th of March I was in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with Mr. Barnard—we stopped just below the Garrick's Head, in Bow-st.—I was getting out—I tripped from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and felt some one put his arms round me—I also felt his hand or his fingers in my right-hand waistcoat pocket—there was a crowd round—I had a watch and a sovereign in that pocket—I am sure it was the same person who had his arm round me whose hand I felt in my pocket—it was the person who pretended to catch me when I tripped—I am sure it was the same person—there was but one person who touched me—I was sober—after I felt that, I saw the same man making off, and tried to catch hold of him—I had not missed anything; I merely felt the action of the hand in my pocket; I had no time—I did not miss anything till my watch was picked up—I heard it drop—I judged what it was—I then put my hand to my pocket, and it was gone—it was picked up and brought to me.</p>

O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You heard the sound of the watch on the pavement before you missed it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I heard it the instant I caught hold of him—I stumbled out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the watch was loose in my pocket—I made a grasp at the man who came to my aid, and heard the watch fall—I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. You say you ran after somebody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I rushed at him—I had not far to run—he made away in the crowd—I should think it was half a minute after I stumbled when I heard the watch drop—I had got on my feet, and caught hold of the man's coat, and I heard the watch fall—it was then hardly four yards from where I stumbled—it fell directly I got on my legs and made a catch at the man—it was certainly not more than half a minute from the time I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> till I heard the watch fall.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 106.) At a quarter before two o'clock on the morning of the 24th of March I was in Bow-street—I saw a crowd opposite the theatre—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drive up, and the prosecutor got out—he made a stumble as he stepped out—I saw the prisoner rush to him, take him round the waist, and suddenly leave him—the prosecutor went to lay hold of him, and I did so at the same time—as I was passing through the crowd after him I heard something drop—I secured the prisoner, and took him to the station—the watch was picked up by another constable—the prosecutor had got two or three yards from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> when I heard something drop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prosecutor was a little the worse for liquor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he made a stumble, and was prevented from falling.</p>

                  </hi>. I was standing facing the theatre—I saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> come, and the prosecutor get out—he made a bit of a stumble—the prisoner went</p>

               <p>to him and saved him from falling, and at the same moment a watch fell upon the ground, close against my feet—I did not see where it fell from, but I saw the prisoner lay hold of the prosecutor round the body, and put his hand into one of his waistcoat pockets—I saw him leave the prosecutor, and the watch was kicked from my feet to the middle of the pavement—the officer took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not the watch fall upon the pavement at the moment of the stumble? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and it was picked up at a little distance, where it was kicked to—I saw the prisoner's hand at the prosecutor's right-hand pocket—I cannot say in the pocket, but on the pocket—if he meant to save him from falling his hand would naturally go round him.</p>

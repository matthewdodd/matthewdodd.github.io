             sworn. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. I do; on the 3d of this month I met the prisoner at a public house, where me and my husband was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go home with you. - A. Yes, just to have something to drink, and to have a dish of tea at my own house, and then she went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing. - A. Yes, my necklace from my neck, which was two rows of gold beads, and a locket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that necklace on your neck when you was at the public house. - A. Yes, and when I went home with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you took it off your neck when you got home. - A. No, I'had been rather ill, so I laid down on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been ill before you went to the public house. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking. - A. No, I was very ill.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any more beer or gin at your lodgings. - A. I sent for a glass of gin to treat her for her kindness, my son fetched it for her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fall asleep when you was on the bed. A. I did; I left her with my own child to have a drop of tea.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you awake. - A. It might be an hour or two, I cannot say, but when I awoke she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that your necklace was on your neck when you laid down on the bed. - A. Yes, instantly I awoke, I missed my necklace just doing so (the witness putting her hand round her neck).</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the room besides your child, and you, and the prisoner. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What age was the child. - A. Nine years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your necklace or any part of it afterwards. - A. Yes, on the same night, at about eight o'clock, the officer shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of your necklace. - A. I gave one pound four shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner a long time. - A. Only by being in the public house, having a pint of beer, she behaved very civil and very kind.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you sober. - A. I was not sober; I am sure I had my necklace on when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your husband at home with you in the room part of the time. - A. Yes, he insisted on her having something to drink for her goodness in seeing me home.</p>

             sworn. I am the husband of the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the public house with the prisoner. - A. Yes. I told them to go home and get a dish of tea, I thought it would do them good; I do not know but they might be both in liquor; they had not been long in my company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go home afterwards. - A. Yes, and the prisoner was in the room with my wife; I told them to make themselves comfortable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether your wife had her necklace on in your room. - A. I did not observe it then, I saw she had it on when she went out of the public house, it was a gold necklace, a double row of beads; I allowed them a dram a-piece; I went back to the room in the company of her man, whom I thought to be her husband; she was sitting and having some tea there; if I had known it was not her husband, I would not have had any thing to have said to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your wife, was she laying down. A. I do not think she was; I did not come back again till my daughter came and informed me the necklace was gone; my daughter informed me where to find her; I found her at another public house sitting on the pipe box; my daughter fetched an officer, she was searched, and the duplicate of the necklace was found on her; I went to the pawnbroker's and saw a part of the necklace.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. The prisoner and your wife had been drinking too much. - A. They were not so well as if they had been at work.</p>

               <p>up the shop in a very poor way, and no sooner had he got it fitted up, than I saw a bill in the window for the shop to let, and he let it to another man without my consent—I still lived on the premises—the bill was taken down in four or five hours—I had not time to remonstrate with him about it—he told me he had re-let it for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the young man came and lived there—he is not here—about the 16th of December, as I had a foundation to dig out in East-street, Manchester-square, I brought a young man down with me to get my wheel-barrow out of my yard, and it was not to be found—I had seen it there about the 12th—I never lent it to the prisoner—he made use of it one day without my consent, and I scolded him for doing so, and turned his lime out of it—the stove was taken out of my shed—he had nothing to do with the stove—I did not miss it till I found it on some other premises which he had taken—I also found the iron pot on some premises of his—I had kept that and my hammer in the shed, and some iron piping—after he got possession of the parlour, he pulled down the wooden partition, and placed it in the shed—I asked him what busi<lb></lb>ness he had to do that—he said, "Oh, I shall make it all good, I have got it safe in the shed, and when I leave your house I shall make it good."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live at Paddington. I was em<lb></lb>ployed by the prisoner to go and open some drains in the yard of this house which I did—I used the barrow in the business—it stood in the yard—I fetched bricks and things I wanted in it—I was there two or three days doing sundry jobs—the place was so bad no one could go into it—the water was all overflowing the yard—Mr. Jones did not see me with the barrow, but he came into the yard—the water-butt was there—he abused me, and told me I ought not to move the water-butt—I said I should replace it—there were words between him and the prisoner, and the prisoner said, "I gave you 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this old lumber, do you want it again? if so, give me my money back"—I remember that.</p>

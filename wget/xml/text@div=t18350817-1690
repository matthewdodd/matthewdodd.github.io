                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 20th of July, I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183508170007"></xptr>
               <p>going my rounds, about one o'clock in the morning—I had heard it striks twelve, but it had not struck one o'clock—I was a little distance form Mr. Moore's, a cheesemonger's shop, in Great Portland-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone, and observed a person's legs sticking throught the fan-light over the shop door—I went up, and as I got up somebody fell inside the shop—it was the person whose lege I had seen through the fan-light—I knocked at the shop door, and was answered by a person inside, saying it was all right, but if I did not think so, they would open the front door—I still knocked at the private door, and Mr. Moore answered me form the bed-room window—I alarmed him, and then went to the corner of the house, where I could see the back part of the house, and in about two or three minutes, I heard a noise in the parlour—I went to the parlour shutter—the shutters were thrown open, the bottom sash thrown up, and the prisoner was endeavouring to make his escape out of the window—I pushed him back, and asked what he wanted there—I took him into custody—he was never out of my custody—there was a gas-light in front of the shop, on the same side of the way—I observed it was not about an hour before—the other lamps were all lighted—I cannot tell how this one was put out—the glass was whole, and it was a calm night—I found a spike in the grating of the sewer, about ten yards form the door—I found it fitted to the iron bars of the fan-light—a person could not get without removing the spikes—three were removed, and one I found—I never could find the others—I could not see any more in the grating.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Great Portland-street, in the parish of Saint Marylebone. I went to bed on the night of the 19th of July, about ten o'clock—the house was quite safe then—the fan-light is always kept open, to air the shop, and the iron bars prevent people coming in—they were quite safe that night—next morning I observed three spikes broken off the iorn bars, and the other bent down—that would enable the prisoner to get in sideways—the fan-light is above the shop door about six feet high—I do not see how he could get up without help—the prisoner had been in my service—he came on the 10th of January, and I diacharged him in February—I have a wife, a niece, a man servent, one female lodger, and a nephew—there was no acquaintance between the prisoner and my niece, nor the lodger, I am quite confident—I keep a till in my shop, but leave nothing in it at night but a few halfpence—I should think he would know that—the shop goods are in the shop at night—when he was taken he said nothing to me as to why he came to the house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and found these articles - he first said the seal was his own, but when Mr. Tegart claimed it, he said it was his - Mrs. Tegart claimed the brooch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe the house is handsomely furnished? A. Yes; and there were many articles of more value than these.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

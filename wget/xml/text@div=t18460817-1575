                  </hi>. I am the wife of General Thomas Grosvenor, of No. 42, Lower Grosvenor-street, in the parish of St. George Hanover-square. The prisoner Jones was in our employ for about two months pre<lb></lb>vious to the 10th of July—on that evening I was at the theatre with my son—I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock—I told the pri<lb></lb>soner he might go to bed also—he appeared at that time to be perfectly sober—the key of the house is usually hung up in the entrance-hall—next morning I went to the General's dressing-room—there was a box there which had been corded and locked—I found the cord was taken from it, and the box was rifled of all its contents—I missed certain articles from the box, which were produced before the Magistrate—my attention was called to the General's writing-box—it was locked at the time, but I saw it opened—I do Rot know, of my own knowledge, whether there had been any money in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid to General Grosvenor. On the 10th of July I saw Jones in the General's dressing-room, about eleven o'clock—he asked me in a very careless sort of manner, what the General's blue box was—I told him it was the General's money-box—on Saturday morning, the 11th of July, I recollect going into the General's dressing-room—there had been a fire lighted by somebody on the preceding night, and there was a vast quan<lb></lb>tity of burnt paper—the only piece left unburnt was this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) which is part of a letter—it was then about a quarter past seven o'clock—I went to call Jones about eight, and he did not make any answer—after the discovery of the robbery, I went to clean the grate in the dressing-room, and this piece of cord came down the chimney with my sweeping about-'—I had dusted the box myself on the Friday, and this cord was round the box—this is the key of the street door—on the Friday following I found some keys behind a lot of old books in the General's dressing-room.</p>

On the morning of the 11th of July, Jones came there about ten minutes before seven o'clock—he came in alone, and was followed by a labouring man, the prisoner Stokes, and another woman—Jones ordered some whiskey when he came in—I did not serve him with that, but recommended him to take soda-water, and some was provided for him—the persons with him had some ale, which Jones paid for—the amount of the whole was ls.—he tendered a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to pay for it—he was a little intoxicated at the time—I sent the servant out to get change for the note, and I returned the full change to Jones—the two females had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he had four sovereigns and a half, and three half-crowns—he then had some more soda-water in the parlour—the labouring man went into the parlour with him—I ordered him out of the parlour, and he went into the tap-room—the two females were at the bar—Jones paid for the soda-water he had in the parlour, and some ale—he pulled out of his pocket three bracelets, a gold seal, and several other things, and</p>

On the evening of the 16th of July I took Stokes in Broad-street, Bloomsbury—I told her I wanted her to go to the station—she made no reply then, but, in walking along, she said she had nothing but 'what the man gave her, the change of a sovereign and the key—I had not said anything to her—when she was at the station she said she had had the change of two sovereigns; and in the morning, when I was taking her to the police-court, she said she had had a scent-box, and it was pawned.</p>

On the 11th of July I apprehended Jones in Grosvenor-street, about one o'clock in the day—he was "sensibly drunk,"in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I found on him a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and three 101. Newmarket notes; some spectacles, rings, seals, and a brooch—I took them to the station; and in the evening, when Jones was sober, I told him the charge was for robbing General Grosvenor of a quantity of bank-notes and jewel<lb></lb>lery—he said he did not know what could induce him to do it; he supposed it was to make himself look big and <hi rend="italic">flash</hi>—he said, "you found the money all right; I will defy you to prove that I changed any of it; I had a fiw shillings of my own"—on the day of the committal I asked what could in<lb></lb>duce him to burn the bank-books and the papers, and the General's will—he said, "If I did it, I do not know that. I did"—nearly all the articles have been recovered, and are here—a miniature, a row of pearls, and the topaz ear-rings, are still missing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Wood. On the 23rd of October, the prisoner came to our house as a servant of all work—she remained till the 27th, and left that evening without any notice whatever, and took a band-box and basket with her—she left a large box behind—her husband came on the following morning to solicit us to take her back again—the trunk was her own—I refused to take her back—she came on the 30th for her trunk—I requested her to allow me to see it before she left—she came up stairs—the other servant was with me—she opened her box, and took out a tea-tray belonging to me—I had asked if any thing of mine was in the box, and she said there was nothing belonging to me—I also found two knives, two forks, one table-cloth, and one flat iron—Brooks, the constable, came and took possession of them—they are my husband's—she had never used these things—her trunk was kept up stairs in her bed-room—the things were in the kitchen when she came.</p>

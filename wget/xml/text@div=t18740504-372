On the morning of April 2nd., at 12.45, I was on duty at the corner of Friar Street, Black friars Road—a cabman came to me—he said something to me—at the same time the witness Earl came to me, and said that three men had knocked a man down—I went with him up Friar Street and Wellington Street, and saw the prisoner Gray standing in a doorway—I caught hold of his shoulder and said to Earl "Is this one of the men?"—he said "Yes, that is one of them that ran away"—267 <hi rend="italic">M</hi> came up and said "I know where the other two men are"—I took Gray across to the opposite side of the street to No. 1, Green Street, where Davis lives, and knocked at the door—the answer was "Who's that?"—I said "A policeman"—Davis said "What do you want?" I said "I want to see you"—he opened the door and said "I have not been indoors, I have only just come indoors"—I said "You will have to come outside"—he did so—267 said "I know where the other man is"—we went to a mat maker's in Green Street, where Connolly works some<lb></lb>times—Connolly was concealing himself underneath some shavings in the shop—he was brought back to 1, Green Street—we placed the three prisoners together, and Earl said "I believe them to be the other two"—I said I should take them into custody on suspicion of knocking down a man in the Blackfriars Road and robbing him—Davis said "I am innocent "—the prosecutor afterwards came to the station in company with another constable and Earl—the prisoners were placed in the dock—the prosecutor pointed to Gray and said "That is the man that threw me down, and the others rifled my pockets"—they made no answer—the prosecutor's right side was covered with dirt; he appeared as if he had fallen or been thrown down—the inspector asked whether he had lost any money—he said "No; I have got plenty of money about me, though," and he pointed to his right side, but did not show any.</p>

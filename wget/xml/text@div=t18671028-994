                  </hi> I am single, and live at 15, Mercer Street, Long Acre—I was in Compton Street, Soho, on 6th October, with a friend—I saw the prisoner and a man there with other persons—she struck a young woman who was with her brother and knocked her down, and the man kicked her—I called out, "Shame! "and the prisoner said she would serve me the same, and struck me in the face and tore my bonnet—I called out, "Police! "and a policeman came up and sent her away—I then walked across the road—I went to put my bonnet on to go home—the prisoner then came across the road with the man—ho had a knife in his hand, and said, "Stick this into her"—the prisoner then struck me in the side with the knife, and ran away—the knife was not open when the man gave it her, she opened it herself—I bled very much, and was taken to the Middlesex Hospital.</p>

                  </hi> I was with the last witness on the 6th October—we were speaking to some young women in Compton Street, when the prisoner came up and struck one of the young women, and knocked her down—she was with a man, her brother I believe, and he kicked her when she was down—the prosecutrix said, "What a shame! "and the prisoner said, "I will serve you the same"—a policeman then came and sent her away—the prosecutrix and myself then crossed the road, she was putting the strings on her bonnet, the prisoner came over and struck her again—the man gave her a knife and said, "Stick this into her"—she opened the knife and stuck it into her side—the prosecutrix called out that she was stabbed—the prisoner was quite close to her.</p>

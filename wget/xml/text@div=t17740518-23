            . I am a surgeon: I was sent for on the 2d of February between six and seven o'clock, to look at this child; accordingly I went and found it in the lap of a woman in Mr. Cauldwell's kitchen; a considerable parcel of the small intestines came through a small wound about three quarters of an inch above the navel; I could not return them into the abdomen till I had dilated the wound; when I had cleaned and returned them, and stitched up the wound, the child was then alive. I had a good deal of difficulty in reducing these intestines into the place; some few ashes or cinders were upon them; they were not wounded: the wound appeared as if it had been made with a sharpish instrument, though not a knife; it was rather too irregular to be made by a knife; I saw no other particular marks; I think the wound could not be made by a blunt stick; it might be by meeting some sharp thing in the soil, or in throwing the child down, or by a nail in taking it up. I believe the wound and the intestines being so long exposed to the cold air were the occasion of the child's death; when the child was dead I opened it before the coroner, and could plainly discover which were the intestines that had been exposed to the cold air, because they were discoloured. The child lived seven or eight hours; I opened it to see if the wound had been done with a knife, because I think if it had, it was almost impossible but some of the intestines must have been wounded; upon the whole I have no doubt but the child's life was lost by this wound and the intestines coming so out of its body.</p>

            . I am mistress of the work-house: the prisoner was brought to the work-house on the 2d of February, between six and seven o'clock, in an hour after the child was brought; I was desired to take care of the child, as it would be the means of saving two lives if I could preserve it; I sat up all night with the child; it lived till half past four in the morning; then I went to the prisoner and told her the child was dead; I asked her how she could commit so rash an action, and how the wound came on the belly; she said she believed it was by poking it down the vault with a stick, but she believed she was out of her senses when she did it, or else she had not done it.</p>

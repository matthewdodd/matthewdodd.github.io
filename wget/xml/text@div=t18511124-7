On the evening of 28th Oct., I saw the prisoner in London-wall, on a grey mare, galloping as fast as it could go—I saw him attempt to turn the corner of Coleman-street—the horse fell down, and the prisoner endeavoured to run away—in a few seconds there was a cry of "Stop thief!"—I was holding the horse, and gave it to a gen<lb></lb>tleman, and went and stopped the prisoner—several persons came up and said in my presence that he had stolen the horse—the prisoner said,: It is a bad job; I got on the horse, and he ran away with me.",</p>

On 28th Oct., I bought a grey mare—I had not been upon her—I led her to the door of Mr. Abbott's public-house, in Coleman-street—before I went in, I saw the prisoner—he asked me if he might hold the mare—I refused; but I could not open the door to go in; and I said to him, "You can hold it, if you please, for a moment"—I went in, and I was not in two minutes before I heard the horse go—I ran out, and gave an alarm, "Stop thief!"—I saw the horse about twenty or thirty yards off, and the prisoner on it, going very fast—it was stopped; it was my mare—I had given 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—they tell me it is worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a collecting clerk, in the service of Messrs. Bar<lb></lb>nett. Hoare &amp; Co., bankers, of Lombard Street—on the morning of Satur<lb></lb>day, 5th February last, I went out on my collecting rounds—I received, at Messrs. Coutts' bank 4184<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was partly paid by four notes, of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; two of those notes were numbered 82,305 and 82,306<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I receive notes I write on them the name of the bank where I receive them; I did so in this case—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two notes, and I wrote on them "Coutts', 5th February"—they were perfectly clean and quite new when I received them—besides the 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd which I had received from Coutts', I had in my wallett some more notes, amounting to 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I went from Coutts' to the Birkbeck Bank, Chancery Lane—I put my cheques on the counter, and called out "Barnett's charges"—I took out my notes and ran quickly through to see that they were right, and then put them in my case—I found them right, and put the amount on a slip of paper—the case was open on the counter at that time, and my hand was on it—some person touched me and said "You have dropped something"—I looked down and saw a piece of paper, like a cheque, at my feet—I stooped down and picked it up—there was nothing on it, and I put it down again—it was blank paper—I got up directly, and I fancied I saw a hand leaving the case—I looked in the case and saw the notes were gone—I called out, and then ran to the door, and looked up and down the street, but I could see no one—the bank is close to some steps, where you go down into Staple's Inn—the number of the notes were obtained from the different banks, and advertisements were published and bills issued, offering rewards to any person who should discover the thief.</p>

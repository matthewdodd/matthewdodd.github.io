                  </hi>. I keep the King's Arms tap, in New Palace-yard, Westminster. It is underneath the hotel—I rent it of the proprietor, Mrs. Elizabeth Herbert—I do not life there, but Webb and Spear, two of my servants do—on Tuesday morning, 30th Sept, when I went to the tap, about half past 8 o'clock, I found the bar window open—a little piece of the window had been broken previously, but more glass had been broken out, and the catch drawn back, so as to enable the window to be opened from without—the door of the bar had been tried to be forced open from the out<lb></lb>side, by the tap room poker, and ar screw driver, which was found, and which did not belong to the premises—I had fastened the window when I left, at 4 o'clock that morning—we keep open till 2, 3, and 4 o'clock sometimes—I had also locked the bar door, and taken the key home with me; that was forced open by the screw driver—that room communicates with a waste or store room, leading to the cellar—I went into the cellar, and there found a box belonging to a club which is held at my house once a week; the lid was broken open, and three locks forced open, and I found a lot of papers strewed about the beer cellar—I do not myself know that there had been money in that box, it was kept in the strong room—some bread and most was brought to me; I do not know where it was found—I saw some brandy there, and I missed some, and I also mused a pair of scissors—I know the prisoners by using my house—I saw them in the house that morning up to 4 o'clock, when I shut up the house; there were eight or ten persons there, and they all went up together, the prisoners among them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. Hudson. On 30th Sept., I went to bed between twenty minutes and half past 4 o'clock in the morning—my fellow servant, Spear, went at the same time; we slept in the same room—I was awoke by Spear, between 6 and 7 o'clock; he had got put of bed—I went out into the passage which leads from the tap room to the back yard, and saw Cole in the tap room; it was between light and dark—he was doing nothing—he was standing still—he told me he had been locked in—I told him that it was usual for the master and me to go round with the candle, and see that everybody was out of the house, and there was not a soul in the house when we shut up—he made no reply to that—I and the <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> had gone round with a candle, and there was no one in the house then—there was another man in the passage, but I could not see his face—I was stripped—I went to put on my things, and while I was doing so, the men went away—I afterwards saw Allen, the Hackney carriage attendant, and went round the premises with him—I could not see that anything was disturbed, until master came and went to the store room—some bread and meat was brought into the tap room; I cannot say where from—there was no meat in the tap room, or anything lying about there when I went in first.</p>

               <p>I jumped up in my bed, and saw a man's band removing my clothes off the top of the drawers—I did not see the man, only his back as he turned away—I afterwards saw him in the passage—I have known Cole about six months, by using the house—I cannot say it was him, it was so dark—I did not see any other man—the man in the passage said he had been fastened in all night, and would I let him out—I said "No; I cannot do that, I have no key, you must stop here till Mr. Hudson comes"—I do not know who that man was—I thought it might have been so, and did not notice him, and came away—I afterwards went over the premises, and found some bread and meat in a dark cupboard in the passage, and two bottles of brandy; they were full, or nearly so.</p>

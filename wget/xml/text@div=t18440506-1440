                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Hyde Park-street—the prisoner was my housemaid. About seven o'clock, on the 3rd of March, she asked to go out for a couple of hours, to see her relation—next morning she told me her mother was dead, and requested me to let her go and see her buried in Wales—I told her to get her things and go—next day I gave her her wages—the things that were missing in the house she said she would make good—I missed a brooch, and went to Spring-street with a policeman and a lady's-maid, on the 15th of March—Webb went up stairs—she showed me two duplicates when she came back—in consequence of that, I went with one to Mr. Smith's, the pawnbroker's, and got this brooch for it—it is mine, and was on the toilet-table, in a box in my daughter's room.</p>

I lived at this time with Mrs. Storer, as ladies'-maid—the prisoner was there—I know this brooch—I had seen it on a box on the table on the 19th of Feb.—on the 15th of March I went with Mrs. Storer to No. 10, Spring-street—I went up stairs with the landlady, and went into a room—the landlady opened the drawers in my presence, and took out two dupli<lb></lb>cates—I gave them to my mistress—I went with her to Mr. Smith's, in Edgware-road, and saw my mistress get this brooch.</p>

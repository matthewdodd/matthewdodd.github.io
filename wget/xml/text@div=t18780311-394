                  </hi>. I am a draper, of High Street, Peckham—about the middle of November the prisoner called—I knew him as a commercial traveller—he said that he was engaged to go to Turkey for the London Stereoscopic Company, and would not have his money till the day before he started, and on a second occasion he said that he was also going as special wire correspondent for the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, and could not pay for all he wanted until he received an advance—I supplied him with shirts, 10 yards of flannel, 16 yards serge, and other articles, and somebody else with other articles, of which this is a list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said that he wanted the serge as a present to his wife on her birthday, and that he should have a <hi rend="italic">draw</hi> at the end of the week—he took the shirts and rugs</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187803110112"></xptr>
               <p>with him on credit—I let him have them because I believed he was about to receive money from the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> and that I should be paid—I sub<lb></lb>sequently met him in the street and he said that his going had been post<lb></lb>poned, but that he should go when the English Army went out to fight the Russians—I afterwards called on him and could not see him, but he wrote me this letter without a date—I do not know his writing—I went to the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> office about a week afterwards, and the prisoner was given in custody—I have never been paid, nor have I received the goods back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I knew that he was living with his wife at the address on this letter—she has dealt with me for cash, and I once trusted her little girl for four yards of serge—they live five minutes' walk from me—I do not know how long the prisoner was out at the seat of war, but when he returned he came to my shop as usual—he had always paid me cash before—he had the 16 yards of serge and the shirts and flannel in November, and I saw him again next day or the day after<lb></lb>wards—I knew his wife was not going to the East—he gave me to unde<lb></lb>stand that he was going to have money; that was my real reason for letting him have the goods—I said at the police-court that I wanted payment for the goods.</p>
               <p>

I have been engaged at the manager's office of the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> 12 months—the engagement of a correspondent would come under my notice—I am bound to know the names of the correspondents—I do not know of Edward Powell being engaged—I heard of it from the manager about three weeks ago, but no one of that name has been en<lb></lb>gaged since I have been there—I never saw the prisoner.</p>

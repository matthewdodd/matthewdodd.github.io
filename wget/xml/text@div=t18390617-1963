                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 22nd of May I was at Greenwich fair, in plain clothes. I observed the prisoner there for about a quarter of an hour, and watched him—he went behind a gentleman, lifted the tail of his coat, and took this handkerchief from it—I immediately went to the gentleman, and asked if he had lost his handkerchief—he felt, and said he had—I said, "This boy has got it; come with me, and I will take it from him"—the prisoner crept under a show—I fetched him out, took the handkerchief from him, and the gentleman claimed it—he would not come to the station-house, as he said the had so much trouble in a case before—I do not know his name.</p>

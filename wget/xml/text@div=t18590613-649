                  </hi>. I am the son of William Potter, who keeps the Grey<lb></lb>hound, Clapham-road—on 21st May, about 2 o'clock, I was disturbed by a noise over the leads, and afterwards by the window opening—I listened some time, and then thought I heard a noise in the passage leading to the house—I got out of bed and awoke my brother—we both went down, and I heard footsteps in a room which was locked outside—I opened it, went in, and found the window open—I went on to the leads, and saw a man get<lb></lb>ting over the adjoining premises into the road—I raised an alarm, a police<lb></lb>man sprung his rattle, and several persons came and said that they had caught the man.</p>

I was on duty in the Clapham-road near the Greyhound, heard an alarm, and was going to see what it was, but before I could get to the place the prisoner and another man not in custody dropped from the leads of the butcher's shop adjoining Mr. Potter's premises—the one not in custody ran down the Clapham-road, and Jones came</p>

I was on duty in the Clapham-road in plain clothes, heard cries of "Thieves" and "Police," turned round, looked up the Brixton-road, and saw Jones running as fast as he could from the Clapham-road—I hid myself, because I thought that, nobody pursuing him, he would turn back again—he came up to the gateway where I stood, and, knowing him to be a notorious thief, I called out, "Halloo, Rollicky. what have you been doing?"—he said, "I have not done the job"—I said, "I shall detain you, and see"—Monk came up and said, "That is the man who dropped from the leads"—the prisoner said, "I have not been near the leads"—I know Monk's house—I went into his garden, and on the window-ledge found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy,</hi> with marks of paint on it—I went to Mr. Potter's—the window-frame was shut—it had been opened, and there were marks of a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> on the door corresponding with it—I searched him at the station, and found a quantity of lucifer matches.</p>

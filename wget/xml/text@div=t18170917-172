               <p>WILLIAM SUMMERLING. I am clerk to a warehouse-man, in Ironmonger-lane. On the 12th of July, about twenty minutes after five o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Swithin's-lane, Forresterspoke to Ennis, he shook his head, they both turned round and went to a picture shop, Forrester went to a gentleman's pocket-the gentleman went away. I could not see whether she took any thing, or not. Mr. Walsh came up, I saw her put her hand into his pocket, take his handkerchief out, and put it under her cloak, she then gave something to Ennis, and they both turned away. I asked Mr. Walsh if he missed any thing, he said he had lost his handkerchief; I told him Forrester had it, he asked her for it, she said she had not got it; I said then Ennis must have it, and ran after him - He ran away-Mr. Walsh collared him. I saw the handkerchief in Walsh's hand when he had hold of Ennis.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL SIMMONS. On the 12th of August I was in Threadneedle-street, and saw Forrester secured; the officer brought the other prisoner up and gave Forrester in my charge.</p>

I am a sugar baker, living at 16, Lower Chapman Street, St. Georges-in-the-East—I remember at midnight one Saturday being in Cable Street—I had been drinking—I ran up against a woman, who began to quarrel with me, the prisoner came up and struck me twice on my eye and mouth—when he went away I saw my watch and chain gone—I am sure he is the man who struck me—I gave information to the police on Sunday afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Philip Street—I am single—I was in Cable Street this Saturday night—I saw prosecutor come out of a grocer's shop, he knocked up against a drunken woman who began to row with him when the prisoner came up and caught hold of him with his left hand, put his hand to his trowser pocket and struck him in the eye and the mouth—he turned round and I saw no more of him—I am sure prisoner is the man who did this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was dark, the prisoner wore a soft dented in hat—it was light enough for me to see that he was the man—it was little before 12 o'clock—the grocer's shop was open, and this occurred just against the door.</p>

From information I received I went to Tower Stairs, and took the prisoner—I charged him with stealing the watch on 16th May, in Cable Street—he denied the charge—he was taken to the station and the prosecutor sent, for, but he didn't identify the pri<lb></lb>soner; in fact, didn't see him till he was in the dock at the Police Court—Louisa Blanking identified him amongst eight other men; she had no difficulty in picking him out.</p>

I am a lighterman—on 11th May, I lived at 3, St. James'-street, St. George's—the prisoner is my wife—about 4 o'clock on 11th May I went home and went up stairs—my wife was there—we lived on the first-floor back room—I had no sooner got into the room than I walked towards the fireplace—I saw my wife standing against the window—I walked over towards her—I saw a piece of iron in the fire like a skewer, used as a small poker—I had no sooner got near her than she said, "You b—, I will do for you," and she took this piece of iron (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—on 11th May I examined the prosecutor's eye—the left eyelid was very much swollen and completely closed, and there was a superficial discolouration on the upper eyelid—I opened the eyelid and found the <hi rend="italic">conjunctiva</hi> very much congested—I did not see any blood—all I saw was this discolouration, which might have been a burn—this piece of iron would have caused it—supposing he had fallen against a door-key, that might have done it—he could not open his eye himself—if he had fallen on a door-key I should have expected to have found a bruise—there was no bruise—there was a large amount of swelling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You don't mean to tell me you would have found a bruise immediately after? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know when it was done—you would not find a bruise while the swelling was there—supposing it to have been a burn I should not have expected blood to have flown—if there had been bleeding from the eye, I should draw the conclusion that the instrument was not hot—the man did not offer to show me his hands.</p>

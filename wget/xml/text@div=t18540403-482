                  </hi>. I keep a stationer's shop in New-road, Hammersmith. On Friday, 24th Feb., the prisoner Mullins came to my shop, and asked for a pennyworth of paper—he gave me a shilling; I gave him a sixpence and five pence—I put the shilling in the till—there was no other shilling there, loose—after Mullins had left, the officer came in, and I gave him the shilling.</p>

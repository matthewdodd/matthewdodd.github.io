                  </hi>. I am a coach painter, I work in the neighbourhood of the Borough-road, Newington. On 7th November I had been walking during the evening with a female—I left her about half-past 12 o'clock in Whitechapel—I then walked back again—I got just by Short-street, near the Elephant and Castle—after passing the street a man came behind me—it was before I had got far a man came behind me and caught me round the</p>

               <p>throat and pulled me backwards, and then two men came in front of me and took my watch and chain and my purse—when I was laid hold of by the throat it was with two hands—my throat was so pressed that I could not call out at all—I was not pulled quite on the ground, the man had his knee in my back—I had had my watch and chain a minute before—the prisoner was one of the men in front of me—I can't say whether he took my watch, I don't know which of the two it was that took it—I felt the chain go, and felt the tug in one of the button-holes of my waistcoat—after they were taken the man behind knocked me down on the pavement, and all the men ran away—the man struck me, but not to hurt me much—I got up and ran after the men as fast as I could—I saw them run round Short-street—I saw that when they got to the end of Short-street they turned towards the New Kent-road—I don't know much about that neighbour<lb></lb>hood—out of Short-street, they turned to the left, I did not see them any more—the direction they were running in would lead them to the New Kent-road—they turned towards the Elephant and Castle—I know the Rockingham Arms which is opposite the Elephant and Castle—I went across the New Kent-road and saw the prisoner in custody of a policeman at the corner of Poplar-row, which is the first turning leading out of the New Kent-road—I followed them up in the direction they went, and in a very few minutes after I lost sight of them I found the prisoner in custody—I ran all the way—I lost my watch and chain and a purse containing a sovereign and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was safe in my pocket half-an-hour before—I had not been in any company nor spoken to anybody—the prisoner is one of the men who stood in front of me, I know him by the scarf he had round his neck, and by his size—it was dark at the time—I could not see his face—when I saw the prisoner in custody he had the scarf on his neck which I identified at the time.</p>

I was on duty in Newington-causeway on 7th November, about half-past 1 o'clock in the morning, nearly opposite the Elephant and Castle, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I looked down the Newington-road and saw the prisoner run through Cross-street, which is the first street at the back of the Elephant and Castle—he was on the left-hand side and running—he came out into the Walworth-road and crossed the New Kent-road into Poplar-row—that is twenty or thirty yards from the Elephant and Castle—I ran after him and appre<lb></lb>hended him in Poplar-row—the prosecutor identified him as one of the two men who had taken his watch and Albert—the prisoner did not say a word—he was quite out of breath, he could not speak—he had this handker<lb></lb>chief or scarf round his neck and mouth—nothing was said respecting that that I am aware of—I did not lose sight of the prisoner after he came out of Cross-street—he was the only man that was in the road.</p>

               <p>Was it read over to him before he signed it? - It was.</p>
               <p>Did he make any objection to the contents of it? - Not in the least; he said, they were contented.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said to him, either by the Magistrate or any body present, that he had better make a confession? - Not a single syllable.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. How do you know it? - By the string and holes.</p>
               <p>When you go to market how many purses of this kind do you see? - I do not think there is a great many of this sort.</p>
               <p>What is there any more convenience for money in that? - There is not many of this sort; I seldom see many of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, to Creedland. I think when you was speaking of this confession before, you was not quite sure at first whether you was there all the time? - I am very sensible I was not out of the place.</p>

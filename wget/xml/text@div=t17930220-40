               <p>I live at the Star and Garter at Colnbrook, I know the prisoner; I have known her since last Michaelmas; she came to my house for a lodging with a man that went as her husband, and I know no otherwise; he goes by the name of Will the Blacksmith; I have known him this two years, he did lodge at my house all the two years; he left it last summer, and came again about Michaelmas, and then he brought the prisoner at the bar with him; and she continued with him as his wife. I remember the child, the prisoner at the bar brought it on last Tuesday was a fortnight, some time about noon, I was very busy in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she sleep in your house the night before? - No, I believe she had been absent a month; when the child came it had on a blue jacket and trowsers, it continued to wear these things constantly from day to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner dispose or any of the things do you know? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the shoes the child had on; do you know whether the child returned in the same shoes? - I heard the prisoner say she bought him a pair of shoes, she told me so.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200086"></xptr>Q. Pray did you enquire whose child it was? - I asked the prisoner if it was her's? she told me it was; I really thought it was her's, she always used the child so well, that I took it to be her's.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray madam did you happen to hear at all of a paper importing of a child being lost? - I never see it till I was subpoened on the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what did the child do while it continued with you? - As all other children did; sometimes it played, sometimes it sat still, it was very quiet all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the child leave you? - It was from the Tuesday to the Friday following; the prisoner went away on the Friday and took the child with her; it might be about ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever pretend that she found the child? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray did you examine the prisoner at the bar concerning the child? - I asked her if it was her child? she said, yes; I knew her to be a woman that travelled the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not appear to you that the child was dressed a little above the state of a blacksmith? - I did not think any thing of that; I asked her if she had brought it up? she said no; she said it had been at nurse, and it was at nurse with a coachman's wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the child ever tell you where it lived? - No, nor I never asked it, because I always thought it was her's, she used it so well I could not think any otherwise.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would like to know how she came up on this piece of business? - I was subpoened.</p>

               <p>I heard the voice of a woman enquiring for the name of Vaughan, on Monday week the 11th of this month, about nine o'clock in the evening; I live in New Street-square, No. 2; I heard her say she had found the child or left it at a public house, I cannot tell which, then I thought it was the lost child found; and I went to enquire of its friends, I had heard of Mrs. Vaughan having lost her child, on the Saturday before; when I went in the prisoner was sitting down by the fire, and the child in its mother's lap; I asked the prisoner where she found the child? she told me it was left at a public house the Duke's Head at Windsor, by a travelling woman; she said she was a poor low life drunken wretch; I asked her if she knew her? she said she knew her well; I said she must know that that child was not her's, she said she knew that well, for she knew that she never had a child in her life; I asked her how then she could tell the child that its mammy was gone; for she had told me, that she said to the child your mammy is gone, when that woman went away she said the woman told her it was just come from nurse; I then took the child on my lap and asked the child who took him away? he told me that lady, pointing to the prisoner; I asked him when the lady took him? he said the first day, he is a very intelligent child, this was all in the hearing of the prisoner; I asked him where? he said he rode in a cart, I asked him with whom? he said with that lady, pointing to the prisoner; I asked him where? he said not far; the prisoner made answer and said, that he had been in no cart with her; the prisoner said that he had rode on the coach top, from Windsor that day; the child made answer and said he rode in a cart the first day; she was silent to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it explained what the first day meant? - The child said he had left home a good many days; but that was the first day he rode in a cart, when he left home, he said they were measuring coals, where he strayed from; the child could not mention the name of the street, and he crossed the way, and that lady laid hold of his hand, and said she would take him to his mammy; she took him a little way, and then she put him into a cart, and that lady rode in the cart with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to this? - She said she had rode in no cart with the child.</p>
               <p>Q.Did she deny any other part of the story? - She said the mother had got the child, and what more did they want? she would not have brought it if she had known that there would have been that piece of work; she had taken great care of it, and washed its shirt and bought it a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Vaughan. I think you told me that all the clothes were brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200088"></xptr>back again? - Yes, there was, only the shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any buckles in the shoes? - Yes, they were brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of shoes were they? - The shoes were not very good, pretty much wore; the child came back with another pair of shoes which had been new, the heel pieces were wore off and his feet were so blistered he could hardly stand for three days afterwards; they had been bought new.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I came from where I lived in London, when I am in London; I was coming to the top of Holborn and there was a parcel of bullocks and cows running in the road, and the child was there and would cling on me whether I would or not, and he said, pray do take care of me and he would hang on me whether I would have him or no, and I took the child by the hand till all the bullocks were gone by, I loosed the child from my hand, and he said, he was going this way, and followed me all the way along Piccadilly, till I came to Hyde Park-corner, and the child would go into the public house along with me, and I gave the child some beer, there I asked him which way he was going? and he said, he was going this way, after I got through Hyde Park-corner, I stopped for the coach there, at the Hyde Park-corner, I got on the coach, I had not got to Knightsbridge before a man ran after me and said, I had left my child behind me, it was crying, the coachman stopped there and I got down from the coach again and I stopped there, and two men brought the child to me, and I did not know what to do with the child, and I told the people the child did not belong to me and they said it did, and I sat there with the child on the ground for a matter of an hour, I wanted to go to my journey's end, and I took the child along with me, just at the end of Knights-bridge I gave a man six-pence to ride in a coach to Brentford, the child would not tell me where it belonged to, and I got out of the coach at Brentford and I walked to Hounslow with the child in my hand, and the child's shoes were very ordinary, and I went and bought a new pair the next morning, and I asked it what its name was, and it said, Jackey Vaughan; and the next day I brought him down to that gentleman's house at Colnbrook; on the Thursday night I was putting the child to bed I asked the child where his mammy lived, he said, in New Street-square; I was coming to London on Monday and I thought I would bring the child then.</p>

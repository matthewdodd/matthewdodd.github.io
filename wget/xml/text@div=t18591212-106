On the evening of 30th November I was on duty in St. Paul's Church-yard, about a quarter-past five o'clock—I saw the prisoner, he was carrying a truss—it was wrapped in this wrapper—when I saw him first he was in Cannon-street West—he then had this truss on him—I followed him up the east end of St. Paul's as far as St. Martin's-le-Grand—I then tapped him on the shoulder and asked him what he had got there—he immediately took the truss off his shoulder and placed it before him and said "It is all right; you can have it; it don't belong to me"—I asked him where he got it from—he said a gentleman gave it him in St. Paul's Church-yard to carry for him—I asked him where the gentleman was—he said he thought he was behind—I told him I should take him in cus<lb></lb>tody on suspicion of having stolen it—he resisted my taking hold of him, but I took him by the collar and took him to the station—he said he lived in a street which he named in Commercial-road East—I found it to be false.</p>

I am carman to Mr. Young husband—on 30th November, about five o'clock, I was delivering goods at No. 55, Cannon-street—I went into the warehouse to get my bill signed—when I went in I left one truss and some other goods on my cart, and when I got up in my cart to drive away the truss was gone—this was the wrapper of it—it had been safe, when I went in the warehouse—I was in about three minutes.</p>

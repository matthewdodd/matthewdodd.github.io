             sworn. - I am a headborough: On the 10th of March, Guest, another officer, called upon me to go with him to take the prisoner into custody, for making a great riot in the house where he was quartered, in sermon-time; when I got there, the landlord called me on one side, and told me he suspected the prisoner had been stealing some fowls; I went up stairs where the prisoner slept, and in a drawer in that room, I pulled out a bag containing five hens and a cock; I took him into custody, and took him to New-prison; I asked him how he came by those fowls; he asked me what fowls; I told him that were in his room; he said he had bought them; I asked him where; he said it was no matter where he bought them, there were three of four of them in it; the prisoner told me he had been at Old Ford the day before, and I went round there, but could not hear of any body there that had lost any fowls; on the Thursday I produced them to Mr. Gasquet in their feathers.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Gasquet). Were the fowls that were produced to you the same fowls that you had lost? - A. They were; and before they were taken out of the bag I described every one of them.</p>

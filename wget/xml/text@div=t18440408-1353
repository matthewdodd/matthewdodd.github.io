                  </hi>. I am a costermonger. I went to lodge at the Cock at Clapham on the 1st of April—I gave four sovereigns and eighteen or nine<lb></lb>teen shillings to the landlord to take care of for me—he gave it me back next morning, and I began to drink, and fell asleep—the officer awoke me—my money was then gone—I am sure I had three sovereigns and some silver when I went to sleep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-cooper, and live at Clapham. On the 1st of April the prosecutor came to the public-house, and about three o'clock the next, afternoon he was the worse for liquor—I saw the prisoner take three sovereigns from his pocket.</p>

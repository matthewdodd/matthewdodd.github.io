Salter &amp; Whiter, Spital Square—I also went to a small grocer's shop in Pelham Street, also occupied by the prisoner and another man; and in the back room I found a roll of silk velvet, which formed part of the robbery, of the value of about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and some other articles that I was in search of—I had been on the look out for the prisoner since that time, but could not find him till the 27th of August in this year—I set a watch on the room and shop, but the prisoner never came there after—I found this hat in the room where I found the velvet.</p>

I am now, and was on the 15th February last year, in the employment of the Great Eastern Railway Company—on 15th February I went out with my cart, with some packages for Messrs.

               <p>in 1867 of stealing this horse and cart—I saw it in Brick Lane, with a load of boxes on it, and drove it to Pelham Street—I took the smaller boxes off by myself, and took them to the room in Pelham Court—the prisoner and another man were there when I put the boxes in the room—they were afterwards broken up—I then drove the cart away, and left it—I had told them there was a horse and cart, and then the other man said, "If you get it, bring it round here"—the prisoner was present—I knew them before—the prisoner lived at that place, and he also occupied the shop with the other man—I knew them at the room about three months—they had taken the shop about a week—I went back to the room about an hour after I had disposed of the cart—I saw two bags and a half of reels of silk, and the boxes broken up—the prisoner was there then—I have seen the prisoner wear a hat like the one produced—I saw the velvet in the shop when I got back, and I had seen it in the room before—I have completed my term of imprisonment—I had twelve months—I saw a pony and cart come to the shop in the afternoon, alter I had taken the goods—they took away a bag containing some velvet.</p>

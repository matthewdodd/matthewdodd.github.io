             (Police-constable N 112.) On the 20th of December I saw the prisoner bring this stove along the New North-road, at five minutes before nine o'clock at night; I asked him if he was removing; he said Yes, from No. 5, Hope-street - I said it was a curious time to be carrying things, and asked if he would go with me to the landlord; he said Yes, tha the was a person named Watson, and lived in Southampton-street; I went there, but could find no such person - as I took him to the station he told me he had stolen it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you make him any offer? A. No, I asked him several times where he got it.</p>
               <p>MR. ELKINGTON. This is my stove - I have known the prisoner three or four years; he is married, and has a family.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character, and a witness engaged to employ him.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 39.</p>

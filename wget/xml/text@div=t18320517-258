On the evening of the 29th of March I saw the prisoner at the prosecutor's yard, about half-past eight o'clock or near nine; he asked if I had seen his aunt - I said No; he said he had seen her once, and she told him if he came again, he should have his trousers - I went to the Holly Bush to get half a pint of beer, and as I came back, I saw him coming from their yard, with a bundle; he saw me coming, and dropped it; he said the kettle was so b-y hot, he could hardly tie it up in the petticoat - he went in with a stick, but came out without it; he dropped the bundle in the garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A.Near nine o'clock, it was quite dark - I had known him before.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my employ on the 29th of March; he met me at five o'clock in the morning at Enfield, and came to London with me; I sent him with my cart to the Queen's Head, the watering-house, in the Green-lanes, and to wait there for me; my brother persuaded him to go on - I was detained in London, but I overtook him with the cart, about two miles and a half before he got to Enfield; he left me at Chase-green, at half-past eight o'clock, which is about a mile from the prosecutor's; I gave him some money - he came to me the next morning, and said his aunt had been accusing him of stealing these things; that he had gone to the stable with the horse and things, and then to bed directly at Mr. Leifchild's, the auctioneer.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SANDERS. He told me the next morning that he did not sleep at Enfield, but at Botany Bay - I have never seen the things since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had you had any quarrel with the prisoner? A. No; he had formerly worked for me, and he might do so again, for his victuals.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SMITH. I am a labourer, and live at Enfield. I have known the prisoner from an infant; about half-past eleven o'clock that night, I was coming along the road, and heard somebody stepping in the road, or in Mr. Sander's premises; I stopped at the side of the road, and saw a man come out there, with a pot of some kind - he brought it across the road, and took the lid off; he held it up, and poured something out of it, which made a rattle - I made up to him - he put on the lid, jumped over the bedge, and away he run; I saw some potatoes in the road.</p>
               <p>SARAH SANDERS re-examined. Q.Were there any potatoes in the pot? A. My husband had been boiling potatoes in it, and put it outside with the potatoes in it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in the Strand on Sunday, the 23d of December, and saw the prisoners following the prosecutor, nearly opposite Water-street; they were in company - I crossed over, saw them try his pocket, and when opposite Waterloo-bridge they tried very hard, and opposite Southampton-street Kennedy succeeded in getting the handkerchief from his pocket - I saw him take it: Thompson was close behind, looking out- they crossed the street, towards us; I took them, and found the handkerchief in Kennedy's coat pocket; Phillips, who was with me, went and told the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say "They" tried, who was that? A. Kennedy - I might say "They;" I did not see Thompson touch the pocket.</p>

            . I was with Whittingham, and saw the prisoners following Mr. Redhead and a lady; they attempted his pocket several times, and tried very hard by Waterloo-bridge; Thompson kept looking out, and closed up to the other, and near Southampton-street Kennedy took the handkerchief; Thompson was close behind, hiding what he did; I believe he took it from the right-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say "They tried very hard?" A. Yes, and I say so again; Thompson did not put his hand to the pocket, but he closed up, and put his hand quite close. I often parade the streets to take such rascals; I get nothing for it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What are you, an independant gentleman? A. No; I am a hardwareman.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM REDHEAD. I have every reason to think this is my handkerchief; there is no mark on it.</p>

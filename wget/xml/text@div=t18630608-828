I am a partner in the firm of Norris and Chaplin, wine and spirit brokers—we have had transactions with the bank<lb></lb>rupt for some time—these warrants have all been through our hands—we have been in the habit of making advances to the bankrupt, and made an advance to him in February—we keep an account of the money advanced, but not of the specific securities that we receive—I have no memorandum to refer to which will tell me when we received these warrants—by referring to my book, I see by a cheque that we made an advance on the 26th of February, of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there have not been any warrants since that 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by way of loan, but there may have been by way of exchange—we should not advance the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without security—I can give an opinion as to these warrants—I should think, looking at the date on the warrants, that we must have had them somewhere about that time—we have made no advance since the 28th of February—I am not able to say whether those are the warrants we received for the advance, or for the exchange of other warrants—the exchanges are not entered in our books—we keep books of the moneys advanced, but not of the securities—we regard the warrants as bullion—there were exchanges after the 28th of February—I do not think they were to such a large extent as those warrants would represent—I was examined in the Bankruptcy Court—I have no notion now to what extent there were exchanges after the 28th of February—I cannot tell whether those sixteen warrants were deposited at once or not—our first transaction with the bankrupt was on the 18th of March, 1861—we have sold wine for him; we did not purchase wine from him—I can tell you the total amount of our transactions since that time, but not the amount of our advances—up to June, 1861, they were 8,590<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; to January, 1862, 19,520<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; from January, 1862, to June, 1862, they were 21,735<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we did not advance any money after the date of the petition in May, 1862—his bills were returned to us—those figures include the dishonoured bills—I have given you the debtor side of the ledger—when we made an advance, we should give him a cheque for the amount agreed upon, which he would leave the warrants—we should not give the cheque without the warrants and we should draw at three months, and that bill would be put into the safe with the warrants—the bill was held as collateral security—we should charge discount about three or four per cent above the Bank rate; eight per cent, if the Bank were five—I have a letter from the bankrupt, dated 26th June, 1861—(<hi rend="italic">The letter was read, and created a charge upon all warrants then or thereafter held by Messrs. Norris &amp; Chaplin, for the payment of all the bankrupt's I liabilities to them, with power, without further consent, in the event of default in the payment of any bill, to sell, and to deduct all charges, commission, &amp;c.; and an undertaking by the bankrupt to reimburse any loss that might arise upon the sale</hi>)—we continued to hold the warrants until the bankruptcy—we realised them on the 19th of June—I cannot tell precisely what those sixteen warrants fetched—I have the details here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is not the course of business you have described, of depositing warrants very common in the wine trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is very com<lb></lb>mon with a great number of merchants in the trade—there are several other houses besides ourselves who do the same sort of business with wine mer<lb></lb>chants very largely—when a person lodges warrants he can show the wine; he cannot take it away—he is permitted to sample it, and sell it, subject to the lien—it is not done secretly by the London Dock Company, but, having deposited the warrants, they allow him to sample the wine; it is a continual occurrence—the exchanges of warrants were not generally large ones—we</p>

               <p>had sold wines for the bankrupt exclusive of the realisation of securities—irrespective of the wine sold under the bankruptcy, which was sold with the consent of the trade assignees, I think we sold some 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth for him, but I cannot tell the amount of sales—a conversation did occur between me and the bankrupt about his laying down some port wine when he could spare the cash, but I cannot assign any date to it—it was on an occasion when I remarked that some wines were freshly landed, and he said, "It is merely for temporary accommodation, those wines I am going to lay down in the cellar"—there are none of these warrants freshly landed—I do not think we exchanged warrants to so large an extent—I can only speak from my conviction by the entries in the book; I have no absolute knowledge on the subject—when I gave my evidence in the Bankruptcy Court, the circum<lb></lb>stances were fresh in my mind—if the bankrupt brought fresh warrants we should see that they were of sufficient security, and then let him take the others away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined. Q.</hi> When the warrants are in your possession, you are, in fact, the owners of the wine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; we could take the wine away on giving up the warrants—we view the warrants as property—we always take an endorsement on the warrant—it does not make over the title in the wine to us; it is simply an endorsed warrant, and we hold it—it is not endorsed specially to us, but in blank—the last deposit of wine previous to the 28th February was on the 17th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, residing at Windsor—before March, 1862, I had bought some wine of the bankrupt, and on the 4th of that month I saw him in Tower-street, and gave him an order for some wine—he then introduced to my notice some port wine, as very fine old wine of Offley &amp; Co.'s shipping—I think it was invoiced at 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per pipe—I men<lb></lb>tioned also a butt of sherry, which I had previously ordered, but which had not been delivered—I had applied a great number of times for it, and he had put me off some months that he could not get the warrants—he said at this time that they had been mislaid, but that if I pleased, he would clear all the goods then ordered on the following day, that is the port, the butt of sherry, and two or three other common wines which were purchased at the same time—I received an invoice of the whole, and there was a "duty "statement as well; the invoice was 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the duty 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these were accom<lb></lb>panied by two bills and a letter asking for my acceptance—I accepted them, and returned them by post, on the faith of the wines being in clearance—they were afterwards paid by me—I have never had the wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the sherry, which had been paid for months before, paid by an acceptance of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It had been paid by an accep<lb></lb>tance which had been properly retired—I do not remember that the bank<lb></lb>rupt lent me 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purpose of meeting it—I paid it some considerable time before this occurred; I cannot speak from certain knowledge—it formed part of a transaction with the firm of Lawes, Simon, &amp; Co., and when that partnership was dissolved, the bankrupt was particularly anxious to have all the accounts then owing settled up—it was paid entirely by me—it was all paid before this visit—I keep books, but I have not brought any; I did not think they would be needed—I had not had dealings with the bank<lb></lb>rupt for a long time; I think they commenced in 1860 or 1861—they have been to the extent of a few hundreds possibly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, carrying on business at 79, Great Tower-street, in partnership with Mr. Boyes, and we are the agents for the "Duff-Gordon" sherry—we had dealings prior to 1862 with the bankrupt, which were generally cash transactions under discount—in March, 1862, he came to us, and stated that the wines he had recently purchased and paid for under discount, were of a character which were getting him a very good private connection, and he then required some more of the same wine, to pay the duty immediately, to lay down in his new cellars in Mincing-lane—we then agreed to sell him three butts and three hogsheads of sherry of the value of 254<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at six months' credit—I gave him these four delivery-orders (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), signed by myself—we have never been paid for the wine—the inducement for our parting with the wine was our having discounted a bill from Sharp Simon for 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and therefore we knew that he had some capital to go on with, otherwise we certainly should not have given him credit for this wine—it was his having required discount for a very good hill of 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which induced us—we knew he had that amount of capital, and, from his own account, he was getting a very good private connection from the quality of those wines.</p>

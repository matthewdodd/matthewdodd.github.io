                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, we lived at 2, Brooks'-gardens, St. Pancras. This occurred on Monday morning, 16th Aug.—we had gone to bed as usual on the Sunday night—about 12 o'clock at night he said he must pray, that he had got but an hour to live, and he got out of bed and prayed till about 2 in the morning—I said to him, "If you wish to pray, I will not prevent you from getting up, Knight"—I begged of him to lay still, but he got out, and remained out until near 2, praying—I then asked him to come to bed—he still said he must pray—he went downstairs, he said he was going down to the closet, which I believe he did; he came up again in a few minutes and got into bed, and laid till about 5—he then got up, and said he must dress himself—I asked him not, I said it was too early to dress himself—he said he would light a fire and make me my breakfast which he was always in the habit of doing, I having the rheumatic gout so bad—I never get up till 11, and every day he always made my breakfast for me, and waited on me—he stood for some time with his back towards the fire<lb></lb>place—I still asked him to come to bed, as it was very early in the morning, it was too soon to get up to his work—he said he would light a fire—I saw him standing with his back towards the fireplace, when I felt a blow on my head—I was still in bed—he was about two yards from me—the blow caught me on the side of my head; he made a dart from the fireplace to the bed, but he had not said anything to me—I saw nothing in his hand, but I afterwards found this ball (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) lying in the bed beside me—it is part of a chimney ornament—we had had it in the place for years, it was kept on a table by the side of the bed—after receiving the blow I got out of bed, and tried to get towards the room door, when I recollect his following me, and seeing a knife in his hand—I do not recollect his stabbing me in the room, a little girl of mine unlocked the door, and I got on to the landing; he followed me on to the landing, and I then recollect his using the knife—I was very faint from the blow I had received, but I have a recollection of feeling it in my shoulders, as if I was stabbed—I bled a good deal—I felt very faint—I had struggled a good deal, and I am very much afflicted with the gout—I had had a struggle with the prisoner in the room—that was after I had got out of bed, and as I was going towards the door—when I was on the landing, I recollect Mr. Green's room door opening, and seeing Mr. Green and his daughter standing there—they lodged in the next room—I do not recollect whether they came to my help; I recollect seeing the door open, and them both standing there, and the door directly closed—I called out, "For God's sake fetch a doctor!"—my husband ran downstairs—the next thing I recollect was, that I was on the bed—Mr. Brown, a medical man, attended me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I do not wish to ask her any questions; the agitation I was in was the cause of it; I had no ill will against her; I had been very much troubled all night with visions, and one thing and another, which I fancied I had seen, through being on the drink for eight or nine days; I did it with no intent to murder her, or anything of the sort.</p>

                  </hi>. On 16th Aug. I was lodging at 2, Brookes-gardens, in the next room to the prisoner and his wife—on the morning in question I was awoke between 5 and 6 o'clock, by loud cries of "Murder!"—I listened for a moment, and found they came from their room—I immediately went to their room, and knocked at the door—the door was shut, the little girl came to the door and opened it—I did not go in—I saw the prisoner with his wife down on the ground, with her head towards the door, with his two knees on her breast—I said, "For God's sake, Knight, what is the matter?"—he in<lb></lb>stantly jumped up, and said, "You b—, I will do for you now," taking a weapon from off his bench—I could not observe what sort of weapon it was—he rushed at me, my daughter slammed the door to, as I went back into my own room—he had not the weapon in his hand when he got up from his wife, that I saw—he is a watch finisher by business—the weapon he had was one of those things that he uses in his work, a spikey thing—it was not this knife—I afterwards opened my door again, and he had then got her on the landing between my door and his door, and I saw him stab her three or four times—I saw the weapon he had then—it was this broken knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she bled profusely—there was blood on the wall, and floating on the ground—he then went away down the gardens—I called out "Murder!" and Mr. Simpson stopped him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at 1, Wilmington-square. I was called to the prosecutrix, about 6 o'clock, on the morning of 16th Aug., by Green—I found her on the bed, in a great state of prostration, bleeding, and a quantity of blood about her—on undressing her, I found several wounds about her body and shoulders—there were two wounds on the right side, between the eighth and ninth ribs; one on the right scapula, and another on the left—on the right shoulder there was a wound, and on the third finger of the left hand—there were about seven wounds altogether—she had been bleeding a great deal—there was also a bruise on the head—the stab wounds about the body were very probably made by such a knife as this—the bruise on the head might have been produced by this ball, or a hard sub<lb></lb>stance—some of the wounds were very dangerous—she was under my care a fortnight or three weeks—the danger was that the wounds had penetrated the lungs.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 718). On the evening of Saturday, 11th September, I was doing duty near Moor-lane—about half-past 10 that evening I saw the prisoner and another man quarrelling and fighting in that lane, on my beat—I cautioned them to go away; the other man walked away; he said he did not wish to be locked up—the prisoner said if I locked him up, he would serve me as he had other policemen—I pro<lb></lb>ceeded on my beat in the usual way I work my beat—the prisoner walked up just before me, 5 or 10 yards; he was swearing and abusing me all up the court—I saw him go into the house in which he lived—I passed on by</p>

               <p>the door of the house, and thought he was in quiet for the night—I had got perhaps 40 or 50 yards beyond his house, when I heard him come running, and I heard him say, "Where is the b—policeman? I will kill the b—"—as I went to turn round, he caught me on the shoulder with this instrument (<hi rend="italic">producing an iron</hi>)—he said, "G—strike me dead, I will kill you"—I then saw him aim at my head again, and I put up my hand to prevent the blow on my head, and he struck me over the elbow—I was struck five different blows—I was struck on the elbow, the shoulder, just below the blade-bone, the chin, and the head—blood flowed from the head, and also from the chin—this lasted a very short time—I was about 8 or 10 yards from one of the street-lamps—I have no doubt whatever that that was the weapon with which he was striking me—some persons came up, and the prisoner ran away—I was able to go myself to the station-house for assistance—Mr. Simpson, a surgeon, saw me, and I have been under his treatment up to the present time—I have been unfit for duty ever since—I am not on duty now, and am not likely to be at present—I have known the prisoner these 18 months.</p>

On the night this occurred I want in search of the prisoner—I was not able to find him at first, but I did subsequently, at the house where he lodges—I told him the charge on which I took him—I went to the door and pushed it open; the room was quite dark—I called out "Is Oxley here?" he immediately answered "Yes"—I desired him to come out, he said he would come, he was not afraid to come, that he had fought the policeman fair—I saw this weapon found in the window sill; at that time one end of it was wet—Vince was asked in the hearing of the prisoner, if this was the weapon that he was struck with, and he said "Yes,"—the prisoner then said with an oath, "I never had it in my hand"—it was the inspector who was speaking—he asked the prisoner, what he called the weapon; he said, he called it nothing; his game was to know nothing; let him find out what it was called,—the prisoner had been drinking but he was not at all intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Fore-street, Cripple<lb></lb>gate—on Monday morning, 13th September, about 11 o'clock, I examined the prosecutor—he had an incised wound on the left side of his head, a cut wound above the ear, rather behind; he had likewise an abrasion on the chin, the external skin was broken—I did not examine the bruises about his body, because he was then on the point of going up to the police-court,—he was suffering from dizziness in the head, confusion of mind; there was an uncertain stare about his eyes; the eyes were suffused, and he had been vomiting—all this would be the result of the stun or concussion—the wound on the head might have been caused by such an instrument as this, coming rapidly—the symptoms I have described were undoubtedly the result of such injuries—there was slight concussion of the brain—he has not been directly under my treatment ever since, although I have seen him from day to day—he is properly under the care of the surgeon of the force; he is certainly not fit for duty; he will not before some time—even his life eventually may be in danger—he may suffer from this injury yet.</p>

The Crime which these committed was the same with the former: but as they had been longer at the trade, so these were the more hardned; the former being of a good Family, had drawn on the latter to his Confederate. As they had been accustomed to lewd Courses, they were the more hardened in their ends; neither is it possible that without erring from the Truth, that we should give a good account of all that <rs id="t16751013-2-punish5" type="punishmentDescription">

However, they seem'd to be both very penitent all the time they were in Prison, and is hoped continued so to the last; the former of them two had a great Love and that for the Maintenance of the Mother and the Child he took these evil Courses, his idleness not permitting him to take any better. He desires his Friends to see her and bid her be careful of the Infant, and to betake her self to some honest Labour, wherein she would finde more comfort than in those ways to which the Trade seduced him. Of the latter, we can onely say, that he continued with that seeming repentance which was most suitable for a dying Man.</p>

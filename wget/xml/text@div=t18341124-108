                  </hi>. I live in Devonshire-street, and am servant to Mr. Meredith, of Chapel-street, Edgeware-road, nearly opposite Mr. Gay's, the hatter. On Monday; afternoon, the 24th of November, I saw a person go and take a hat off the door, and give it to another, who stood by the painter's shop—he immediately went and took another, and gave it to the other man—one of the men ran down Bell-street, and I ran after that man—the other-man ran down Barl-street—I ran after the man down Bell-street, and George-street, which was the one who took the hat from the door—I lost sight of him in Stephen-street.</p>

On the 24th of No<lb></lb>vember, I met Sturges in Stephen-street—in consequence of what he said, I went down the street, returned, and saw the prisoner standing with a basket in his hand, a coat on his arm, and a hat in his hand—I asked what he had there—he said it was nothing to me, and, while I was examining the basket, he ran away up James-street, and was stopped by Smith on my calling, "Stop thief"—I found these two hats in the basket, which I took from him.</p>

About half-past four o'clock, I was in a public-house having something to drink—I went down Union-street, into Wil<lb></lb>liam-street, and down a court there—I met a young man in his shirt sleeves talking to a girl—the girl said a person was walking up and down the passage waiting for die young man—he took off his coat and hat, and asked me to hold the basket a few minutes—he put his coat on the basket—I held the coat in my hand, and asked another young man to hold the hat—a witness saw a man deliver the basket into my hand, and while I had it in my hand the policeman came and caught me with the things.</p>

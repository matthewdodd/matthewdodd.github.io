                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where are you living now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Grosvenor Place, near Russell Square—I am living entirely alone—I saw Mr. Sidney yesterday—he was here with me—he is the gentleman under whose protection I had been living—I am twenty-seven years of age—boy as the prisoner is, he has too many wives—I first met him in the road, I got into conversation with him—he asked me if my name was Armstrong, I said, "No, sir"—our acquaintance dated from that period—I did not take him to my house that day—he called the next day, not by my invitation—I did not give him my address—he saw where I went to, he was walking the same road, and he called on me the next day—I had not my four children there, two of them were away—Mr. Sidney called on me yesterday, and he was there the day before, he has been there very frequently on this business—it was not under his advice that I gave the prisoner in charge—I am not taking his advice, but he came to me—I always allow him to come to visit his children, two of them are living with me—he did not know I was going to be married to the prisoner, he was on the Continent at the time—I had not exactly had a quarrel with him, we were not very good friends, but I had no quarrel—I married the prisoner without the knowledge of the father of my children—it was my full intention to do so—the prisoner never came home to me before our marriage—he did afterwards—he has slept in the house two nights running—I could not tell how often he slept in the house after the marriage—hedid not live away—he might have slept away more often than he slept at my house—while I was living at that house I had two or three solicitors call on business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and have one partner; we are cooks and confectioners. On 15th Jan. the prisoner came to my shop—he ordered a basin of soup—I saw it served to him—there was a plain silver spoon in it—while he was having his soup two ladies came—while I spoke to them the prisoner passed me, gave me a shilling, and left—he looked round, and then ran down the street quite fast—I said, "That man hat stolen the spoon"—I went to the room where he had been and missed it—this is it—I have used it twenty-two years.</p>

               <p>went—the ladies were strangers to me; I have not seen them since—I had not seen the prisoner before—I am sure be is the man—I saw him after<lb></lb>wards at Bow-street—I went there because I was told I should very likely see the spoon—I saw the prisoner there in custody, and saw the spoon—the prisoner might have gone off without paying me for the soup—I did not go to the door to look after him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Hedges. On 15th Jan. the prisoner pawned this spoon, and another that has not been identified—I kept it in my custody till it was produced before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fellow shopman with the last witness. I received this spoon from him, and produced it at the police-court—it was given back to him the same day, and placed in the drawer till the next examination—I am sure this is it—I know the prisoner, but I cannot swear that he pawned this.</p>

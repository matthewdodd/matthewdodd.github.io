                  </hi>. I am one of the principal clerks in the Savings Bank Department of the Post Office—if a person wished to withdraw a sum of money from the Savings Bank the first thing would be to obtain a notice of withdrawal, which can be had at any post office—he would then write on that notice the name of the office at which his book was obtained and the number of the book, fill in the amount he required, and give the name of the office at which he wished to receive the money—he would then sign the notice and give his address where he wished the warrant to be sent to him—that notice would be received at the head-office, and the signature would he compared with the signature to the declaration made when the account was opened, and, if correct, his account would be debited with the amount, and the warrant sent to him, and, at the same time, an advice would be sent to the office of payment—this notice was sent to the Post Office in August, and this is the warrant and advice made out in consequence—the notice of withdrawal applies for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the warrant is for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the advice also—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230044"></xptr>
               <p>the signature to the notice was compared and found to be correct—on the same day a notice was also sent to the Post Office for the sum of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these are the advice and warrant, and they were sent on the same day to the same office—this is a correct copy of the prisoner's account—it shows that there was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to his account on that day, and he draws out 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., so that the account was not closed—the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would be entered before the warrant was sent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk in charge of the High Street Branch Post Office, Notting Hill—the prisoner made this declaration before me on 6th January last; he signed it in my presence—a savings bank book was then issued to him—at that time he lived at 40, Kensington Place, and since that at 2, Palmerston Street, Notting Hill Gate—the number of the book is 4476—on the 22nd August I received this letter of advice, "Pay to Middleton 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I also received a letter of advice to pay Harriet Baker, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were put into a pigeon-hole—they are always put in one place—Miss Crockford is also a clerk in the office—about 10.45 she brought me the book and the warrant—I went to the counter and saw the prisoner—I compared the signature on the warrant with that inside the cover of his book—after the warrant issued from the office gets into the hands of the prisoner he is required to put his name to it as the form of receipt for the money—I found his name there, and compared it with the signature in his book—I found they corresponded, and I took up the advice which I thought Miss Crockford had laid down for me, as she generally used to do so, and put it over the warrant for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—upon looking at the advice I found it was for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I paid the prisoner that amount with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, three sovereigns, half a sovereign, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I took it from the ordinary till—I put down the date and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the prisoner's book, and signed my name against it—I stamped it, showing that that money had been paid in reduction of the account—I laid the money on the counter in front of the prisoner—there is a brass network in front, between me and the customer—I laid the net: down first and counted the gold and silver on to it—he took it up, and returned him the deposit-book—I put the warrant and letter of advice together on the file with the paid warrants; that is the ordinary course—there was no one on my side of the counter at that time—Miss Crockfond was doing her work at the other end of the counter—Mr. Taylor was on the public side; he could see all that was done; he was waiting to cash a money order—there was a telegraph messenger there—in the course of the day Harriet Baker came for her money, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I paid her—I looked for her letter of advice and found it on the file with the warrant for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; nearly at the bottom of the file—I think it was between 4 and 5 o'clock that she came in—a short time after that I proceeded to make up my accounts and found I was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. short—on looking into the matter I found the letter of advice for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pigeon hole—it had not been taken out at all—the warrant for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was alone on the file, and the advice in the pigeon hole—I went to the prisoner's house, but he was not at home—I "was going a second time, but Mr. Taylor came after me and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230045"></xptr>
               <p>said would he go, if I was afraid, and I was to follow—I saw him bring Middleton out, and I went back—Taylor brought him into the office—I asked him what money I gave him in the morning—he said "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said "What else?"—he said "My book"—I said "What else did I give you?"—he said "Nothing"—I said "Yes, I did; I gave you a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, three sovereigns, half a sovereign, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver"—he said "I am quite sure you did no such thing"—I said "I have a witness to prove that I did do so"—he said "lam quite sure you have not"—I had sent for a constable—he came in, and I repeated the questions again—I said "Have you got your book in your pocket"—he replied "No, I have burnt it"—I said "Why did you burn it?'—he said "Because, I had no more money in"—I said "That is not the reason, you have burnt it because you saw the entry I had made in it"—he replied "I have seen no entry"—I said "I have a witness to prove that you had the money, "and then I pointed to Taylor, and said "That is my witness"—Taylor said "I saw you take the money; it is no use denying it, and I will go into any court of justice and swear that you had it"—the prisoner said" Is that what you have brought me here for Joe; I am sur<lb></lb>prised at you"—the policeman refused to take him into custody, and I took out a summons—the prisoner said he had burnt the book because there was no more money in—there would be a shilling left, and he would not be able to obtain that without producing the book—there was only one figure different in the numbers of the two warrants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The defendant said "I declare to my God I never received more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" and he also said the policeman might search him—I can't say how many entries there were in his book; I should not look at the former entries—they are all-on one page—this is a correct copy of his book—he paid in 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on January 6th—I merely signed the book, and I did not notice that he had only got 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—there is not a single sovereign down except the first item—there is not a single entry for a sovereign of money drawn out; I say, in the face of that, that such a mistake might arise—I don't look at the depositor's book except for his name—if I had seen that he only had 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I should not have paid him what I did—I was busy at the time—I might have paid out 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that day in small sums—when I paid Baker I thought there was some mistake, but I did not find it out till made up my accounts—I had filed the wrong warrant, and I took it off the file again, but I was not certain till I balanced my accounts in the evening—I was afraid I had paid it, but I was not sure; it was some hours afterwards—I did not know that I had paid any one too much until after I had balanced my accounts—I did not know that I had paid any customer 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. who had presented a warrant for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I knew Taylor, as a neighbour, as long as I have been in the office, nearly three years—I did not know the prisoner, only by his coming in—I went to the prisoner's house first and then I went to Taylor—I asked him if he knew who he was speaking to in the office in the morning, and he said he knew perfectly well—Taylor is a hairdresser; I don't know what the prisoner is—I asked Taylor if he knew what money I gave him—he said "Yes, you gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and some gold and silver"—I heard Taylor say, at the Police Court, that he heard me count out the money to the prisoner: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, but he corrected himself afterwards—he said he heard me count out the sovereigns in that way, but on the instant he said "I was wrong, it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold"—I recollected that I had paid a note when the circumstance came before me and I came to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230046"></xptr>
               <p>remember—I did not take the number of the note—before we went to the Police Court Taylor said that I had given a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I asked Taylor, for my own satisfaction, to know if any one else really knew what I had given; I knew that I had done it before I went to Taylor—a corporal of the tele<lb></lb>graph boys was at the office in morning when the prisoner and Taylor were there—I can't say whether Taylor or the prisoner come in first; I don't know—I can't say how long Taylor was there; the prisoner was there two or three minutes, while the entry was made—he went out first—I did not make any entry on the sheet till the close of business in the evening—I copy the amounts from the letters of advice—I made the entries on the sheet before I balanced—I entered on the sheet a payment of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Middle<lb></lb>ton from the warrant—the thought did not strike me that I had given this man too much until I balanced my accounts—Taylor said, "I am quite sure if you did pay him he will give it you again;" that he was a very respectable man, and he thought he was not quite sober at the time; that he might have taken it not knowing what he had, and he would certainly return it if he had it—that was what Taylor said of Middleton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I make these sheets up at the close of the day—the red ink marks are the corrections by the Post Office—the entry "Middleton, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., "is scratched out because I did not send the warrant—presuming it was right I placed the money down with the intention that he should take it up—I had not power to part with money belonging to the Post Office—this money did belong to the Post Office—I should not have paid him the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I had known the warrant was for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I found Baker's letter of advice on the file I concluded that I had put it there improperly.</p>

On 12th Jan., I was barman at the Duke of Sussex, Goulston-square—at 10 minutes to 12 o'clock, that night, the privsoner came, asked for a pint of porter, and gave a counterfeit shilling in payment—I asked him where he was going to take the pot to—he said to Mr. King's, his father's. No. 10, Thomas-street, pointing in that direction—I sent the waiter there, while the prisoner remained in the bar—the waiter came back, and said they were all in bed at No. 10—the prisoner then said a man sent him from outside, and told him to go and get the porter—I gave the prisoner in charge, and gave the shilling to the policeman.</p>

               <p>Jan., between 5 and 6 o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop and asked for some dripping—I told him I had got none I could recommend, and he left the shop—he came again in a few minutes, and asked for a bottle, to hold a pint and a half—as I was going to get it I passed him, and he said, "What are you going to do?"—he said that twice—I said, "Nothing, my lad"—he put 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the counter, while I was getting the bottle, and held his thumb on the shilling on the counter—I gave him the bottle—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put it in my mouth and bent it—he was going out quick, I went out too, and walked by his side till I met a constable, and gave him into custody—I gave the shilling to the policeman.</p>

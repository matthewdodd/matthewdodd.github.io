               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar was in your employ. - A. He was; I employed him principally to melt silver, and to work at his leisure hours at his trade; he was a <rs id="t18070916-12-deflabel61" type="occupation">watch case maker</rs>

               <p>Q. How many years had he lived with you. - A. He served his time with my father, and has been with me about twelve years. On the 29th of July last, from a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160009"></xptr>knowledge that I had been robbed a few days before, I took the numbers of the notes that I had in my pocket book; that was in a tin box underneath the desk in the accounting house.</p>
               <p>Court. You took the dates of the bank notes, number, and value. - A. I did: I have the book here. Having taken down the dates and number of the notes, I put them in the pocket book, and the pocket book I put in the tin box which was underneath the desk. On the 29th of July I was absent after two o'clock in the afternoon; I returned about eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. In consequence of some information that you received did you examine your pocket book. - A. I went up immediately on my return and examined it; I found all the notes there, wanting one. I missed a one pound note The next morning I went into the neighbourhood where the prisoner lived, and enquired at the public house nearest his dwelling, Mrs. Milley keeps it; she produced to me the second note, which corresponded to the date, number, and amount of that note I lost; the officer has the note (note produced), it is dated the 12th of June, 35,100.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What year. - A. I did not take the date of the year.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you not to take the date of the year. - A. I have not taken the date; I only swear to the 12th of June, 35,100; I have no doubt of its being my note. The prisoner's lodgings were searched, I was present at the time; we found sixteen guineas, and a small piece of coin, which I have every reason to believe is mine; it is a particular coin, I do not pretend to swear to it. The prisoner was entrusted to melt two quantities of that coin.</p>

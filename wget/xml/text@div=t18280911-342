               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Is there not a way throught your premises? A. Yes; a person may go through - the prisoner has occasionally taken tares through there; I did not make any observations on the sack - I think it was his own; I believe he buys a quanlity of tares and sells them.</p>

            . I am a coachman. I was in Mr. Kent's employ; he called to me and I went after the prisoner, but did not see him; I went into Southampton-street, and there his cart stood and his mate with it; I looked, and saw the prisoner at the corner of King-street beckoning his mate to come to him; I called him - he came and asked what I wanted - I said master wanted to speak to him; he said "I am going to Hatton-garden, and can't come, what can be want with me;" Mr. Kent then came running up the road and accused him of taking the corn - he said he had not and knew nothing about it.</p>

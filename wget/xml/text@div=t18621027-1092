I am an outfitter, at 8, Wells-street, Wellclose-square—it is the custom when vessels come in for my agents to carry my cards on board—on 4th October, between 8 and half-past in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop, and I heard him ask my young man to lend him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—I then asked the prisoner what ship he belonged to—he said the ship <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi>—I asked him where the ship was from—he said, "Rangoon," and that it was lying in the West India Docks—I asked him how long he had been on board, and he said, "Fourteen months"—I asked in what capacity, and he told me, "Steward"—I asked him how much he had a month, and he told me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I would not be sure which—I then said, "If your statement is true, I will lend you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." but previous to that I had Lloyds' list sent for, and I found there was such a ship just arrived, and the captain's name was as he stated—on that I let him have 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—he came to my shop again next morning, which, I believe, was Sunday, and said he wanted some clothing—I questioned him about his wages, whether the statement that he made last evening was correct, and he told me the amount of his wages would be 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., balance, due to him—I asked him if he was sure of that—be said, "Yes"—he then selected a coat. a waistcoat, a pair of trousers, three shirts, a pair of Wellington boots, a silk handkerchief, and a hat, and also asked for a sovereign in money—I gave it to him—it was on his statement that I let him have those things—I asked him again if it was correct, and he said, "Yes; I have told you I have got 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., due to me," and he also wanted to buy a watch and chain of me—he left the shop with the goods, and in about a quarter of an hour, or 20 minutes, he came back, and asked me to let him have another sovereign,—I said, "I could not before 1 o'clock, when I would change a five-pound note—he said he had got a pair of patent leather boots on, which he had bought from a sailor at the Home, for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he had got no more money—I afterwards sent down to the ship and found that he had only come from Queenstown—I afterwards went to a shop in Poplar, kept by a Mr. Richardson, and there I found my</p>

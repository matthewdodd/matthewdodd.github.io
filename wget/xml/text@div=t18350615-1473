               <p>good sixpences, and these memorandums—I asked him if the hat was his—he said no—I asked him where his hat was—he said somewhere about the room, he believed—I shortly after observed that he had this other hat on, which, I believe, is the one which Bringlow had on when I first entered the room—Bringlow then called out, "Where is my hat"—my attended was then called to another part of the room, and then I found Bringlow with this other hat on—I asked Bringlow where he got his hat, and what name was in it—he said, with an oath, that he got it down the lane; and Monks gave me the same answer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. You asked every body in the room whether they had a hat, snd was there not one hat to spare? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes. This one was to spare. in which the money was found—when I took the hat off your head, I asked where you bought it, and you said down the lane, and Bringlow said the same, and that he could bring people to swear that it was his—it is possible some one might have put something into this hat while it stood on the table, without being seen—there was not a hat under the bench.</p>

               <p>Mary Sparkes. About 12 Months ago, the Prisoner Jordan lived with me, and while I was gone to my Aunts to Breakfast, she took the Handkerchief out of my Draws. I taxed her with it, and she denied it: So I troubled my Head no more about it; 'till I accidentally heard Mrs. Bowen had got it. I went to her House, and she shewed me the Handkerchief: I told her it was mine; she said she had it 12 Years, and I must prove it to be mine. or I should suffer for it. I got a Warrant for her, and Jordan, and Bowen produced a different Handkerchief, from what I saw first. Jordan own'd she took it, and sold it Bowen, for 2s. 6d. in exchange for a Gown, and was to give her 1s. 8d. in Money.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you miss it while Jordan liv'd with you?</p>
               <p>Sparkes. Yes, and charg'd her with it.</p>
               <p>Council. How long was it, from the time you lost it, to the time you saw it again?</p>
               <p>Sparkes. I saw it no more, 'till the Morning I took out the Warrant for them.</p>
               <p>Mary Barret: I went with Mrs. Sparkes, to enquire about her Handkerchief: Mrs. Bowen shewed her the right, at first; but when we went again, she produced another. Jordan owned, she was to give Bowen the Handkerchief, and 1 s. 6 d. for a Gown.</p>

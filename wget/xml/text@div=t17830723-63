               <p>I am apprentice to Mr. Priddle, in Bond-street, but in Mr. Nunn's absence, I was in that shop; on the 19th of July, about half after four the prisoner came in, and ordered to the amount of 1 l. 2 s. 9 d. to be sent in an hour's time, in the mean time she stole this remnant.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I suppose so, it being found about her, I saw it before she came in, and I missed it immediately after she was gone out, the goods were to be sent to Mr. Bennet's a copper smith, No. 152, in St. Martin's-lane, and there is no such person nor no such number in the lane, she would not tell me her name, so I suspected her, she was brought back in a quarter of an hour, I am sure of the prisoner's person.</p>

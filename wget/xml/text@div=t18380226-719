                  </hi>. I am a constable, and live at No. 19, Ann-street, Pentonville. On the 27th of January I went to No. 127) Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, at a little after three o'clock in the afternoon—two officers, named Duke and Hall, were with me—I found the street-door of the house open—I went up two pair of stairs, followed by Duke and Hall—when I got to the top of the two pair of stain there was no landing—there was a door which was shut—I tried it, and found the fastening of the door——in feeling about for the fastening, I found a piece of cord hanging down—I laid hold of that with my right hand, and put my left hand on the latch—by pulling the cord I removed a log of wood, which was placed against the door, and opened it—I entered the room immediately; and on the left-hand side of the room, sitting in front of a small furnace, on a stool, was the prisoner—he had on a waistcoat with sleeves—there was charcoal in the furnace—as soon as I entered the room he rose up from the seat—he had a small brush in his right hand—Duke and Hall had followed me into the room—I took hold of him on one side, and Duke took hold of him by the other side—he resisted having the handcuffs on, and dropped the brush on the ground—I handed him over to Hall—Duke went to the fur<lb></lb>nace, turned round, and said, "Reynolds, look at this, feel this"—he showed me a sixpence, as if it had been under the process of gilding—I felt it, and it was quite warm—it appeared yellow—I then went to a bench close to the window, alongside of where the prisoner had been sitting—I removed a tin dish containing charcoal-ashes, and then saw the lid of a tin box—on removing that, I saw three silver sixpences under the box-lid—I called Hall, and gave them to him—he took them up—I afterwards</p>

               <p>produced, and which is generally used for the purpose by watch-gilders; it is then held over a charcoal furnace, the quicksilver is driven away by the heat, and a brush is applied to take away the remaining portions—these basins each contain quicksilver, and the bottles also contain quicksilver—this glass vessel when at the police-office smelt very strongly of acid—I could not tell what—there is quicksilver in it—they both contain quicksilver, and the bottles also—two of these half-sovereigns produced by Hall resemble the sixpences.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose, by the colour of gold you mean coin to look like gold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have said nothing about coin—I am not aware of any materials ca<lb></lb>pable of producing the colour of gold on coin, unless it has gold—I will not undertake to swear they will not produce the colour of gold on coin—lam not a chemist—I carry a little bottle about with me sometimes to test bad silver—it was not given me by a chemist—I saw this amalgam at the po<lb></lb>lice-office—the officer took it away with the other things—I had not seen it before it was at the police-office—I merely looked at it then; but I have to state, that I took a portion of it and tested it, and am prepared to stale what it is, and I have the result of my trial in my pocket—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it is an experiment I made from a portion of the amalgam I had from Duke—it was not produced before the Magistrate—I have had it since from Duke, and tested it—that was in the absence of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prisoner, and have been about a year and an half - I am turned of fourteen. I found a great piece of iron in the street, and carried it to my mistress; and with this iron she broke open the door, where Mr. Shirley's coals lay.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she break it open?</p>
               <p>Wood. About twelve o'clock at noon.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you came to be an apprentice was this done?</p>
               <p>Wood. A good while after, but I don't know how long.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do, when the cellar door was broke open?</p>
               <p>Wood. She took coals out of the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she take the coals out?</p>
               <p>Wood. She took the coals out at night; she has often emptied the cellar of the coals; I have helped her to take them away my self; and when she went into the house to clean the knives, she used to pin napkins upon me, to bring away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her bring away any napkins?</p>
               <p>Wood. I never saw her bring any away.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the knives and forks away?</p>
               <p>Wood. She brought some, and I brought some.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to bring these things away?</p>
               <p>Wood. She forced me to do it, she used to beat me very much.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do with these things?</p>
               <p>Wood. She burnt the coals.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do with the napkins?</p>
               <p>Wood. She laid them upon the table to eat her victuals off - She used the plates, and knives, and forks when she eat her victuals.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any instance of her selling any of these things?</p>
               <p>Wood. I never knew that she did - I have seen her put them up in a box, when she came home.</p>

               <p>Robson. I had no business to stop her; because she said she bought them.

On the 16th of December about seven o'clock in the evening the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to look at a watch; being engaged myself I directed my shopman to shew him one; the prisoner made an objection to a watch, and requested to see another, and while my man was gone to the window, he went out of the shop and took a watch with him; my man gave me the alarm; my man and Mr. Lydiard pursued after the prisoner, and they took him to Mr. Hillier's shop; I went over and saw my watch, I knew it to be mine.</p>
               <p>MR. HILLIER. I am a linen draper in Ludgate-street; I was in Mr. Miles's shop at the time this happened; the young was shewing him some watches, he made an objection to them; he went out of the shop as I thought to point to one, he did not; I pursued him, he ran into Union-street, where he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing found upon him. - A. The patrol searched him in my house, where he was taken to; the watch was found close to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at the time. - A. He implored for mercy, and wished to see Mr. Miles alone; they went into my back shop together.</p>

            . I am a watchmaker, I work for Mr. Miles. The prisoner came into the shop to look at a watch; I shewed him a gold hunting watch, he objected to its winding up on the dial plate, he desired to have one that did not. While I was gone to look for one, he went out of the shop, he said he would shew me one in the window; I asked directly did the gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130013"></xptr>leave a watch on the counter, the reply was no; then I gave the alarm and pursued him; I saw him after he was taken in Mr. Hillier's shop; I was present when the watch was found; I knew it to be the watch that I had shewed him; it is worth seven pounds.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney, to Miles. I believe this poor boy shewed a great deal of contrition. - A. He did; if any recommendation of mine will induce the court to be merciful towards him it will be a great satisfaction to me.</p>

On the 17th of December, between six and seven, the prisoner came into the shop, she asked to look at some tippets, I shewed them her; she took this tippet up and said it was a pretty one; she kept it in her hand, it had white spots in it. She then asked to look at some gloves; I told her we did not deal in gloves. She reached over to the drawer, and then walked towards the door, and I saw the end of a tippet hanging out of her handkerchief as she was going out; I took hold of her and told her that she had got a tippet of mine; she said she had not, and flung it out of the handkerchief, on the side of the shop window; she tore herself from me and ran out of the door as fast as she could; I ran after her, she was stopped and brought back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Upon your asking for the tippet she shook her handkerchief and out it fell - A. I cannot tell. This is the tippet, it is mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel; called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

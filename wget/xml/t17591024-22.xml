            . On a Wednesday at night; about three weeks ago; about ten o'clock; I was in liquor in Hedge-lane; going home to my master's house, I was drawn in by this girl at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How drawn in?</p>
               <p>Fenlason. She laid hold on my arm, and I went into a house with her; there was only she, and she drawed me into a room.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was it?</p>
               <p>Fenlason. I do not know the name of the people of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Fenlason. I never saw her before; I went to my place but on the Wednesday, and this was the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a light in the room?</p>
               <p>Fenlason. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen your watch before you went into that room ?</p>
               <p>Fenlason. I was at Temble-Bar along with some people drinking just before, and I had my watch then; and I am sure I had it in my pocket when I went into the house with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her taking it from you?</p>
               <p>Fenlason. I remember her hand being in my pocket; but do not remember her taking it out.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you miss it?</p>
               <p>Fenlason. I miss'd it the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found it again?</p>
               <p>Fenlason. It was stopp'd at Little Turn-Stile, Holborne, by

I first read the warrant—when I came to the word "plane" the prisoner said, "Oh, I have got the plane!"—he went to the cupboard in the front parlour and produced it—Mr. Hewitt said that was his plane—I then went to the cupboard and found two castors—this other castor I found in the bed-room—the prisoner said he put them into his pocket when he was at work, went home, threw off his coat at home, and they were left at home—I afterwards found these two boxes in his bed-room—they were pointed out by Bonney—he said in the prisoner's presence, "Mr. Hewitt, these are your property; they are made of your wood"—the prisoner said they were not Mr. Hewitt's wood, and Bonney bad not made them—in the front parlour I found this square, which was pointed out by Bonney, who said it was made of Mr. Hewitt's wood, and he had made it—the prisoner said it was not Mr. Hewitt's, and Bonney had not made it—I found a rule in a small box on the parlour table—Mr. Hewitt said it was his rule—it was marked with the prisoner's name—I afterwards found four picture-frames which Bonney said he made, or assisted in making, out of Mr. Hewitt's wood—the prisoner said they were not Mr. Hewitt's wood, and Bonney had not made them—I then took him into custody—I afterwards searched a box of his and found a nest of drawers—Bonney stated they were made of Mr. Hewitt's wood.</p>

               <p>Somers-town. I was formerly in the serivce of Mr. Hewitt—I was so in June, 1841—I remember Mr. Hewitt being ill, and being in the country—the prisoner was foreman, and I was under his orders—while Mr. Hewitt was away I made this nest of drawers by the prisoner's order in the factory during the usual business hours—I made them out of Mr. Hewitt's wood—the prisoner said he had liberty from Mr. Hewitt to make them, or any thing he liked—I made these picture-frames by the prisoner's orders out of Mr. Hewitt's wood, partly at the factory, and partly at my own house—I made this drawing square by his orders out of Mr. Hewitt's wood—it is the same wood as is used at the factory—I delivered it to the prisoner after I made it—these two boxes were made by the prisoner himself at the factory, during Mr. Hewitt's absence, of Mr. Hewitt's wood—I cannot speak of this rule—I have seen such an one about—this plane, I believe, belongs to Mr. Hewitt.</p>

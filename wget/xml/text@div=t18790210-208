                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper, of 5, Dock Street, London Docks—the prisoners lived with me two or three days, and asked me to settle with them and give them change out of these two advance notes for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I did so, and gave them 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, they are both for the same ship, they had had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each in board and lodging—I believed the notes to be genuine, but afterwards noticed that the date, 3rd January, ought to have been February—I went to the shipping-office to get it altered, and the result of my inquiries was that I gave the prisoners in custody—they were not endorsed—that is not done until the men go on board ship.</p>

                  </hi>. I am captain of the eighth batalion of the Royal Ar<lb></lb>tillery. The prisoner was brought before me to enlist on the 12th, to the best of my recollection—I do not remember at what time, but I think it was in the morning—I was not before Mr. Stace when he was taken to him to be attested—he continued in the service about two months, when an ap<lb></lb>plication was made by a female to see him—I saw her, in his presence, about a fortnight after her first application—I sent for him, to know whether the woman who had made application at the barracks was his wife—I heard from the colonel of an application, made by the woman, for her husband to live out of the barracks—it is customary to allow married men to live out of the barracks—the woman came to ask that permission, and I sent for him, to ask if he was married—he said "Yes"—being married, and having sworn he was not, I said I should not allow him to go out—he made no observation in reply.</p>

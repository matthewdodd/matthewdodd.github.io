            . I am in the service of Mr. Wittel - he is a baker. I had been out on the 25th of August; I received from his customer 4l. 10s., I think - I put it into my box in my bed-room, between twelve and one o'clock, and the prisoner left in the evening, about eight; when she was gone I went to my box, and missed the money - she had not seen me put it there.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner on the 23rd of September, from the information of her sister, in Church-lane, Whitechapel; I asked her how she could think of robbing her employer - she said she did it, because she wished to leave the country; I asked what she had taken - she said 4l. 18s., and 4l. was in sovereigns; she said she saw a young woman on Tower-hill, and she went with her to Cheshunt and to Coventry, where she robbed her of her money and clothes, and that she had walked back on foot; I believe she had the same dress on that she has now, but she did not appear so clean - she did not tell me where she got the money.</p>

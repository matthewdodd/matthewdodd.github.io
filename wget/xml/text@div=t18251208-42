On the 23d of November, about six o'clock in the morning I went out, leaving him in bed in the room; I came home about five o'clock in the evening, and he was gone. I missed the property stated in the indictment, and which I had locked up in a box, and kept the key in my pocket - I found it unlocked, but the lock was not broken - I had opened it the day before, and every thing was then right. I found them on the 2d of December, at Bow-street, in possession of Birchall - they are worth 5l. 5s.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 23d of November, about four o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in Cockspur-street, with two coats loose on his arm, two waistcoats, a pair of trousers, a pair of breeches, and three shirts - he had a silver watch in his pocket, with 25s., and 101/2d. I asked where he got them - he said he had bought them at Chatham a month ago. Dawkins had stopped him, and brought him over to me - I have had the property ever since.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I stopped the prisoner with all these things on his arm, and asked where he got them; he said in the Borough - that they were his own, and he was taking them to Oxford-place - that he had given 7l. for them. I took him over to Birchall.</p>

                  </hi>. I was barman at 287, Oxford-street, where the prisoner was potman; we slept in the same room. On 9th or 10th of Oct. I went into the country, leaving a pair of Wellington boots there—I returned on 22nd, and the prisoner was not there, or the boots—I never allowed him to use my things—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the boots—I believe they are mine, but they have been altered a great deal—this piece on the side I put on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Arthur Trumper, the prisoner's uncle. About three weeks or a month before I went before the Magistrate, the prisoner came to my master's with a pair of boots on his feet, and asked my master to lend him a pair of shoes, as the boots were worn out—he lent him a pair, and the prisoner took off the boots and left them—I gave them to the constable.</p>

I took the prisoner on ano<lb></lb>ther charge, at Harefield—he said the only thing he had done wrong was stealing a pair of boots from Mr. Field's in Oxford-street, which he had left at his uncle's at Egham—I got these boots from there.</p>

Q.</hi> On whose oath was this summons granted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On mine—Hurst did not give me any instructions to take the prisoner—he was acquitted on the other charge—I went to Mr. Field, and was instructed about the boots—the Magistrate did not tell me to look after the prosecutor before I took the prisoner—Hurst was very reluctant to come up: I do not recollect telling him he would have the trouble of a second journey if he did not—I learned his address at Mr. Field's—he did not say he had any doubt about the boots—I do not recollect telling him the boots could be proved to be his—I charge for my expenses in going to Egham, and being here to-day, and all the Sessions—the prisoner did not say he had done wrong in taking the boots without paying the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not tell me his mother was going to send a post-office order up.</p>

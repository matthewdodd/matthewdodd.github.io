               <p>Q. What do you mean by facing? - A. The letters are all mixed promiscuously when they come to the Post-office, and the facing is, putting the face upwards, that the direction may be seen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The letters, when they first come to the office, do not come to the eighth division immediately? - A. No; they go through several other hands.</p>
               <p>Q.Before they come to the eighth division, where the prisoner was? - A. They come to him in the first instance; when they come to the Post-office, in the first instance, he has to do with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go through other hands? - A. There are so many hands employed, that they may come through other hands.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that Bank-note of 10l.; has that Bank-note at any time been in your possession? - A. It has; there are my own figures upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to say how it came into your possession? - A. I am not; I can tell that a person bought three sixteenth shares of lotterytickets at my office.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear from any thing upon that Bank-note, that you had a knowledge that that Bank-note was paid for those shares? - A. I am certain of it; there are the check numbers of the shares upon the back of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the description of those shares that you sold, for which you received that 10l. note? - A.The lottery number; 51; check, 202: 2046, the lottery number; check, 204: 40465, the lottery number; check, 257.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabout was it you sold these shares? - A. I think, from the 25th to the 31st of January.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you a memory at all of the person who bought the shares? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you afterwards pay this Bank-note? - A. To the Equitable Assurance-office.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it afterwards that you heard any more of it? - A. On the 2nd or 3rd of February I received some directions from Mr. Parkin; I had informed him of my having sold these three shares.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at the prisoner at the bar; do you know him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it he made his appearance at your office? - A. On the 28th or 29th of March; the prisoner desired I would stop No. 51, having lost his pocket-book near Whitehall; he told me it was the only sixteenth there was in it; upon which I told him I was very glad he had called, having been placed in a very disagreeable situation concerning No. 51; I told him I must insist upon his going to Mr. Parkin, I took his direction before I mentioned any thing to him, and then I told him I was glad he had called, for I had been placed in a very disagreeable situation, and I must insist upon his going to Mr. Parkin with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him about a Bank-note that had been paid to you? - A. I told him I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200036"></xptr>had received a Bank-note for the share, No. 51, that had been stole; upon which he desired I would give him time to recollect himself.</p>
               <p>Q.About what? - A.About the Bank-note; he told me, when he purchased No. 51, he had received that week three 10l. Bank-notes; he did not object to go to Mr. Parkin, but begged I would give him time to recollect himself where he had received these Bank-notes; upon which I told him I by all means wished him to have time, this was either Monday or Tuesday morning, I don't know which; on Wednesday he called, and I went to Mr. Parkin with him; Mr. Parkin not being at home, I appointed the next morning at ten o'clock; he came at the time appointed very exact, but it so happened that my business was such, I could not go with him, and he went by himself.</p>
               <p>Q.When he first came, had he the usual dress of a letter-carrier? - A.When he came to stop the share he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about his purchasing the other numbers? - A. No; I told him I was afraid he had purchased some more shares.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that the first time he came to you? - A. Yes; I told him Mr. Parkin was the proper person to explain it to, and I did not enter into any further particulars with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether the person who bought the shares was dressed in a letter-carrier's dress? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The first time he came was on the Monday? - A.It was on the Monday or Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q.You told him there was an enquiry on foot? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And that Mr. Parkin was the person to whom it was to be explained? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you that he had that very week he had purchased these shares received three 10l. notes? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore wished for time to recollect where he had got them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him time? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He had full warning, and an opportunity of making his escape? - A. Yes; I think it was Monday that he came first; it was on Thursday morning that he called upon me the last time.</p>
               <p>Q.He went with you on the Wednesday, and Mr. Parkin was not at home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the next morning he came to you, and you could not go? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Between each time having an opportunity of making his escape? - A. Yes; he said he was as innocent as a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Q. You have frequently occasion, in your office, to want change to give your customers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you not know it is very frequent to ask of the collectors of the letters to change notes for people in whole district they live? - A.Certainly; I have asked out postman for change, but not very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that it is a common thing? - A. I dare say it is.</p>
               <p>Q.Could any thing be more open or explicit than this man's conduct? - A.Certainly not.</p>

             sworn. - On the 31st of March last, the prisoner came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q.What day of the week was it? - A. I think it was on the Thursday; he said, he came from Mr. Carter, at Charing-cross, respecting a 10l. Bank-note that had been put off there for a lottery ticket; he said, that about a month or six weeks before, as near as he could recollect as to the time, he bought a sixteenth share of a ticket, for which he paid 1l. 3s. 6d. I told him it was very important, that he should recollect where he got the 10l. Bank-note.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he admitted that he had paid the 10l. note? - A. Yes; he said he could not tell where he got the 10l. Bank-note; I asked him if he did not know it was a regulation in the Office, that the letter-carriers should be able to say of whom they took Bank-notes, by writing something upon them; he said, he did, and he took a Bank-note of one pound out of his pocket that he had wrote upon that note his own name, and that that was the mode in which he wrote upon all Bank-notes that he received; he said, that was his usual mode; he said, the share was not for himself, but for one

             was a servant of Mrs. Lewis there; I asked him if he had sent the share to Carden, he said he had not; I asked him if he had registered the share, he said he had not; I asked him if he had advised the man of the purchase he had made, he said he had not; I asked him if he had bought it by Carden's direction, he said, no, he had bought it of his own accord for him; I asked him where the share was, he said he had lost his pocket-book on the 21st of March, between Parliament-street and the Post-office; that the pocket-book contained some redirected letters, a share of a lottery-ticket, a twopound Bank-note, a one-pound Bank-note, and two pawnbroker's duplicates. He again repeated that he had negociated the note at Mr. Carter's office for the sixteenth, still speaking of one sixteenth only. At this time I had not heard what had passed between Mr. Carter and the prisoner, except what the prisoner had himself said; but some time before that I had had communication with Mr. Carter, and from Mr. Carter I had learned there were three sixteenths sold at the time the 10l. note was negociated. I told the prisoner I understood there were three sixteenths bought; he said, he had only bought one sixteenth. Upon which I turned to some papers that I had upon the subject, and then I stated to him with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200037"></xptr>more certainly than I had done before, that three sixteenths were bought at Mr. Carter's office. He then, for the first time, said, he had bought three sixteenths; that he paid 1l. 3s. 6d. for each share; he said, he thought he had said so to me at the first. I then thought it was necessary he should be taken before a Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any body to controul him at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the main subject of your enquiry was, whether this man had paid for the lottery tranfaction with a 10l. note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That he had paid a 10l. note at that office, he did not attempt to deny; it might have been thought extravagant his buying three at once, and he concealed it? - A. He did conceal it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Is there not an order at the Post-office, that a letter-carrier shall not have any thing to do with shares in the lottery? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. We have heard there is some regulation in the Post-office, in order to enable letter-carriers to know from whom they receive Bank-notes? - A. I always put upon them the name of the person from whom I receive them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the general rule at the Post-office? - A. I have been given to understand that they are to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether the prisoner has received that direction, or has conformed to it? - A. He has conformed to it for any thing I know; I have seen his name endorsed upon many Bank-notes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that it is very frequently done by very honest servants in the Post-office to give change for Bank-notes? - A. It is; they will oblige merchants and tradesmen with cash for notes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. Q. When they do that, if they conform to the regulation of the Office, they will write upon it the name of the person from whom they receive it? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. And they might omit such a thing? - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Moss.) You are a clerk in the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the Bank ever issue two notes of the same date, same number, and same sum? - A. It must be a very great mistake indeed if they do.</p>

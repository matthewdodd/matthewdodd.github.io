                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Robertson, M'Clean and Robertson, of Falcon Wharf, Blackfriars, lead and glass merchants—the prisoner has been for several years traveller to the firm—his salary last year was 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, and a guinea a day for traveling expenses—we were in every respect satisfied with him—his duty in the course of his journey was to collect money and orders, and to transmit them to us by letters, and on his return he handed me in the book of his receipts—these are some of the letters received during 1859—I should suppose that all the letters advising me of remittances are in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is one of the cash-books kept by the prisoner, and this one also (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on his return from his journey he would hand me this book, which I understood contained a statement of the monies received by him during the time he had been away—I do not go over the book with him; I ascertain its correctness by comparing it with the remittances entered in our cash-book—as the monies arrived they were entered in our cash-book—at the end of each journey he makes up this book, and hands to me the book and the balance shown to be due by his own statement—these are the only books of which I had any knowledge; I had never seen these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)until the prisoner was taken into custody—they were used by him for the purpose of entering his orders and the money as he received them—I believe they were given out by us, but they were never returned to us—we never required the return of any of them, or the iuspection of them at all—it is the custom of our house to require an inspection of them—I have never, from the time of his being with us, seen or had any return made of these books—I have no knowledge of the custom of the trade beyond that of our own house of business—Mr. William Day is a customer of our's—I have no doubt that the prisoner was there at the time—this is the cash-book in which the prisoner accounts to me—I find in it an entry, on 10th February, of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>) is one of the books for February, 1859—in it it appears, from the prisoner's handwriting, that he has received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it is not under the same date as the other—this appears to be dated 26th January, 1859, at the top of the page—this appears to be all January, but it is the same amount—I find an entry of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Mr. Day; besides that, there is "9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. discount," as if written in after-wards—he accounted to me for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he never mentioned any sum of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due from Mr. Day, nor any error—the prisoner had a discretion as to the amount of discount to be allowed—Mr. Baines, a plumber, at Cheshunt, is a customer of ours—find in this book an entry, "27th June, 1859, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from"—in the memorandum-book, on the same day, it stands, "C. Baines, cash, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; bill at three months, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.: total, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—</p>

               <p>this is also in his handwriting; it is his private book—in it he enters, at 27th June, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the end of the book, in a list of names, I find the name of "Baines, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—this is a ledger, which the prisoner took with him on his journeys, containing a list of all the accounts he had to collect, made up by himself, in his own handwriting; in it the balance at Christmas stands 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as due to us by C. Baines, of Cheshunt—this paper is in the prisoner's handwriting; he was there in March, 1860—this purports to be an account of what Mr. Baines owed to us—the date of it is 6th March, 1860—I find the balance here 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner has never accounted to me for the sums of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I find that the prisoner's cash-book, which he handed to me at those dates, correspond with his letters of advice and remittances.</p>

               <p>no note of the names—I have not inquired whether those are errors or not—I forget the date when I caused the prisoner to be given in custody; you can refer to the deposition—I applied for the warrant myself, but I took no note of the date—I applied for the warrant on 28th April—between that time and last Monday I looked at those books, in some cases, to see what entries the prisoner had made—in this particular case I did not, nor any of those which were tried on Monday, but I sent for those books yesterday, and I then looked at Baines' and Day's—the prisoner had not finished his accounts for this journey; he was on the journey when he was taken in custody—he was not called upon in any way to go through his accounts or to balance the books—this journeyman's cash-book was merely put into my hands, and I looked to see whether it corresponded with the letters of advice—I never called on him to make up his accounts—it is quite possible that he sent up 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the last week of his journey before he was taken in custody; I do not know—he sent up 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the day before he was taken into custody, and possibly 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the day before the warrant was taken—I ac<lb></lb>knowledged the remittance in my usual manner; "Dear Sir," very possibly—when I have complained of a large allowance of discount being made, the prisoner has said he should be happy to go through it—sometimes I have gone through some particular items—I have not, since 1857, been through the accounts with him at all; the book itself is the account—nothing was said, at the time he was given in custody, about two items of eighteen months ago—all he knew about it was that my solicitor sent him notice that he would be tried—100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his salary is owing to him—since his committal he has brought an action—he was allowed to use his discretion about the discounts—commission would not be allowed to a person who recommended a good customer—supposing that instead of taking a journey to a certain person, the prisoner were to get that person over to where he himself was, he would not be allowed to charge their expenses—at the end of each journey he enters a sum for incidental expenses—I pay those expenses, as expenses incurred by him, and I suppose them to be reasonable; if they were unreasonable I should object—I know nothing of his allowing a person in that way—if it were allowed it would be entered in the incidental expenses—I do not inquire into them; I take it for granted that he has spent the money in some mode for our business—there is always a charge for booking made—in many cases, if the customer complains of the booking, it is allowed to them—in point of fact, it is part of the carriage under another name—we make a charge for carting, under the head of booking—that is not done whether there has been carting or not—if the customer objects, a portion would be taken off; a discretion is allowed to the tra<lb></lb>veller; and sometimes he might take it all off, in the case of a good cus<lb></lb>tomer—the prisoner's salary has been gradually increased from 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the last increase was some time last year—I wrote to him, and told him that I should increase his salary 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is possible that that was in April; I really do not know, I kept no copy of the letter—I am at the business every day for many hours—I am there from 9 in the morning, and am generally there till 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon; every day in the week—sometimes I take a holiday for one or two days—the prisoner has increased his portion of our business considerably—he was a good servant to us; that was why we increased his salary—there have not been very heavy duties for him to perform—we have others who perform as heavy duties, and who perform them equally well—he performed his journeys two or three times a year; some were long and some were short—</p>

               <p>he should usually visit each place three times a year—I really cannot tell you how many places he had to visit; I really do not know whether there were as many as 200—it would be very difficult to answer that question—he went down to the south coast; and north, as far as Norwich—he kept to the eastern coast—I should say he has certainly not been absent on those journeys as many as 360 days out of 365; I am not sure that he has not—sometimes he remained in town two or three days; never less than that—sometimes he remained a week.</p>

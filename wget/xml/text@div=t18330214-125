On the 4th of February the prisoner came and brought some goods from Mr. Exton's; I was first going to pay him 1l. 6s. 6d. for them; I put 1l. worth of silver on the counter, but my husband called me into the parlour, and told me to pay him 13s., and send 1/4 cwt. of sugar back - I forgot at the moment that I had put the 1l. on the counter, and paid the prisoner the 13s.; I then remembered the money that I laid on the counter, and I said to him, "Have you seen any money on the counter?"- he said No; I said "Search your pockets and see if you have not - what money had you?" he said, "I have only 3d.;" I then gave him 1d. for half a pint of beer, and he went out of the shop - I looked about and missed the money; I told my husband - then went after the prisoner to Mr. Exton's, and asked them to send for a Policeman, but they would not; Mr. Exton then came in, and I asked him to send for one, but he would not; the prisoner then said he would go with me to the Police-office - I was going on with him and met a gentleman; I asked him if he would go with me to the station, which he said he would; the prisoner had denied it, and said at Mr. Exton's, that he had not got the money, all he had was 3d. - I had seen him move his hand in going along, from his breeches-pocket to his waistcoat, and the 1l. in silver was found on him at the station - I am sure I had left it on the counter; no one else had come into the shop.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What was the amount of the goods the prisoner brought? A. I can tell the money I paid - I had paid him 1l. 10s. on the day before; and on that day I had paid him 1l. 10s., but that was the first time he came - he came again that day and I paid him 13s., when he denied having any more than 3d. and the 1d. I gave him for beer; he went voluntarily to the station-house.</p>

             (Police-constable D 11). I met the prisoner in Seymour-place; the witness said he had robbed her of 20s. - he said he had no money of hers; I took him to the station, and found in an inside pocket on the left side of his waistcoat, 14 shillings, 12 sixpences, and four pence in copper - the prosecutrix said, he had said he had only 3d., that he showed it her, and she gave him a penny for bringing the goods.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say that this was what he had saved from his wages? A. Yes; but he did not say that this was the amount of what I should find on him - I searched his other pockets; there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140061"></xptr>small holes in each of his trousers pockets; his master said he had always behaved very correct.</p>

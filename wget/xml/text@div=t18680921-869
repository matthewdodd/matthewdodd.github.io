I am a water-side labourer, and live at 11, Suffolk Street, Borough; I had known the deceased seven or eight years; he was a costermonger, and was about thirty years of age—he lodged at Levy's lodging-house, in Disney Street, the prisoner was deputy there, and his wife assisted—on this night, about a little after eight o'clock, I was with Johnson; I left him at the corner of the Old Justice public-house, about sixty yards from the lodging-house; he was in liquor; he had no capon—I went in doors and was called out again, I went as far as Levy's greengrocer's shop, and saw Johnson leaning against the wall—I persuaded him to go home, which he did—I went with him; he was able to walk—the front door was open; he went through the passage—I did not see anything of the prisoner theft—he was inside about two or three minutes—I heard a bit of a row, I could not tell the voices—Johnson then came out, and the prisoner's wife followed him out, and the prisoner came directly after her—I took Johnson as far as Harris Street, about six yards from the lodging-house—he then said, "I am stabbed; "and he pointed to the prisoner, and told me to run after him, he was about twenty yards off at the time, and running—I ran after him about one hundred yards before I caught him—I said to him, "You have stabbed Johnson"—he said nothing—I asked what he had done with the knife—he said nothing—other persons ran up, and Driscol gave me a knife, I did not see him pick it up—I gave it to the constable, who took charge of the prisoner—the prisoner was sober—I saw no marks of violence upon him.</p>

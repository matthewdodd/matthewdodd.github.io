I gave it to Barton - he asked for some lean to it; the prisoner said it should be cut fair; I said, nonsense, I will cut it fair; the prisoner after that, said he should never come there any more; Barton d - d his old eyes, and said he would come there, or else he would have his bl - y life; the prisoner said "Go out, and never come here any more." The deceased repeated that he would have his bl - y life, and he would have money; he called him a bl - y old b - r; he struck him a very hard blow in the mouth, with his double fist; he only struck him once at first. I said "George, for Heaven's sake, go out." He said d - n his bl - y eyes, he would not, he would have money, and it was his determination to have what he wanted. The prisoner left the room - he was not gone a moment, and when he returned he said "Get out;" Barton said he would not, and then fetched the prisoner two heavy blows in the stomach, with his double fist, as before. He was a strong powerful man: the prisoner then struck him with a dagger - I had not seen it in his hand till he struck him; Barton went as far as the street-door - I took hold of his arm - I did not think any thing was the matter with him, and said "George, what nonsense;" he fell on his back and fetched a sigh; I begged of the prisoner to call somebody in; he said "Who shall I call?" he opened the door and called Watch! Watch! I told him the watch was not on, and asked him to go next door, to call a man; he went and knocked at his door, but he was gone to bed - he went a little further, and asked if any one could tell him where to find an officer - he returned immediately and did not offer to run away. I have heard the deceased say, many times, that he was determined to have the prisoner's life; I told the prisoner of it - he has threatened my life many times, and to rob the house and murder us both. I have told the prisoner what he has said - he did rob the house six or eight months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the prisoner called the watch, had you not said, "Oh! he is killed?" A. Yes, and then he called the watchman. I did not observe any thing in his hand till after it was done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Was not this as profligate and wicked a young man as could be? A. Nobody worse. The prisoner was doatingly fond of him, and did all in his power to reclaim him. The house was always open to him; he was always kindly received; he was a man likely to put his threat into execution. The prisoner was certainly in danger of his life.</p>

            . I am a coal whipper, and have known the prisoner and deceased about three years. I was at the Phoenix public-house on this evening, from five o'clock till half-past seven; the deceased was drinking there with me: the prisoner was sitting at another table, with a friend - the deceased was sober. A collection was made for a member of our club; the prisoner said he had 1 s., which he gave - the deceased said he had half-a-crown - somebody said he had better keep it, for he might want it himself; Barton said he should want some more money; I said I thought his grandfather would give him some; he said he had half-a-crown; I said that was enough for a young man to spend in an evening - he said it was not the half-quarter of a quarter of enough, and he would have some more from his grandfather, or would lose his own life, or have his bl - y old life - the prisoner was not near enough to hear this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was he a violent passionate young man? A. Very; he was a wicked rash young man, and strong in stature.</p>

            . I am a constable, and took the prisoner. I was taking him down the street, and heard him talking to the street-keeper about the case - I desired him not to say a word, for if he did I must give it in evidence; we walked a few yards; I had hold of his arm: he looked me in the face, and said, "I have done the job;" but before that he said,</p>

               <p>"You will never take him again:" I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270024"></xptr>him in custody for felony three or four years ago, and had been after him that week for a burglary.</p>

            . The prisoner passed my door between half-past eight and nine o'clock, without hat, coat, or waistcoat, and said he wished to find an officer; he returned in five minutes without one, and seemed in a very agitated state; I followed him to his house, and saw the deceased laying in the passage; somebody went for a surgeon; a scabbard-sheath was found by the headborough. I went after the prisoner was gone to the watch-house, and searched the house - I found this dagger in the sitting-room, behind an old basket in a recess; it was quite wet with blood.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that the deceased had frequently threatened his life, and, being a man of depraved habits, was likely to put his threats into execution; but he was still so doatingly fond of him that he had bequeathed him a legacy, and always supplied him with money; and declared that he had only armed himself with this weapon with a view to alarm him, but the wound was given by accident, in defending himself.</p>

            . I am acquainted with Mrs. Hill, and visited her at the prisoner's house. I have frequently seen the prisoner and deceased there; his conduct was very kind to the deceased, who used to bl - st and swear at him, and say he would have money. About a month before this happened I was at supper there; Barton came to the window, and asked the prisoner to give him money - the prisoner said, "George, you had some this morning" - he said, "You bl - y old b - r, if you don't give me money to night, I'll have your bl - y life." The prisoner was alarmed, went up stairs, opened the window, and called the watchman to assist him; he was very much frightened indeed.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's will was here put in and proved - it was dated the 6th of February, 1825, and bequeathed 150 to the deceased; 25 to be paid immediately after his funeral, and the rest at 1 per week; also his household furniture, &amp;c.</p>

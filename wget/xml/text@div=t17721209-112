               <p>On her cross examination she said she did not know the prisoner's character when she went to live with him; that the other maid was awake when she went up; that one of his hands was lame, but yet he could use it; that her mistress and fellow servant lay up one pair of stairs; that her mistress and fellow servant said next day they did not hear her cry out, though she did cry out when she got up after the first time; that he asked her to drink but she refused it; that it was the first time she had ever been known by any man. She was asked how much she expected as a compensation for the injury, to which she replied six or seven guineas; upon which the court directed the jury to acquit the prisoner.</p>

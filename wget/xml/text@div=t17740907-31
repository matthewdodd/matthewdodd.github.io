When I came down in the morning of the 4th of August, at a little after six o'clock, I missed all my men out of the brewhouse; I went to the back door; there I saw them about a house where the prisoner lived; I went up to them; the men told me the people in that house had got some of my pigs; we waited till a constable came; as soon as he came we went into the house; there we found the two pigs dead in the cellar: I am certain they are my pigs; I keep about six or seven. The inhabitants of the house do not bear the best of characters; we could not tell which were the thieves; so we took up all the men in the house; it is a lodging house; Perkins appeared to be the master of it; they were all in the house in different apartments; they all said they did not know any thing about the matter.</p>

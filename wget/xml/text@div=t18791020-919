                  </hi>. I was at the Admiral Nelson, Grey Coat Place, West<lb></lb>minster, on Saturday evening, 27th September, with Smith, the grenadier—the prisoners came in shortly afterwards, and Flynn said "Halloa! old boy.

               <p>from him—about 10 minutes afterwards I drank my beer and was going ont of the door, when the prisoners came up to me and struck me on the right side of the face, knocking me down—I can hardly tell which did it—no one else was there to do it—there were two soldiers with me—Smith was near me, but he did not touch me—I fell on my back over a table, and my head came in contact with the floor about 3 feet from the door, and I became in<lb></lb>sensible—when I recovered I was at the police-station, and missed my watch and chain—I saw it afterwards at the police-station—I had had a glass or two, but was not incapable until I received the blow.</p>

I am a private in the 1st Battalion of the Grenadier Guards—I was with Burton on 27th September at the Admiral Nelson, and before that at the Crown, in York Street, and the Prince of Wales—we had a pot of ale in each place between four of us, myself, Burton, a Coldstream, and a female who was with him—the prisoners and four or five men came in while we were at the Admiral Nelson—Neal was on a bench behind Burton, and tried to speak to him, but Burton would not—we remained about 10 or 15 minutes, and were leaving when I saw Flynn knock Burton down against a bench, and snatch his watch and chain from his pocket—Burton fell on his back near the door, and I snatched the watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of Neal's hand, and handed it over to the landlady at the bar—Burton lay on the floor—I do not know if he was insensible, but he did not move—the prisoners and five or six others ran away—I caught Flynn 50 yards away near a urinal, and a crowd got round me and pulled him away, and I went to the police-station and gave information—Burton was a little the worse for drink, but was fully sensible and not drunk.</p>

I was on duty in Dean-street, and saw the prisoner at half-past four o'clock in the morning - she turned down St. Ann's-court, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030056"></xptr>went into the prosecutor's house - I lost sight of her, but on going down the court again, I found the door ajar - I pushed it open, but did not see the prisoner - I heard some one call "Police" - I stood there - the prisoner came down, and I took her - the prosecutor came down with this linen in his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been in great distress, and had no money to pay for my lodging - I saw this door open, and went in to sit down - just as I got to the top of the stairs, this gentleman was coming out - I flew down, and the officer caught me.</p>

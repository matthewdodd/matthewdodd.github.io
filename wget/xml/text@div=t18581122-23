                  </hi>. I live in Cheapside—the prisoner called on me, on Wednesday, 10th November—he handed me this letter purporting to be from Mr. Joshua Field, and this petition—they were sealed up together in one envelope. (Cheltenham-place, Westminster-road. Dear Sir,—The enclosed petition has been handed tome this morning, and, knowing the parties, I subscribed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and at the request of the bearer submit it for your consi<lb></lb>deration. <hi rend="italic">This memorial stated that John Whyman, a corn-dealer and seedsman, and his family were in great distress, his son-in-law having gone to Australia, and left him responsible for the sum of 670 l.; and that this sub<lb></lb>scription was entered into to raise a fund to enable his family to open a school; which his daughters were qualified to manage. This was recommended and signed by the Rev. Wodehouse Raven, who had subscribed two guineas, and by several others.</hi>) I read these papers, and as I knew some of the signatures were false, I suspected the whole to be a fabrication—I asked the prisoner if he knew any of the circumstances connected with the case—he said, "Yes, it was as represented, and the petition was for the purpose of raising sufficient</p>

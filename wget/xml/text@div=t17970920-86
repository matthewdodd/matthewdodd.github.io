               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. These were square pieces of leather, cut for the purpose of soles? - A. Yes; they were squares of leather.</p>
               <p>They are to be converted into soles; they are not soles till they are cut to the proper shape? - A. Yes, they are.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley took an objection, that they were not soles till they had been cut into the proper shape.</p>
               <p>The Court over-ruled the objection, as that being the name by which they are known to the trade.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended, that they could not be right pair of soles, unless they all matched, which was also overruled by the Court.</p>

             sworn. - On the 19th of July, about half past eight o'clock, I was at work in my master's shop, and I perceived a light shine through a hole at the top of the stair-case that leads into the leather cellar; I was afraid something might be on fire, and I put my foot down one stair; I stooped and looked through a hole, and saw a man's arm with his shirt sleeves tucked up; I told my shop-mates I believed the carpenter was there; we suspected him, and when he came up, we searched him, and found eight pair of men's leather soles in his apron, under his tools; he had done his work, and was then going away. (The constable produced the property.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Were they not mixed with other leather after they were taken from the prisoner? - A.No, they were not; they are Mr. Soames's property; Mr. Blow wrote upon them at the time.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Joseph Tisdell. I keep a private house of accommodation, in White Hart-street—I have not paid rent for it—I</p>

               <p>am merely minding it for my sister till she sells the houses—the prisoner was employed by me to wait on those who came to the house—she left me on the 21st Sept.—there were no wages due to her—I agreed for none, only what she could get—I missed a shawl, gown, apron, and other things—I saw her in custody on the 27th of Sept., and she had some of my clothes on—I am quite sure these are not clothes which I authorized her to wear to give her a better appearance—I had given her a plaid mousselin-de-laine frock, and a velvet bonnet, but they were not mine—the things she had on when she was taken were not things I had given her to wear—I have lost other things—there was no one there but her on the morning she left—these things were on the chair in the parlour—I had only been confined ten days—she slept by my side—she got up and let the men in who were working at the sewer—she returned to bed and the milk woman came—I said, "Get up, there is the milk woman at the door"—she got up, and I turned and went to sleep—I saw no more of her till she was taken—I slept till ten or eleven o' clock, and then she and the things were gone—she had the whole care of the place—my husband was up stairs—any one certainly might have come into the parlour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I went to live with her as a dress-lodger; she dressed me up and followed me about in the evening; and when I took a gentleman home, she took from me the money which I got; all I had was my board and lod<lb></lb>ging; she gave me the clothes, and said if I took home plenty of gentlemen she would give me other clothes; I got between five or six pounds a week for her; Emma lives in the house as a dress-lodger. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was a woman of that name, but she was not there that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Wick, near Bath. From the latter end of Sept. to the beginning of Nov., 1856, I did duty for my uncle, the incum<lb></lb>bent of Little Stanmore, and resided in the school house, where I had the exclusive use of a bedroom and sitting room; Sir Henry Ellis occupying the rectory in my uncle's absence—the prisoner lived at the school house, his family consisting of his wife and children and a servant, Maria Ginger, who used to go home to sleep every night—on 6th Nov. I received from Sir Henry Ellis 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; there was one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, two sovereigns, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put it into my desk, which was on the table, locked it, and put the key into my pocket—on the following night I went out to dinner; shortly before going, I had to go to my desk, and the money was safe; I locked the desk, and took the key with me—I returned about half past 11 o'clock, and let myself in with a latch key, as every one had gone to bed—I struck a light, and on going into my sitting room, saw that the position of my desk had been altered—I tried it, and found that it was still locked—the window was closed, and I believe fastened—there was a table with a glass vase in front of the window, and seeing that that was undisturbed, I went to bed—next morning, at a little before 7 o'clock, the prisoner came to my door, and asked me if I had left my desk open the night before—I said, "Certainly not"—he said, "It is wide open now, Sir"—I got up immediately, went down stairs, and saw that it was wide open, and the money gone—the staples of the lock had been wrenched, and the vase was removed, and placed on the sofa, which was on one side of the window—I told the prisoner that 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been taken from the desk,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185708170097"></xptr>
               <p>and that I did not know the number of the notes—I sent for a policeman, and examined the outside of the window, but could see no footmarks on the flower bed under the window—persons might have been there and left no trace; I do not think the ground was damp enough to make a trace—I told the prisoner that Sir Henry Ellis had paid me the money, and he said that possibly some of Sir Henry Ellis's servants had taken it.</p>

Mr. Tuson, instead of giving him a cheque, I went to town and got the money for him; my house in Bedford Square was dismantled, and therefore I may have put the initials on them in the country—this entry in my diary was made on the 5th or 6th—I entered the numbers in my pocket book when I went home; Mr. Tuson came to me with a policeman next morning, to know if I had taken the numbers, and I took him into my library, and gave them to him from my pocket book—I must have entered them the day before, because he came early in the morning—these two notes with "Healey" on them, I received from my butcher on 5th Nov.—I do not know what became of the other notes I got from Childs', I only took the numbers of those I was to pay to Mr. Herbert Tuson.</p>

I used to go there between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning, and go away about 9 o'clock in the evening—on 8th Nov. I went there at about half past 6'clock; the prisoner was up, and in the school—I went into Mr. Tuson's parlour, and saw his desk open—the prisoner was coming out of the school room door, and I said, "Have you been in the parlour this morning?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Will you come in then?"—he came in, and then went up, and called Mr. Tuson.</p>

Q.</hi> Who let you in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner—there was nothing extraordinary in his being up; he was always up before I came—he did not let me in, but the door was open, and he was in the school—he did not say that he had opened the door, I only suppose he had—the things in the parlour were tossed about, and I thought there had been thieves there—the prisoner said that he was writing lectures in the school—I saw him write, and have heard him deliver lectures—in the morning he used to compose the lectures that he had to deliver—I recollect the anniversary of the chapel; it was on a Thursday, I do not know the day of the month—the prisoner was at home the whole of that day—I did not see him the whole day—lie had been asked specially to play the organ on that day—he might have been out of my sight for three hours—I did not see him the whole day on Thursday; he was at the Church sometimes—I got his breakfast that morning, and after that he went into the school to teach the children—he dined at home, and after dinner he went to the school for a short time, and then went to Church to play the organ—I did not get his tea for him; he said that he was going out to tea, to the anniversary, to the chapel—I saw him again in the evening, when it was getting dark—I was not at the chapel in the evening; there was service there in the evening, and I saw him come home, as if he had come from the chapel, with</p>

               <p>two friends, at 8 or half past 8 o'clock; I cannot say whether it was 9 o'clock—I know Mr. Green, but I do not think he came home with him, it was with Mr. Kilby—I did not leave that night; I slept there, as Mr. Tuson had left—the prisoner is the organist at the Church, and it was his duty to play the organ every Sunday—this was the anniversary of the chapel, but he had to play at the Church because the people asked him—there is no organ at the chapel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer and engraver, of No. 1, Cambridge Ter<lb></lb>race, Edgeware Road. On Saturday, 6th June, a gentleman came in a gig, and ordered me to engrave a card plate with the name of "The Honourable C. F. Ponsonby, Han ford House, Dorsetshire"—he gave it me in writing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—he was to call for it on the following Wednesday—it was engraved, and this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the plate—it is not uncommon to keep the plate when we give but the cards—he came on the Wednesday, and was to call again—I believe the prisoner is the man, but I cannot swear to him—the person had a beard, whiskers, and moustache, which, to the best of my belief, were artificial.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk and collector to George Burns. The first time I saw the prisoner was on Wednesday, the 10th, or Thursday, the 11th June; he was in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, between Nos. 1 and 2, Cambridge Ter<lb></lb>race—our offices are down stairs, and in consequence of what one of the boys said I went up, and met a cabman—he directed me to the prisoner, who was sitting in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I asked him whether he had come for the cards in the name of Ponsonby—he said, "Yes"—I left him, and fetched the proof card, and asked him whether it was to his taste—he said that he liked it very much, and said, "I suppose I can take this card?"—I said, "In all transactions of this kind we require a deposit"—he drew out a florin, and one or two pieces more silver—I received the florin as a deposit—he said that he would call for the remainder of the cards on Saturday, on his way to the Great Western station, and took the proof card away with him—I hesitated about giving it to him, but he said that he particularly wished it, to show to his lady, and therefore I could not withhold it—I have no doubt the prisoner is the person—he wore a wig, and whiskers, and mous<lb></lb>tache all in one piece—I could see a kind of sticking plaster under the moustache—I heard him speak two or three words before the Magistrate at Edgeware, and having heard him speak previously, I am quite satisfied of his voice—that assisted me most materially in my identification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between 6 and 7 o'clock—I afterwards went down to see if I could identify him—I expressed a doubt before the Magistrate as to whether this was on the Wednesday or Thurs<lb></lb>day—I inclined to the latter day, because I believe there was only one day intervening between his visit and his calling for the cards—that would allow a day to print and dry them—if I was obliged to fix a day, I should fix on Thursday—he did not come out of the cab—it was about ten minutes' walk from the Great Western station—I went down with the other witnesses to Edgeware for the purpose of seeing whether a man who was suspected of something wrong was the person to whom I delivered the card—Winkles did not tell me that he had got the fellow in custody—I went down with Whittaker, and saw the prisoner coming out of Church on Sunday—I was placed in a room commanding a view of the Church, and was told that the schoolmaster would come out that way, and I could judge for myself whether he was the man—he came out alone with his hat off, and then I said that he was the man—I was positive to a certain extent, and after I had heard his voice I was superlatively convinced, though I was not short of absolute certainty in the first instance—the voice came as a piece of correlative evidence—I might say that it was you addressing this Court if I was behind you, but I should be much better satisfied if I stood in front of you—they</p>

               <p>were very large, bushy whiskers—the moustache was not excellent; the whole affair was more like the dress of a Guy on the 5th of Nov.—it was a very outlandish dress—no one would have worn it to disguise their features, because it was so palpable that it was disguise.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Luxmore. On Satur<lb></lb>day, 13th June, my fellow shopman brought a silver watch by Bennett from the back office to the front—I afterwards gave it to Winkles—I went into the back office, and found a lot of people there—I saw the prisoner there—I have no doubt about him—he had a false moustache and whiskers—I asked him if I had not seen him before without his moustache and whiskers—he said that he had put them on for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>, as he was going to a theatre—I went into the front shop again, and then came round the counter to the prisoner, and asked him to step into an inner office—he did so, and I said that I should not like to lend so much on the watch without properly seeing into it, and that I would have it properly seen to, and if it was by Bennett really, I would lend him the money he wanted—he said, that as I suspected him, he should like an acknowledgment that I had the watch—I asked him his name—he said, "Edward Simmons, 13 (or 16), Praed Street, Richmond"—I gave him an acknowledgment, with that name and address on it—I next saw him at Edgeware—I stood at the door of the police office, and saw him come down the street, with from eight to twelve men, not policemen—I stood with a small crowd—no one pointed him out to me—I recognised him instantly, though he wore his hat differently when I saw him—I have no doubt about his being the person.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he the only one in custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I presume he was in custody—I will not say whether he was next to a policeman—(the conversation at our place may have lasted twenty minutes)—I do not think a policeman was walking along having hold of his arm—if he had at all changed countenance, or become discomposed, when I said, "Have I not seen you without your whiskers and moustache?" I should have called a police<lb></lb>man—I did not think that I had seen him before—they were large bushy whiskers, and I saw that he had a wig as he was leaving the office.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, S</hi> 191). I went to Edgeware on 10th Nov., 1856, to make inquiries about the robbery—the school house is in the parish of Little Stanmore—I examined the premises carefully, and said in the prisoner's presence, "This robbery has been committed by somebody in the house, or somebody has come in at the door with a key"—there were</p>

               <p>no marks or any traces on the window sill, and there were bits of glass there which must have been moved if a person had come in that way—the casement window was broken, and I have no doubt from the inside, because the lead, with the diamond panes in it, was pushed outwards—it could be turned back with a finger and thumb, and the glass removed without break<lb></lb>ing it, and then the catch removed—this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) Webling gave me; it is marked Bennett, 39, 987—on 21st June I took the prisoner into custody; he said that he was innocent—on the road to the station he asked me who those two men were that were there—I said that they were from London, and I told him afterwards that they were shopmen, and said, "If you can prove to me that you were not in London on Saturday week, you will be all right;" he said, "I was in London on the Wednesday before; and if I was in London on Saturday I can confirm where I was."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you examine the premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the Monday following; the robbery was on Saturday morning—a sergeant had been there before me—I only searched the room where the robbery was committed—the prisoner was there on the Monday evening—I saw his wife there on the Sunday—I took him into custody on Sunday, 21st June, after he had been identified by two witnesses I took down, Williams and Whit-taker—other witnesses were summoned to appear—I took them down on Sunday by an omnibus—it takes about two hours to go down to Edgeware—the prisoner lived in Great Stanmore—the same coach goes to Stanmore; but the prisoner was apprehended on Sunday, at 1 o'clock, coming from the Church, which is 400 or 500 yards from Edgeware—when I put these ques<lb></lb>tions to him he was in custody—he said that he was surprised he should be taken, he knew nothing of it.</p>

That thereupon she went to Mr. Moses Hart's, to enquire if the Prisoner had been there with the Goods, but was inform'd he had not, and they pitied her for intrusting him with the Goods on those Pretensions, telling her that he was not the Reader of the Synagogue, he having been turn'd out long before. The Prisoner in his Defence pleaded, That he actually bought the Goods of the Prosecutor for 30 l. and design'd to pay for them, but was prevented, in that a certain Person had come to his House, and under pretence of buying the Goods to carry Abroad, had taken the Opportunity to take them away from his House, and pawn'd them for 10 l. and was gone beyond Sea. But being call'd upon by the Court to prove what he said, he had no Witnesses to the Disappointment he pretended; and as to his having actually bought the Goods, that was deny'd by the Prosecutor. He called several Evidences with intent to prove the Prosecutor's having sold him the Goods, but they all appear'd, if true, to be after his having gotten the Goods into his Possession, and had not perform'd the Conditions on which he obtain'd them.

I live at 11, John Street, Cannon Street Road—on 4th August, about 5.30, I was on Tower Hill, near the Tower Subway—I saw the prisoner close to me, and felt a hand in my pocket—I had a half-crown and a shilling in my pocket—I had seen them safe two minutes before, because I put my handkerchief down on them—I looked down, and</p>

               <p>he pulled his hand away, and walked off—I missed the half-crown—Jane Cuttenden was with me—I told a constable—he took me to a public-house, and I pointed out the prisoner—that was about three minutes after—I could tell him by his moustache and whiskers—he is the same man.</p>

I live at 9, Lower Well Alley, Wapping—about 5 o'clock, on the morning of 4th August, I was with the last witness, standing near the Subway—I saw the prisoner put his hand against her pocket—I looked down, and he moved his hand away—he kept there two or three minutes, and moved away—I did not notice where he went to—we spoke to a policeman, and went with him to a public-house, where I saw the prisoner—he is the same man I had seen with his hand against the pocket.</p>

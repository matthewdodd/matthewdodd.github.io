            , Esq. sworn. Examined by Mr. Arabin. I live in Warnford Court, Throgmorton street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you occasion on the 15th instant to have a butt of sherry wine bottled. A. I had, the two prisoners at the bar were sent to my house for that purpose by Mr. Heathfield a wine merchant; they bottled the sherry wine in my cellar, and packed it in prickets.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wine so packed in prickets, and there was one pricket in which there was no wine. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you direct them to fill that pricket with any other wine. - A. Yes, with champagne.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in your cellar in Warnford-court. - A. I told them to put in four dozen of that in that pricket.</p>
               <p>Q. By which means, of course they had access to the champagne; did you see yourself the wine put in. - A. No, I cannot say that I saw them particularly put the champagne in with it; my direction was for them to go to my house at Hackney with it; I only ordered them to fill the pricket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the other basket there besides the pricket. - A. I cannot say whether I did or not, I might have seen them put that basket in the cart with the rest of the prickets; I did not know whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290026"></xptr>there was any thing in it.</p>
               <p>Court. You did see the hamper put in. - A. I did, I had not ordered it to be put in.</p>
               <p>Q. When the wine arrived at your house at Hackney there were these two men and the carter there - A. They were there about a quarter of an hour before I arrived there; I set them to work in the cellar; I opened the inner cellar for them to get some saw-dust.</p>
               <p>Q. What wine did that inner cellar contain. - A. It contained some port, maderia, mountain, and other wines; I believe I shewed them the place where they were to put the wine, and then I went to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Were both the cellars open when they were at work. - A. They were; when I came out from dinner I observed the cart at the door with two or three prickets in it, I put my hand into one of the prickets, to see whether they were full or empty, I felt a bottle, I put my hand in the straw and felt another bottle; I went into the parlour and told the gentleman in the parlour the circumstance, he came out with me, we found these two bottles were corked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue your examination any further. - A. I did not at that time, I went below in the cellar to see how they were coming on, I saw them at dinner with my servants; on my coming out again I saw the pricket overset and the straw loose about the cart, that made me think it was intentionally done to be carried away.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not see how the oversetting the pricket would make you suspect. - A. I suspected the carman had seen me feel these prickets, and that he himself had been in the mean time and taken them out; I then called for a candle to see what was become of the wine.</p>
               <p>Q. You perceived nothing more than two bottles, do you know what the quality of that wine was. - A. No, on a candle being brought me by my stable boy, who is by me, I observed a small basket underneath the cart; I said Charles take the candle and see what is underneath in that basket, upon that he brought out nine bottles, I saw that myself.</p>
               <p>Q. He took nine bottles out of a basket flung underneath the cart. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what that wine was. - A. I supposed it was sherry, I cannot say, then I called the coachman up, in the mean time the carman was by, took it off the ground and carried it down the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the other two put on the ground at the same time that you saw before. - A. I did not see them taken out of the pricket at all, they were taken out in the interval that I went down in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever ascertained what wine it was - A. Not till it was taken down into the cellar, I then asked the prisoners how they could do such an act as that, they laid the charge upon the carman; upon that the carman laughed and seemed very careless about what he had done; I then told the servant to go for a constable; in the mean time they told the carman he ought to be ashamed for laughing so, and to say he was sorry for it, and they dare say I would forgive him; the two prisoners, after I had sent for the constable for them, they went into the cellar and stowed the remainder of the wine, and when they had finished the nine bottles that they had brought down from the cart, which were put upon the rest of the wine to shew me that the quantity was right, I think it was forty eight dozen and ten bottles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these nine bottles prove to be sherry. - A. I thought they were, I did not look at them then. On the Saturday following Mr. Heathfield came to me, I went down the cellar to shew him the wine, the nine bottles were set apart, he then observed that two of the bottles were not his bottles, which he brought up stairs, and drawed the cork, one proved to be a bottle of madeira, and the other a bottle of port, which madeira must have been taken out of the cellar behind the door; there was madeira there, and there was port in the next bin; when they had done binning the whole of the wine I told my coachman I would have all them prickets brought out of the cart, upon which the prisoners said they had forgot one hamper, which hamper was taken out of the basket under the cart, and it proved to be this small hamper of champagne in it; there were four prickets of champagne in the cellar in town.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. What did this hamper contain. - A. ten or twelve bottles, I did not take them out, there is a person that can prove it; the small hamper of champagne was emptied in my cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be the same fort of wine that you had in the cellar. - A. To the best of my knowledge it was, they were champagne bottles.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is, whether this was part of the champagne that was brought from the hoard, or whether it was taken out of the cellar, that you do not know, there were the same fort in both. - A. Yes, and the same fort of bottles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they claim it. - A. No, they said it was left behind in a mistake, they had forgot that small hamper; I told them only to fill the prickel, they had that hamper over and above what they brought in the prickel.</p>
               <p>CHARLES STRANGE sworn. Examined by Mr. Arabin. You are a servant to Mr. Le Mesurier, do you recollect this cart coming to your master's, and the prisoners at the bar coming with it. - A. Yes, My master came out with a candle, he told me to look into the hay basket, I looked in and pulled out nine bottles, I put them on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who took them in afterwards. - A. No, I went for a constable.</p>
               <p>HENRY - sworn. Examined by Mr. Arabin. Q. You are coachman, do you recollect this cart being there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners dine in the kitchen. - A. Yes, and the carman came to dinner in about ten minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect your master calling you to the cart. - A. Yes, I saw the lad take five bottles out of the basket, and afterwards four more; my master told me to take the empty prickets out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the men hear your master order you to search the cart. - A. They might have heard it, he spoke loud enough; as soon as I saw the men they said there was a small hamper in the cart, which they had forgot, I found the hamper and took it out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290027"></xptr>Q. The carman did not come for ten minutes after these men, might not he have taken them nine bottles in at that time. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. He had an opportunity for taking away the nine bottles if he had been so inclined. - A. I should think so.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to this hamper of wine, you heard the men ask for this small hamper of wine and say they had forgot it, you cannot tell whether it was before or after your master ordered you to search the cart. - A. I cannot.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Arabin. I am a carman.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed to carry any load from Mr. Le Mesurier's Warnford court, on the 15th of October. - A. Yes, I cannot say exactly the day of the month, it was a fortnight yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. There were thirteen prickets I believe, and a one dozen hamper, who put that hamper in. - A. One of Mr. Heathfield's men, one of the prisoners at the bar, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Court. They put it in at Warnford court. - A. Yes; when we came to Hackney we unloaded the prickets, they told me that the one dozen pricket was to be left in the cart, but it was not, one of them took it down in the cellar; then they began to put the wine away, and after they put part of the wine away, I cannot say how much, they told me that the one dozen hamper was to come back, they told me to put it in the cart, I did, and I brought it up stairs by their order; some considerable time after that they said there was some bottles in one of the prickets, and they told me to take them out and put it in the hay basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you to put them in the hay basket. - A. I cannot say whether they did or did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood.</p>
               <p>Q. You supposed you was acting very honestly all this time. - A. I did not know what they meant do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you thought that two men had better be hung than one man, than you; when did you first tell this story. - A. When I had my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken in custody, and then you told this story. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And not before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were doing an honest thing. - A. I cannot say, I was only the carman, I spoke the truth and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Court. You must know they were full bottles. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must know that you were carrying away a quantity of wine belonging to Mr. Le Mesurier. - A. I cannot say what they meant to do with them.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know they were carrying away Mr. Le Mesurier's wine. - A. I have spoke the truth.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATHFIELD sworn. Examined by Mr. Arabin. You are a wine merchant. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course a judge of wine. - A. Yes; when I was at Mr. Le Mesurier's, Mr. Le Mesurier pointed out nine bottles of wine in a bin, he said that sherry had been put into them; on examining them I found two bottles which I said had not been mine, we took them out of the cellar, 
               <persName id="t18061029-31-person354">drew</persName>
             the cork of one and tasted it, it was Madeira, we did not draw the cork of the other; I examined the bottle with the candle, it appeared to be red port; the other seven bottles were the bottles that I had sent to him to be applied to the sherry and the same fort of wine appeared to be in them.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to see these men in prison. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hold out any threat, or promise them any favour to induce them to say to you what they did. - A. None, they asked me to be as lenient as possible with them; I told them they could not possibly have any favour from me. I then left them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they deny all knowledge of the transaction. - A. No, not to me.</p>

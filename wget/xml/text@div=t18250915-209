The prisoner was in my employ, and generally comes on a Sunday morning to attend to the blue vats. On Sunday, the 31st of July, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I was at the stair case window, and saw him go down the yard into the dye-house - he came back, up the yard, and, as I supposed, went into the warehouse - he had business in the dye-house, but not in the warehouse. I went down stairs and found the warehouse door nearly closed, and him inside - he seemed rather alarmed at seeing me; I said "Wynn, what are you doing here?" he answered</p>
               <p>"Nothing, Sir;" I said "You have no business here; I am sure you are doing something which you ought not;" he said "No, Sir." I observed that his hands were all over annatto, and said "Where is that annatto which you have taken out of the cask?" there was a cask of it in the warehouse - he said "Here it is;" pointing behind him; I said "Hand it over to me;" he handed the parcel to me - I went out of the warehouse, and remonstrated with him on his conduct - he walked down the yard - I said "Don't think to escape, for you shall not:" he said "No, Sir;" I turned round to speak to the servant girl, who stood in the passage - he ran down the yard, and got over the gate - I went to the front door - he was running along the street - I called Stop him! - a man ran and brought him back to me - I gave him in charge. The parcel of annatto was in the warehouse - it had been taken out of the cask, and wrapped in paper - it weighed 9 lbs., and cost me 3 s. 6 d. a pound - he said it was his first offence. I was in the warehouse the night before, it was not taken out of the cask then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. How long has he lived with you? A. Since May, 1821, and was one of my best workmen - the parcel of annatto was on a cask in the warehouse - he had been in the dye-house, but had not performed his duty there. I have two boys in the warehouse - they leave at eight o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How near was the annatto cask from the parcel? A. It was on a cask close to it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

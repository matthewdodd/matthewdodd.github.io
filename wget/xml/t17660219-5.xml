He paid me 2 d. for it for that night. When he was gone, on the first of January in the morning, I missed a sheet. I saw no more of him till the 31st of January. My baker being constable, I went there; he said he had taken a man for stealing a Cheshire cheese out of a cart, and that he was a baker. I knowing the man that had robbed me was a baker, I went to see him before the Justice, and found him to be the same. I charged him with taking my sheet: he confessed it, and said he had pawned it to a woman, name Young, near Shoreditch church. I went there; she said, if she had it she had sold it, so I could not get it again.</p>

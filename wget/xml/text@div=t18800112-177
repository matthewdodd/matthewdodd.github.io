                  </hi>. I live at Kennington, and represented in London the firm of Mr. Smithson, a stuff merchant at Bradford, in 1878 and 1879—I have an office at 25, Gutter Lane, City—I knew Michell before, but did not do business with him till October or November, 1878—I have been in the trade all my life, and have known firms in London 10 or 15 years—I knew the old firm of Keighley and Brother, the father of the present Mr. Keighley, who I have known 12 or 15 years—I knew him just to speak to when the firm consisted of his father and uncle—he commenced three or four years ago to trade on his own account in the name of the old firm—I have not seen his uncle or his father for years—I sold him about two lots of goods about September, 1878, value 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and a day or two afterwards I saw Michell at 4, Priest's Court—he said that they were a nice clean lot of goods, and had I another lot like them—I said yes, I had one or two lots at higher prices—he said "I should like to see them, as I can them for you"—I had some at a higher price—samples were sent, and he said that they would suit him better, as they would suit the West End, and the goods were bought and delivered to Keighley, who had made a communication to me—that lot of goods, which was the fourth lot, came to about 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a week or a fortnight after the delivery I saw Michell at Keighley's place—Keighley was not there—I said "Michell, our account is getting rather large, Mr. Smithson is rather anxious. Mr. keighley has told me you are going to put 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the concern at the end of November, is that correct?"—he said "Yes, Mr. cordoron, it is quite right," and I was satisfied—several lots of goods were bought after that, and I had frequent conversations with Michell—I used to meet him every day or every other day, and he said that he was going to put money in at the end of November—invoices were sent with the parcels, and I made a note of the sales in the order-book, which I have not got—Mr. Smithson has it—I know what goods I sold, but I do not know whether the railway people delivered them—I took about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of orders, and Mr. Michell told me afterwards that he was very much pleased with the goods, and he had done well with them—that was early in December—I communicated what was said about the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Smithson—I had no power to allow the credit to run to 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he entrusted me with a certain amount of discretion—I would not have trusted Keighley with 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before that statement because, though I knew him to be all right, I knew his trade was not large enough—I depended on the extra trade he was to bring in, and the greater outlet for the goods—Michell pulled a newspaper out of his pocket in November, and said "This is a very nice thing, Mr. Cordoron, to meet one at break<lb></lb>fast"</p>

               <p>—I said "I don't know, what is it?"—he said "There has been a fire at Notting Hill, and three houses of mine have been damaged to the amount of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "You seem very happy" or "very comfortable over it; I suppose they are are insured"—he said "Yes, they are, but there is a very great deal of annoyance and inconvenience attending it"—I said "Are they detached villas?"—he said "No; they are in the centre of the terrace"—I said "They are not the only three perhaps that you have?"—he said "No; I have other houses on each side of them"—he ordered goods after that, and I still believed he was a man of property—I was with him and Mr. Smithson and Keighley very shortly after that at the City wine-house, Cheapside, and Michell said "The property will be sold next week, and then I shall hand over to Mr. Keighley over 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I saw him when he stopped in 1879—he said that he was very little—he said that things would come all right—I had not supplied him directly, and had no account against him, but I had supplied him with goods which Keighley never saw—they were delivered at my place into one of Johnson's vans by Michell's direc<lb></lb>tions and sent away—I did not know where they were going, but he said that they were not going to Michell's because they were sold, and were going direct to the customer—Mr. Smithson sold those cords in my pre<lb></lb>sence, and I delivered them—I do not think the conversation at the City wine-house was before that—I did not know that he was getting advances on the goods.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was signed "F.

               <p>

Plunkett and Leader, who I have known 14 years, some time in January, and in due time received notice of Michell filing a liquidation petition—I attended the meeting, and was chairman—I took no other steps till April 1st—I do not know whether the composition was to be secured by the wife—the general feeling was that the creditors would not take less than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—as the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was refused Mr. Vanderpump suggested that time should be given—I do not remember hearing Mr. Waddington say that if 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound was not paid bankruptcy proceedings would be instituted, or that a prosecution would probably take place, or that the Bradford creditors would prosecute, nor do I remember stopping him and correcting him—I do not remember a statement being made by any creditor that he would prosecute if 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound was not paid—the committee of inspection are Mr. Newstead, who is, I think, Mr. Lovering's manager, Mr. Lovering, who is Keighley's trustee, Mr. Hopkins, one of the managing clerks of plunkett and Leader, and myself.</p>

My wife has 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year private income.

I determined to see Michell, which I did, and he corroborated Keighley's statement that he was placing 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the concern, and that he had not got the money just then, but expected it day by day—the credit had not then expected to 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the morning of January 5th I got information that Keighley had field a petition, and I saw him, but I held no conversation with him or Michell—I never got any information from Michell of his filing a petition there were no acceptances in my case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not a creditor of Michell; I had to prove against Keighley, I took it for granted that Michell was an actual partner—he told us that the deeds were actually prepared but he had not signed them until he had got the money, which was coming day by day—I know that if he had been a partner I could have proved against him—I cannot say whether Michell said in Nov. that the money he should put in was trust money—the second interview commenced at Keighley office, and we walked up Cheapside and continued the conversation at the wine-shop for half an hour—he said that there was a lot of red-tapeism about it, and that it was trust money and trust property, and he should have it certainly by the end of the year—I supposed it was coming to him in consequence of the death of a relative, but I do not know that I heard him say so—it is just possible that when I sold the 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods I sent a messenger to Keighley's office to say that I had some stock in London—Michell came round first, and I believe he came the next morning with Mr. Partridge, who, I understood, was Keighley's manager—the Rusell cords and the black goods are the only two parcel I sold myself; those came to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less 2 1/2 discount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Keighley said "I can pay on the, day," not "We can pay"—the pay day was to be 19th December, the very day that Michell was at Bradford, and as I did not get a cheque I went to his hotel and asked him for payment for all goods invoiced up to 19th November, which was 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "How is it that the cheque from Keighley has not come?"—he said "I have got an explanatory letter from Keighley, and will see after it; I am going there this afternoon, and it shall be sent to-morrow."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cloth-merchant of Bradford—in october, 1878, Iknew John keighley, who was trading as keighley and Brother—I had trusted him with goods worth some hundereds of pounde—there was an open account—there was no limite of credit till about August, 1878, and then there was a limit—after that the name of Michell at was men<lb></lb>tioned—Isaw keighley in reference to some goods about october, after which I parted with some goods—that was before I saw Michell at all—this is the orginal invoice, it is in my writing; "Oct 29, 1878. keighley and Brother, 118 pieces of black Iustre, 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—in the middle of November "Mr. Michell, my future partner"—Michell said that he was going aways by train, but he should be back very shortly, and would call and see me—on 17th December, 1878, he called at Broadfrod and said "I am going into partnership with Mr. keighley, and I shall put in some 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I said "Have you gone through Mr. keighley 's affairs, and are you satisfied with regard to his solvency?,—he said "Ihave gone through all his affairs, and I am perfectly satisfied Mr. keighley 's can pay 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound and have a surplus left, and with the money I shall put in the cornern we ought to do a nice business"—I said "I am glad to hear it, and I think you ought with that amount of capital in the cornern"—he said "virtually I am a partner now, although the deed of partnership is not signed and future I shall take Mr. keighley's books and manage the financing"—he said "Being a stranger in Broadford, can you tell me where E. Gwilliams's warchouse is?" I said "I am going into past it, Iwill show you," and Idid so—he asked me to go in with him—did so, and we saw Mr. Grandage, who introduced himself as going went into partnership with Mr. keighley—Mr. Grandage went into a private room with him, and after Garnett's werehouse, and saw Italin cloth—after that we went to Gillies michell, from keighley's; I have called to get you to renew a hill; I am going into partnership with Mr. keighley's, and shall put in 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I am acting now as partnership with him, although the deeds are not signed"—he further said "This money which I am interested in is in the hands of trustees, and there is some little brother about it; the property will be sold in January, and the money paid into concern"—Mr. Granett said "well, I will renew the bill; only lot me know the date to put in and I will oblige you"—that was all passed—we went next day to messrs Jones sharp's where he said "I am Mr. michell, from keighley's; Ihave called to renew a bill; I am going to put 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the cornern, and the firm will be all right in January"—one of them said "we deeline to renew the bill"—this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing; I supplied those goods after the statement made by keighley with reference to michell—they have not been paid for.</p>

                  </hi>. My partner is dead, and I am now the firm of Gillies, Garnett, and Co., stuff merchants, of Bradford—I never knew John Keighley, or that the firm had business transactions with him, but this bill is dated 10th October; it is due 13th December—it is a two months' bill for 184<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by us and accepted by Keighley and Brother—it was not paid when it fell due—I had heard of Michell from Mr. Ramsden before we drew the first bill, and a day or two after it was due Ramsden and Michell came—Michell had announced his arrival two or three days previously, and I expected him—when he came in I find him perfectly solvent, and I intend to take up that portion of the business, and I intend to introduce an amount of capital which will make the concern perfectly right, and I have come to ask you if you will grant us an extension of time, so that it will make it con<lb></lb>venient for us and perfectly safe for you; I shall put 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the business, and your bill will be met when it becomes due"—I said "If you have 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. why do you allow the credit of your intended concern to be blasted by having these paltry sums of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coming due and not being met?"—he said "I am entitled under a will be carried out, and that it may continue to lead to further business"—I agreed that there was to be a new bill from December 1, but it was not drawn, and two or three days afterwards I received this letter: "London, 23/12/78.—Dear Sir,—The arrangement made with Mr. Michell when he saw you in Brad<lb></lb>ford we shall be glad if you will carry out, but we should prefer if you would renew for three months." A bill was sent with a letter in reply to that with an explanation of what was required, and it was sent back with Michell's name on the back.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The conversation was on a market day about 20th December; I have no memorandum of the date—I wrote a letter as to the nature of our case I think between July and December last—Michell said between 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I understood that Mr. Ramsden said before the Magistrate that Michell said between 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told Mr. Ramsden that what he said to me was between 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that I should state that that was the fact—I am prepared to swear it—I believe our cashier can confirm it—we have a great many people in and out of the office on market days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stuff merchant, of 4, Priest Court, Foster Lane—I have been in business on my own account about three years as J. Keighley and Brother—they were my father and uncle—in my state<lb></lb>ment of affairs Mr. Card, of Aldermanbury, is my debtor for 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the other hand I owed my mother 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my total book debts were 3,378<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including the 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Card—I first knew Michell in November or December, 1877, when he came about a bill of Card's which he had accepted, and within a few months of that he bought goods of me from time to time—previous to July and August, 1878, he owed me about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I held a deed of his for some time as security, but I gave it back to him; this is it. (<hi rend="italic">The indenture</hi>)—I had no other security—I told him one day that I was hard up, and his large account and one or two others made me very short indeed—he said, "Why don't you take a partner?"—I said, "I don't care about it, and I do not know anybody who would be likely to join"—he said, "Why not take me?"—I said, "I will think about it"—he said, "I have a fine West-end connection, and I can bring in some money"—a few days afterwards I said, "I have thought about it, and I will take you as a partner"—he said, "I expect some money to be left me by a relation of my wife, who is expected every day to die; I have been telegraphed for two or three times"—shortly afterwards he came and said, "My relation has died"—I said, "Do you get as much as you expected?"—he said, "Yes, rather more, about 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that was about the beginning of July, 1878—he said, "I am going to put in 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and pay you at the same time the account I owe. By the terms of the will it must be settled, and I must have the money within three months"—that would be the beginning of October—he said, "I think you had better not say anything about it tll I get the money," and I said no more about it for three months till the time came—he asked if I would mind his letters being sent to my place, and I gave him permission—he came there every day, and stopped sometimes half an hour and sometimes an hour—I supplied him with a few goods between July and the beginning of October, but not to the same extent—I drew bills on him for his indebtendness; some of them are in my box not discounted, and some were paid away and were subsequently dishonoured; these are some of them. (<hi rend="italic">Seven or eight bills were here put in, drawn by the witness and accepted by Michell.</hi>) Two of those bills have the notarial charges on them of 20th April and 17th May; they are marked as dishonoured—I should think they were never paid, but I cannot swear to it from memory—these two cancelled bills of 10th October were renewed, I believe, but I cannot swear that from memory—here are two in February, 1878, not marked or cancelled, but marked "N.S.;" they were renewed—there are other bills to represent them somewhere—these two of 15th and 19th March were renewed—this bill of October, 1877, would be due in February, 1878; that was paid—the oter were, I believe, all subject to renewal—after the beginning of 1878 his bills came back or were returned—they are <hi rend="italic">bona<lb></lb>fide</hi> bills given by him as the purchaser of our goods—I told him in October that I was very hard up, and he knew I was—he saw two or three writs that I had, and I showed him papers showing that I was pressed for money—I referred to the time being past when the legacy was to be paid, and he kept saying that the lawyers could not get the property realised, that it was principally housed, but there was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Consols—I said, "I cannot go on as I am going on; I have been dpending on your money coming in"—he</p>

(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLAY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to this evidence, and the Cournt did not think it admissible.</hi>) Michell spoke to me many times about ordering goods—if we had the pattern of a cheap lot he would say "You had better order those, I could sell them"—I very often acted upon those statements—I remember this invoice of 14th of October for coloured lamas—I ordered those—I cannot call these parcels to mind of 15th October I had a conversation with Mr. Cordoron in the prisoner's presence—I remember the subtance of it—it was simply that I was about to bring in a partner who would find the money—I believe Mr. Cordoron let us have the goods on the strength of that statement—I recollect this parcel of serges in invoice F.S. 4,102'. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we had samples first—Michell saw them—I consulted him—he said they were cheap, and we offered a lower price than that at which they were de<lb></lb>livered—I know what the goods were of F.S. 5,66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were ordered under the same circumstances—as to F.S. 6,301<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I said to Michell "Can you pay for these goods? you know what I mean; I am dependent on your money coming in to pay for them; you know I cannot pay for them myself, and unless you will give me your word of honour that your money will be in before the money is due I shall send every piece back to Cordoron's"—he said "You need not be at all frightened, my money will be in long before it is due"—on the strength of that I did not send the goods back, but we kept them—I cannot say the value of the goods I ordered separately—Michell was party to the buying of the majority of them—F.S. 7, of 26th November, 24 pieces of alpaca blacks, 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I bought myself; also F.S. 8,34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., F.S. 9,24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we had samples of F.S. 10—he said he knew where he could sell them; he could sell a lot—after that statement I gave an order for forty pieces, 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—F.S. 11 and 12, December 9th, did not come intomy place at all—Michell told me he was going to order them—I understood they were going to Bowers and Co.'s, a customer, of Covent Garden, whom Michell introduced—this invoice of 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

               <p>the last sessions of this court—that was the first time I had seen Harfeld—I knew of about half-a-dozen pledgings by the defendent—the first was about October, when the money did not come in as Michell promised—he said, though I forget the exact words, "We must get some money on the goods to tide over till the money comes in"—I knew where they went—I consented—I expect they went to Harfeld—I connot say that he mentioned the name of every parcel—an invoice went out with the goods—some porter fatched them—the goods were not measured, they never are; the manufacturer's measure is taken—this was Michell's banker's book—I had no banking account of my own from October 15—some moneys I paid into his bank and some I paid away in other things without banking—the moneys received from Harfeld would be used in the business, or paid into this account—I kept my own cash account—I carried on the business till the last day of the year—I filed my petition on the 3rd January—I had two or three conversations with Michell before stopping—I said "It is absurd going on like this"—the last thing I said was, that if he could not tell me something definite the next day I should put my affairs in my solicitor's hands—that was the day before we closed—I did so—up to that time I believed he had power to put money in—he then owed me about 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I recollect from my books—I did not receive from the bank more then I paid in—there was a small balance left of about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon that account belonging to me—Michell told me so—I handed over to Michell these five bills of exchange with my initials and numbered J J K 22 to J J K 26, because he said I ought to give them up as he had endorsed a lot of bills for renewal at Bradford: they are dated 17th September, 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 134<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—some of them repre<lb></lb>sent The bills which you have shown me—they all represent goods that Michell had of me to the value of them—the original bills were given up for goods—I never consented to his putting my name in the list of persons owing him 740<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he never consulted me about it—I banked at the Union Bank before the account was opened at the head office of St. James's Bank—I did not know the defendant was pledging the goods he bought of me—I had no account with E.G. Williams and Co.—I did not know of the purchase on 17th December from Mr. Grandage—I saw a sample of the goods at our place—those goods were not sold; they became part of our assets—when I found out how things were going I kept the goods in the place intact—Gillies, Garnett, and Co.'s bill for 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was renewed—I had a conversation about it—Michell said he would endorse it, to induce them to renew it till his money came—not endorsing it was an oversight—I do not know what Michell's travelling expenses were—he was absent when he went to Bradford three or four times during the period, but not more then three days—I went with him once or twice—I saw Mr. Waddington, Mr. Hertz, Mr. Borisson, Mr. Robertshaw, and several others—they were all my creditors—I know One or two cheques were dishonoured in December—this one of 9th November For 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was—I cannot say if it was paid the next day—it is cancelled—the bank stopped about the 12th December—I knew then that Hall Well's cheque was dishonoured for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was afterwards paid; also a cheque in favour of William Blake Williamson, of 10th December, 1868—I had none of the money—I remember an application being made with reference to Hall Well's cheque in favour of J.

I will send the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Halliwell's and send the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. another time"—I cannot say that it did not happen—Michell told me that when the St. James's Bank stopped there was a small balance to my account, from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I suppose I was not asked that before the Alderman—the Union Bank stopped my account about the beginning of October—it was understood when the defendant opened an account at the St. James's Bank that it was to be for the convenience of Keighley and Brother until the partnership was complete; my money was paid in to his account—money was paid in and drawn out from time to time—I do not suggest that there was more than from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to me on the balance—I do not say that I paid in all I reveived; when I wanted a cheque to pay any of my creditors I went to Michell, and said "I want so much," and when he signed a cheque it was against money which had been paid in—a cheque may sometimes have been drawn before the money was paid in, and I paid the money in afterwards—I never paid Michell any commission or salary, he had nothing out of the business—sometimes he got money for me, and handed it over—I never got Card to obtain advances for me, or any one else—I belive Card is in London—my bought ledger was kept at Bradford, and I did not see it—I closed the office at Bradford about the end of the year, just before I failed—I swear I saw Mr. Wyatt, my manager, there in October, and I feel perfectly certain I saw him there in December—he came to London at the beginning of the year, and made the book up then—he made entries in the bought ledger after he came to London, and looking at it would enable me to tell very nearly when he was last at Bradford—I also got some goods from Rendle—I should say I had between 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. represents the goods I had between August and</p>

I owed to my mother—I went down to Bradford in July or August with Michell to see Mr. Wood, a manufacturer, and other people—that is not Mr. W.H. Wood—I wanted him to discount bills, and roughly made a statement to him of what my position was—I believe Michell had just gone out, but I should not like to swear he did not hear it—I gave him two bills of 760<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each which I wanted him to cash, but he refused—I do not think I had dis<lb></lb>cussed my position with Michell—he knew the object of my going—I made a memorandum of my affairs on a piece of paper for Wood, and I never saw it afterwards—I will swear I never showed it to Michell, but I will not swear he never saw it; I don't believe he did—I did not ask Michell if he would endorse the bills, I belive he suggested it first—they were to be drawn on him, and he was to be the acceptor—I perhaps left the bills with Wood, but I got them back again—I Kow Michell left the office directly we get the bill stamps the first thing in the morning—I made the writing to get the bill stamps the first thing in the morning—I made the writing when I was down there, not in London—I had it in my head—I will swear I did not make it in London and show it to Michell in the train—I will swear I told Wood what I owed my mother—I was never asked that before the Alderman—I was solvent up to the end of December if I had my mother's money, at least I believed so—I made two or three large bad debts, one of 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and two or three more of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I owed 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I stopped, the bad debts would very nearly bring it to that—I do not know whether I made a mistake or not, it was a very rough thing—my cash book will show what payments I made after July, 1878—I should say I did not pay between 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods previously had, and for goods supplied during that time—I can tell by the cheques what I paid while I was at the Union Bank—I think I paid Sutcliffe about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I don't think it was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not pay Borisson 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 28th November he sent me 290<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., half of the bill, and we were to find the other half to take the bill up, (<hi rend="italic">Several entries in the cash-book were read to the witness, which, he stated he could not remember.</hi>) I know 163<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was sent to Borisson to meet a bill—I do not see it here, but I am sure that was not a cash payment to him; there was a bill drawn by him on me coming due, and they sentme up the money.

I think—I do not recollect Mr. Leaoer saying that Michell really was a partner with me, or saying that the deed had been drewn, though it was not signed—I will not swear that nothing of the sort was said—I am not sure some gentleman there did not say "Are you a ware you are liable? the deed of partnership is drawn up, though it is not signed"—I had given them instructions about October to draw up a partnership deed from the time his money came in—I don't think Michell was there, but I had his authority—he was not to be a partner until he brought his money in—Plunkett and Leader were my father's solicitors—Mr. Cordoron owed me 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I stopped—I sold him about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods in 1878—perhaps 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of the goods I had from Smithson were for the Indian market—the lost were very small—the cheque for 128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Harfeld and Co. at the beginning of October was some money which Michell got me from Harfeld, and there is an entry in the ledger in red ink on October 2, "Sundries 128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that was posted by the trustee from my cash-book—the cntry of those goods is in my day-book; it is included in this 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I never sent Harfeld a piece of goods myself—I might have very likely credited the cheque and not received it at all.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on 18th May—it had been taken up be me out of my funds before he had the goods—they were sold to him in the ordinary way of business—on 22nd June he dishonoured another bill of 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and another on 10th August of 163<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had not, I believe, provided any funds for any of those bills—the five bills were given on 17th September simply to balance up what was owing on the dishounoured bills—that is why they were all of one date, and when his money came he said he would take them up, so I did not discount them—that represents the total amount of goods he had of me—these accouts, J.J.K. 14 and 15, were always on two sheets of paper, debtor and creditor—I charge him as a debtor.

                  </hi>. I am a public accountant, of 105, Cheapside—I have experience in the liquidation of bankruptcies—I was concerned for Mr. Webb, a creditor, in Michell's liquidation—a statement of affairs was Prepared in our office from figures given to us by Michell, and he gave us The list of creditors—there were no books except the bank book and this Little Private memorandum book; they were all loose papers, the memorandum book contained not the slightest information—there was a paying-in book—the loose papers were all invoices, and receipts, and cheques, and counter<lb></lb>foils of the St. James's Bank only—what amounts there are were got from cheques on a banking account, which had been closed six months, at the British Linen Company's Bank—some of the acceptances were to be pre<lb></lb>sented To that bank—we got the figures of Hyde and Co., creditors for 421<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., from Michell; a great deal was from his memory, there were very few papers to throw light upon it—in the first statement are the names of Gillies, Gaarnett, and Co., Hertz, Hyde, Sharp, Turner, and wad<lb></lb>dington as creditors—he gave an explanation that those were liabilities on account of his acceptances to Keighley—I mention that because if I had understood that they were liabilities, which they appear now to be, they would have been in List F instead of this list—he mentioned Bentley, 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I got no information from him as to when that debt was con<lb></lb>tracted—there is no record of it, but the statement is very imperfect, in some instances the date of the debt being contracted being given, and in some not—he gave no statement as to Card, to whom he owed 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Mander, 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Rowley, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Shannon, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I have no means of Telling when any of those debts were contracted, I have no invoices of any Of them—he gave me them from memory—he endeavoured to explain List G, and I asked him to see Mr. Vanderpump and get this list made out—he did so, and we copied the statement—there were securities in Mr. Vander<lb></lb>pump's hands which were pledged for his bill of costs, which we estimated at 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was property on the list to which no value was attached—he has entered "stock in hand" nothing; "cash in hand," nothing; "bills of exchange and furniture," nothing—I always go through those items with the debtor and ask him—he described himself as of 4, Priest's Court only—I did not know at that time that he had the use of Card's room in Aldermanbury—he was a perfect stranger to me, I had not seen him before he came to me—I did not know that that statement of figures referred to the time when he was in Priest's Court only—the heading was drawn out at Mr. Vanderpump's—it is "Priest's Court, late of Aldermanbury and of Woodbine Cottage"—I got the amount of book debts in List H from Michell—he made up the amount of 507<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. himself, there was nothing else to go by—on 1st April, when the bankruptcy petition was filed, I was not acting for him, I was acting for the creditors, and Messrs.

They were entitled to that—I have made no efforts to sell this reversion, I left It to Mr. Leader—I know nothing of it, it has not brought in a penny—I inquired in to the state of accounts between Keighley and Michell and the two papers J.J. and K.K. 20 and 21 were corrected by Mr. Wyatt and myself as there was some delay in getting the books from Bradford—Messers. Lovering made them out against the ledger—I have complied a statement of those alleged monthly purchase of goods from the commencement of the account—the account begins on 3rd November, 1877, with 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

(<hi rend="italic">Reading a number of amounts from the margin of the cheque book</hi>)—I went through that with the defendant last night, and there is a very little differences as to payments out—Michell for his own purpose got money from the banking account to the amount of 437<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not say that amount exactly, but there is not much difference—I have no means of knowing what the monkeys were that were paid into the bank—I know the amount, but I do not know where it comes from—Michell has said that is was a private banking account of himself, but not his own money—he said that moneys of his moneys of Keighley were paid in, and I asked him last night and neither he nor Mr. Keighley can do it—I asked Keighley whether any of Michell's money went into the bank, and he said he did not know, but Michell's said there were several payments in out of his private money—I found no trace of Keighley and Brothers's cheques—the banks—book will show the total paid in—Michell pointed out one payments which he thought was his own: the first item in the book 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he said he thought so, but he could not speak positively—he also pointed out a loan of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the paying in book, but I did not understand it—the total is 447<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., including one of Mr. Dear's acceptances for 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 13th November—the amount paid out under keighley's name is 1,616<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Michell says it is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—there was a credit balance 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when the bank stopped—amongst the papers delivered to me as trustee were several invoices from Keighley to Michell—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two invoices delivered up to Michell—amoung the invoices delivered up by Michell I find reference to the identical goods which are in Harfeld's Re<lb></lb>cepits—I find no instances of a sale at a profit at Harfeld's—correcting the statement of affairs by my evidence now, the total gross deficiency in Michell's bankruptcy statement is 4,222<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is the differences between the debts and credits—I first had knowledge of sales at Harfeld's at the examination in bankruptcy—I had often seen Michell before the sales commenced; he was in and out of our office twice and three times a week during the liquidation—he did not explain to me where the goods had gone; only the shawls to Dear—he said there was a parcel of goods which he had sold at a loss, but Harfeld's name did not turn up in any other instance—I believe he mentioned Harfeld's as the person to whom Dear's shawls were sold—he said that he had had great traveling expenses and living expenses, and had not made much profit out of his transaction—I don't think he gave me any explanation of the expenses he spoke of or the profits he had made—he said that they had made very little profit, and in some instances made a loss—he did not mention to me three journeys to</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have never found Michell Backward in answering any question as to the figures—I think he has given me the best answer he could—I do not think any of the information he has given me has been willfully false as to facts and transactions, but he has given me such a little information—after the petition in bankruptcy was filled he told me of the transaction of Harfeld with regard to Dear's shawls as the only transaction of the sort—to the best of my knowledge I never heard Harfeld'd name till then—I was at the meeting of creditors on 13th March, and I believe Harfeld's name was mentioned—I think a question asked him by Harfeld was the only Michell answered—I know he had one dealing with Harfeld—I never went to Harfeld—I asked Michell several question, the same as I ask bankrupts to account for the deficiencies and he said that he could not give me a account, that he made very little profit, and on some transaction a loss—I reckon his deficiencies to be 4,229<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which he has to account for—2,271<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is accounted for his accep<lb></lb>tance to Keighley, which reduces the account for by 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I account for the largest part of the deficiency at once—there are three cheques besides to Borisson, to Bowers, and to Halliwell—I do not know whether he received anything for them—he said that he never had a sixpence for them—I have never asked Keighley about it—I did not apply to the Bankruptcy Court for an order on the defendant to file better accounts; we did it in another way; we had him privately examined—I think he has passed his public examination; I was not there—he enters his liabilities in bankruptcy at about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or nearly so; that is in consequence of the amounts due to the creditors being correctly ascertained—he told me then almost entirely from memory—I do not suggest that he kept anything intentionally back from me—he did not omit the names of any creditors which I afterwards found out—the substantial differences was between his account and Keighley's and there was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more liability—he told me that Keighley had a claim for 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was his first statement, but he did not tell me anything about the bills that were ruining—he said that he had endorsed a considerable amount beyond the value of the goods or he would not have made him debtor for so much—I could only prepare the accounts from what he told me—I saw Mr. Vanderpump; he did not ask how it was that Keighley was put down as a debtor instead of a creditor—Michell's explanation to me was that it was in order to make the account Balance properly, because though Keighly and Brother were creditors of his, still he had accepted a large amount beyond the amount of his goods—having no books, I could only get it from his mouth until I saw Mr. Wyatt—I did not then know that Keighley's claim for goods was 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not discover before the meeting in liquidation that the actual amount Michell admitted was 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I took his figures entirely—he in<lb></lb>sisted that Keighley was his debtor for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in respect of the balance of account—he told me he had endorsed and accepted, and made up the account in his own way, and claimed credit for what he had not, and had made himself liable for about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not advise him only to put Keighley down as a debtor for 560<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if Mr. Vanderpump says that I did he</p>

               <p>Has made a mistake—I never told him that as Michell had endorsed bills to The amount of 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Keighley ought to appear as a debtor, and not as a Creditor; I expressly said that that was the amount Michell made it, and According to his figures it was correct; all those endorsements are figured As unsecured creditors to this day, and we did not know, except from the Debtor, that they were unsecured creditors—at that time Michell himself Did not know the exact state of affairs—I must have understood that Michell had taken up the endorsements—Michell was so foggy about his Books, having only his memory to trust to, that I can distinctly state that I did not understand it, and I may have concluded that Mr. Vauderpump Thought from the debtor's statement that the claim against Keighley was Correct—I have not got the original draft from which I prepared the Debtor's statement, I have an office copy—the figures were taken down From Michell's dication by one of our clerks, but I have not got it; most Probably Michell took it with him; it was of no use after I had made my Copy—I do not think Michell came to me on Card's recommendation, he Came of himself—I have known Card as long as I have known Michell—I Cannot say that Michell did not tell me that Keighley's claim against him Was considerably larger than 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he might have said that he owed Keighley about 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods, but if he did I do not see how that can Make him his debtor for 560<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in all probability he claimed that the Difference between 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should appear on the other side of His account—it was very important to wipe out his debt and make him a Debtor; we have always recognised that as accounting for the deficiency to That extent—if he did not take up drafts he would be a debtor for them, But not to Keighley—none of the bills were taken up—Michell said that He really could not tell what the state of his account was without seeing Keighley's books and I sent him to see them; I did not go personally—I think Mr. Lovering refused to show them once, and on two other occa<lb></lb>sions The books were at Bradford—I applied for an order of the Bankruptcy Court on 8th August to see them, which is on the file—it was made in a Day or two—that was after I had examined Keighley on 29th July at con<lb></lb>siderable Length in Michell's bankruptcy—we wanted to get at the fact, And see if we could elicit the truth—we had not seen the books then to Take extracts from them.

Plunkett and Leader appointed me trustee as wished by the Bradford creditors—no Dividend has been paid on Michell's estate—I have had 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in hard cash; My solicitors have it—I have never pretended to pay a dividend; there is Nothing to do it with—I think the dividend is payable upon the whole Amount of claim, both for Keighley's debts and acceptances for which the Defendant has made himself liable; but it is hard on the estate I admit—I Must do it, I am bound to pay on all liabilities—if the estate was able to Pay 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, I might deal with the acceptances and endorsements In another way, by relieving the estate of them; but I cannot do anything With them, they are in the hands of third parties—until I can get the whole</p>

Plumkett and Leader Are finding out what property he or his wife are entitled to—I am not a Lawyer—I do not think it was an unfair thing not to make inquiries before The prosecution was instituted; we go upon the figures that are put Before us—Michell does not say in his balance-sheet that he has rights In consequence of Mrs. Masters's death—I believe be has said in my hearing That his claims were in consequence of Mrs. Masters's death—my solicitors Have inquired what the property was to which he said he was entitled—I Have not asked them the result at present of what they are doing in the Matter—I cannot say yea or nay whether the defendant has any claim Under the will—I cannot say whether Michell has any interest under Certain wills in consequence of Mrs. Masters's death—I have never read the Wills or settlements—Mr. Vanderpump asked me to prepare the accounts In the bankruptcy—the delay in filing the accounts was not in consequence of My not having prepared them, it was in consequence of an error one of My clerks made, which caused some little delay—the trustee in bankruptcy Prepares the accounts, but they are the debtor's accounts—I did not tell Mr. Vanderpump after I was I was appointed trustee that I could not Undertake to prepare the accounts; what I said was in the interregnum Between the liquidation and the bankruptcy; when the liquidation fell Through Michell was adjudicated bankrupt, and it was 21 days before The appointment of a trustee, and between those times I suggested to Mr. Vanderpump that perhaps it would be as well to draw up the statement Before the trustee was appointed—I drew up one statement, but it was Incorrect, and Mr. Vanderpump drew it up afterwards; a certain Correction was suggested, and Mr. Vanderpump adopted it—my clerk pre<lb></lb>pared The bankruptcy accounts, and they were produced at the examination In July, and Mr. Knight objected to them—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the state<lb></lb>ment I handed to Mr. Vanderpump—this comes from our office—Mr. Vanderpump or Mr. Knight suggested that it was incorrect because Sheet A Contained all the liabilities—that was just the mistake which was In the liquidation proceedings—that was not Michell's fault—it contains The 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it is 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., more than the liquidation, we had got the amounts Corrected then—I have been ordered to prosecute by the Committee of In<lb></lb>spection; As trustee I am only a servant—the Court of Bankruptcy put Me in motion and I put it in motion—I have not said that this is an</p>

               <p>The document Mr. Clay speaks of, and I heard of the name of Masters, but I first heard this morning that property had been omitted from List G—I Directed Mr. Leader to make inquiries with respect to List G, but only as to legal Matters from 3rd October, 1879, which was before the examination before The Alderman—I have not had the slightest power or control over the pro<lb></lb>secution—Michell never presented to me any books but those I have stated—I had no means of searching him by means of books; my hands were Tied—I had no data to go on—all the invoices I have taken out were supplied By Michell, and all that I have seen here are in his writing—I have not Take out the whole of the goods under cost price—there is no other invoice On the same footing as this one of Hyde's for shawls—these are some of the Invoice which came from Michell, but not all.

We simply acted as solicitors for the Bradford creditors to recover the, Debts—Mr. Hopkins has been our clerk nine years; he was appointed proxy One Manchester creditor and one Bradford creditor to represent them in London—no objection has been made to him—the others are Mr. Dear and Mr. Newstead of Lovering and Co., who represent Keighley's estate—Mr. Dear Represents Hyde and co. for about 418<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we were the petitioning Creditors' solicitors on the adjudication, receiving instructions from Mr. Dear, Hyde and Co., and the Bradford creditors—we were concerned for Keighley In his liquidation, and have never ceased to act for him, but there have been No active proceedings since his meeting of creditors—he has liquidated by Arrangement, and the creditors have wound him up—we were acting For the Bradford creditors up to the stage of getting the order—no offer was made that if 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid there should not be a Prosecution, but if not that there should be—I was never a party to any Such statement—I have here the original letter from the Treasury authorizing Us to conduct the prosecution, under which we act—from the time the Matter went before the Alderman we had no discretion as to entering into Any compromise, we are simply acting as agents for the Treasury—I do not Know of any Bradford creditors who dissented—I do not know that I ever Had any full knowledge of the transactions between Michell and Keighley—I have never been able to get it; the examination at the Bankruptcy Court Gave me the only information—it has never been suggested to me that Michell had other property than is contained in List G, but I had personal</p>

               <p>Communications with him—I have received an intimation of further property Subject to the wife's claim on equity of settlement; that is of doubtful value—I should not like to say that I admit it, because it might prejudice the Claim—I know nothing about Downer's will—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) refers to the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. contingent reversion on the death of Mrs. Michell, aged 35—I received A communication from the prisoner's solicitor as to the value of it; they Took the opinion of an actuary, who valued it at nil—those are the legal Points upon which I have been acting—I have no expectation of other Profits, and have no idea where to look for further assets—I think the Examination of Michell's books was necessary, and they were attended by Expense—all the expenses were incurred long before any money was received—from the time of the Treasury taking it in hand there was an end to the Liability of the estate—all the examinations were under the order of the Bankruptcy Court—I have no motive whatever in regard to the prosecution.</p>

I had two or three conversations with Michell as to what he owed Keighley, and that Keighley owed him—he Said there was some mistake—I asked him whether it related to goods or Cash—he said the goods he believed to be correct, but there were some late Transactions of cash which he did not think he was given credit for—I asked Him to tell me the amounts—he could not do so then, but he said he would Refer to his books which he had at home and let me know, and I think he Afterwards brought me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he never suggested that the account Should be corrected to more how it was three items—I think the account Was corrected—I asked him how it was he got those bills from Keighley—</p>

               <p>He stated two reasons, one that he did not want Keighley's creditors to know That he was indebted in such a large sum to Keighley, and that he had also Endorsed and accepted bills for something over 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Keighley—I said "That is nonsense, you have not paid those bills, you have simply en<lb></lb>dorsed Them; are you in a position to pay them?"—he said that he should Be—I told him I could not take his endorsements as a set-off against Keighley's claim, which was very nearly 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the open account and Acceptances running—neither he or Keighley could give me the particulars Of those bills, but I got them subsequently—think the conversation about The 171<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 178<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which were struck out was in Michell's Presence, but I am not positive—it is impossible for me to say by the ex<lb></lb>amination Of the day book whether those items are fictitious or not—i only Know why they are omitted on the information given me by Keighley—There has been no insisting on the restoration of those two items—in January, 1879, when Michell told me he was liable for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said "How is it if You are able to pay this 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you have not paid a bill of something like 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I heard you speak of yesterday as having written to a creditor At Bradford about?"—he said that he had a large sum locked up in cones<lb></lb>quence Of the stoppage of the St. James's Bank—I said "I understood all Along from you and Mr. Keighley that the money at the St. James's Bank Belong to Mr. Keighley, not to you"—he said "That is of no consequence, It was an understood thing that the bill was to be paid from the proceeds of The bank."</p>

                  </hi>. I am member of the firm of G. J. and P. E. Vanderpump solicitors, of Gray's Inn—we are solicitors for The defendant—we acted for him prior to his bankruptcy—he called On me at the latter end of December, 1878, and brought with him these two Documents, one the appointment on his marriage with Miss Harrington, and The other a receipt for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. signed by the trustees of his wife's father—he Had promised to hand me a cheque, partly for money I had advanced, and Partly for costs, and he asked me whether I could get him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon them And pay myself, and give him the balance—I read them in his presence, and Said "This is a contingent reversion, and not an absolute one; and it is Certainly not of the value of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," pointing out to him that he would have To pay a large premium, his age being the same as his wife's—I told him I Thought I could get 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Law Union upon it, but I must take an Actruary's opinion; and the opinion was that it was worth nil, as the premium Would make it too large to make it worth anybody's while to advance upon It—the bankrupt called on me with Mr. Everett his trustee and I in<lb></lb>structed Mr. Everett to prepare the usual statement of affairs—they called Again together on the morning of the first liquidation, and brought the state<lb></lb>ment That had been prepared pursuant to my instructions—I looked at it, And called Mr. Everett's attention to the statement under the head of book Debts, where Keighley and Brother appeared as a debtor instead of a creditor—he said "It is the balance after taking the full amount of aceptances And endorsements by Michell, against the amount due from Michell to Keighley for goods sold and delivered"—at that time Michell believed that The amount he was indebted to Keighley was 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that he had no Means of checking the exact figures—they must be taken at an approximate Amount—Mr. Everett said that the statement had been made up from the Documents given him by Michell—no inspection was to be made of the Books at that time—Michell told me that he had been to Keighley for the Purpose of seeing the books on two occasions in March, and that the inspect<lb></lb>tion Had been refused—I paid Mr. Everett for preparing the account, and Pointed out that it appeared wrong to put him in as a debtor instead of a Creditor without seeing how it was arrived at—he said that it was a state<lb></lb>ment Of affairs, and not a balance sheet—several months afterwards it was</p>

               <p>necessary for another statement to be prepared for the meeting in bank<lb></lb>ruptcy, and I believe Mr. Everett's clerk copied the exact statement that had been made in the liquidation—Mr. Everett pointed out to me that as trustee he ought not to prepare the debtors' statement—there was some delay in the filing of those accounts, and on, I think, the fourth of fifth day of the private examination Mr. Everett handed me across the table the state<lb></lb>ment of affairs in his clerk's writing—I looked at it at once, and saw that it was exactly the same as before—there had been no alteration whatever—Mr. Knight, the Counsel, being there, I put the question to him how it was To be framed—he advised that it was not in the proper form, as the bills Endorsed and accepted should have been under D instead of A—he did not disapprove of any other matter, but I think it might have been framed very much better now; but the defendant did what I advised him to do—the accounts under the liquidation were fully gone into at that meeting of creditors—they were read out and discussed, and Mr. Lovering tendered a proof for 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on behalf of the bank<lb></lb>rupt I disputed it, acting under Mr. Everett's advice—I think I explained publicly at that meeting the way in which I arrived at the balance—it was explained and thoroughly understood by all the creditors—when Michell consulted me first he told me how he had got into his difficulties—I procured an office copy of Mrs. Master's will—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mr. Joseph Downer's, original will from the Probate Court—it is dated the 12th of February, 1835 (<hi rend="italic">This was put in and read</hi>)—Thomas Harrington died before Mrs. Masters, childless and intestate, and she was only between William Downer and Mrs. Michell as representing her mother—I cannot Prove Mrs. Thomas had any other child but Josephine; but Josephine represented her dead sister or brother—William Downer and Josephine Michell divided the estate between them, and they have already divided the money—they have each taken their share—it was 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Consols—Mrs. Michell's share was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and after payment of solicitors' charges she received 493<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I received 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it from Plunkett and Leader—the land was not sold, but it is estimated to be worth 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also produce Mrs. Masters's marriage settlement (<hi rend="italic">This was dated the 5th of June, 1839, and Was partly read</hi>)—the money was paid over in Mr. Read's presence to the Bank of England—he is here and will prove it—it was exactly 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Consols—I first obtained particulars of Josiah Downer's will within the last Three weeks, and of the marriage settlement within the last fortnight, at any Rate since the case was set down for trial here—I found out these two documents through Mr. Read's solicitor—the 505<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. mentioned in the marriage settlement has never been handed over to any one, it is now in dispute—that does not relate to the Consols at all—758<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. New 31/2 per Cents. Was originally settled by the marriage settlement—that is the total Amount—I know it from the trustee himself—the endorsement relates to What is paid under the will—I also produce an office copy of Mrs. Masters's Will—it was sworn under 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the terms of that will are the beginning Of all the trouble—there purports to be a real estate passing by that will, But there is none, the prior document having directed where the real estate Should go—it does not pass under that document at all but under two other documents—the amount passing under that was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a small amount of the plate and furniture, which was not valued, but it was sworn under 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—here is also a declaration of trust of 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of</p>

Consols settled under a declaration of trust of trust of November 6th, 1865—it is left first to the wife and then to the defendant if he survives her; she has an interest in the whole 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. until her death. And then 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. goes to him absolutely if he survives her—the actuaries' opinion has been given since the bankruptcy—Mr. Leader said that it would give the defendant's friends the option of purchasing, and they have offered to sell it to me for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the defendant's age is 35 I think—I think it would be a very good specula<lb></lb>tion for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the reason it is not worth more is that you are obliged to take one premium, and therefore it is really worth nothing at the present time—I have seen Mr. Everett repeatedly since the commencement of the prosecution—there is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year under Mr. Harrington's will; this is an office copy of it; under it the trustees are to pay Mrs. Michell 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for her separate use until certain claims on the estate are paid off, and then it is to be increased to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the balance invested for the benefit of the children, in whose favour there is a trust of the whole of the estate with the exception of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year to Mr. Michell for life on the death of his wife, subject to some very strong contingencies; he cannot charge or continue it—it is voidable in bankruptcy, but I do not think he has lost it by the present bankruptcy—I think it means bankruptcy subject to this taking effect—I have put in all the documents—I prepared Sheet G after a careful examination of all the facts Mr. Michell put before me, and after a careful examination of him as to what property he had—did not know of Joseph Downer's will or of the settlements of Francis Downer at that time—the trustee is here and he will prove that he did not know of it, it has all come out since this inquiry—whatever was given was for the wife's separate use, not subject to the control of the husband—I do not know of any other property that passed under that—the defendant also handed me this receipt for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the trustees, dated 10th December, 1878, and the original document bears the same date—I heard Mr. Everett cross-examined by Mr. Clay, and heard him deny that he had made certain state<lb></lb>ments to me—that denial is not true—Mr. Everett said to me that this was an improper prosecution, that he was simply trustee in the matter, that he personally considered the prosecution was not a proper one, as it was for the purpose of compelling the bankrupt's friends to come forward, and he should not have gone on if he had not been compelled by the Committee of Inspection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That took place in Guildhall Yard after Mr. Everett's examination—I knew at the time that he had no control over the prose<lb></lb>cution—he considered that it was an improper prosecution; that is what I said—he and I walked from the Court together; there was no one with us; this was privately spoken to me in answer to something I said to him—I have been instructing your learned friend in this matter—I have made no inquiry whatever about Keighleys—I supplied them with materials I did not suggest that he had been insolvent before—I was his solicitor first in 1876, I think—I was never concerned in paying his creditor—I never acted for him in reference to any composition—I don't think I acted for him before the beginning of 1877—I should disclose or compel a client to disclose any contingent interest in property, most decidedly—I know as a fact that the defendant did not know of this half interest—I know that no</p>

               <p>one knew it except Mr. William Downer—that was under Mrs. Masters's marriage settlement—I first had knowledge if it two or three weeks ago, and that was the same time that Michell had knowledge of it—the omission of that property from Statement G was most decidedly from ignorance—had I know it in January, 1878, I should have inserted it—the other property does not all come under the headings 1,2,3, and G—there is no mention of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no non-disclosure except under G, which I only I known that the defendant had any interest in it in the right of his wife I should have mentioned it on the statement—I believe he gave me the fullest information in his power, and I filled it up myself—there is only one contingency, and that is of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I have written "a hundred a year, &amp;c., until he becomes bankrupt," but that does not relate to Downer; that is under Harrington's will—when he brought me this parchment and I found it was worth nil I temporarily gave him a cheque for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he promised to bring me back—he did not, but brought me this security, and asked me to get him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it and pay myself, and I said it is not worth it—the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not borrowed on the statement that it would be paid again in a day or two; it was not sent to him, it was sent to some one else—I think that was about December 30—I cannot tell whether Card stooped in 1878 or 1879; he had as early as 30th July dishonoured a cheque given to Rowley, and I say here in my books "Writing to you to take cheque up, and dishonoured cheque, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that is true—the property was really the property of Mrs. Josephine Michell's father—it had not been invested in houses, it was a very long row of freehold shops, which brought in between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—it is worth 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say whether it was old Mr. Harrigton's property time out of mind but it was his before his death—under Mr. Harrington's will he takes 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I am speaking of the property at Notting Hill—it represents more than that, because she was to have 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and there was another 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay mortgages, and the remainder was to be laid out in trust—it is all to her private use and benefit; there is only a charge of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Michell on his surviving his wife—I think his saying "What a thing for me to find my property burnt down" was a very reasonable observation if it was his wife's—he had never the control of a single tenant—I knew nothing about his business affairs before he came to me to consult me about keighley having stopped and his affairs being in confusion—he did not then show me the little bank-book of the British Linen Company; if he had I should not have looked at it, because I had arranged with him to employ a professional accountant—I did not know he had an account there till I heard it at the Mansion House—the whole of the books and papers were handed to Mr. Everett, and he attended to them solely—I do not know of his having any banking account between 15th April, 1878, and 12th October, 1878, when the other account was opened.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am positively certain that the defendant knew nothing about Mr. Downer's will and Mrs. Masters's marriage settlement—he told me something about his expectations, and how they came—List G discloses 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coming under a marriage settlement, but with no statement about bankruptcy—I prepared two office copies of the two wills, and satisfied myself by the will of Mrs. Masters that the property was bound to Mrs. Michell's separate use—at the meeting of 13th March, after the debtor's</p>

Consols—Woodbine House is let furnished for the benefit of the estate; The trustees of her father's will have taken it at 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; the rent and taxes are about 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and the surplus 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. goes to Mrs. Michell under her father Mr. Harrington's will—there is a surplus to educate the children, and in the event of the mother dying, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is left to the father for the support of the children—there is no special fund for the maintenance of the children, but it accumulates till they come of age—the property under Mr. Harrington's will consists of houses on a terrace at Notting Hill. Which are in the hands of trustees, out of the rents of which Mrs. Michell's income is paid, and the defendant's income if he survives her—on 9th July, 1878, a fire took place there, injuring two or three of the houses—they were insured, and the insurance was laid out in rebuilding them—I first heard of the fire by Mr. Michell's calling on me early one morning, and showing me the account in a daily paper—it mentioned this terrace—I have known the Michell family 40 Years, and have known Mrs. Maters very well—I know that she received the rent of the Bull Inn, at Rodenden, direct from the tenant for some Years—I did not know that there was a mortgage on the Bull Inn till July, 1879—so far as I know, Mrs. Masters was entitled to it unencumbered—I know that it was part of the property settled by Mrs. Masters's marriage settlement—Mr. William Downer and Mrs. Michell are entitled to the property on Mrs. Masters's death in moieties—I do not know the details of the marriage settlement—I never saw it till Yesterday or the day before—I know there was one—this is the first time I knew of its provisions—the copy has been lost for some time—I knew of the cottages at Westborough Green, and that Mrs. Masters received the rents of them—I thought they were hers absolutely—I did not know the provisions of Joseph Downer's will—she only had the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Consols for life—I did not know originally that the sum settled under Mrs. Masters's marriage settlement was 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know how the Bull Inn came to be included under a settlement—when Mrs. Master's died I knew that I was one of her executors—I proved the will about 22nd October, 1878—I remember the receiving from Joseph Downer's trustees the proceeds of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

Consols—I am executor to both Mr. Harrington and Mrs. Masters—I knew that there was a will if Joseph Downer existing before July, but I did not know the provisions of it—I Knew there were Consols under it, but having nothing to do with it I did Not interest myself in the matter—Mrs. Masters was willing that Michell Should have this money—there is no other person who is as intimate with the financial affairs of Mrs. Michell as I am—she has no brother, she is the only surviving child—I know it was intended that the Bull Inn should be sold at the end if December, 1878—I believe six months' notice had been given to the mortgagee—negotiations were proceeding for the sale as early as January, 1879—there was considerable delay in selling it on account of the missing deed, Mrs. Masters's marriage settlement—the deeds were supposed to lay with Mr. William Downer—I have had rendered to me an account of the proceeds of the sale, 855<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—certain claims were made for costs by William Downer and his London agent for about 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I dispute as trustee, And contend that I am not liable—I understand that the trustees of Michell's bankruptcy had made a claim to it—what Mr. Vanderpump said yesterday as to the relationship between Mr. Downer and Mrs. Masters is correct.</p>

Consols—I took the dividends and paid the whole to her every half-year—in september, 1877, a new state of things occurred.

               <p>notall at onec, but ouly as she asked for it; I paid nothing to michell—after the payment of existing liabilities I was, with Mrs. Michell's consent, to pay back the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within seven years; that was thoroughly well known to michell—the cheque for her half share of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was 493<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went with him to the Bank of England on 25th or 26th November, 1868; he cashed the cheque there and gave me the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the memorandum of December 27th shows the way I was to have the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know nothing about his having dishonoured some bills, or about his business affairs—Mrs. Masters died in July, 1878—was at the funeral; the will was read; the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not to be free from her husband's control—everything but the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was tied with the condition that she was to have the enjoyment of it as a <hi rend="italic">feme sole</hi>, as I understood, but I am not a solicitor—Michell did not apply to me to advance him 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to put into the business—I never heard of it till these proceedings—I saw him there or four times a week—he know I was the executor of Mrs. Masters's and of Mr. Harrington's wills, and the also the trustee under the original thrust of Joseph Harrington—I cannot say whether the six months' notice to the mortgagee was given of the sale of the Bull Inn—I nothing to do with that trust; Mr. William Downer managed that, and I only know what he tells me—I have said that Mrs. Michell's interest was only one half of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that was my belief at the time—no question was put about any other property—I know nothing about the marriage settlement, I only know about the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Console—I was asked whether there was any interest upon any other property—if the question had been asked I should have answered that there was a marriage settlement—the cottages are under the grand<lb></lb>father's will, which I never read, and know she became possessed of them—I thought they were vested in her absolutely—I leave the succession duties to my solicitor—I have got the 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is in Mr. Badham's hands, the trustee of Mrs. Masters, if he has not paid it into the Court of Chancery—Mrs. Michell has instructed my solicitor to claim a settlement of it—Mrs. Master had been ill eighteen months or two years, confined to her room, if not to her bed—I do not know of Michell using Card's rooms in Alderman<lb></lb>bury, or a room at Keighley's—I know he did something in the city—I believe this letter is in his writting—I know nothing of any affairs between Mr. Harrington and Michell—I heard that money had been lent, but I had Nothing to do with 418<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. lent in 1875—I know nothing about his affairs in 1876—it is rather an expensive house, we pay 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent—we cannot let it unfurnished, so we let it furnished—it was given up about 5th or 6th October, 1879—I did not give any portion of the rent to Michell—it is Mrs. Michell's property.</p>

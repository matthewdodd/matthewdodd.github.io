            . The prisoner used to work for me last summer, at my house in David-street, Grosvenor-street; I sent her home with a gown to one of Mrs. Johnson's shop-women, in Union-row, Chelsea. The prisoner was in the hospital when I found her; when she came out she came to my house, I was then removed into Berwick-street, Soho; she was in a distressed state; I gave her a shilling and a pair of shoes. I had occasion to go to some of my duplicates in a tin box, she was very assiduous in looking over them; she said, I am very sorry for you now, I knew you when you had all these things about you. She went out with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to any of the shops where these things were pawned - A. Yes, to one of them. and she wished me good night at the top of Davey-street, and told me she was going home. When I came home I asked my landlady for my key, she said, it was in my door; she said my husband's sister had come back and got the key of her, as she said she had left her key on my table. When I went into my room the first thing I missed was a piece of cotton, about four yards and a half, it was what had been left for me to make up, and a new pair of stockings that I had been shewing to her; the next thing I missed was a shirt and a shift; my duplicates I missed the next day; I went to the pawnbrokers and found all my things were redeemed; I never found any of these articles. When she was taken nothing was found upon her but two of my gowns, that had been in pledge. She stole the duplicates and the tin box.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost them, on what day - A. On the day after the Jubilee day. She came for the key the same night, Mrs. Bailey, my landlady, gave it her. I am sure I left the things in the apartment before I went out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110006"></xptr>Mrs. BAILEY. Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming and getting a key at your house. - A. Yes; it was a very short time after Mrs. Thomson went out; she said she had left her key in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she was the husband's sister. - A. Yes, I understood her so; I gave her the key; I did not see what she brought out; nobody went up but her; she staid there but a short time.</p>
               <p>JAMES GILLMORE. I belong to the Public Office, Queen-square. I searched the house where the prisoner was taken, and in the water-butt I found two gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not in this charge. - A. She owned to the tin-box; and the duplicates, she said, she had put in her bosom; but she was so drunk she did not know what had become of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. - When I first went to live with this person, she hired me, to work for her. She was a person on the town, and I went with her; she wore my gowns, and I wore her's; and part of these duplicates the clothes belonged to me. I asked her to give me the duplicates; she refused giving them me; she asked me to go out with her; she had another woman with her at the time I went out with her. I had left my key in her room on the table: I said, Mrs. Thompson, I forgot my key; she said, go and get it. I asked the landlady for the key; she saw me go out; I was very ill; I had lost the use of my limbs; I heard that she had a charge against me; I went and delivered myself; she has been the ruin of me entirely.</p>

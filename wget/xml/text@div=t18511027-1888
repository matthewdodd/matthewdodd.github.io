                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Bush and Mullens—the 15th April bill would be due on 18th Sept,, and the one of 15th May on 18th Oct.—we merely sent a letter to Mr. Gil<lb></lb>bert of York—it came back, and then Bush and Mullens inquired—we took no steps except by letter—I do not know the prisoner's brother.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury,—I am placed in this deplorable situation from circumstances over which I have no con<lb></lb>trol; and so far as regards the crime imputed to me of forging or uttering with a guilty knowledge, the document produced, I am entirely innocent; and had, down to almost the last moment, hoped to have made my innocence manifest, by producing the persons who have done the act for which I am here before you to answer. I pray you, not only for myself, but for my poor wife and six children, seriously to take my case into your consideration; and believe, too, that it is quite possible for circumstances to arise which may warrant an accusation, and for the party accused to be the innocent victim of others, and to be without the power of producing witnesses, because those others (fearing consequences to themselves personally) decline to come forward and prove the facts which none, except themselves, can establish. It is painful for me to introduce to your notice the name of a brother; but my present misfortune, for truth's sake, obliges me. He may have been, and probably has been, him<lb></lb>self</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270055"></xptr>
               <p>deceived; but I will tell to you the honest truth of my own participation in this transaction, and I defy contradiction as to one iota. My brother, Augustus Westley, was under considerable obligations to me, in consequence of my having assisted him to go into business. Having a very large book-binding concern myself, in which my outlay for wages alone was from 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week, I was frequently straightened for money, and it was fre<lb></lb>quently the subject of conversation between myself and my brother Augustus. It is known to the commercial and trading world, that men in business will, and very frequently do, assist each other with "accommodation" acceptances; and by such assistance very many tradesmen are able to get, by discounts, temporary help, which enables them, at the time of pressure, to keep their credit, which (but for such assistance) would be entirely destroyed; for you know, Gentlemen, when once a man's own acceptance is dishonoured, his trading credit is gone; and without credit, no man, in these times of specu<lb></lb>lation and competition, can avoid sinking. Upon mentioning to my brother my want of capital to go on with,—having, as I had, a large business which would (by assistance being afforded me) have enabled me very shortly to have extricated myself from embarrassment of every kind, he said, "I have no doubt that I can get you some accommodation paper;" I was thankful for his offer; and, at his suggestion, I drew upon parties upon whom he stated I might do so with confidence. He took the bills, thus fully drawn and signed by me, to get them accepted; the bills were brought back to me, and I had my brother's assurance that they were accepted in due course,—for that he was acquainted with a person who, to oblige him, had procured the acceptances. Gentlemen, fully relying upon the acceptances being genuine, I then added my name at the back as indorser, in the usual way, thinking that in doing so I was using a mere temporary accommodation, determining to provide at the time when the bills should become due, in order to honor them, but which, I lament to say, subsequent unforeseen embarrassments prevented; and I solemnly assure you that, until I was apprehended at the Court of Bank<lb></lb>ruptcy on this charge, I was utterly unconscious of the fact of the acceptors not being resident at the places named on the bills, and not being known at the places where they were made payable. I had relied upon my brother, and had no reason to believe, or suspect, that he had deceived me. I had always believed the bills to bear true acceptances (there being no doubt suggested by anybody as to the fact that they were otherwise), and that all I had to do was to provide for them at maturity. Gentlemen—I was, when put into custody, taken to the Mansion-house, and remanded to the Giltspur-street Compter, where my brother Augustus came to me, and I told him of the accusation against me; he stated then, as he had done before, that the accep<lb></lb>tances were genuine, and that by the next examination he would bring for<lb></lb>ward the acceptors. I fully expected he would do so; but from that moment I never saw my brother,—he never came near me again; and from communi<lb></lb>cation made to the rest of my family, it is quite evident that he is fearful of doing so, or appearing, lest he (by the evidence whereby he would relieve me) should be placed in my situation. These are the facts, Gentlemen; and I implore you to take them into your consideration. I am guiltless of the charge, and have been deceived, as I told the Lord Mayor; but I am help<lb></lb>less, and throw myself on your justice. Gentlemen, when the bills became due, Messrs. Glyn, it appears, presented them for payment. They must, by those presentations, have at that time discovered the fact which I was ignorant of, namely, that the acceptors were not known at the places where the bills had been made payable; and although they did so then know, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270056"></xptr>
               <p>made inquiries after the acceptors at the places where the bills were addressed and could not find any such persons; they kept those facts secret from me for weeks, until after I was declared bankrupt, and until after I was in custody. Instead of which, I cannot help saying, that it would have been better had they at once sent to me and stated the facts, I should have then told them all the circumstances about the acceptances; and the parties who have deceived me, and through me deceived them, would have been made answerable, and justice would have been done. As it is, the bills were kept in their hands, I was in the dark, and they never thought of making this charge against me until I was bankrupt, and in due course appeared at the Court of Bankruptcy,—which, Gentlemen, do you as tradesmen, and as men of rational understand<lb></lb>ing, think I should have been mad enough to have done, had I ever imagined that the bills which I had passed, had upon them forged acceptances? Gen<lb></lb>tlemen—to charge me with this forgery, or with this guilty uttering, is surely an afterthought. Messrs. Glyn's were aware of my difficulties as to money, because I made them known to them myself; and to cover any deficiency that might be upon my running account, I deposited a security in their hands, and they now hold that security; it refers to freehold property in the City of London, which will realize from three to four thousand pounds. So that if they do sustain some loss, it will be comparatively small; and when it is known, as their books will prove, that during the few years I have been bank<lb></lb>ing with their house, ninety thousand pounds, or thereabouts, has passed through their hands, you will readily admit that it was not too much for me to expect some consideration from them. Gentlemen, I do hope that you will take this plain and honest statement into your humane and just con<lb></lb>sideration, and remember that I was a tradesman, having large weekly de<lb></lb>mands to meet; that I believed I was merely availing myself of genuine accommodation acceptances, to gain time thereby to meet just demands upon me; that I was anxious to keep up a large business, which (could I have continued) would very shortly have placed me beyond all difficulty; that I availed myself of what is considered a kindly and affectionate brother's offer to extricate myself from present pressure; that I had no intention of injuring or defrauding the prosecutors, they having security to so large an amount as from between three and four thousand pounds; and that guilty knowledge was at variance with my whole conduct, by meeting my creditors, and by going to an open Court, where my intended appearance bad been openly and pub<lb></lb>licly advertized in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette,</hi> and the public journals, for a particular day and hour. These are the observations which I take leave to address to your humane hearts, trusting that my true statement will weigh in my favour against inferences which are only supported by circumstances, all of which (though some may be consistent with guilt) are thoroughly capable of being consistent also with innocence.</p>

I saw the two pri<lb></lb>soners near Mr. Jolly's shop, on Saturday, the 16th of January—I had been watching them—they were in company together—I saw them at the door, and in the space of a minute and a half I saw Creabolt take the stove—I watched them, and gave them in charge to the policeman, who took one to the station-house—the other escaped, and was taken on the Monday morning.</p>

On Monday morning, the 18th of January, I was on duty at the station-house, and was called to take the prisoner Smith to Lambeth-street office—in going along I asked him what he had been doing?—he said he had been taken for stealing a stove, which he did not take it, but he knew the man that took it, and saw him take it—I was talking to Barton, and he said, "Do you see that man with black whiskers?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "That is the man that took the stove"—I went out, and Creabolt (Whom he had pointed out) ran off, and some persons said, "Cut it, Jack!"—I pursued him about 300 yards, and he was stopped by a person, and they fell in the gutter—I took Creabolt.</p>

I was examined in the former case—on 7th Jan., about 7 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our milk shop for a halfpennyworth of milk—(it was the same day as the prisoner Stratford came)—I served her—she gave me a half crown; I gave it to my brother; I did not know it was bad—it was on a Saturday; and on Monday, the 9th, she came again, and my brother sent for me into the shop—I did not recognise the prisoner at first, but am sure now that she is the person who came on the Saturday.</p>

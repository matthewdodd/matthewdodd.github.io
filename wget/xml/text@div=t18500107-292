                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the Railway Company. On the evening of 22nd Dec., I was on the bridge, which is part of the line at the back of the Swan at Highbury—I put six pounds of candles on the abut<lb></lb>ment—I used some of them before I went, and left the rest there—any person might go there, but they had no right to go—I left about a quarter before eleven o'clock—they were for the use of the bricklayers, who were working all night—they were Messrs. Gregson's candles—I left the prisoner there, he was in Messrs. Gregson's service—I went back about a quarter before twelve, there were then only four candles left—the prisoner was there, I told him the candles were gone—he said I had no business to have left them there, I knew they would go—he had been working there, but was not then.</p>

I saw the prisoner on 22nd Dec. coming out of the Holloway-road from the back of Highbury-terrace, about four hundred yards from the bridge, with a sack on his shoulder—I asked what it was—he said coals, that he had picked up—I saw he had something in his bosom—I said, "What is this?"—he said, "That is my <hi rend="italic">grub</hi>"—I found it was twelve candles—I asked him how he came by them—he said he had had them given him by the foreman—I took him to the foreman, and he said he gave him none, and he was not allowed to take them.</p>

            . On the second of August, Mrs Ryley came to my Shop, and offered me seven Yards of Cloth to sell, I agreed with her for 10 s. a Yard, and then I wanted to know whether it was her Property; she said it was not; she sent me to the Barley-Mow in - Street, Goodman fields, and there was the Prisoner, who said it was his Property. I asked the Landlord, whether he knew any Thing of the Man or the Woman; he said he believed they were honest People, and we might venture to buy it. After I had paid him for that, the Prisoner said he had another Remnant; Mrs Ryley went and fetched it, that was 15 Yards and a Half, and the Prisoner was secured. I am sure that is the Cloth I bought of Mrs Ryley.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Wilkes Plaisted, of High-street, Woolwich. The prisoner was in his service on 26th Feb., and had been so about two months—on the night before that, Friday, I had marked</p>

               <p>some money in the presence of Mrs. Cleall, to whom I gave it, requesting her to have some goods purchased at our bar as near 8 o'clock on the next morning as possible—next morning, about half past nine o'clock, I examined the till, and found one half crown, and 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in small silver—there was no 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece there, but I found one, and the other half crown I had marked, on the top of the pounds which I had left the previous night—I always leave 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver over night, in a glass case, that they may not want change—I afterwards told the prisoner that I suspected her of being dishonest, as I had marked two half crowns and a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and one half crown I had missed, which must be in her possession, and I said, "If you are not guilty you will show me what you have in your pocket"—she said, "I do not see that you should ask me that; I cannot see why you should do so"—I said, "If you are innocent you will not object," and she took her purse out in Mrs. Cleall's presence and mine—I examined it, and took out this half crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is one of those I had given to Mrs. Cleall—I know it by the cross on the chin, and I took the dates down—when I first spoke to her she said that she had no money but what belonged to her.</p>

We called at a public house, and had a glass of spirituous liquors. I changed a French half crown.

I pulled off my boots and coat, and slept in the room, and in the morning I found this woman had left me, and I missed my watch, and likewise half a guinea in gold. With that, finding myself in the room alone, I called the watch, and the watch called the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, are you sure that you had your watch at the time you went into the room with her? - I am certain I had, because I looked to see what it was o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you awoke and called the watch? - About half after four, or near five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your watch? - I did not find my watch, I found some few halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your half guinea when you went into the room with her? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever recovered any of your property? - None at all. I have seen my watch in the constable's hands about an hour after the same morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you take her up after this? - About an hour after, the constable and watchman went in pursuit of her, and took her in Hatton-wall, Leather-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance is that? - Three or four hundred yards, I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she searched? - We searched her when we went into the public house, she said, she would go back to the same room, and see if she could find it. She went back to the room.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she deny that she was the same person that had been with you the over night? - She did not deny that, but she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160103"></xptr>denled that she had got the watch; the constable took it from her. I heard the chain rattle; I see it in the hands of the constable. The constable says, here is your watch. I went to the justice, and the justice made me prosecute her. I wish to have my property again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by your directions that this woman is indicted for a capital offence, or did you leave it to the officer? - I left it to the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. What happened when you went there? - I found the watchman and this man here there. I found the watch, I see the prisoner take it from her side, and give it the watchman. I had searched her pockets before; I ordered her to strip herself to see if she had any duplicates I found seven shillings but no half guinea.

I pulled the bed about, and found two pence halfpenny. I asked him if he knew the woman? He said he knew her very well; and on coming along Hatton-wall, I found her about seven o'clock. We went to her lodgings, and the constable searched the drawers, and bed likewise. We found the watch as she was going to prison.</p>

He has sent twice since I have been in confinement, if I could raise money he would not prosecute me at all, but I could not; I have no friends at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did one of them take your arm? A.

            . I live at No. 7, Hatton-garden. I was standing at our street door with my brother between twelve and one o'clock, on a Sunday morning, in January - five men passed me with Mr. Monro - one man had hold of one arm, and the other had hold of the other arm, by Mr. Mouro's side; he was in liquor; I watched them - they stopped at the next door to me, and two of them wished him good night, after one had put his hand into his pocket behind; those two left him, then crossed, and turned up Holborn, the other three went on with him along Hatton-garden till they were out of my sight, and then I sent my brother to watch them - one of those who left him wore a flannel jacket, and one that went on with him; I cannot positively say whether the prisoner was one of them.</p>

            . I was with my sister, and saw five men and a gentleman pass our door - I now know that was Mr. Monro; two left him and went towards Holborn - I followed them along Hatton-garden; I believe the prisoner to be one of those who left Mr. Monro and went up Holborn; he was one of the two who had flannel jackets on - he was talking to Mr. Mobro; I followed Mr. Monro and the other three - I saw them turn into Charles-street; the two who had gone away came down from Leather-lane - they walked at a distance behind till they came to Kirby-street; the prisoner was one of those two I am sure; when they got into Kirby-street all the five surrounded him, the prisoner among them; Langham, one of the others, went to look at a door, and before he returned they knocked Mr. Monro down - I saw his watch swinging round from one to another; they then all ran away down Union-court, and Langham went up Charles-street; I saw Logan the watchman, immediately after, and told him to take Langham, for they had knocked a gentleman down; I went to Mr. Monro, and went to the watch-house with him; I had seen the prisoner before and knew him; I am sure he was one of the four present when Mr. Monro was knocked down and robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you examined in this Court before on this subject? A. Yes; and said I knew Birmingham, one of the prisoners, before; I did not say I knew this prisoner - I said he was one of the men at the Police-office; I at first said I believed he was the man, but if he was, he had a flannel jacket on - I could tell better if the jacket was put on - and when I saw the jacket on, I said he was the man; I am between twelve and thirteen years old; I said at the office that I knew the prisoner before; I thought if I saw the jacket on I might know him better - I did not mention his name to the officer; the names of the three men tried last were read over to me; I did not see the prosecutor knocked down.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. It you did not see him knocked down, did you see that he was down and his watch taken? A. Yes;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090066"></xptr>but I did not see anybody strike him; I did not know the prisoner's name before; I at first said I believed him to be the man, but would not swear to him; the Magistrate sent for the jacket - I then said he was the man.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was on duty on Sunday morning, the 18th of January - I was in Kirby-street, but saw nothing of the robbery - I was informed of it afterwards; four men were taken; I was at the apprehension of three of them in West-street - they could get to that street by Union-court - one of the four had a flannel jacket; and about twenty minutes to two o'clock, while I had hold of the three, I saw another man run by in a flannel jacket - it was at their apprehension; he was about the size of the prisoner, but I cannot swear positively to him; I knew the prisoner before - he lived in the neighbourhood, and has worn a flannel jacket ever since I knew him; I had not seen him from the time the others were apprehended till he was taken - before the robbery I was in the habit of seeing him in the neighbourhood</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew him before, but cannot positively swear to him? A. I have known him many years; a flannel jacket is a common dress for a <rs id="t18290409-126-deflabel721" type="occupation">bricklayers' labourer</rs>

                  </hi>. I am a tanner. The prisoner came to my place previous to September last, add saw my servant—I was out of town—he came again when I returned from the country, and on one occasion I saw him—I had known him many years—he used to live at Osborne's Commission-stable, in Gray's Inn-lane—he was ostler there—I wanted to dispose of my horse—two or three weeks before the 18th of September he came, and said he understood I had a horse I Wished to dispose of, and if I would allow him to show it he would bring me a customer—he rode a horse there, which he said was his—he left that, and took away mine—he was absent about two or three hours—he then brought it back, and said he could not see the gentleman, and took away his own horse—he came again some days after<lb></lb>wards on another horse, which he said was his own—he left that, and took away my horse to show the gentleman—he brought it back in a few hours, and took away the one he had ridden—on the 18th of September he came again, and said he knew a wood-merchant at Deptford who wanted a horse,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184005110144"></xptr>
               <p>and he would bring it back in two hours—I let him have it, not to sell it, only to show it—I made no bargain, but if he had brought me a good cus<lb></lb>tomer I should have compensated him—he never returned—he promised to bring it back in an hour and a half or two hours—I became uneasy about it, and sent my servant to look for it—I have never found it—I heard the prisoner say at Guildhall that he had sold it, but could not get the money—he said he sold it to a man named Maltby, I think, or Mialtby, and Goddard, I think—he named two—he did not tell me where they lived—it was a grey gelding.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Upcott. He sent me to the prisoner's place to look after the horse—I did not find it—I found the prisoner the second time I went—he said he supposed Me. Upcott was uneasy about the horse, but he had sold it, and was then going to the west<lb></lb>end to receive the money for it—I carried that mesage back—MR. Upcott did not seem very well satisfied with it—he wanted his horse or the money—the prisoner did not come, but wrote a letter to Mr. Upcott the same day, begging that he would not be uneasy about the horse; he was going into the country for a few days, and when he returned he would see more about it—I went several times afterwards, but never could find him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 6th of May I ap<lb></lb>prehended the prisoner, in a skittle-ground in Little Moorfields—he said he had sold the horse to two <hi rend="italic">chaunters</hi>, and had not received the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. Mr. Upcott applied to me to sell the horse; he first wanted 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., then 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., then 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he allowed me to take it away three or four times to show it, and once to trim him up and have him shod; I sold it, and he directly said he would not have it sold, but would have it back; I sold it to Maltby and Goddard, and when I applied to them for the money they only laughed at me; 1 intended to pay Mr. Upcott' for it, having some property in Hertfordshire, and as soon as I sold that I should pay him for it.</p>

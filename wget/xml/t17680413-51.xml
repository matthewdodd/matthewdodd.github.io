The buildings are mine; I had lost lead, I set a watch on Sunday se'nnight; I saw Rainfrow come down the area wall, which is ten feet high; I laid hold of him; he got away, and ran up North Audley-street; the mob seemed to take his part, but we took him in Mount-street, and carried him to the watch-house; when we came back, some of them said they saw the other prisoner in the inside of a room; I saw him come out of the cock-lost by a ladder, and then down stairs; he appeared to be drunk.</p>

            . I was set as a watch; I saw the two prisoners doubling up lead; I called up several times, but had no answer; at last one did call to us; when we went up they were gone; I went and laid hold of one of them in South Audley-street, we took him to the watch-house; I am sure he was one I saw doubling up the lead; when we came back again we saw the other prisoner, he pretended to be very drunk, lying all along upon some lead that was doubled up, but after some time he appeared to be sober.</p>

               <p>them together in 1860—I have seen Elizabeth Marsh to-day, and on two or three other occasions—in 1860 there was a disturbance between my father and mother and brother, and Elizabeth, my brother's wife, rela<lb></lb>tive to my brother's age—Elizabeth told my father and mother that they both ought to be ashamed of themselves for allowing them to cohabit together, when she found out my brother's age, he having previously given his age as 19, and stated that his father married before he was 19—she then left my brother in disgust—the prisoner then lived at 65, Vauxhall Bridge Road—at the end of November, 1861, his wife's clothes were taken to my sister's, Mrs. Cruikshank's, house, from 65, Vauxhall Bridge Road—Elizabeth had them from my sister—I saw Elizabeth twice after that; some two years afterwards at my father's house—she went to complain to my father and mother that they had sent my brother to assert his right as a husband to strip her of every shilling's worth of property, she having established herself in business as a milliner—after 1863 I used to see my brother frequently at 266, Euston Road—my father had taken the house for him, and erected a studio there—my father paid 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent for him, and my father had part of the house as a fried-fish shop—I believe I saw my brother in 1866 before he went to the Isle of Wight—I did not see Elizabeth in 1866—the prisoner used some<lb></lb>times to say he had seen Lizzie—I knew she was not dead—in 1866 I think the prisoner went to the Isle of Wight—the first time I saw him afterwards was at 435, Bethnal Green Road—that was in 1871—I saw him on another occasion at my mother's, and he asked me to go to 9, Belgrave Street, Euston Road, to ask for some negatives, and to ask for Mrs. Turnbull—not knowing whether it was another Mrs. Turnbull or anybody else, I asked for Mrs. Turnbull, and saw a child about 16 years old—he told me when I took him the negatives, that he had brought that little thing away from Birkenhead, where he had been employed by Mr. Lancaster at five guineas a week, and had decoyed away the daughter—at this time he did not speak of Elizabeth as he used to—I knew she was alive—she used frequently to go down and see mother and father—I do not know whether the prisoner met her after 1866.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 22, King Street, and am a seaman and rigger—I do not know Hutchinson, no further than doing a job for him—I have known Dowling about eight or nine years—on a Friday in February I saw Hutchinson and Dowling going in the dock, between 12 and 1 o'clock—they called me on board the <hi rend="italic">Corfu;</hi> both of them called me—they went on board and I went after them, and another man came after me, Wilson—when I got on board I saw a quantity of empty sacks lying on the deck, and a quantity of small rope shakings in the sail compartment, and they told me to commence to fill the bags with these shakings—they were about four bushel bags—we filled two and a half with shakings that were there, and then we went into the cooking department, and Dowling fetched a lot of new rope and filled the remainder of the third sack with that—it was four-stranded lanyard rope, what they set the rigging up with—they all helped to fill up the bags, Hutchinson, Dowling, and Wilson—when they were filled I carried one, Wilson another, and Dowling the other—we went right through the gate to Mr. Dowling's house—Hutchinson was left on board—we left the sacks in Dowling's house and came back again to the ship with a bigger sack, like a sailor's bed-tick; we got that from Dowling's house—we took that on board and filled it with new rope—there was a coil of rattlin line, about a 1/2 cwt. of new rope which had never been opened, and about fifteen fathoms of Manilla three-inch rope—Hutchinson helped with Dowling to put the rattlin line in the bag—there was about 19lbs. or 20lbs. of lanyard rope besides put in the same sack; it was filled, and we took it out at the gate to Dowling's house and left it there—Dowling and Wilson went with us—Wilson carried the sack outside the gate, and then I gave him a spell to the house—Dowling gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for my trouble, and his wife gave me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get a half-pint of beer—we afterwards went on board again to ask the ship-keeper for allowance, and he gave us 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. between us—it is a regular thing to ask for a drop of allowance when you are carrying a heavy job—altogether about 2 1/2 cwt. or 2 3/4 cwt. of rope was taken out of the ship on the Friday—I saw Humphreys on board; be went aboard before I did.</p>

               <p>while they were packing the first two sacks, I could not tell exactly where—he was somewhere about the house of the ship; he came and looked at us now and then, and then he would go away again about the ship—Humphreys went ashore when we filled the first sack—I thought this was all fair and square, as Dowling was a man that had been in the dock many years, buying rope, and I never saw any harm of him—you cannot get out of the dock without passing through a gate—an officer is supposed to be at the gate, to see everything that comes in and out—I did not see one on this occasion—I have known the docks from my childhood—I was first spoken to about this case on the 23rd—the head-constable of the docks came to mo where I was at work, and said Mr. Ross wanted to see me on the Wednesday.</p>

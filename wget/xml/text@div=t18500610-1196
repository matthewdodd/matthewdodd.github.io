                  </hi>. I am a corporal in the Artillery at Woolwich. On 2nd May, I had two sovereigns, two half-crowns, twelve shillings, and a sixpence in a purse in my box at No. 116 barrack-room—the box was locked—I put it under the bed, and put the key in the fold of the blanket—I went on duty</p>

               <p>at a quarter-past eight o'clock—I came back at a quarter before twelve—the prisoner bad charge of the barrack-room—I left him there when I went on duty; when I came back, he was absent—I went to my box, and the purse and money were gone—the prisoner continued absent till 8th May—he was taken before the officers—I was there—he said he would speak the truth, he had taken the money to the amount of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—no one said it would be better for him to tell, he was merely asked if he knew anything about it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 310). I received charge of the prisoner at the station—he said he took the money, and on going to the lock-up place, he said he took the money from the box—I asked what he had done with it—he said he spent it at Greenwich.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> A friend came to see me, who enticed me to go out to drink; I got too much, and absented myself for six days; I then gave myself up to the sergeant of the guard; the sergeant-major came to me, and asked if I had spent all the money; I said, "What money?" he said, "You will be made to know," and the next day I was ordered before the Colonel, who asked me if I would be tried by a Court-martial for selling my regi<lb></lb>mental boots, and the next day I was called and asked if I knew anything about Corporal Laing's money; I told him I did take it, but I solemaly declare I know nothing about it; I did not know what I was doing or saying, for I was not in my reason, being afraid of being flogged; I thought it better to throw myself on the civil Court, and should I be so fortunate as to be acquitted, I intend, by God's assistance, to. be a good soldier, and not swerve from the duties of my calling. <hi rend="smallCaps">

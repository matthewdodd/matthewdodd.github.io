                  </hi>. I am the manager of the Capital and Counties Bank, Ludgate Hill—on 17th December the prisoner applied to open an account, promising to deposit between 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I consented—he said he had been paid 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a customer on his way, and he would pay that in, and go home and fetch the money that he had there—he paid in 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he signed our book in the usual way, and he had a small cheque-book with 30 cheques in it—he did not pay in the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he promised; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the paying-in slip-book; the figures on it are not mine—I do not recognise them, nor are they like the prisoner's—the prosecutors have not had possession of this book since the prisoner took it away—I next saw the prisoner on 10th January, when the balance was only 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the cheque for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid through the clearing house on the 13th, leaving a balance of 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on that day the prisoner came for a fresh book—on the 10th I told him, partly on account of his having failed to pay in the money he promised, and partly on account of cheques being returned dishonoured, I had decided to close his account—I also asked him to give me all the blank cheques in his possession—he said he had none, as he had used them—I then took him to the cashier, and repeated the state<lb></lb>ment to him—the cashier said his statement appeared to be true—he then said he had one cheque for a small amount—I said "Then you can pay in the difference to meet that cheque, and that will close it"—he said he would do so—on the 12th he appears to have paid in 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—On that morning his balance was 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid out—no money was paid in on that day—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cheque-book which was issued to the prisoner; one counterfoil, dated the 10th, has 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on it, another, dated 12th January, 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. counterfoil is numbered E 4795—the next number is E 4796—it was presented to our bank in favour of G.

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. George Allison, of 17 in the Meat Market—on Saturday, 10th January, the prisoner came to our shop between 1 and 2 o'clock, with a man named Robinson—I did not know them—the prisoner asked if we had any borsch tubs—that is a substitute for butter packed in tubs—I showed him some, the market price of which was as per cwt.—he asked how many we had—I said we had 11 and could only spare 10 of them—he agreed to the price—it would come to 10 guineas—he asked me for the bill—he then wrote this cheque in my presence for 10 guineas—I took it to Mr. Allison and let the goods go by the carrier Orchard—we have no more to do after we see the goods delivered to the carrier—the cheque was paid in on the Monday—I have nothing to do with the cash—I next see the prisoner on Tuesday, the 13th, with Robinson—he asked me if we had any more bosch tubs left—I said I had not, but I had something that would suit him as well in the shape of six boxes of the same article—he chose the lot—he also chose some American cheese at 70<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt, and five sides of bacon at 74<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt, total 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and including the Saturday's goods 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I made out a bill and he wrote out a cheque for 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the clerk referred to Mr. Allison—Mr.' Allison hesitated—the prisoner said "Well, Mr. Allison, you had a cheque of mine on Saturday, and you have had one or two before," and he referred Mr. Allison to Messrs. Towers and Cheshire, in the market—I went away and inquired and came back and told Mr. Allison about the reference—then the cheque was taken and the goods were taken away—we took possession of some of the goods and some were returned from Kennington Lane Police-station.</p>

George Allison. I carry on business in the Market—I had no trans<lb></lb>action with the prisoner prior to 24th December, when ho bought some salt pork amounting to between 21. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the cheque that wag then paid me for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mr. Catt handed me this cheque on 10th for 10 guineas—I did not see the prisoner then—I paid the cheque into the Capital and Counties Bank, Ludgate Hill branch—I saw the prisoner on the 13th—the cheque came back to me later that day, marked "Refer to drawer"—the prisoner that day offered me a cheque for 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "I have already received a cheque from you for 10 guineas I want a reference for this"—he said "It will be all right"—I said "You are not personally known to me"—he said "I can give you any amount of references"—I said "Who are they?"—he said "Gurrier knows me," that is a salesman, "and Messrs. Tower and Cheshire"—I said "Well, I should like to know something about you"—I then sent Catt to Tower and Cheshire's—he came back and said they had had one or two small cheques—I said "I will take it this time, but I don't care about it"—he said "Oh, it is all right"—afterwards the two cheques came back together—I went over to the prisoner's place, at 117, Lower Marsh—it is a small cupboard of a shop—I waited two and a quarter hours—I then went to the Capital and Counties Bank and got a report from the manager—then I went and saw Orchard the carrier to know where he had taken my goods to—I then took Orchard's horse and cart with my two men and went to a little dairy in Sussex Street, Limehouse—I found nothing in the shop—in the back kitchen I found the bacon, the cheeses, and the boxes of butteries; the whole of the goods represented by the 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque with the exception of one gammon of bacon—it was about 4 p.m on Tuesday, the 14th—I saw the prisoner in the shop—we put the goods in Orchard's cart and took them away—I did not see the tubs of bosch—they were afterwards given me by the police.</p>

I have been credited with this cheque, E 4794, for 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the other goods were to be sent and not parted with without a cheque—I authorised the London and Westminster Bank to guarantee this other cheque, which was presented on Wednesday, the 14th—I never; got the money for it—on Wednesday, the 14th, I got back part of my goods from the Lower Marsh—Mr. Warner, my foreman, will ten you mare about it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant L</hi>). I got a warrant about 12 o'clock on 12th January—I apprehended Jackson in Lower Marsh, Lambeth, on the same day about 130 yards from No. 117—I told him the charge was for obtaining goods by false pretences from Mr. Crump, and another charge I had better not mention—he said it was merely a business transaction—I searched him and found on him this great quantity of papers produced (<hi rend="italic">These were writs, letter complaining of disfionoured cheques, &amp;c., and bills of exchange</hi>), this cheque-book and paying in slip-book—the last cheque drawn is 12th January—that amount of cheques drawn for which counterfoils appear is 327<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and the amount paid in from the paying in slip book 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to the prisoner's other place of business at Limehouse, and seized 15 cheeses and 15 tubs of butterine and a quantity of other goods relating to another charge—it has been identified by Mr. Allison, Mr. Crump, and Mr. Shrimp<lb></lb>ton as goods delivered to Jackson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I laid a portion of the information—I do not know that Mr. Shrimpton has received back five pieces of bacon more than they delivered—I know some of the actions have not been settled—if my duties had allowed me I would have preferred another charge, but three can only be taken—the tubs were oval and of wood, and one firkin was round.</p>

I now produce the daily balances as taken from the prisoner's books, also his pass book, which represents truly the cheques which have been paid—these slips have been torn from toe paying in slip book, and are vouched by the cheques—the daily balances are: December 19th, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 20th, 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 22nd, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d;</hi> 23rd, 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 24th, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 27th, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 29th, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d;</hi> 30th, 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 31st, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; January 1st, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; then no operations on the</p>

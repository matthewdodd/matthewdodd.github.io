            . I am clerk to Messrs. Longman and Co. Todd's Johnson was under my care, at the warehouse in Shoemaker-row. I took stock in June, 1819; there was no deficiency then.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what took place, was the stock of Johnson, and Robinson's Scripture Characters, taken in October - A. Yes; I then missed twenty complete copies of Todd's Johnson, with portraits and titles - fifteen copies complete, but wanting the portraits; and five more copies, wanting seven numbers and the portrait. There were two of Part II. and five of Part XI. wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. What was wanted of Robinson's Scripture Characters - A. Twelve copies complete, and four volumes unbound. It is my business to issue orders for the delivery of them. I had given orders for twenty-five of Parts VIII., X., and XI. - that was all; no order was given for any perfect copy. I gave no order for the delivery of Robinson's Scripture Characters.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the copies which the house deliver - A. Particularly; none were delivered without the particular portrait engraved by Holl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany 
               <persName id="t18191201-126-person1340">Harrison</persName>
             any where - A. Yes, on the 23d of October we went to Brooks's house; he was not at home - he came home while we there. Harrison, the officer, asked him where he obtained the copies of Johnson which he had been selling? he said he had them from a respectable tradesman, and then said he had them from a respectable housekeeper - that did not satisfy the officer; he then said from Longman and Co. The officer told him the felony rested on his shoulder until he could remove it, for these gentlemen (pointing to me and Bamfield), come from Messrs. Longman's. He hesitated, and then said he had them from Mr. Broom, who kept the Goat's Head, in Cloth-fair. The officer said he must do his duty, and examine for the property. In the mean time I told Brooks I conceived he must be only the agent, and Broom the middle-man, and that I should be obliged if he would give me further information, and point out the person who stole the property. I said I considered he had been made a tool of. He said,</p>
               <p>"You know as well as I do." I said I should be sorry to name any person on suspicion, but I should be glad if he would name the party; he said, your own man did it. I said, do you mean

            ? he said, Yes, I do. I pressed him for further information, and he said Harrison was in it. Harrison, the prisoner, was not present. I and Harrison, the Marshal's man, then took him to the Goat; on arriving at the corner of Long-lane, we remembered that we could not identify Broom, and went back for Brooks to identify him; I saw Stewart, who had been our porter, coming out of Broom's door; I took hold of him by the elbow, and said,</p>
               <p>"William, have you been taking a glass of beer?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have been waiting at home, expecting you." We took him into the house with Brooks, and there found the prisoners Harrison and Broom; the Marshal's man put them all into the bar, and said he had called in consequence of their selling Johnson's dictionary - Harrison and Broom said they knew nothing about it. Harrison requested to go home to make some arrangements, I and Forrester accompanied him; we found some of our property there. We took him to Giltspur-street Compter.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You told Brooks you considered him as an agent - A. I did; I considered him tool at that time. I believe he was employed in the sale and purchase of books in trifling way. Broom has dealt in books many years.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. What you mean by a tool is, that he was not employed in stealing the books, but in selling them - A. I did; I never saw Broom at our premises.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 19th of June you state every thing was safe - A. At Midsummer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that none of the publication had been circulated in the legitimate course of trade, before you missed these - A. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there one hundred copies circulated in the world - A. Possibly there might. I will not swear there was or was not three hundred. I do not think there was - there might he two hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. You believed Brooks could not have stolen them, but received them from other person - A. I did. Stewart had been discharged a few weeks previous to this.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not dismissed for roguery - A. I cannot say that; he was dismissed under unpleasant suspicions. He was examined before the Justice when the prisoners were committed. He was once charged with taking a book up and putting it down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was it not stated to the Lord Mayor that Stewart had stolen one book - A. I said so - that was overlooked.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he charged in this felony with the other prisoners - A. He was, but not indicted. He helped to cart this particular work to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the entry under your care - A. No, under the care of Bartrum.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself examine the stock, and miss the copies - A. I did not. I checked the stock book, examined the papers of the stock, and found them right - I did not count the books. On the 22d or 23d of October the stock was taken by Whitthorne.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010064"></xptr>MR. BOLLAND. Q. In June you issued orders for certain books, but for no perfect copies - A. Yes. The Lord Mayor discharged Stewart. The warehouse is merely a depot for works, which we send for when we want them. Sometimes we send there twice a day, and not again, possibly, for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the stock was taken in June, were you present - A. No; I received the report from Whitthorne. I was not present in October neither. I have taken stock myself within this few days, to ascertain if his account in October was correct, and found it was so. I found two parts less missing than he stated.</p>

            . I am a warehouseman to the prosecutor. In June last I took the stock at the warehouse, in Shoemaker-row; Todd's Johnson was packed in a part of the warehouse by itself - it was all correct. What had been issued was marked off from a former account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in October observe any thing about the warehouse - A. On Saturday, the 23d of October, I went and found the door left open - it should have been shut. There was a bundle, containing two copies of the dictionary just inside the door, down stairs - it ought to have been up stairs. I took stock that day, and missed some. I took stock again on Monday morning, the 25th, particularly, and missed twenty complete copies with the title page and portrait, ready to be bound, fifteen copies wanting the portrait, and five other copies wanting eight odd parts.</p>
               <p>Q. How were Robinson's Scripture Characters - A. Twelve complete sets were gone. Mr. Huntsman always made out delivery orders - there had been no order for a complete copy of that work between October and June. None were taken out to my knowledge in that interval.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You speak of some account by which you take stock - A. The account agrees with what had been delivered; no work can be delivered out of the warehouse without an order. Huntsman had access to the warehouse - Stewart had an opportunity of stealing the books if he liked, he could get the key. He was taken before the Lord Mayor with the prisoners, and was discharged - he is not here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do one or two persons take stock - A. A person writes down, while I count how many remaining copies there are, then we check it with the former account, and see if it agrees with those which are marked of.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Castle-street, Leicester-fields - I know Brooks. On the 31st of May he came to my house, and on or about the 10th of July, the 12th, 16th and the 31st of August or the 1st of September, and the 22d or 23d of September. On the 31st of August or the 1st of September, I bought two copies of Todd's Johnson of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy the copy you have to produce - A. I really do not know, for we buy them very often in sheets. I bought eight copies of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you buy of him on the 31st of August or the 1st of September - A. Two copies - I have known him three or four years as a dealer in books. The first copy he brought was in eleven parts, and the remainder in quires unfolded - one copy had no portrait, and he procured one to suit it. The others I believe were perfect.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the copy that he brought a portrait to - A. I sent it to Miller's to be bound - he bound it and returned it. I delivered that copy to Bamfield on his coming to my house - he bought it of me. I gave Brooks 6 l. 15 s. for the first copy - I paid him 10 l. for two copies on the 1st of September. The average price of the whole was five guineas and a half, in ready money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you not think that a fair price - A. I certainly did. Brooks dealt in books.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he like yourself and other tradesman, likely to buy them fairly from persons who brought them as shareholders - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. We are told that two hundred copies had been issued before the loss; had you seen several about in the trade - A. Yes, it was nothing uncommon to see them. I received them in sheets, and that is the regular way in which they were sold. Shareholders have been in the shop at the time the books were sold by Brooks, and to whom I mentioned the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. One copy had no portrait. I presume the portraits are delivered loose, and not pasted in - A. No, they are stuck in the sheets. Books are very commonly delivered imperfect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You cannot say on which of the days you mentioned you bought this copy of him - A. It must have been either in July or September. I did not know 7 l. 8 s. 6 d. was the return the prosecutors made for the copies.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAED. Q. Is it probable that a new work may be delivered without the portrait - A. It was as likely as any other work; I would not buy it without the portrait. I afterwards found a duplicate portrait in another book. The shareholders knew I gave five guineas and a half for it. Mr. Read. of Charing-cross, was one.</p>

             re-examined. I saw Harrison take the memorandum from Brooks's pocket, in consequence of which I found out several of the parties the books were sold to.</p>
               <p>BROOKS'S Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury. About the latter end of July I called at Broom's on business, he being a general dealer in books; he wished me to sell ten copies of Todd's Johnson for him, as I had a more extensive connexion than he had; he charged 5 l. and all that I could obtain more I was to have - I sold them in about a month. He said his friend had more, which must be either sold or pledged, as his friend wanted money to go into the country - I sold about twenty-five copies in all. Carlisle bought four copies, for which I took his note. Now was it likely that if a man had participated in the robbery he would have taken a bill with the articles mentioned in the body of it. I am well aware that there is no certainty where a bill gets, and it might get into the hands of Messrs. Longman. It has been stated that I sold them so low that I could not have honestly obtained them. It is a fair inferrence that if I can buy Rees's Encyclopedia at 9 s. 6 d. a part, which is published at one guinea, that this work should also sell low. I did not hesitate to give up the party I received them of. I always thought Broom a respectable man.</p>

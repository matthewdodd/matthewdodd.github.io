            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty in Upper George-street, about two o'clock in the morning, on the 10th of April - I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner standing together; the prosecutor was drunk - the prisoner was in the act of putting his own hat on the prosecutor's head - I asked him what he was doing with the drunken man, and if he knew him; he said No, but that he saw him on the pavement, lifted him up, and he had put his own hat on him out of kindness - the prosecutor charged him with having taken his hat; one of my comrades came up - I left the prosecutor with him; the prisoner said if I would walk a little way he would give me the hat and tea - we walked on; he met a woman - he said to her "You must give up those things; the Policeman is very civil but he will not be done" - we then went down a mews, and found the hat behind some dung; the woman gave me the tea out of her bosom - I took them both to the station-house; the prisoner said she was his wife, and stated where they lived - the woman pointed the hat out; here is the hat and tea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw a man laying on the pavement, quite intoxicated - a woman came up and said he was her husband; she took his hat up, and went away with it - I told the Policeman that a woman described herself as his wife, and I told him the way she went; we went and found her, and she gave up the hat - the man was drunk, and did not know who took it; I never saw the woman before - I never called her my wife.</p>

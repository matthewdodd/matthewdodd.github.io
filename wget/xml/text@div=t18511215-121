                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Fighting Cock, St. John-street, in the parish of Bethnal-green. Last Sunday morning 30th Nov. I went to bed about a quarter to one o'clock, the house was then secure—I was awoke about three, by a policeman, went down-stairs as quick as possible, and found the back-door leading to the yard, open, and the hinges wrenched from it—I cannot say whether the door was exactly off, but violence had been used—it was secure when I went to bed—I had noticed it particularly, because the house had been broken into the night before, and I had had extra bolts put on—there is a window in the yard, looking into the kitchen, a pane of glass had been taken out from there, close to the safe, which adjoined the window—I had seen that about 8 or 9 the night before—I had a piece of pork weighing about 5lbs. and three small pictures in the safe—the door was fastened, not locked—to open it a person must have come inside—the pork and three pictures were not there at 3, but Greathead showed them to me, asked me if they were my property, and I recognised them as having been taken—I have been shown where the prisoner lives, it is not far from my place.</p>

On Sunday morning, 30th Nov., about 2 o'clock, I was on duty in a court near the yard of the Fighting Cock, and heard some one running across the yard—I could not exactly tell whether it was one or two persons—I waited a minuet or so, and then looked over the paling surrounding the yard, which is about five feet six inches high, and saw two men lying underneath the outer paling, about ten yards from the house—they were crouching down, and I said, "What, are you here again to-night?"—I had heard of something of the kind before—they then got up and ran away—I was getting over the fence to pursue them, and it broke down and I fell—when I got up, they were about ten yards off, getting over another fence, and they ran towards Three Colt-corner, which is at the corner of St. John-street—I sprang my rattle, pursued them, and when I got to Hare-street, the prisoner was in the custody of Blake—I had lost sight of the two men—it did not take me half a minute from the time I passed</p>

I was on duty in Bethnal-green, and about 2 o'clock I heard the springing of a rattle, and a cry of "Stop thief!"—I was then at the corner of Abbey-street, at the end of which Hare-street runs—I went towards Three Colt-corner, in which direction I had heard the sound; and as I was going I met the prisoner run<lb></lb>ning fast towards me—he was alone—I stopped him, and asked what he was running for; he said "For nothing"—his hand was behind him, and I asked what he had got there; he said he had nothing—that did not satisfy me, I looked and found a brass poker in his band—I told him I should make some inquiry, and took him into custody—upon that he called out, "Father!" and two men and some women came out of a house close by—Greathead came up immediately, and we both took him to the station, the prisoner was then discharged, I was not aware any robbery had been committed—I then went to the back of the prosecutor's premises, and found a piece of pork outside the window-cill, where the square of glass had been taken from—the pic<lb></lb>tures were in the yard.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 16). On 30th Nov., about 3 o'clock in the morning, I received information, and went to the prosecutor's house—I examined the back-door, and found several marks on it, which had been made with some blunt instrument—between 4 and 5 I went to the prisoner's house, which is forty-six yards from the railing at the back of the prosecutor's house; I have measured it—if a person wanted to go from the fence to where the prisoner lives, he would go across Three Colt-corner, and then come round into Hare-street—the place where the prisoner was taken has been pointed out to me; a person would have to pass that spot—I went to the prisoner's house, and found him lying on a bed with all his clothes on except a coat and hat—it was then between half-past 4 and 5—I cannot say the time exactly, as I was delayed at the prosecutor's examining the place—I knocked at the door—his father answered it, and T said I wanted to see George—I went into the room, and said to him, "Put on your things, and-bring the same poker with you that you had before"—he pointed to the fire-place—I said, "Get them yourself"—he then got this standard and the poker, and said, "This (<hi rend="italic">the poker</hi>) is the one I was stopped with, and this (<hi rend="italic">the standard</hi>) is the one I threw down in the passage"—I took the poker and the standard as well to the prosecutor's premises, and compared the marks on the outer-door with these instruments—I found five or six marks which it fitted into exactly, be<lb></lb>tween the door and the door-post, and likewise the hinges outside the door where it had been placed in between the hinges and the door—the impression on the door corresponded with this in size and form—to the best of my opinion, the indentations I saw were done by this instrument, or another very similar to it—I examined some foot-prints from the back of the prisoner's house to the back of the prosecutor's—they had to go over about four different yards, I should say, where they had broken away the palings—I could not tell in which direction the foot-prints were, on account of its being a frosty night—it was only where the ground had broken that I could see the mark of a heel—the only thing that led me to think they went from the prosecutor's to the prisoner's was that there was a railing fresh broken at the end of the pri<lb></lb>soner's yard, and there was some fresh dirt upon it as if it had been grazed off the sole of the boot in getting over; had they been coming the other way, I think the dirt would have lodged on the other side—to the best of my belief, that railing had not been broken many hours—in the next yard there were railings quite recently broken, and the nail was forced out with the wood—I took the prisoner into custody about 5 on the Sunday morning—I searched him, and found 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Q.</hi> Was the standard loose generally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We generally use it to stir the fire; I recollect using it after 12 o'clock on that evening—it was the standard I handed him, he took the poker himself—he was by the fire-place then—my mother was in the back-yard then, and my father was in bed—I ran out into the back-yard with my brother—my sister-in-law was there, she does not live in the house; she lives up at the West-end; but it was very foggy, and mother persuaded her to stop all night, and she was undressing herself by the fire—she was to sleep with me, in the same room—all the rest of the family were in bed—my mother could not see the persons that came home with my brother—I did not see them—I did not go out, and they did not come in—the door was open when my brother came home the first time, and I let him in the second time—I do not know whether there were two, or three, except what my brother told me—I heard their voices, nothing more—I could not say by their voices who they were; I did not pay much attention—my brother was very seldom in the habit of being out at 2 o'clock in the morning—my mother had not gone out to the back-yard above a minute when I let my brother in; she could not have got further than the yard—she went to the back-door, and I let my brother in at the front-door—he said the second time, he brought the bird from his young woman's—when I saw the policeman with him it was two or three doors from father's house—my father picked up the standard, and put it into the fire-place, before he went out—I did not see him put it into the fire-place, but I saw him pick it up in the passage, and take it into the room—it was in the passage, close by the stairs—my mother was in the passage at the time he picked it up—he then put on his trowsers, and came to the street-door—when my brother cried, "Father, father!" I was in the passage against the street-door, and then my father came out at the street-door—he had his trowsers on then—he is a fender-maker—we are in the habit of being up late on Saturday evenings.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you afterwards hear the names of the young men who came home with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from my brother, at the police-court—when my father took the standard in his hand he was in his shirt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married to a son of Mrs. Cumming. I was there the night my brother-in-law was taken—I came there a little after 10 o'clock—he had just gone out—he came home about 2 o'clock—he brought two birds, but I think only one cage—he went out again, and came back in about twenty-five minutes, with another bird—ray sister-in-law opened the door to him—my mother-in-law had just gone into the water-closet: she had not been out many minutes before she hallooed out, "Bring me a candle! there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> thieves!"—the prisoner ran to the fire, and said, "Father, there is thieves!" and he took the poker, and said to his sister, "Give me the standard too"—she did so, and he went out, and came back, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the standard to father, who was in the passage—he went out at the front-door; turned back again, and the policeman took him—he went as far as Three Colt-corner—there is a low wall there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were not examined at the police-office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was not in the street to say that he went as far as Three Colt-corner—I was undressing myself by the fire, but I went to the door, and saw the policeman catch hold of him, and heard him halloo out—before that I do not know how far he had gone—when he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the standard down, he was just going into the passage—my father put it on to the fender; in <hi rend="italic">the flurry</hi>, I cannot say whether he fixed it, or put it down—he did not leave the house till he heard his son was taken; he then slipped on his trowsers and boots, and went out—the first time the prisoner came home my sister let him in, and the second time as well—I do not think he came into the room the first time; I think he gave the birds in at the door to his sister—I heard him knock at the door the first time; my sister answered the door, and I heard him speak—I think that was how it was—I did not go to the door, I was sitting by the fire—my mother did not go—I do not know in <hi rend="italic">my flurry</hi> that I heard a knock—I think I heard my sister say, "Don't be long, we want to go to bed," and he said, "I shall not be many minutes gone; I want to get the other bird"—I have no distinct recollection, except hearing my sister speak to him—she was at the street door when she spoke to him—she opened the door to him—she was sitting with us before that—I heard the voice of no one but my sister and brother, nor did I the second time—there is no knocker to the door; if he did knock it would be with his hand—I heard him knock the second time: my sister opened the door, and he came in—my mother was then in the yard—my brother went into the room where my father was sleeping, and put the bird on the table—I came from the West<lb></lb>end: my husband had sent me to take a job home; I intended to return that night—I had not seen my brother-in-law that night, till he came in with the bird the second time—my sister went out a little after 10 o'clock, after I came in—I supped with my father, sister, and mother; that was a little after 12, after my sister came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's father, and am a fender-maker, and have lived in Hare-street eleven years; my son lives with me; he is a blacksmith. Last Sunday fortnight I went to bed about half-past I o'clock, and went to sleep—my attention was afterwards called by my daughter, or daughter-in-law saying, "Father, father! there are thieves in the yard!"—I could not find my trowsers—I ran to the door, and found my wife, and my son and daughter in the yard—my son said, "I will get over the pales"—His mother said, "Don't, there's a dear"—my daughter said, "Depend upon it, they have gone round by Guflfer's"—my son <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the standard down, and said, "Father, you take that"—I picked it up, and put it by the fire<lb></lb>place; I put my trowsers on, and heard him say, "Father, they are going to</p>

               <p>take me to the station-house!"—I dressed myself, and went down to the station—the inspector said to the policeman, "Is this all you have got against him?" and dismissed the case; I was not called upon to explain; I came back with my son, and he was afterwards taken into custody—they came nod rapped at the shutters, and wanted to speak to him, and took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a machinist, of 2, William-street, Spicer-street, Bethnal-green. I know the Trafalgar beer-shop, Bethnal-green—I was there with the prisoner last Saturday fortnight at 10 minutes after 10 o'clock—I was with him till 5 minutes before 12—Chamberlain was with us as we left the Trafalgar—the prisoner was in other people's company at the Trafalgar, and I was sitting alongside of him—Chamberlain came into the tap-room a little before 12—we all three left together, and went to Mr. Westguard's, Church-row, Bethnal-green, where we remained till 2—the prisoner got a bird in a cage there—I and Chamberlain went with him to his own house, where he took it in—from there we went to Hunt-street to Mary Green, his young woman; he there got a bird and cage—I parted with him at my house, 2, William-street, which was on his way home, and Chamberlain lives next to me—he left him at the same time as I did—I saw Mary Green.</p>

               <p>not go up to the door with him; I stood a little way off—I do not know who let him in—I did not see him go inside, or see who took the bird—Mary Green's is about four minutes' walk from the Fighting Cock—we did not have to pass the Fighting Cock to go from his place to Mary Green's; it is to the left, and Hunt-street turns down to the right—my place is about three minutes' walk from Cummings's—it was about 20 minutes past 2 when I parted with him altogether—there was some beer in a pot at Westguard's, they offered it to me, and I drank it—the others bad some out of the same pot—I only saw one pot—we had nothing to eat.</p>

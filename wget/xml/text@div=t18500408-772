                  </hi>. I am a postmaster, of 24, Hart's-lane, Bethnal-green. On 25th July, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came and asked me for a horse and cart to go into the City for a couple of hours—he said that his name was Howell, and he came from Slater-street, facing the Three Compasses, Bethnal-green—I had never seen him before—I said if he came in half an hour it would be ready for him—he came in about a quarter of an hour, and I let him have a black gelding, with nose-bag and harness, a light chaise-cart with cushions, and a whip—he went in the cart with my servant to Mr. Howell's—I saw that name over the door—the prisoner said his name was Howard—I saw no more of him or them till three weeks ago, when he was taken, but not on this case—I found my horse at Eaton Bray.</p>

I drove the prisoner from my master's to Mr. Howell's—the prisoner jumped out of the cart there, and stood on the cellar-stairs six or seven minutes—then he came out again and stood on the step of the door, put his hand into his pocket, and said, "I have not got any halfpence, but I will give you some when I come back"—he said he was going to the City for two hours, on a little business—he gave his name Howell, a silk-dealer—I made no fresh bargain with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper and shoe-dealer, at Luton, in Bed-fordshire, thirty-two miles from London. On 26th July, about eight o'clock at night, I saw a horse and cart for sale in the Black Horse inn-yard, at Luton—there were ten or twelve people round it—the prisoner was lodging there—I purchased it, two days afterwards, of John Henry Clark, for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was not by them—I believe he was on the premises—I cannot say whether he was present when I tendered the money down—the horse was not cheap—it was broken-winded, both knees recently broken, and had one eye—it had hardly a piece of shoe upon its feet—I had met the prisoner two days before, and he told me there was a horse to be sold at the Black Horse, and asked if I was a buyer—after the sale, I spent 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in ale—the prisoner had part of it; and he, Clark, and the landlord, went away together—I had known the prisoner before, attending the markets at Dunstable, Hemel Hempstead, and Luton—I got a receipt from Clark—he is not here.</p>

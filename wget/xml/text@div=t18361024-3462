                  </hi>. I live with my father, in Clarence-street, Rother<lb></lb>hithe. On the evening of the 17th of September, the prisoner came to the shop for a twopenny loaf—he put his hand into his pocked and showed me half-a-sovereign—he said, "Oh I don't want change of that"—he put his hand into his other pocket, and took out three farthings—he said, "Oh, that won't do"—he then put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and took out half-a-crown, which I observed—he gave it to me, and know<lb></lb>ing it was a good one I put it into the bowl—he saw I was confused about the change, and said "Oh, I think I can give you halfpence"—I returned him the half-crown and he put it into his waistcoat pocket—he then took out another half-crown, and said, "Oh, you must give change"—the first was a new one, and the second and old one of George the Fourth—I took it up, and saw it was bad directly, it was so black, and felt so smooth—he immediately snatched it out of my hand and threw the bread down—I said, "You good-for-nothing man, you have given me a bad half-crown"—he ran up the street, and I after him—he got away, but I found him in custody in about twenty minutes—I am certain he is the man—he had a blank frock-coat on; but when he was taken he had neither coat nor hat on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clothes-dealer, and live in Clarence-street, Rotherhithe.

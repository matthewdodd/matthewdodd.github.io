            . I am a copper-plate-printer, in the employ of Mr. Newberry, whose office is in Stonecutter-street, Fleet-market; I lodge there. About the 10th of September, I was at the Key, in Fleet-market, and saw the prisoner, Powell, there; I never saw him before; he had an engraving tool on the table, I took it up - He asked me if I understood engraving - I told him I understood a little of it-but I was a printer; he said he had frequently little jobs of printing to do; I told him if he would bring them to Stonecutter-street, my master would do them for nothing, by way of giving him engraving for printing, if his engraving would suit; he asked me if I could not print on my own account - I told him I did not wish to act clandestinely, and wished him to bring them to Mr. Newberry's; he did not say what he wanted printed. On the 14th, I saw him there again-nothing particular passed. On the 17th, about half-past ten or eleven o'clock at night - I was in bed at Stonecutter-street - it was Wednesday night, there was a ring at the bell; I went down and found Powell at the door, he said he had got a job - He came in, produced paper, and a plate, and said he wanted to get them done the first thing in the morning; the paper was for me to print the notes - He said he wanted 150 of them by the morning. I took the paper and plate out of his hands, I looked at it, and said it was Malton Bank; he said he wanted to send them by the Mail in the evening, and asked me what time he should call for them in the morning, as he must have them by nine o'clock - I told him to make it nearer ten o'clock, as I could not get them done before; he said it would be a satisfaction to him if I wetted the paper before he went - I did so.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he wish you to do it without your master's knowledge - A. Yes; he asked me if I could not do it myself; I said I would not act clandestinely, and that it would be to his advantage to let Mr. Newberry know; the next day I took the plate to my master and told him of it; an officer was placed in the office. I went on with the job-Powell came while I was at work - I had done about 112 of them; he took some up, and said they would do very well, I told him I had done 112, he told me to make haste, as he had them to dry and send by the Mail; I printed about five more and the officer came in, took him, and the notes and plate from me, I went with the officer to the Maze in the Borough, to the Sun and Hat-block, and saw the prisoner, Storr, there.</p>
               <p>DANIEL TURNER. I am an officer. I was called to Mr. Newbery's on the 18th of September-Powell came in, looked at the notes, and said they would do. I took him into custody, and asked him who gave him any order to get the notes printed? he said he had an order from the agent of the Bank to get them printed. I asked him where the agent lived? he said at the Sun and Hat-block, in the Maze, and I had better go with him, as I should find him at home now. I took him before the magistrate. White and I went with him to the Maze. When we got there we received information. I went to the back-room; Hawkins and Reeve went in first, and began to search the prisoner, Storr, who was there. They asked him if he knew Powell? he said he did not, at first; he afterwards said he did knew him, as he had seen him the night before in Petticoat-lane. A pocket-book was found, with nine or ten notes in it. I have the plate which I took from the printing-press, and the notes.</p>
               <p>RICHARD REEVE. I am an officer. I went with Turner and White, to the Maze, and saw Storr there. I searched a trunk which was on the table, and found four guineas and six 1l. notes, all on different banks. One of them was on the Malton Bank-this was in a separate pocket from the others. I found some tracing-paper in the principal book. The notes are all genuine, and not payable in town.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHITE. I was with the officers, and took Storr into custody. I went with Powell-Powell said, "These men are come about the notes." Storr said that he knew nothing about them. I told him I must search him. I found a genuine Doncaster note in one of his pockets, and a Sheffield one. Hawkins found a bag in the trunk, which contained 4l. or 5l. in silver. He said he was with Storr in Petticoat-lane the night before - We went to Guildhall. Powell said he could bring a witness, who was present in Storr's room when he cut the plate. I told him that would serve him materially.</p>
               <p>PETER COWPEN. I live at the Sun and Hat-block, in the Maze. The prisoner, Storr, came to lodge with me in the name of William Henry, only - He lodged six or seven weeks with me, and went by that name. He always wore a brown coat, except for about a fortnight, when he went into the country, and returned in about three weeks, he then dressed like a sailor. I have seen Powell go to his room several times, both before and after he went intothe country.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. His wife came with him. He always went by the name of

               <p>MR. SAMUEL NEWBERY. I am a copper-plate printer, and have been so for seven years. Engravers use tracing-paper to get fac-similies. The tracing-paper produced has been used to engrave a plate-it has been traced from a genuine note; the words One Pound correspond exactly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290032"></xptr>On another part of the paper, there are the words Richard Dunn and Peas, which appear to have been traced from a genuine note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He might engrave from the genuine note, but it would destroy it.</p>
               <p>MR. ASHLEY. I am an engraver, and live in Lombard-street - I engrave the plates for the Malton Bank. I never gave the prisoners authority to engrave the plates - I never saw them before. Tracing-paper is used in engraving. It is very evident that the tracing has been done from the genuine note. I cannot say whether the engraving on the plate is done from the tracing-paper, or not.</p>

            , we keep the Malton Bank. We never authorized the prisoners to engrave for us.

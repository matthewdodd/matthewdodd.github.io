On the 13th of September, I lost this property, and several other things, out of two boxes in the back parlour, which is used as a bed-room; the door was broken open; they were safe the night before Watkins slept there: the staple of the padlock was drawn. I went to Bow-street, and upon returning, Watkins had come home and gave me a hat, which I took to the Marquis of Granby, public-house, in Chandos-street, and sent a man in with the hat. The prisoner, Brown, came out with a paper cap on; I told him I wanted him; he immediately ran out, and went a back way right through the house; I followed, but he outran me. I got a search-warrant, and went with Stevens to Dodd's room, and found a pair of sheets.</p>

On the night of the 12th of September I went out about half-past six o'clock, padlocked the door, and put the key in the usual place for Mrs. Mills. I returned about nine, and found the bed gone, two boxes broken open, and the sheets and a tin can gone. I found a man's hat on the head of the bedstead, and gave it to Mills.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 13th of September I went with a search warrant, and accompanied Mrs. Mills to No. 14 Vine-street, Lincoln's Inn, in consequence of information, and was directed to the front attic, and on the landing, near the door, I found a bed and one pair of sheets, and in the room another pair of sheets laying loose, not on the bed; Mills claimed them. On the 26th of October I apprehended Dodd in the same room; two women were with him; he sat by the fire holding the frying-pan. I spoke to the women, he immediately held his head down. I could not see his face for ten minutes, and as he would not turn it towards me, I touched him and said, "Dodd, I am come for you, I suppose you know what it is for," he said, "Yes; I intended giving myself up in a few days," and that he knew nothing of the robbery. I have the hat, bed, and sheets.</p>

            . I am an officer. Stevens shewed this hat to me. I know it to belong to Brown. I have seen it on his head several times at the Marquis of Granby; I am certain it is his by a round patch on it. I apprehended him on the 24th of October leaning against a post at the corner of the Seven-dials; I said "Jack, where have you been all this time;" he made some mumbling answer; I collared him, and found seven keys, a crow-bar, and knife in his pocket, and a bag in his hat; one is a padlock key, the others are common ones, but the ward of one is forced off.</p>

               <p>BROWN'S Defence. On the morning of the robbery I was in the Marquis of Granby, a man brought a hat in, and asked if any one owned it. I came out soon after and met Mills at the door; she said something about the hat, I walked away, but did not run. I returned in half an hour, went to my lodging and got my hat.</p>

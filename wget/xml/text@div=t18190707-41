            . On the 26th of June, about ten o'clock at night. I was very tired, having been a long journey. Being fatigued, I sat down in one of the alcoves on <placeName id="t18190707-41-crimeloc227">London-bridge</placeName>

            . On the 26th of June I was on London-bridge, waiting for my sister, who was coming from Croydon-market. I saw the prosecutor sitting in one of the alcoves fast asleep. I awoke him - he got up, but was so overcome with fatigue he could not stand. Suspecting his bundle would be taken, I sat down by him; the prisoner came by, gave me a nudge, and asked me if I belonged to that man? I said No. I went away a few yards, and found my sister - I told her I should watch a thief who was on the bridge. I had hardly spoken to her, before the prisoner came down with the prosecutor's bundle. My sister called Stop thief! and I ran after him down Billingsgate, caught him behind a watch-box with the bundle, and brought him away. When I got to the end of the street he got away - the watchman knocked him down; he got up and was secured, still having the bundle.</p>

            . I am a watchman. At half-past ten o'clock I heard the cry of Stop thief! the prisoner came to the corner of Philpot-lane with the bundle, I secured him. He said he took it out of a lark.</p>

             sworn. - I am a butcher; I live at Paddington, close to Mr. Brown's; on Wednesday, the 21st, the prisoner came to me about the middle of the day, and asked me to buy two beifers; he said they would not walk any further, and rather than take them back he would sell them; he had left them upon the waste ground in the Harrow road; he told me he had brought them from Penn, in Buckinghamshire; he said he had taken them to a gentleman who had bought them, and who would not have them; he took me to them; they were about half a mile from my house; the beifers were both black and white, I am not sure to the colour of them; he asked me nine guineas; but having some suspicion of him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180009"></xptr>I took him to a public-house, got a constable, and detained him; I delivered the heifers into the custody of Mr. Brown; he said that they could not walk; I found that they were not lame, they could walk, and that gave me a suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Ravenhall afterwards? - A. Yes; I delivered the heifers to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the heifers you delivered to Ravenhall were the same that the prisoner offered you for sale? - A. Yes, I am sure of it.</p>

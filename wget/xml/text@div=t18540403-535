                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. George Potter and another, lime merchants, at Purfleet-wharf, Earl-street, Blackfriars.

               <p>ran by me, the prisoner was by my side, and something was dropped like a sovereign—the prisoner picked it up—it sounded like a sovereign; I had not time to see what colour it was—the other man said, "That is that boy's sovereign"—the prisoner said to me, "Is it yours?"—I directly took my money out to count it, and the other man came and knocked my elbow, and all the money fell into the road—I picked up some, and the prisoner's com<lb></lb>panion came and assisted me to pick up some—he gave me two sovereigns and some of the silver—I thought that the money was all right with the two sovereigns that I had picked up, and I put it in my pocket—the pri<lb></lb>soner and his companion walked on to the corner of Charles-street, and I was informed they then ran—I did not see them run—I went on to the corner directly, but I could not see them—I thought the money was right, and I went on to the Strand—I there thought there might be something wrong, and I went into a jeweller's shop, Messrs. Vaughan's, and I showed Mr. Hitchcock the money—he told me there were two bad sovereigns, and he told me to go back to the bank, and tell them—I went back and told them—I then went home and gave Mr. Potter all the money, the good and the bad—he gave me the whole of it back the next morning—I kept it in my possession for about a fortnight, and then Mr. Potter said he thought we should hear no more of it, and I gave it him back again—I do not know that there was any mark put on it at any time.</p>

I took out my money to count it—the prisoner was standing close by my side, and the other man knocked my arm, and then the money was taken up and given me—I had not seen either of the men before.</p>

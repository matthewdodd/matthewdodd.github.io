                  </hi>. I live at No. 6, Smith's Place, Devonshire Street, Ken<lb></lb>nington, and am a labourer. The prisoner keeps pigeons, and on Sunday night he knocked one down with a prop, about half past 8 o'clock, and threw it into the pigeon house—his mother came into ray room crying—I married her daughter, and am the prisoner's brother-in-law—I went out to the prisoner, and did rather more than I ought to do; he was on a ladder, swinging by a rope, and I pulled the ladder from underneath him, and pulled him down on his back—he was from three to four feet from the ground, and as he laid on his back I struck him several times, and walked in doors—he said nothing to me then, but afterwards called me very bad names—he remained in the yard, and dared me to come out again; I went out, struck him, and either made his nose bleed or cut his lip, the blood was running from him, and as I turned round to go in again, he stabbed me on the left side, under the arm—I got a neighbour to take me to a doctor, who strapped it up, and persuaded me to go to Guy's Hospital directly, where I remained a month within three days—I lost much blood.</p>

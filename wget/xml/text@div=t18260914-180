            . I was in Jermyn-street on the 12th of July, a few minutes before ten o'clock; I saw the prisoner take two spoons out of her apron, and offer them to a costermonger, who goes round with a cart; and he gave her a measure full of beans, which he emptied into her apron: I supposed they were silver, and I crossed over to her - I said to the man "What has she given you?" - he said, "These two spoons;" I told him to give her the spoons back, and take his beans, as I was going to take her into custody; I found the remainder of the spoons in her apron; I took her to the watch-house, and found the duplicate of this coat on her; she said she had the spoons of her husband, who was a waiter - but I find she has no husband.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. This coat was pawned with me on the 11th of July, by the prisoner, to the best of my recollection, about half-past eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man, who appeared rather distressed in his mind, accosted me, and said, "You seem poor like myself - if you will go and pawn this coat for me, I will give you something;" I went and pawned it; he gave me the duplicate, and I was to see him the next day, which I did; he gave me these spoons to sell, and said I should have seven of them for myself if I sold twelve of them; I went and got some beans for two of them.</p>

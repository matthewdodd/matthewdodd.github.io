            . On the third of this month about seven o'clock in the evening I went out , and my servant brought me notice that a gentleman wanted to buy some goods of me; when I came in the Prisoner said, Sir, Do you know me? I said I did not remember him; said he, I have been your customer before, and have sold you some dollars a while ago [but I cannot remember it;] and he said he had since that belonged to the Prince Frederick privateer, Capt. Talbot commander, that his name was Masterson, and he was chief mate of the Prince Frederick privateer. I asked him what goods he wanted; he said he should want some watches, some buckles, some gold rings, gold buttons, &amp;c. and desired to have the strongest I had in my shop. Accordingly while he was in the shop there was one pair of silver buckles looked out, four silver watches in double cases, and two pair of gold buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing more laid out?</p>
               <p>Threlkeld. Not while he was in the shop, but the knee-buckles were to be looked out to the shoes, and some plain gold rings; then this note was produced. I asked him what it was for; he said it was for my security. I looked at the note, and thought it to be a pretty good one, I did not question it in the least. The note was signed by Capt. Talbot. [The note was produced.]</p>
               <p>This is the note the Prisoner at the bar gave me, and left with me as a security for the goods he was to have that night: then he said he was going to the Hermitage, and would be back again in an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174510160009"></xptr> hour's time. I thought after he was gone if this was a false note it would be a great loss; and I went to a house in the neighbourhood where some gentlemen were, and shewed it to them: they advised me not to deliver the goods, but to bring the person there, and they would talk to him. He came some time afterwards, and some of the gentlemen talked to him, and asked him what post he was in; he said he was first mate of the Prince Frederick privateer , that his name was Masterson, and Capt. Talbot was his commander; but as fortune would have it, there happened to be four gentlemen there who knew him; and the landlord said there were some gentlemen in the house who belonged to the ship, and should know him if he belonged to that ship; and one Mr. McNamar, who came over as a passenger, said he was a villain, for he never was on board the ship; then the Prisoner was for going out, and he did go out, and the landlord of the house brought him back again, and I charged an officer with him, and carried him to the Counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went into the shop, I asked him whether he would accept of that note as a security for goods; I mentioned no quantity or kind of goods. Mr. Threlkeld produced only one pair of buckles, and asked whether those were large enough. There is his apprentice, I desi re he may be sworn, to know whether there were any watches or rings produced, or any thing else.</p>

               <p>Chariot. He mentioned rings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Upon your oath I ask you, whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174510160010"></xptr> your master asked me about any sort of goods? did not he ask me about watches? how did I know he was a watchmaker? I saw no goods but one pair of silver buckles.</p>
               <p>Chariot. There were some watches shewed to you.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner say when he came into the shop ?</p>
               <p>Chariot. The shop was shut, and my master was not at home.

               <p>Q. Did I say my name was Masterson?</p>
               <p>Chariot. Yes; you did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . Did your master deliver me any kind of goods?</p>
               <p>Chariot. Yes; buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deliver them?</p>
               <p>Chariot. He shewed them to you.</p>
               <p>Q. How many?</p>
               <p>Chariot. One pair.</p>

I am a nurse in the service of Mr. Buller, of Par-sonage-road, Enfield, and was so in June and July last—I know the prisoner, and knew the deceased John Cock, he was Mr. Buller's footman—I saw the prisoner at Mr. Buller's, on Sunday, 1st July—about three in the afternoon I was up-stairs preparing for Church—the deceased came up and asked me to come down and see his baby—I said I would come down when I was ready for Church—I went down in about five minutes, and went into the kitchen-there was no one there—I then passed through the kitchen to the pantry door—the pantry adjoins the kitchen—I there saw the deceased lying on his back, with his feet in the kitchen and his body in the pantry—the prisoner was standing by his right side, close to him, more towards his head than his feet, and she had the child on her left hip with her arm round it—through the door where the deceased lay on the left, there was a dresser, and immediately on his right there was a sink—the prisoner was between him and the sink, with her back to the sink and her face towards him—I heard no cry or excla<lb></lb>mation before I went down—nothing had attracted my attention—I had tocóme some distance from my room, along a passage and down a flight of stairs—any one in the pantry might have called out without my hearing it in my room—the deceased appeared dead when I first went to him—as I approached the pantry door the prisoner asked me to go and fetch a doctor—I immediately ran to the bottom of the stairs and called the cook, who was up-stairs dressing for Church—I directly returned to the pantry and said, "Perhaps he is only faint, there is no occasion to fetch a doctor"—she said, "For God's sake fetch a doctor; see what I have done," pointing to the body at the same time—» then looked at the man and saw blood on the top of the left waistcoat-pocket—I had not seen that before—I did not touch him—he had no coat on—then went to a neighbour and requested him to go for a surgeon immediately—I did not see the cook come down—I had then gone out for the doctor—had</p>

                  </hi>. The deceased was in my service about two years, at Enfield—I have known him about twenty years—I procured him a former situation with Mr. Twopenny, the conveyancer, in the Temple—I have reason to know that he was a man of religious feeling and principle—I was out of town when this occurrence took place: I think I went on the Fri<lb></lb>day or Saturday previous—he appeared then to be in his usual health and spirits—I had seen his wife on several occasions, and, from certain reasons, I forbade her coming to my house—I prepared this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I believe it is correct in its measurement, according to a scale at the bottom—on the left-hand</p>

                  </hi>. I was cook in the service of Mr. Buller, and had been so six weeks when this matter occurred—during that time, previous to the Sun<lb></lb>day, I had seen the prisoner there once—on Sunday, 1st July, I was dining in the kitchen with the deceased and the coachman, about one o'clock, and the prisoner came in, bringing her child—she appeared to be in a very heated state by walking—I spoke first, and said, '. Oh, dear, what a heat you are in!" and I took the baby from her—I asked her to sit down and have a bit of dinner—she did so—her husband walked round the table, and said, "What brought you here?"—she said, "You know what I have come for"—those were the first words she spoke in the kitchen—the dinner was not over when she came in; they had just helped once round—when the prisoner said, "You know what I have come for," the deceased and she appeared a little excited with each other, and I do not know what the reply was—he seemed vexed at her coming, and she seemed a little out of temper with him—that was before she sat down to dinner—she had not sat down before the deceased asked her what she came there for, that was when she first came into the kitchen; she answered, and then it was I asked her to sit down to dinner—she thanked me, and sat down—they appeared angry with each other—he appeared angry with her coming, and she made an angry answer—I cannot exactly say whether her husband gave her a chair or not—the deceased sat down again at the table, and nursed the child while the prisoner had her dinner—he took the child from me—the deceased did not eat any more dinner after she came—the angry feeling subsided in a few minutes, I did not see it after a minute or two; I saw them conversing together, apparently without anger—the deceased was in and out of the kitchen to the parlour after dinner, till I left it, about three o'clock, and went up-stairs—the dinner was at one, and the prisoner came in about one, or a minute or two after—I went up-stairs at three o'clock, to dress for Church, and left no one but the deceased, the prisoner, and the little child, in the kitchen—the door between the kitchen and pantry was then open, as it gene<lb></lb>rally was—my room is on the second-floor—while I was dressing the nurse called me at the bottom of the stairs—I heard her call—I had not heard any noise, or call, or shriek, or anything of that sort before; she called, "Cook, cook, come down directly, John is very ill!"—I went down immediately, went through the kitchen, and found John lying between the two rooms, across the doorway which separates the two—the prisoner was in the kitchen, crying—I saw her before I went to the doorway—I believe she said, "Fetch someone," or something of that kind—as I went through the kitchen, the steel on which we sharpen the knives was lying by the side of deceased's legs—it was usually kept in the pantry—I never recollect seeing it in the</p>

               <p>kitchen before—the knife-tray was on the dresser, on the right-hand side, in the pantry, as you go in, facing the sink—there were white-handled knives in it—I had never seen the steel before that day, but I always under<lb></lb>stood it was kept in the pantry—I had never seen it in the kitchen—I did not notice any blood about the deceased—I went back into the kitchen, where the prisoner still was, got some vinegar, and washed the deceased's face with it—I believe I asked for it when I went into the kitchen—it was usually kept in the kitchen cupboard, and 1 went there and got out the cruet—the prisoner saw me do that—I do not recollect that she said anything when I washed his face with the vinegar—after I had bathed his face, I called, "John, John!" and tried to see whether he would speak—at last he said, "Humph"—I called him again repeatedly, and said, "John, here is your wife"—he said, faintly, 'What does she want?" and that was all he said—after I bad washed his face I saw blood on his left breast, and asked the prisoner what it meant by the blood issuing from the heart, and if ever she had heard him complain of an affection of the heart—she said "No, never"—that was after he had said, "What does she want?"—Mr. Asbury soon after came, and the deceased was found to be dead—before he came I had run down the drive to see if I could get anybody to come in, and I met Charlotte Grant, the nurse, there—I could not find anybody, and ran back as quick as I could—I could not have been gone above a couple of minutes—when I returned the prisoner was in the pantry, kneeling down, and looking at her husband—I do not recollect that she said anything to him—I think she was loosening his neckcloth, but I will not be sure—I then, for the first time, discovered that he was stabbed, just as Mr. Asbury came in—the prisoner was collected at that time—I said, "Good God, he is stabbed!"—I do not know that I said that pointedly to any one—the prisoner, Grant, and her mother, who had come in, were there—the prisoner was close by, standing on one side of the body, and I on the other—she did not make any observation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Enfield. I was called in on 1st July, to Mr. Buller's house—I got there after four o'clock—I saw the deceased lying on his back, between the kitchen and the pantry—I found a wound on the leftside, made by some cutting instrument—I afterwards made a post. mortem examination, by order of the Coroner—the wound was about an inch in length, and immediately above the sixth rib—the knife produced would make that description of wound—I passed another knife, of the same size, in the direction of the wound, and it corresponded precisely—the wound took a direction from left to right; first entering the left cavity of the chest, passing over the lower margin of the left lobe of the lung, and entering the pericardium, it transfixed the heart—the knife went through the right ventricle of the heart—I attribute the death to loss of blood from that wound—there cannot be the least doubt that that wound caused the death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you formed any judgment as to whether it was a wound that could have been inflicted by the deceased himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It could not have been done by his right hand—I have not the least doubt about that—it is pos<lb></lb>sible that it may have been done with his left hand—if it was done with his left hand, he must have placed his left arm in an unnatural position for striking a blow; that is to say, the elbow must have been drawn backwards, in this position (<hi rend="italic">placing his arm close to his side</hi>), and the knife would go to the anterior part of the chest, anterior to the lungs—that must have been the case either with a back-handed blow or a front blow; in either case the arm must have been held back, to bring the point of the knife to where it entered, to inflict that wound—he was not a very thin man, but not corpulent; not so lusty as myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At what part of the heart was the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the apex of the right ventricle; a contraction of that ventricle would propel the blood in an opposite direction to that of the wound, and therefore he would live a much longer time than if the other portion of the heart had been reached—he might probably have lived twenty minutes—that is the side of the heart which propels the blood through the lungs, not that which supplies the brain, so that' his intellect would continue much longer than if the left ventricle had been wounded—he would not drop the instant the wound was inflicted—he would be capable of walking for some paces—he might be capable of speaking after he recovered from the fainting—when syncope takes place a coagulum of blood would fill up the orifice in the heart—I should say a man would probably be able to speak about fifteen minutes after receiving such a wound—I am not aware of cases where persons have walked half-a-mile after the heart has been wounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this a wound of the heart that would cause the blood to drip slowly, or the reverse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a contraction of the ventricle there would be no loss of blood from the heart in the intervals—the loss of blood would take place as the ventricle was being filled from the office—during that time the blood would come in quantities—it would perhaps be five or six seconds after receiving such a wound before he would become faint and unable to stand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe that after the infliction of this wound, by whomsoever inflicted, this person could have walked, called another person to him, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184909170047"></xptr>
               <p>laid down on the floor, and afterwards speak so as to express his belief that be should soon be better? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might be capable of walking three or four paces; he would then feel faint, and probably attempt to support himself by the dresser, or any furniture that would be near him; he would then lower himself gradually to the ground; he would be conscious of a faintness coming on; and under those circumstances it is I account for his being on his back—if he had fallen suddenly he would have gone head first, and fallen on his face—I should not think the violence of the blow would have anything to do with it—it must have been inflicted with considerable force—when he recovered from the first syncope, which he would do by lying on his back on the floor, the horizontal position being the most favourable for him, he would be capable of speaking—the intellect would recover—it might be from five to ten minutes after receiving the blow that he would be capable of speaking—I did not observe a knife-tray on the dresser—I saw the dresser and the sink—if he had stabbed himself, I think that he could not probably have placed the knife in the sink—I do not think the knife would have been transferred from the left band to the right, and placed in the sink—I have seen cases of suicide by stabbing in the side, and I have read of other cases—I have not myself known a case of suicide by stabbing with the left hand—supposing the deceased to have com<lb></lb>mitted this act himself, the direction of the wound was not such as would have followed a stab by himself with his left hand—I think if he had inflicted it with his left hand the arm would have been placed in a position which would give it the greatest purchase, and therefore the arm would have been extended, and he would drive the knife into his body—in that case the direction of the wound would be different; it would go from the surface to the centre; this traversed from left to right.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Will you tell me what part of the heart's circle cannot be reached with the right hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be an extremely difficult mat<lb></lb>ter for me to take that knife and to drive it into my chest in the direction this was—it might depend a good deal on the sort of chest and the length of the arm—it must be a longer arm than mine—you could not drive it in anteriorly with your right hand, because it is an unnatural position—it would depend a good deal on the position of the person—I have read a good many books on this subject—I know "Beck's Medical Jurisprudence," it is a very old work—there are extraordinary wounds committed by suicides, but they are generally on the right side—I do not know that they are in all positions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe in the centre of the chest there is a bone, called the sternum? Yes, to which are articulated the cartilages that fasten the ribs to the sternum—the wound passed behind the sternum—it passed immediately above the sixth rib, where the rib terminates in cartilage, and proceeded over the left lobe of the lung, horizontally, but inclining a little inwards—I do not think a person could inflict that wound upon himself, not to carry the point of the knife in the direction in which it went for three inches and a half—if he did he must draw the knife along—it could not be a stab—if he had done it himself it would have gone more directly inwards—it was a mere matter of chance that the heart was transfixed at all, because when the ventricle con<lb></lb>tracts there is a recoil, and at that instant the hrart strikes against the ribs, and at that moment the point of the knife must have come in contact with the ventricle, otherwise it could not have been wounded at all—the wound was three inches deep—I do not think the man could have inflicted such a wound in that direction; besides, the knife was not very sharp—the proximate cause of death was the loss of blood, not the blood filling up the cavity and pre<lb></lb>venting the action of the lungs—there was no blood in the right cavity of the</p>

               <p>heart, consequently the right lobe of the lung was not impeded in its action—the brain is supplied from the left side of the heart—that supply of blood to the brain would continue, and so long as that continued, consciousness, power of speech, and ability to stand would remain, and for a much longer period than if the left ventricle had been wounded, because that would stop the supply to the brain—so long as the brain was supplied with blood, there would be no impediment to the intellect—faintness results from want of blood to the head—there would be a series of faintings and recoveries till death took place—in my judgment the wound could not have been inflicted with the man's right hand.</p>

Q.</hi> On what occasions did you see her write? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first was when she signed a receipt for some money which I gave her—I have it here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—that was in the cell at the station, I was standing close by her—the other occasion was in Newgate, when she signed a receipt for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note which I gave her.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The following letters were hete read:</hi>—"Dear John,—I received your note this morning; I can't say pleased as I should have been if I had it before, as I think you have took your time thinking about it. You say that I never send to you without a complaint—pray what would you have me say? You ask me to let you know how I am, and because I tell you I am not well, you say I always make a complaint. But you need not ask many more times</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184909170050"></xptr>
               <p>how I am, for I shall not tell you, as you seem to think it is not true. I can't help thinking that you are very unkind to me; as to your loving of me, John, it is all false and lies. Your note was not very kind, so you can't complain of mine: but as your time is so taken up with the nurse, I can't expect you to send to poor me; but never mind, as all things are for the best. I am very unhappy, John; why do you go with the nurse, so as I beg of you not? I am afraid that there is something wrong between you and her, and if that is the case, that is why you don't care for me. How do you think that I can love you if you love some one else? no, John, you don't seem to care for me as you did before you went there—why is that? because you have got some one else there, and if that is the case you shall have reason to be sorry for it. Please to send me an answer by return of post."—(Post-mark, 20 <hi rend="italic">June</hi>, 1849.) "Mr. Cock,—I received your letter yesterday, and wonder how you can say I sent you an unkind one. I think you are the most unnatural man that ever was, to think of your sending me back all across the fields, one of the coldest nights we have had; the beasts of the field would have more feeling for their young, and to say that you love him, you are a liar to say such a thing as to love my baby or myself. I shall not tell you, let him be as bad as he may. I shall not send for you, mind that. I should be glad if you would come to some arrangement with me not to come and see me at all, but allow me something as I am not to come near you, and when I do to be served like that. O, you beast! to come to me after you have been with your whore. You d—d devil; would to God you might be dead by the time this comes where you are; I feel that I should be glad never to see you again. You say in your letter 'that bonnet and shawl.' You know that you sent me to ask the price, John; I think as you have been made a father down here, and you can buy things for them, you may as well get her to make your shirts, for I shall not until I am treated as your wife by you and your <hi rend="italic">pals</hi>; so I tell you. If you wish to get rid of me, you need not serve me in that way. Perhaps you will think about what I am saying and let me know as soon as you can, if by return of post."—28<hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, "Well John, you say you can't think I mean what I say about the money. I can tell you that I do, as I have not got any, as I told you in the last, and therefore hope you will send some. I am to get some powders for the dear child, and I have not got the money, so if anything happens to him you must blame yourself, as you will not send me any money. John, you must remember that I have had to pay 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for rent, and then to live out of it and buy things for the child and myself, which you know, but not 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. like you. I hope you will send me some, as I must have some. The dear boy is very ill; he has no teeth yet; I wish he had; I shall be glad. I should not send only to tell you that I have not got any, and you may believe me this time. I think you one of the most unkind men in the world, for you have got everything you wish for and don't think of poor us. Send by return."—30<hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, "Well Cock, so you don't mean to send any money. Well then, I shall come down and see your wh—; you d—d devil. So you can buy things for her, can you? You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you beast; but your master is as bad as you. I shall come down, so I tell you, and shall let the people know what a man your master is, and his servants too, that your wife is not allowed to come to you. You two-faced beast; you are a d—d wretch. If you wish me to send and let you know how the child is going on you had better send a stamp." <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN COLLINS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined by</hi>

I did—her hands anddress particularly, and there was not any—I also examined the deceased's hands, and there was no blood on them—in fact there was not above an ounce of blood came from him altogether.</p>

I was examined before the Magistrate—this is my signature to my deposition—I see I stated here, "She was stooping down and stroking her husband's face, at the same time saying, 'John! John!'"—I did state that, but I did not recollect it just now—I should say that she said that like a grieving wife to call her husband to himself. <hi rend="smallCaps">

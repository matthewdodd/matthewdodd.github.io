                  </hi>. On Sunday, 10th March, I was living at 2, York Row, Ratcliffe, which is kept by a woman named Wynn—I have left there now—about 12.45 that morning the prisoner and Caroline Smith (the deceased) and another man and woman came there—the prisoner and the deceased went into a back room down stairs, and the others went up stairs—shortly after that, I was in the kitchen, which is close to the back room, and saw the deceased come out of the back room—she came into the kitchen, where I was, and was doing her hair up—the landlady then went through the parlour, and saw the prisoner standing in the passage, and said to him "Good God, man, how you frightened me!"—he made no answer—the landlady then said to the deceased "<hi rend="italic">Carry</hi>, your young man is in the passage"—<hi rend="italic">Carry</hi> was going towards the back room and the prisoner was standing between the door and the passage—I then heard her say "Oh, he has stabbed me!"—I saw nobody else there—she walked into the kitchen with the knife in her side—I saw the prisoner brought back by a constable.</p>

I keep the house, 2, York Road—on 10th March, a little before 1 o'clock in the morning, I was at my door—two young men and two young women came—the prisoner and the deceased were two of them—they asked me to accommodate them, and they went into the back room down stairs (the other female was named Williams)—shortly afterwards the deceased came out and gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the bed for them, and as I was going into the parlour, which is on the same floor as the back bedroom, I saw the prisoner standing in the passage—the deceased was then in the kitchen—I said "Caroline, here is your young man in the passage"—Caroline walked up towards him, and I went into the parlour—as soon as I got there I heard her scream out "Oh, he has stabbed me!"—I had just got the parlour door open—I ran out, and saw Caroline leaning against the kitchen wall, and this knife on the mat in front of the kitchen fireplace—she</p>

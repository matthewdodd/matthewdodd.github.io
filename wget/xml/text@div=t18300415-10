               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had no quarrel whatever? A. No - I cannot say whether the woman was tipsy, the time was so short - I believe she was his wife; she was laying on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the young man who was with the prisoner is now in Clerkenwell prison, for an alledged assault upon you? A. I do not know - I left it to the Magistrate's discretion to do what he chose with him; I stated the case before Mr. Broughton, the Magistrate, as I have now, and how far the young man participated in the act; I do not know what was done with him - I said he took up this weapon, and I certainly felt an increased apprehension from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of them touched you till you seized the prisoner by the wrist, and grasped him as you have described? A. Certainly not; I grasped as tight as I could, for my own preservation - he had threatened to strike me, and was over me in this way; I was afraid to turn, or I should have had the instrument in my neck - he was in a dreadful passion, and did not seem to know what he was doing; the prisoner and the man were in the front room, which they call the shop - I was not trying to get in; I was in the room when the man was there.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the instrument struck your eye was not the door half closed between you and the prisoner? A. I stated that my umbrella was between the door and the jam - I was not pushing to get in at the door, nor did I make a push at the men inside - it never entered my mind; my umbrella caught between the door as I was retiring - the pointed end of it caught in at the door; I was carrying it as I usually do - I did not push with it at the people inside; I could not move it - it was fast between the door and jam; I did not attempt to withdraw it - I never thought of entering the room, and did not push to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing to prevent his rushing out at the door at you if he thought proper? A. I should think not; he did not attempt to do so - I was taken by the arm, and walked away from the place; I should think it all passed in less than five minutes from the time I entered the house till all was over.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Trapp on Tuesday afternoon, the 16th of February, between three and four o'clock - when I got half way up stairs I saw a female laying on the ground, and two men standing over her - directly they caught sight of us they turned; we retreated down stairs - they followed us into the shop, and I saw the prisoner with the chisel; I did not see it in his hand before he followed us down stairs - after we had retired down into the shop, he held the chisel up as if going to strike Trapp, and threatened him; he threatened every one in fact; the other man was in the act of trying to get hold of something in the cupboard, and I caught hold of him, to prevent his doing mischief - I found Trapp had disarmed the prisoner of the weapon he had, and had let him go; he immediately seized hold of another weapon - it was a chisel; they are tools he uses in his business - I did not see the blow struck, as I got out immediately; I did not see Trapp do any thing with his umbrella, either striking or attempting to strike: when I retreated from the house into the street I heard somebody say Trapp was stabbed - I went and found him with his handkerchief up to his face; I took him to a surgeon, and got the prisoner apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went down stairs immediately after seeing the prisoner and his companion with a woman? A. Yes; I went down very quickly - I will not swear he might not have had the chisel in his hand at first.</p>

            . I was at this house, but did not go up stairs; I saw them come down - Trapp and Woo came down first; I was just at the foot of the staircase - it is a small house; I did not see any thing in the prisoner's hand when he came down - I heard them scuffling on the stairs, and withdrew immediately to the front door; I saw Wood and Trapp come down, and the prisoner immediately turned to the left, towards a sort of cupboard without a door, where he keeps his tools, and immediately after I saw him with a long handled chisel in his hand, struggling with Trapp, who was behind him, and holding his wrist; before that he was holding the chisel up towards Trapp in a menacing way; Trapp did not give him time to turn round, but seized his wrist, grasped it, and the chisel fell - I did not hear him say any thing, it was so momentary - Wood came out of the shop; Trapp followed: I saw his umbrella entangled between the door and frame or cill, as if somebody had shut it in, he being outside the door -I never saw his umbrella pointed to any body; very shortly after I saw the prisoner pass the window, and take a large sharp turner's gonge, which is a circular tool. and very sharp - he seemed to take it from a work bench; I saw him put his hand through the aperture of the door, with this gouge in his hand, and strike Trapp on the face; Trapp immediately turned round, and said, "Oh, dear, he has cut my eye out," or words to that effect; the prisoner opened the door soon afterwards, with a kind of laughing grin apparently; Wood led Trapp away to a surgeon's - a Police-officer came; they would not open the door, and the officer broke it open - the prisoner did not appear to be drunk: shortly after a tall gentleman, who said he belonged to the Excise, was remonstrating with the prisoner - he immediately knocked him down, and cut his mouth; the prisoner appeared to me to be sober - I went to the Police-station with him, and when he and his companion were put to the bar, the prisoner said to his companion,"Mind, they don't know which of us did it;" I am quite sure he is the man who struck the blow, for he was in his shirt sleeves, and the other had his jacket on - I did not see Trapp give him any provocation.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does the shop door open in or out? A. Inwards - in his hurry of coming out, I suppose, his umbrella got entangled, for they thrust the door too immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they not try to shut the door too to keep the persons outside from coming in? A. I do not think they did, for they could have done it if they liked - it appeared to me that the umbrella was caught in the door by accident; if it had not been there the door would have shut - if they had relaxed the door the umbrella would have been loose; Trapp had held his umbrella by the handle, and was trying to get it out, which caused his face to be towards the door - I cannot say whether the prisoner had any thing in his hand when he came down, but after he get to the cupboard he had the chisel - whether he had it before I will not positively swear; he appeared in a violent passion - I suppose the whole affair lasted four or five minutes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I got up at three o'clock to finish some work I had in hand; I returned about nine - my wife was not at home: I asked my child where her mother was - she did not return till near four o'clock in the afternoon, and then came through the streets, roaring, singing, and crying; I was ashamed of her - she came in doors, and went up stairs crying and singing; she was going about the place, puking and crying Murder! I went up stairs, as I could not work for the noise - I said, "If you don't leave off that noise you must leave the place;" I helped her up, and persuaded her to go to bed - she resisted me, and I went away certainly in a great passion, having been at work very hard, and really I could not tell in my passion whether I stood on my head or my feet - I have stated to you the real facts of the case; this is not the first time she has been guilty in this way - I am a hard working man; not a neighbour can say I ever used a bad word, or said harm of them. I acknowledge I was in a most violent passion, and being with an hungry belly, from waiting for my dinner, to have at four o'clock a drunken wife come home; I never struck her all the time she has been my wife - no person can say a word against me; when she has come home in that way I have gone out of doors, as I could not stand it.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character for humanity, kindness of disposition, and as an affectionate father.</p>

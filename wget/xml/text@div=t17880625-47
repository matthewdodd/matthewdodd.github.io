               <p>Where did you see him with your neighbour's mare? - As I was coming up to London, he overtook me between Chadwell-street, and Illford, between two and three o'clock in the morning; I asked him whether he came through the town; he said yes; then I asked him whether he had seen a man on a brown mare with a white jacket on; he said he had.</p>

               <p>How near do you live to Manders? - A mile and a half.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was Manders's mare? Yes, I had known her above a twelvemonth; afterwards I heard Mr. Manders had lost his mare; and we pursued after her almost as far as the Rising-sun; I asked him how he came by her; I told him it was not his property, it belonged to a neighbour of mine; he said he had her from the Lion at Rumford; my man who was with me said, no, for you came through the turnpike with her at the same time I did, and that is beyond the Lion; then he said, his master had sent him overnight to fetch her from grass, and if we would go, he would shew us where his master lived; he said his master's name was Bushell, that he lived at Holywell mount; we let him get on the mare, and we followed him as far as the Red-lion, Whitechapel, and there we stopped him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was your neighbour's mare? - Yes, I will take take my oath of it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Friday the 6th of June, I was at the Seven Stars in Whitechapel, about four o'clock in the afternoon. (Newell and Shepherd ordered out of court.) The prisoner came in and asked what time the Rumford coach went out; I told him it was gone, or nigh upon going, just at that minute the coach came by, and he left part of the beer he was drinking, and got upon the roof of the coach; on the Saturday morning, between four and five o'clock, I was going down Whitechapel-road, and saw him driving a mare before him towards town.</p>
               <p>In what manner was he driving her? - He was walking behind her with a postilion's short whip.</p>
               <p>Was she saddled and bridled? - There was no saddle.</p>
               <p>Was there a bridle? - I believe there was.</p>
               <p>At what rate did he drive her? - Very slow, I was on the footpath and he in the road, I suspected him, because he went down with the Rumford coach but the night before, and I followed him; just at this side of Red-lion-street, Mr. Newell and his man came up and stopped.</p>
               <p>Were they on foot or on horseback? - They were on foot.</p>
               <p>Which way did they come from? - From Whitechapel Church; but when I first saw them they were standing at Mr. Crabb's, the butcher's door.</p>
               <p>Did you see them there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long before? - Not above a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner with the mare when you saw them at Crabb's door? - Passing by.</p>
               <p>They followed him then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far from Crabb's door was it that they stopped him? - About twenty doors, they stopped him at the end of Red-lion-street.</p>
               <p>How near were you to him when they stopped him? - I was opposite them, they in the road and I in the foot way, when they stopped him, I went up to them.</p>
               <p>Did they call you? - No, I went of my own accord, when I went up they were asking him how he came by the mare; he said it was his master's, he had fetched it from grass; I asked him if any body thereabouts knew him, he said the landlord at the sign of the Tewkesbury Church.</p>
               <p>What did Newell say? - He said it was his neighbour's mare; we took the prisoner to the Tewkesbury Church, the landlord said he knew nothing at all of him; I asked him where his master lived, he said at Holywell-mount; I told him he was going from Holywell-mount; we took him before a Magistrate, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in Whitechapel-road was it you first saw him? - On this side of the hospital.</p>
               <p>How far is that from the place where he was stopped? - It is about four furlongs, near half a mile.</p>
               <p>(Levi ordered out of court.)</p>
               <p>Newell called in again. Where was it you first saw this man? - Between Rumford and Ilford.</p>
               <p>How far from Whitechapel? - About nine miles.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250046"></xptr>Were you on foot or on horse-back? - On horse-back.</p>
               <p>Was Shepherd on foot or on horse-back? - On horse-back.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner on foot or on horse back? - On horse-back.</p>
               <p>Then he went on before you? - Yes, my man went back after our own horse, and then I heard that Manders had lost his; then I went to meet my man and we both followed him, and overtook him at the Rising Sun.</p>
               <p>How far is that from Whitechapel? - About four miles and a half, he galloped as fast as he could and we after him.</p>
               <p>After you overtook him, at that time did he ride slow or fast? - He rode gently, he could not get the mare on, he had rode her so hard he was obliged to get off and drive her.</p>
               <p>How far from Whitechapel did he get off and drive her? - Some where about Bow.</p>
               <p>Did you keep with him? - After him.</p>
               <p>All the way? - Yes, as far as Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Where did you first get the constable? - We had him over to the constable's house, he was taken into the sign of the Tewkesbury Church.</p>
               <p>Who stopped the prisoner first? - I did.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts? - On the stones.</p>
               <p>Near Red-lion-street? - I cannot say whether it was beyond, or on this side of Red-lion-street, but it was as near Red-lion-street as could be.</p>
               <p>Were you on foot or on horse-back then? - I had got off my horse, and my man held all the three horses while we went into the Tewkesbury Church.</p>
               <p>How came you to go in there? - Because he said he knew the man that lived there.</p>
               <p>Did you take him into the Tewkesbury Church, before you fetched the constable? - He went in of his own accord, and we followed him.</p>
               <p>Did any body there know him? - No, the man that did live there I understood was gone.</p>
               <p>It was after that that you went over to the constable's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And took him over with you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You shewed him the mare? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that the same mare that the prisoner was upon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Here is a person here that can prove that the Jew has been trying to persuade these men to swear my life away, for the sake of the reward; I bought this mare and paid honest money for her as I stand here alive; I bought her of a man about four miles from Rumford, for 17 s. he asked two guineas and a half for her.</p>
               <p>(For the Prisoner.)</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A servant.</p>
               <p>Where? - I am not in place.</p>
               <p>Where did you live last? - At the White Hart Tavern, Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you lived there? - About six months.</p>
               <p>How long did you live there? - About six months.</p>
               <p>How came you to have been so long out of place? - I have been unfortunate.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner? - A gardener.</p>
               <p>Where did he live before he was taken up? - At the Curtain, Holywell-mount.</p>
               <p>Do you live at Holywell-mount? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>About a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Do you know one Levi? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard him say any thing about this matter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now be careful and tell us truly what you have heard him say? - I have heard him say that he knew the prisoner had bought the horse.</p>
               <p>Now be cautious, for if you don't tell the truth you will run a risk yourself, and the prisoner's life will be risked too; nothing will be of service to the prisoner but the truth.</p>
               <p>Now what else have you heard him say? - I did not hear him say any thing else.</p>

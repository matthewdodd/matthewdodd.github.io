               <p>I am a lodger. On the 10th of June, at about half after five o'clock in the afternoon, I went out; I left my husband a-bed in the next room: he is a <rs id="t17810711-43-viclabel225" type="occupation">watchman</rs>

               <p>Had that room a communication with yours? - Yes; they go out of one another: it is a kitchen and bed-room. I bolted the door on the inside; I went through the bedroom, and locked that door. I came home about eight o'clock; and, being hot, I sat down on the step of the door. I heard the prisoner was stopped in a court opposite; I went over: the prisoner was in the necessary, and my things lying by the door within a yard of it, I believe. It was not my own property; I took it in to wash. By this time an officer was come, and I ran home to call my husband up. I went and looked at the kitchen, and found a pane of glass broke. The prisoner's mother lodged in the house.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came into our yard about seven o'clock, as nigh as I can recollect, upon Sunday the 10th of June: she sat half an hour in the necessary, very much in liquor: I went and pushed open the door; and she had a bundle, it looked like a child, lying on the vault: I looked to see what it was, and found the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them): I flung them on the ground before the people who were present; she had put on the prosecutor's shift, and her own was lying on the ground in the vault.</p>

               <p>I was coming through the same street; a person asked me to carry this bundle; I went with it up this yard; a person stopped me, upon which the woman ran away, and I was taken to the Compter.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Newman, and saw the prisoner take his hand out of Mr. Newman's pocket - but could not see what was in it. There were two others with him. Mr. Newman took the prisoner immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were looking before you I suppose - A. I turned round immediately as Mr. Newman did - he steped suddenly - I saw him take his hand out of the pocket - but saw no handkerchief in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking the same way as the prosecutor - he turned round suddenly, and said I picked his pocket - I said I had not, and went quietly to the watch-house; if guilty, is it reasonable that I should have gone so quietly.</p>

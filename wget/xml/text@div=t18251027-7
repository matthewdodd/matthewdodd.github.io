            . I received a watch from Mrs. Pack, and put it into a drawer in my room, and afterwards moved it into a drawer, which was not locked, in the front parlour, about the 8th of April, and missed it on the 9th; the prisoner was in my mother's service and had access to the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long was it in your possession? A. About a fortnight; it was not convenient to have it repaired directly.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Newby,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270007"></xptr>pawnbroker, Drury-lane. I have known the prisoner about two years, and know his person well - he came to the shop on the 2d of August and pawned a ring; on the 20th he pawned a watch - he had pawned other rings at our shop but I did not take them in; I took in the watch myself - it was handed to me to look at.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know who pawned the watch? A. I believe it to be the prisoner - to the best of my belief he pawned it - we advanced 4 l. on it, and 35 s. on the rings - both were pawned in the name of Newton; he had pawned two or three rings with the other person, and a small diamond ring.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any doubt of his pawning the watch? A. Very little - scarcely any; I told one of the lads in the shop to ask the person pawning for the name - I verily believe it to be the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the lad write the name on the duplicate from what you said or from his own knowledge of the name? A. From his own knowledge.</p>

            . In April last I was in the service of Mrs. Nelson as lady's-maid, for nine months - I left three weeks ago. The prisoner first came there about the middle of February as <rs id="t18251027-7-deflabel40" type="occupation">footman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18251027-7-defend119 t18251027-7-deflabel40"></join>; this watch was missed about Easter, and inquiry made among all the servants about it. About the middle of June some things were missing which were under my care; I opened the prisoner's box with the key of my tea-caddy; I know it was his box because he always had it in his possession. On opening it I found the watch and knew it by the name (looking at it). Here is "Silver," the maker's name, on it - I saw that when it was in his box - I saw a ring there with the name of Hector on it - I believe this to be the watch - I did not inform mistress of it because I was afraid; I took the cook to the box next day - the watch and ring were still there; I was still afraid to tell mistress; the cook left the service some time before I said any thing about it; I went to the box about a week after, to shew it to my mother, and asked her what I had better do, but it was then gone; I saw the duplicate of it in the box, with the name of Newby on it - my mother afterwards gave information. I was to be left in care of the house, with the prisoner, in the summer, and was afraid to mention it on that account. My mother told the family of it the latter end of September - I was going to leave the service then.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you in place now? A. No; I did not know the prisoner before he came to live there. I had not a month's warning; my mistress had five different cooks during the time I lived there - they were not all exactly cooks, there was a char-woman for about a month. The prisoner and I were never otherways than on friendly terms - he had no regard for me - I did not know that my key would fit his box till I tried it: the cook was not examined before the Grand Jury. She went to live somewhere at Newington-green: I and the prisoner were a week in the house by ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the confidence of your mistress? A. No, I am not exactly a lady's-maid, I call myself a housemaid: I did not particularly examine the duplicate, but my mother did: I saw the name of Newby on it, and there was a watch mentioned on it. I went to his box because I had missed some work, and he had given me some of it back a short time before: I expected to find some stockings which were missing: it was a small mahogany box.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. What had he given up to you? A. I missed a pair of drawers and mentioned it; he put them on a table and told me I should find them there; I missed the stockings soon after and looked in his box for them.</p>

            . I am Togwell's mother. I went to Gower-street the early part of July; she took and shewed me a small square box in the pantry; she opened it with a key and I saw the duplicates of a watch and ring in it; I looked at them and saw "a watch" written on one, and "a ring" on the other: I expected to see a watch and a ring: my daughter requested me not to mention it as she expected to be left in the house alone with the prisoner: the pawnbroker's name was Newby, No. 23, Drury lane. I afterwards told a friend of Mrs. Nelson, to inform her - that was the latter end of September or beginning of October: I thought it right Mrs. Nelson should know before my daughter left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw nothing but two duplicates? A. No, I did not look further; I believe Mrs. Nelson was to leave London the next day: my daughter was afraid to be left with the prisoner if I told.</p>

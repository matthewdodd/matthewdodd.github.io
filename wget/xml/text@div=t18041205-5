             sworn. - I live in Artillery-lane, Bishopsgate-street: On the 7th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at the bar in the act of pulling down a piece of lead from the skirting of the tiling, he was alone; this was on the top part of the house, between the ridges of Mr. Winders's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when you saw this? - A. On the garret floor; our garret is rather higher than the top of Mr. Winders's roof.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards across from your shop to Mr. Winders's? - A. Between fifteen and twenty, as near as I can guess; I went down, and informed Mr. Mason; we went and looked at the next door, and saw him at work; I said, that is the man; there was a ladder there, and he was removing it into the yard; Mr. Winders asked him if he knew any thing of the lead; he said, no; Mr. Winders ordered me to fetch an officer, which I did, and he gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the lead afterwards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what he did with the lead? - A. No more than he threw a piece of lead between two ridges adjoining the premises, all on one roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account of himself? - A. Yes, he said he was as good a character as any of us were.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at the time you took him? - A. He denied having taken it, he said he was as good a character as any man in the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you replaced the lead? - A. I have, and it required thirty-five pounds and a half to replace it; I desired the plumber to replace the lead the same as the other was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found the lead? - A. No, we have looked for it every where, and cannot find it.</p>

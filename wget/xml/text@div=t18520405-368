                  </hi>. I live in Broad-court, Long Acre, and am a tobacco<lb></lb>nist. On the evening of 12th March the prisoner came for half an ounce of tobacco, it came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served her—she gave me a shilling—I gave her change, and she left—I placed the shilling in the till, where there was no other money—she came again in about five minutes, and asked for a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of snuff—she paid for that with a shilling—I asked her if she had not got a sixpence, as I had given her one just before—she said it was for some one else—I gave her change for that second shilling, and before she got out I discovered that it was bad, but I could not say anything to her as she was out of the shop in a moment—I bent the shilling in the "detector," and then looked at the one I had taken before—I found they were both bad—I placed them in a box, and locked them up—on the Sunday the prisoner came again, about 7 o'clock in the evening; my wife was serving in the shop—I saw the prisoner through a window—I saw my wife serve her with some tobacco—I saw the prisoner lay down a shilling—my wife called me, I went, and the shilling was bad—I told the prisoner she was there on the Friday night, and passed two bad shillings—she said she was never in the shop before—I said I could swear to her being there on the Friday night—I sent for an officer, and gave her into custody—she then said she had been once in the shop on Friday night, but she did not know the money was bad, and if I would let the policeman go home with her she would give good money—I gave the two shillings to the officer—I found them in the same box in which I had locked them up.</p>

On the 29th of January the prisoner came to our shop, said he resided at Bishop Stortford, and had been pastor to a Baptist church there twelve months; that the people were poor, and could only raise him 50 l, a year - that he had an assistant to maintain, and found himself deficient; and his friends recommended him to open a shop in the linen-drapery or stationery line, he wished to commence in a small way, and should take 10 l. or 15 l. worth of goods. Believing his account to be correct, we agreed to supply him; he wished to have them immediately, as he was going to Bishop Stortford by coach next day. We promised him part if we could not get all ready. I made out a list of them, and our young man packed them up - they amounted to between 8 l. and 9 l.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutors. I looked out the order, and was packing the goods up when the prisoner came in, and asked if they were ready. I said I had got part of them ready, and would send them immediately. He said he could wait nearly an hour, if I could get the whole. I said we had got up what he would want most, and he appeared satisfied. I sent them to the New Inn, in the Old Bailey, directing them,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Bennett, passenger, Bishop Stortford." When the porter returned, he said Mr. Bennett told him the coach was gone, and he would be glad if I could pack the rest, and send them next day.</p>

            . I am a porter. I took the goods to the New Inn, and saw the prisoner; he said he was too late for the coach; and asked me to take them into the public-house, which I did. He said,</p>
               <p>"This is not all, I wish you would bring the rest to-morrow by twelve o'clock." I took another parcel next day there for him; my master came up with an officer, and took him. We then went to his lodgings, and found the first parcel, at Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>JAMES LOW. I am in partnership with Messrs. Pewtres. On the 29th of January being informed the defendant was an impostor, I went with our porter to the New Inn, gave him in charge, and enquired what had become of the goods? He expressed his willingness to return them if I pardoned him. He said they were at a room in Drury-lane, which he had taken the night before. I went and found the goods unopened.</p>

            . I live at Bishop Stortford, am a clock and watchmaker, and a member of the Baptist church; the prisoner was not pastor there, had no salary of 50 l. a year, nor did he live there - it is all untrue. He preached there a few times, occasionally, but never a fortnight together; they gave him 1 l. for preaching on a Sabbath. He slept at my house two nights, and said he was a painter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is with feelings I cannot describe, or express, that I stand here; little did I think a few months ago that I should be placed in such circumstances. I am not able to employ counsel, but if I was I should not, as I know your Lordship's known humanity will mention to the Jury every favourable circumstance in my case. I gave them information where to find the goods; for after I got them my conscience would not let me part with them. The moment I saw Mr. Dean, (my prosecutor in another indictment,) I told him I had injured him. As to my altering my name, it was because I was ashamed of what I had done. I am glad they have got their goods back, Nothing but the greatest distress caused me to do it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police sergeant</hi>). On Friday, 1st July, about a quarter before 3 o'clock, I was at Smithfield horse market, and saw the prisoner come into the market—Mr. Nice, the inspector, called my attention to a horse which the prisoner led into the market—I looked at it, and saw a discharge from one of the nostrils, the off nostril, I believe, and the glands under the jaw were swollen—it was pretty visible to anybody that came into the market—I took the prisoner and the horse to the station—Mr. Nice went with me, examined the horse, and pronounced it to be glandered—coming out of the market, I asked the prisoner who the horse belonged to; he said, "It belongs to me"—at the station he said it belonged to Mr. Henry Lee, of Cheneys-mews, a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> proprietor, who directed him to bring it there for sale.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of cattle and horses at Smithfield market. I was in the market on 1st July, and saw the prisoner with a horse, which attracted my attention, by the enlarged state of the glands; I examined it more carefully out of the market, and found that it was in a state of glanders—the membrane was lacerated, and the gland under the jaw was enlarged—that is a disease which is contagious to animals and to the human species, by proximity—it was plainly to be seen by anybody that knew anything about horses—it is very dangerous to have an animal going about in that state.</p>

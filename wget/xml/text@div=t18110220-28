             of the bank. The prisoner lived with him three months longer than that time, she was his niece.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday night the 9th of February last did you go to the alms houses - A. In the evening I did, with four shillings as usual. When I knocked at the door the prisoner called who is there? I answered, it is me; the door was not opened at first; after I had been there sometime she opened the door about one third; she stood behind the street door, put her hand out and asked me if it was silver; I told her it was copper, she told me I could not come in, her uncle was unwell and dozing; I walked in, I approached the table; she then went on the other side of the table and endeavoured to conceal somewhat from me, she prevented me from coming round the foot of the bed; she treated me in that manner three times, as I moved she moved, to cover somewhat as I suppose. I then said, if it is unpleasant to you for me to bring the money, Miss Woodthorpe, you must come to my house for it. She had been to my house on the Thursday before, but did not inform my family; I asked her what was the matter with her uncle on the Thursday, she said no matter now. On the next morning my wife received this letter from her, I immediately came home and received this letter; I went there on the Sunday about one o'clock, I took an officer with me; when I entered the room I said to her, you have sent me a letter; she said, here is a copy of it.</p>
               <p>(The letter read, signed R. Woodthorpe.)</p>
               <p>"MR. HOLLOWAY.</p>
               <p>I am sore distressed; I gave my uncle a piece of cake and wine the last thing before I went to bed, I left the knife and piece of cake upon the night stool. In my first sleep he reached the knife, and cut his throat; it was unknown to me; I was awoke by a strong smell, and when I turned myself I found I was all in blood; it was about half past two in the morning, and I all alone. I am much distressed; my mind is hurt in doing for him, and now to have a painful end. I shall thank you come and advise me what to do.</p>

               <p>Yours, in great trouble, 
               <persName id="t18110220-28-person304">R. </persName>
            WOODTHORPE.</p>
               <p>Mr Holloway; Here is the identical bit of cake that was put on the night stool to cut. I told the prisoner. I believed she had cut her uncle's throat; she said to her friends,</p>
               <p>"do you hear what Mr. Holloway says, his words were always like swords and daggers to me." After this I went to the deceased, I found he could not articulate.</p>
               <p>Q. What aged man was the deceased - A. Eighty-three, a very infirm man; he was feeble all over his system; he could not walk about for the last two or three months, he was bed ridden. When I went to his bed side his wound had been dressed; I found he was unable to articulate; I asked him if he did this act to signify it by holding up his hand. I am sure he knew me, his eyes were open, he shook hands with me, he did not hold up his hand; I then asked him if his niece did it to signify it by holding up his hand. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the linen on the bed whether there was much blood - A. There was a deal of blood where he laid, but none where Miss Woodthorpe laid.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in the habit of sleeping with her uncle - A. So she informed me, on account of his infirmity. I returned the next day between four and five, before day light, then I examined the bed particularly, I found no blood on the side that Miss Woodthorpe slept; I found a small pen-knife in the bed; I then said to him, Mr. Crickett, did you do this act; he said, no. He could then articulate with sufficient clearness. I asked him if his niece did it; he said, yes: I was astonished when I heard him say so. There was no one present but the nurse that I placed there, her name is Johnson. I let him rest. It was much labour to say yes, he could say no; there was much wind issued from the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the throat at that time - A. I did not before I went to the magistrate; I asked him again, Mr. Crickett did you do this? he said, no. Did your niece do this? he said, yes. After that I went to the magistrate, the magistrate came there, I was present, the examination took place about two o'clock. On the evening of the same day, between eight and nine o'clock, I went there again, my daughter Boosey and her husband was present. When I entered the room I went to his bedside, I found he was more capable of articulating than I had seen him before; I then said to him, Mr. Crickett, did you cut your own throat; he said, with a peculiar emphasis, no; I then said, did your niece do it, he replied plainer than I had heard him before, yes.</p>
               <p>Q.At any of these conversations was the niece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200021"></xptr>present - A. When the magistrate was there she was present, but no other time.</p>
               <p>Q Do you recollect at any period of his life whether he had been insane - A. In the middle part of his life he had been insane, I understand, and about seventeen years ago I thought I saw a little wildness in consequence of some little misfortunes, it soon went away; from that time to his decease I did not observe the least return of it. I saw the wound almost a day before he died; the windpipe was nearly cut through; some tapinda that he took came through it. I fetched Mr. Fox to dress the wound. The last conversation that I had with him was a few minutes before his death. Mr.

I have known Mr. Cricket four years, he had been confined to his bed about six months, he had not been able to cut his meat some time; the prisoner told me he could not help himself, she was obliged to assist him like a baby. On the Saturday night, about nine o'clock, I saw her, I believe she did not stop with me ten minutes. I saw her the next morning about eight o'clock, she came to me in great distress; she said, my uncle has cut his throat, about two o'clock in the morning, as nigh as she could guess; she was awoke with a great smell; she went round to her uncle, and said, uncle, what have you been doing; she received no answer, nor had not received any answer up to the time that she was speaking to me; I asked her why she did not call for assistance; her reply was, as her uncle was not dead she did not wish to disturb any body. I called my husband to go for assistance. He did. I went in on the Monday morning, and kneeled down by his bed side, I believe he saw me, I told him my name was Sarah Saunders; I said, Mr. Crickett, I am going to ask you a question, I hope you will resolve it; I said, Mr. Crickett, did you do this act yourself; his reply was, no, quite distinct; I asked him the second time, Mr. Crickett, are you sure that you did not do it yourself; he answered no; I then said, did your niece do it; after resting some time he replied, yes, distinctly. I asked the two persons in the room to give attention, they said the heard it; they are not here.</p>

            . I am the daughter of Mr. Holloway that has been examined; I live at No. 4, Spital-street. On Sunday morning, about ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the deceased's house, before the wound was dressed; Miss Woolthorpe was present and my husband; I uncovered the bed as soon as I went in; the wound appeared to be three inches in length across his throat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether the windpipe was cut - A. Mr. Fox put his finger in as he was laying on his right side; that side of the bed was very bloody, the other side was not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him in the morning state what past - A. The prisoner met me at the door and said, I am glad to see you. I then went and uncovered the bed, he seemed to me to be done bleeding. I asked the prisoner how long it had been done; she said she awoke at about half past two in the morning and found herself all in blood; she said to him, uncle, what have you done; he made no reply; she got up and walked about the room till she was very cold, then she lit the fire; I said, why did not you send for assistance before now; she said, she wanted somebody to administer that advice. I asked her what he did it with; she said a table-knife; I said, let me look at it; she gave it me out of the closet; I said, you have wiped it; she said, she had on a flannel waistcoat that he had tied round his body; she had taken the waistcoat off his arms, and wiped the knife on that flannel waistcoat. She then produced me a copy of a letter that she had sent my father telling me that she writ that copy in case any thing should happen. I asked her where she found the knife, because she said her uncle did it, and she supposed he had flung it out of bed; she said she found it afterwards at the foot of the bed, by his side.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Crickett - A. I have known him from my infancy. I was present when Mr.

               <p>Q. Who was present when you saw him - A The nurse,

            , he was then in a doze. At one o'clock I went to the house again; I saw him then, and conversed with him; I sat down by his bed-side. I said Mr. Crickett, I am Mr. Lemaire's son, your old acquaintance; he looked up, and put out his hand; I said, Mr. Crickett, did you do it yourself, he drawed his hands together, and said, no; he then put his hands together, his lips muttered; what he said I could not understand; he appeared to me to be in devotion, he appeared then rather saint; I suppose it was two minutes before I put another question to him, I then said, who did do it Mr. Crickett; he made no reply; I said, did your niece do it, Mr. Crickett; at that time his hands laid upon the sheet, he raised his hand and put it to his throat, but did not speak; I put the same question to him three times, every time he repeated the same motion by putting his hand to his throat, but did not speak. I know the prisoner was at Worship-street Office, I went there, and the magistrate came with me to the dying man's apartment. At seven o'clock in the evening, on the same day, I went to Mr. Crickett's house, I kneeled down by the bedside, he appeared to me to be more revived than when I had seen him in the middle of the day; I put my hand on his shoulder, he looked at me, I said my name is Lemaire. Did you do this rash act yourself, Mr. Crickett; he said, no, and that strong. Did you do it yourself, Mr. Crickett - no. At that time the air issued through the aperture of the windpipe, and he appeared saint, I gave him some wine, it issued out of his windpipe. I said as your dissolution is issuing, I hope you are prepared for where you are going; he turned his head upon the pillow and said, no; Mr. Crickett are you sure that your niece did it; he said, yes. Mr. Crickett are you sure that you did not do it yourself? no. Are you sure that your niece did it? Yes. They are the last words I heard him utter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. During the time that you have known Mr. Crickett do you know of your own knowledge of his being deranged - A. Yes; I know of his being confined in Bedlam, the first time 1777 or 78. I was then but young. I cannot say how long he was confined; he afterwards came out, he was restored to his faculties; in 1785 or 86 he was deranged again; after that I have heard that he was deranged a third time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever observed any appearance of derangement about him lately - A. No, but a great dissatisfaction about him, his salary being so small.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FOX. I am a surgeon, I live in Bishopgate-street. On Sunday the 10th I went to the deceased about ten o'clock in the morning, I found a wound across the throat, from two to three inches in length, and about one in depth; the windpipe was partly divided. I asked the deceased if he cut his throat himself; he said no. I asked him if his ce cut it, he made no reply to that. I afterwards dressed it; he appeared to have last a vast deal of blood. I have known him about eighteen months and frequently attended him; I have seen a mental variance in his understanding I never saw him of his bed for the time I knew him; I should suppose he was bed ridden.</p>
               <p>Q. From the infirm state he was in, he being bed ridden, was he capable of inflicting that wound himself - A. I should think not. In insanity I should; think he might possess more energy at that time; that wound was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley A momentary fit of insanity produces momentary strength - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And a man more advanced in life is more liable to it at that time - A. Certainly The large arteries were not cut, if they had been cut he would have bled to death; the smaller ones might stop The wound might be inflicted on the Saturday before; what time it is impossible for me to state.</p>

The said examinant being asked by me in presence of the prisoner if he did this, signs being made to him to signify his giving himself the wound in the throat under which he now labours, distinctly said, no.

               <p>Q. to Mr. Holloway. Did you hear her state what expectation she had - A. I did, on Saturday the 25th of January. She asked me to go to ask Mr. Holloway of the bank to let her have twenty pounds; she said she was very much embarrassed, she wished to go into the country and leave her uncle; I asked Mr. Holloway if he would let her have twenty pound; he said no; I returned the same evening and acquainted her with Mr. Holloway's decision. She said she did not know what she should do; I told her if she was distressed it was a pity but what she should go in the country, and leave her uncle at once, we would take care of him. In our conversation I proposed his going into St. Bride's workhouse. I told her as he had fifteen shillings and nine-pence coming in he would be very comfortable there; Miss Woodthorpe seemed much pleased, and said that exactly met her idea. I then said to her, remember Miss Woodthorpe you will not have the goods; your uncle told me twenty years ago that he had willed them to Mr. Holloway of Hampton-court, and Mr. Holloway of the Bank. She then said, I do not know what I am to do now, Mr. Holloway will not let me have twenty pound, and I am not to have the goods; what am I to do, I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200023"></xptr>go into the country.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Whenever I met that gentleman he struck a terror to my heart, and my uncle said repeatedly the last week or two, never let him him, come nigh me; he had agitated him and put him in nine months ago, by talking of carrying him to St. Bride's workhouse.</p>

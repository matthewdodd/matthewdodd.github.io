                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 5, Henry Street, Gray's Inn Road—on the night of 30th October, about midnight, I was with the prosecutrix, in a public-house, in Holborn—the prosecutrix left first, and I left two or three minutes afterwards and looked for her—I saw three wo<lb></lb>men running away, and she said "My dear, my watch"—the prisoners are</p>

               <p>two of them, I am certain; I ran after them calling "Stop thief"—I over<lb></lb>took Saunders, held her, and gave her in charge—I had seen the prosecutrix with the watch before she went out—I saw Saunders reach her hand at the corner of Chancery Lane to the third one, who has got away, so as to touch her—Inwood came voluntarily to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Francisco, of 24, Win<lb></lb>chester Terrace, Caledonian Road—on the evening of 30th April, I was in a public-house, in Holborn, and left about 12.45—the minute I was outside the door, three women surrounded me and struck me a violent blow on the temple—I cannot tell who that was, but Inwood held my arms and Saunders put her hands under my dress and tore my watch away from my watch pocket—it was a very violent blow, my arms were black and blue all over—I called out "Oh, my watch?"—it was safe when I left the public-house—it was worth 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 10). On 31st October, at 12.50, I was on duty in Holborn—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I ran to the corner of Chancery Lane, and saw Mrs. White holding Saunders—she said "I give this woman in charge for robbing a lady of her watch, with another woman who has run down Chancery Lane—I took Saunders to the station—some little time before the robbery I saw the two prisoners and another woman walking up Holborn, in the direction where the robbery took place—Inwood came voluntarily to the station with the constable who took the prosecutrix there, and was identified by Mrs. White—the prosecutrix was the worse for liquor—the blow might have had something to do with that—the watch has not been found.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Saunder's Defence.</hi> I admit that I was with Inwood half-an-hour before it happened. I saw a crowd, and saw a girl lifting up the woman. I was by the side of the girl, and the lady said that she had lost her watch; then she said "I think you are one of them." I said "No, I am not."Inwood came down as a witness for me; there was no other girl there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Inwood's Defence.</hi> I was selling flowers, and saw a girl snatch the watch. The lady fell on her face, and was lifted up and sat against the wall. I admit that I was with Saunders and another in Holborn. The young woman who has got away got the prosecutrix under the arms, and made a snatch at her side, and I saw her chain rush out, and she said "Oh! my watch."She could hardly walk; they very nearly had to carry her. I went to the station, and they asked me what I wanted. They did not say that I was the girl then. The policeman told me I need not come back, but I did, and went into the waiting-room, and this woman said "I think that is one of them."I said "Do you think if I had anything to do with it</p>

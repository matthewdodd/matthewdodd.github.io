            . I am servant to Mr. Thompson. On the 14th of April, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, the sweeps rang at the bell - I did not expect them, and they were strangers; I opened the street door to them; the prisoner was one of them I am certain - they were both dressed as sweeps; his companion said he was desired to call and sweep a flue, which leads from the oven into the kitchen chimney, which the boy had forgotten to sweep six weeks ago when they swept the chimney; I said I was sure he was mistaken; he said, No, his master had desired him to come - I said, "Who is your master?" he said, "Mr. Shipley of Broad-yard" - I let his companion in; he came down into the kitchen, and began to sweep the flue; the prisoner did not come in with him, but walked down the street; about five minutes after the prisoner came up the steps, and knocked at the door - I went up to the door, leaving his companion sweeping the flue in the kitchen; the prisoner came down stairs: the other said, "Here Jack, take the brush and sweep;" he did so, and the other took up the soot, and then said,"Now, will you be so kind as to let us out?" the other put the soot into the yard, and went up-stairs before me; I followed him, and the prisoner followed behind me - I had left him in the kitchen; he followed me directly, but when he got to the kitchen door he closed it - I had got out, and he being inside, I turned back, saying, "What do you mean by this?" and pushed the door open; he said, "Nothing, Ma'am;" it must have been done on purpose - I immediately said, "Please to deliver up the silver spoon, which you have taken off that dresser." as I missed it; he looked at me, and without saying a word, delivered the spoon from his bosom; the other came down stairs, and said, "What is the matter?" I said,"Why this fellow has taken a spoon off the dresser;" he said, "Jack, you ought to be ashamed of yourself; don't you know better, you may rely on it, I shall tell your master" - I said, "You need not trouble yourself, I will do that;" I then let them both out of the house, and when they had been gone about five minutes, my master asked me what the time was - I went down into the kitchen, and missed the watch, which hung over the dresser just before they came in - I had hung it there that morning; it was mistress', and has never been found; one of them must have taken it: it was worth full 10l. - I told master I had let the sweeps in, and instantly went to Mr. Shipley - the prisoner was brought to me on the 22d - I had described his person to the officer - I swear positively he is the man who had the spoon - I should not have let them in if I had not believed they came from Shipley.</p>

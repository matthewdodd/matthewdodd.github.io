                  </hi>. I live at Clarence Villa, Bedfont, I went to live there in October, 1878—on 30th December that year the prisoner and his wife came to reside next door in a house called Holly Lodge, a detached house stand<lb></lb>ing in its own garden, and about 30 feet from my house—on Saturday, 3rd July, I noticed that the blinds of the house were partly drawn up, and they continued in the same state up to the 13th—I had not seen anything of the prisoner or his wife during that week—on Sunday, the 11th, about 7 in the evening, I went round to the back of the prisoner's house; I got on a garden seat and looked through the window; I could not see anybody; I could see into the kitchen; I could see the table and I could see the clock going, and could hear it tick, and there was a basket of wood on the table; the next evening, Monday, I saw the prisoner peeping through the glass of the passage window upstairs, and I saw him two or three times in the course of the afternoon passing across the passage from one bedroom to the other—on the Tuesday afternoon, the 13th, he came to me and said he either thought Mrs. Catlin was dead or mad—he said "That d—d bitch has been mad again," and he asked me if I "would do him a favour, to send for Dr. Lundy; I did so—when sober the prisoner and his wife seemed on very good terms and fond of each other—I have frequently seen Mr. Catlin the worse for liquor, and Mrs. Catlin three or four times—I did not hear any noise in the prisoner's house during this time—I went into the house on the Tuesday after Mr. Lundy had gone—I saw Mrs. Catlin lying in the right-band room downstairs—at that time the prisoner appeared to be drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner at Feltham, close to Bedfont—on Tuesday, 13th July, I was fetched to the prisoner's house about 3 o'clock—after knocking a second time the prisoner opened the door; he said "Who's there"—I said "The doctor"—he said "Come in"—I entered, and he relocked the door; he then opened the door of the right-band front room on the ground floor—he said "Come in and see a b—corpse"—he had the appearance of recovering from heavy drinking—I noticed a very bad smell—he sat down in the easy-chair by the side of the Replace; I saw the body of the deceased lying on the floor with her head towards the table and her feet towards the fireplace—she was entirely dressed except stockings—I said to him "Mr. Catlin, this is a serious matter"—he replied "She set herself on fire on Tuesday; I threw two pails</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On Tuesday, 13th July, about 3 in the afternoon, I went to the prisoner's house—I saw Dr. Lundy there, and saw the deceased lying on the floor—I found a quantity of clothes partially burnt, and a quantity in a dust-pan in the kitchen; it was tinder—there was an apron in the scullery, and some burnt clothing in the right-hind bedroom upstairs—I found this empty oil bottle lying down outside the back door—the clock was going—I took it to the police-station to test it; it will go nearly 30 hours; you pull up the weights when it runs down—I saw a moveable calendar in the back parlour, set for Wednesday the 7th—I took the prisoner into custody on the 15th, after the inquest—I told him I should charge him with culpable neglect and causing the death of his wife—he said "I have nothing more to say than I have said before the Coroner"—I was present at the inquest—the prisoner was called by the Coroner, and cautioned that what he said might be used in evidence against him—he made a statement, which was taken down and read over to him, and he signed it. (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoners Statement was read as follows</hi>: "I am a retired baker. The deceased was my wife. I was lying down very much afflicted with diarrhoea, and had taken some brandy and water. There was a scream, and when I went down I found her in the passage. She was alight. I threw some water over her. She was well enough to go up and take off her burnt rags and lie down. She come down again and sat in the easy-chair, as she was in the habit of doing. I had to lie down again afterwards, and when I came down she was lying on the floor and appeared to be dozing, when I found she got so bad. By the time I got down again she had been lying there a couple of days, I should think, and so I sent off for the doctor. I was very much to blame. I ought to have sent for a doctor before. It was three or four days, I should think, from the time she was burnt until she died. I can't say on what day she was burnt. It was about foe 8th or 9th, I think. I had nobody in the house. I had no servant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Melton, an eating house keeper. I have been in the habit of employing the prisoner at our house—she came first as a friend, and we have employed her to do many things, and have paid her for them—two or three months ago I was confined; before that I had missed numbers of things from the house, but never suspected the prisoner—I discharged the washerwoman in consequence—adjoining the room in which I was confined there was a box containing sheeting and other articles—the prisoner had access to it—after she left I examined the box, and missed a large sheet, a very handsome tablecloth, some petticoats, drawers, and many other articles—I have seen some of them since—this is the sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is now cut in half—all these articles produced are ours—I missed them seven or eight months ago, during the time we have been employing the prisoner.</p>

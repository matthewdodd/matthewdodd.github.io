I married his mother fifteen years ago - he is twenty years old, and is married himself - he was in the habit of coming to see his mother. On the 19th of August I went out, and on returning missed a clock-case, six yards of linen, and a shift; the linen was locked up in a trunk in the bed-room, and the clock-case was in the cupboard. I know nothing about the linen - I might not have seen that for a month. I found the clock-case at Worship-street on the Tuesday following - they were stolen on Friday.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for on the 23d of August, and took the prisoner in charge. I found three duplicates in a tea-caddy in his room - one for the clock-case, the others for the linen and shift. He said his father gave him the clock-case to pawn. I took him to the office, and he was bailed for an assault. Grove was examined.</p>

            . I was at my door in Richmond-street, and saw the prisoner coming out of Grove's house, with a bundle in a yellow handkerchief, on a Thursday or Friday in August, and when he returned he shewed me seventeen shillings - he said he had been to the pawnbroker's for his mother.</p>

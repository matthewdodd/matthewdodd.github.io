               <p>I am a smith. Mr. Paterson the prisoner brought this wedge for sale; I asked him how he came by it? I don't know the day exactly, about eight weeks ago; I lived by Kensington at that time; he told me he found it; I took and weighed it, and it weighed seven pounds, I gave one shilling for it; he was rather dissatisfied with the money; I delivered it to Ewster the constable; he was rather dissatisfied, but I could not afford to give any more, I told him I thought it was a long price for old iron, it was almost twopence a pound; he went away about his business; I never saw him before in my life, I have seen him since pass and repass.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you know who he is? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live? - I don't know; I never heard.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it found in your possession? - The 25th of April I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was called to give an account for it or else they would have taken you up? - I don't know; as soon as I heard of it I took it directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who found it in your possession? - The constable; but before that, Mr. Meux's son and one of his men came.</p>

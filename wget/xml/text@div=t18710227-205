I live at 26, Surrey Road, Blackfriars—last summer, Mr. and Mrs. Burns lodged at my house—at that time Mr. Burns went into Yorkshire, and Mrs. Burns went after him in the autumn—she left twenty seven pawn-tickets with me for articles pledged in our neighbourhood—amongst them was a ticket for a watch and chain, pledged at Mr. Davison's, in the Waterloo Road—I paid the interest for it on 26th November, and got a new ticket—I sent the twenty seven tickets to Mrs. Burns on 22nd December—I wrapped them up in a piece of brown paper, sealed them and tied them round with a small string, half a sheet of paper with writing on it, and three penny postage stamps—I posted it myself at 100, Black<lb></lb>friars Road, on 22nd, from 5.15 to 5.20 at the latest—in consequence of something that occurred, I made a communication to the Post Office authorities—the letter was addressed to "Mr. Thomas Burns, contractors" office, 114, Hut Terries Tunnel, Ballywife Hole, Ingleton, Yorkshire"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a portion of the paper I sent them in, and this is the letter I wrote, it is dated 22nd December—I had written to Mrs. Burns before, addressed in the same way, and had answers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an overseer of letter carriers at the South Eastern District Office—a letter posted at Blackfriars Road would arrive at the General Post Office and be forwarded in the ordinary course—I see the stamp "Too late" on this brown paper, that would indicate that it arrived too late for the evening mail—if posted after 5.30 it would be too late, and would then go into the "next collection, and be forwarded next morning.</p>

I am an overseer sorter at the General Post Office—a letter addressed to Ingleton, Yorkshire, would come to our office, and if marked "Too late" would be forwarded at 7 o'clock next morning—the prisoner was employed under me—he came on duty at 4.45 on the evening of 22nd December, and at 4.45 on the morning of the 23rd, and would leave at 8.30—letters addressed to Ingleton, Yorkshire, should go to Lancaster—letters so addressed are frequently mis-sorted—it is a small place, not generally known—if the letter packet was so mis-sorted to the Midland division it would pass through the prisoner's hands, to be re-sorted—if properly sorted it should go to the North Western division, then it would not come to the prisoner—the whole of Yorkshire, with the exception of some few towns is "Midland," but Ingleton is under "Lancaster."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was a sub-sorter in the Midland division—it would be the duty of the midnight sorters to sort letters for the Midland or Lancaster districts; there are a number of them, but this could only fall into the hands of one man out of three—if properly sorted it would not come to the prisoner's district at all, but would go to the North Western division; I don't see any are here from that division—if it was re-sorted again into its right division it would come into other person's hands.</p>

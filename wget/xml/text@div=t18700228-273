                  </hi>. I am an accountant, and live at 4, Albert Street, Hackney—about 6.40, on Saturday night the 29th January, I was in the Hackney Road—I had a watch and chain—as I was crossing the road lead<lb></lb>ing down to the new market, a man came sideways and passed in front of me, and made a snatch at my chain—he did not get hold of it—I railed my umbrella, and said, "Stop, you thief!"—upon that another man came up and said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "That man is robbing me"—on the instant I felt the second man's hand passed round my loins, and a third man pushed me over the legs of the second man—I put out my hand to save myself, and fell on my shoulder, jerking it out of the socket—I was picked up in about a minute by some man—in picking me up he pulled my arm into the socket again—when I got up I saw all the three men running away—the one behind me jumped over my body as I fell, and ran after the others down the street—I went to Spital Square Station the following Wed<lb></lb>nesday, and saw seven or eight persons together—amongst hem I saw the prisoner—I said something to the sergeant, and the prisoners were arranged differently—I went up to the prisoner and said, "You are the man that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187002280023"></xptr>
               <p>robbed me in the Hackney Road on Saturday night," upon which he shud<lb></lb>dered—he was the man that made the snatch at my watch—when I got up my chain was hanging down, and the watch was gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Twenty persons came up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a minute afterwards—the prisoner was the first man who came up—he came side-ways, and in front of me—I had a full look into his face—there was a gas lamp about ten yards from me—I said at Spital Square Station I thought he was the man—I saw him hanging down hit head and said, "That is the man in the corner"—I told the Magistrate that when I first saw him I thought he was the man, and I went to the officer, and he had them differently arranged, and I picked him out at once—Dunnaway was the constable who was with me—I was coming home from business at 7 o'clock, from my office in the City—I was perfectly sober—I can't say which one took my watch—the first man was not a big man—he had to rise up to get at the chain.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant H</hi>). On the Wednesday the last witness came to Spital Square Station, and I accompanied him to Worship Street Police Court—the prisoner was there—the prosecutor went into the passage of the Court where the prisoners were—he came out and spoke to me, and I went into the passage and made all the men stand up—he then came in and pointed out the prisoner as the man who had robbed him—I afterwards took the prosecutor in the Usher's Room and got the prisoner into the yard of the Court and brought in seven or eight men from the street and put him among them—he had no cap on the first time—I borrowed a cap from another person and put it on him—I then sent for the prosecutor to come into the yard, and said "There are some more; have a look at them"—he went again, and picked out the prisoner—the prisoner said he knew nothing about it, and could prove where he was—I told him if he would give me the names of anybody I would go and make the inquiry—he did not give me any names—he did not call any witnesses before the Magistrate—the prosecutor had no difficulty whatever in picking him out on both occasions.</p>

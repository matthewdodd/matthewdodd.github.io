On the 24th of June, in the morning, I called him up, and he went down stairs, and after he had been down a few minutes, I heard a great fall, which was the till, and being full it made a great noise; I immediately got up and went down and found the boy was gone, he had absconded, left the shop shut up, and pulled to the door after him; I opened the shop myself and went in pursuit of him; I went to his father and mother's in Oxford street; but he had not been there; accordingly I went to Marlborough-street, and went in search of him with an officer; at last we found him in St. James's Park, in the grass or the Parade, where they were mounting guard, with the money; we found the money in his hat, halfpence to the amount of one pound thirteen shillings and nine-pence halfpenny, and a clasp knite.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know these halfpence are your's? - I cannot swear to them.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you swear to that clasp knife being your's? - I think I can; I had a a knife of that sort; it is a remarkable knife, being a French knife; two or three days before it lay about the kitchen. I understand he comes of a very good family, and only fifteen years of age; I recommend him to mercy; I hope you will consider that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Attenborough, a pawnbroker, in Bridge-house-place.

                  </hi>. I am a goldsmith and jeweller, at No. 18, Poultry, in the parish of St. Mildred the Virgin. I have two partners—the prisoner Edwin was in our service about four years, and left about nine months since—Wil<lb></lb>liam was between three and four years in our service, and was so still on the 7th of Sept. last—he was a sort of under-shopman—it was his duty to attend to the shop in the daytime, and of an evening, to see that no one entered the premises—he slept behind the shop, in a sort of lobby connected with the shop—he was placed there to have personal charge of the shop in the night—our property was kept in cases—I have seen some articles produced by the officer—they were usually kept in a glass case on the counter—we kept watches in the same place as the chains, pins, and brooches—the cases were secured by a lock—he was not intrusted with the key of those cases at night—either myself or brother, whichever was stopping latest, locked up the cases, and put the keys into an iron safe—that was at the close of business in the evening—we locked up the place, and took away the keys—William was directed on no account to let any one in to sleep on the premises—here are three watches, Nos. 29084, 29114, and 29088—they are the property of myself and partners, and have never been sold—on Monday, the 9th of Sept., in consequence of information I had of a loss, I went to Horsemonger-lane gaol—I there saw Edwin Hart ridge in custody—after I had seen him I re<lb></lb>turned with the officers to my shop—I found William Hartridge in the counting-house—Inspector Waller asked him if he knew where his brother was—he said he did not—I then gave him in charge—he burst into tears, and made a statement to me—he did not make any statement about the watch that was pawned in Aug., or about anything that happened before that time—the watches produced were purchased of Mr. Stauffer—on examining my stock, I found they were missing—I had missed neck-chains prior to this, prior to my being aware that the watches were gone—I missed a neck-chain about the first week in July—shortly before that time I had seen that neck<lb></lb>chain in the possession of William Hartridge—it had been purchased of a gentleman named Taylor—I had taken it out of the window, for the purpose of having it washed, and gave it to William—I have seen two breaat-pins, with stones in them—they are my property, and have my private mark on them—there are two brooches—to the best of my belief they are ours—these have not our mark—we have such in our stock—I cannot say whether any are missing.</p>

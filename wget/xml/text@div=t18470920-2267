I had some lead on the roof of my own private house at Croydon—I had a new roof put on that house—the old lead had been removed—I sold it to Warner and Sons—Salmon was a carman in our service—he was sent to Croydon for the purpose of removing the lead, and he was ordered to call at our place in the Borough—he would have no business in Bermondsey-street with the cart on the 31st of Aug.—it is not in the direction from Croydon to my house in the Borough, or to Mr. Warner's—this lead worth 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt.</p>

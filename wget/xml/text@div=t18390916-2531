                  </persName>. I am a baker, and live in Mason-place, Little Chelsea. The prisoner was my servant for about ten weeks—she did not sleep in the house—I had one till in each counter—about half-past five o'clock, on Sa<lb></lb>turday morning, the 17th of August, I had some money in both tills, which I saw safe when I locked the tills up the night before—I left in one of</p>

               <p>them a silver sixpence, and the other monies stated, and two silver thim<lb></lb>bles—it was safely locked up at half-past five o'clock—about half-past seven o'clock, the same morning, I missed the till and the money—I asked the prisoner if she had seen the till—she said she had not—I found the till on the Sunday night in the privy—on the Monday morning I sent for a policeman, who took the prisoner—I followed him with her to the station-house—I saw her, in going, take a bag from her bosom, and throw it away—it contained a lot of sweetmeats out of the glass and was one of my bags.</p>

On the Monday morn<lb></lb>ing after the till was found on the Sunday night, I called up the prisoner, and accused her of taking the till—she swore she had never seen it—I said the key of my drawer was in the till, and no one had had access to my room but her—I had lost many other things, but I never suspected her—I said I would forgive her for every thing that was not under lock and key, but for using my key to open the till I would not forgive her.</p>

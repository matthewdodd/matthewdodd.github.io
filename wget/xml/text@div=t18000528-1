             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer: On Thursday, the 6th of March, I went in company with other officers up one pair of stairs in a house in Gloucester-court, between Golden-lane and Whitecross-street; when I came to the door I looked through the key-hole; I opened the door and went into the room, with Mason and Ray; I found in that room the prisoner Blakesley, Wright the accomplice, Hayes Jones, another prisoner, who is since dead, and the prisoner Hale sitting by the fire-side on a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose lodgings these were? - A. The landlady is here; in the window were these two one pound Bank-notes; the prisoners were secured, with the bed, two pillows, and bolsters, that were in that room; we took them all to the office; I left Hayes at the office giving his deposition, and I went with Vickery and Mason, two other officers, to a room in Red-lion-court, Red-lion-market, I believe it is called, in Whitecross-street; I went up two pair of stairs, and broke the room-door open; there I found this carpet, a bed, three pillows, a bolster, two images, and sundry other things, which I put into a coach, and went to Hayes's house in Golden-lane, and brought Mrs. Hayes to the office, who had the key of that room; there was a woman laid in that room, though Mrs. Hayes kept the key; I took her into custody, but she was discharged; I took Mrs. Hayes to the office, her word was taken, and she came when the Magistrates ordered her; her husband was kept; I delivered them to Mrs. Davies in Court last sessions, and put my mark upon them; these are the same things, there is my name upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Davies. I am very sure they are all mine; they are the things that I left in my house in February, and that I missed when I returned home.</p>

               <p>Q. You have once sworn to that Jury that you had no room in your house for those things, is that true or not? - A. I had no room, because they were in the passage; I had no room convenient to put them in; the shop and the kitchen laid open, and I did not think that was proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no place above stairs? - A. None but my own sleeping room.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you go there? - A. We went with a horse and cart; we unbolted the garden-gate and went in, and found the door as Davis and I had left it on the Monday before.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you leave the door when you left it on Monday? - A. We pulled the house-door to, and left some stones between the door and the doorpost.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What did you do then? - A. We pushed the door with our knees, and it went open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it require any degree of force to open it? - A. No; then we went into the house, and I brought out a bed that laid in the passage, and put it in the cart; after which Blakesley brought out another bed that was in the passage; we went up one pair of stairs, and brought the carpet down.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that carpet; do you believe it to be the same? - A. It was like this; there were two china images, three pillows, two bolsters, and some chimney ornaments; they were all put into a cart; we brought them to town, and took them to Jones's apartments, somewhere in Whitecross-street; we took the things up to his room; Blakesley helped to take the things out; then we wanted a purchaser; we shewed them to two or three persons, and they would not buy them; then I went to Henry Hayes, in the afternoon of that same day; he lives in Golden-lane; I told him what articles we had got, and he came along with us to look at them; Blakesley asked eleven guineas for the property, and Hayes refused; he said he would give five guineas and a half; we did not agree to let him have them, and he returned to his home; and then Blakesley went to tell him he should have them; Hayes came back with him, and he was to have them for five guineas and a half; he paid half-a-guinea earnest; Hayes took one bed away with him, and the carpet, and the chimney ornaments; then he returned again for the other bed, and as he was paying the money to Blakesley, while we were there, the officers, Armstrong, Ray, and Mason came in.</p>

               <p>Q. We have heard that Hale was in the room at the time? - A. Yes, she was sitting down by the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any thing to do with the sale of the articles? - A. No.</p>

            , and Mrs. Hale; when I returned with my little girl, they were there then; I gave her the ornaments, and they took the carpet; this is the carpet, as near as I can judge; I took the carpet home and returned again, and found them all there then; I then packed up the bed, two pillows, and one bolster; then one of the three men, I cannot say which, asked me for half a guinea, to discharge a cart that they had to fetch these things in; I gave them half a guinea, I think it was to Blakesley; I then took home the bed and the two pillows and the bolster; I then went back again, and they were all there then; I took them money with me, and I began to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay them all in cash? - A. No; there were two one-pound notes; one of them was torn a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two? - A. These are the same; Blakesley put the money in his pocket, all but the notes; they were put in the window, and then the officers came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Blakesley and you having any conversation about where the goods came from? - A. No, they did not tell me; Blaksley said they came from the country; I think it was him; I had no other conversation with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you think these goods fairly and honestly come by? - A. No; I did not think about it.</p>

               <p>Q. You are training her up early? - A. I never bought any thing in my life before; my wife keeps the shop, and my business is out-door.</p>

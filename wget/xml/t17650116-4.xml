            . On the 27th of December, in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop; and asked me if I would buy a coat and waistcoat: I seeing they were livery cloaths, asked him if he had a right to sell them; he said he had: that his brother was a livery servant to one Mr. Fleetwood, on Ludgate-hill, and he came from him. I agreed to give him 5 s. and a pair of red shag breeches; but said he must bring me some body of credit, to prove what he had said, or I would go with him to his brother; he then began to hesitate, and wanted to have the things again: I could not leave my shop, but sent my brother with him, who returned, and gave me room to suspect they were stole. I then advertised the coat and waistcoat, and Mr. Forrester's servant came and owned them, (produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I met a man in Queen-street, who had those cloaths on his arm; he desired me to go and sell them for him, and when I was stopt he ran away.</p>

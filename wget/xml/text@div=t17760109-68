               <p>Was any body in the summer-house when you went in? - No, there was a large fire and a pot with metal melting upon it, and many implements for coining; in the garden we found a blunderbuss broke asunder in the stock; it was loaded very deep.</p>

               <p>Was there any body else? - No: when I got over the back pails into the garden, I peeped through the window and saw them in the summer-house; Minion was sitting by the fireside; Harris had a pair of scissors and some metal in his hand, which he was clipping; then I immediately burst the door open upon them; Harris directly presented a blunderbuss to me, I drew back directly; then he came into the garden, and Minion after him; Minion hit me with a garden rake; we had a fight, he knocked me down with it; then Harris threw away the blunderbuss, and went over the pails; after Harris was gone over the pails, Minion and I had a fight for two or three minutes together, he had a garden rake in his hands; he got away from me and run over the pails, and I after him; and I never lost sight of him till I took him.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice what there was in the summer-house? - I did not go into the room.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. You say you saw Harris with an instrument in his hands; a pair of scissors or a pair of shears? - A pair of scissors; he was clipping the metal.</p>
               <p>In what form? - In long slips rather more than an inch wide.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Whitechapel-road.</p>
               <p>What is your employment? - An officer in Whitechapel court.</p>
               <p>Are you in any other office? - No other duty but that.</p>

               <p>What may that office be? - To arrest people for forty shillings, and under 5 l.</p>
               <p>I understand you attend some justice's office besides? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do not you execute warrants sometimes? - No; but if I hear of any coiners, I go after them, if it is fifty miles, to take them.</p>
               <p>Then you have an enmity to coiners? - I have suffered a good deal by them myself.</p>
               <p>Who gave you information to go after these men? - Mr. Cooper.</p>
               <p>Was there any thoroughfare to this summer-house? - None at all; it stands at one corner of a wall; there is a gate forwards and another backwards.</p>
               <p>How did you get to the summer-house? - I got over the pails; that was the only way I could go to them that they should not see me.</p>
               <p>There was another way to them? - A gate opposite the summer-house and a path: they would have seen me if I had gone that way.</p>
               <p>Which window was it you looked into? - The window forward; it was the height of my breast.</p>
               <p>Were there two windows or only one to that room? - The door is in the middle, there is a window on each side.</p>
               <p>Do these windows front the path of the first gate? - Yes; the windows were open<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090057"></xptr> above, but there was a half blind where Harris was at work, but I could see over that.</p>
               <p>That blind was put to prevent people seeing, but it did not prevent them? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the blind or window was not above your breast? - It might be a little higher; I looked in for a minute or a minute and half.</p>
               <p>Then nobody saw you? - Not till I made a push.</p>
               <p>Nobody was upon the watch to see if any one looked in? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there a pathway any one might walk in and a gate? - Yes, but it was locked and had iron spikes upon it.</p>
               <p>Could they have come back along that path without getting upon the gate? - There are two gates to the summer-house, one before and one behind; the gates were both locked.</p>
               <p>How came you to know that the fore gate was locked? - I tried and found it was fastened before I got in the back way.</p>
               <p>If that gate had been open you would have gone in that way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And if you had gone in at that gate you would have gone fronting the summer-house? - Yes.</p>

               <p>This is a flask in which any metal is cast, it is just in the state as when, first made; the shillings that now lie upon the sand are good shillings laid for the purpose of making impressions: here is a channel made of sand, and through that the impressions are fed by the metal; the flask casts about fifty shillings at a time.</p>
               <p>Does it appear to you that this bad money that is produced was cast in that flask? - First, here is the spray, as the founders call it, what they make the channel from, then here is the exact form in the base metal, which is what remains after those moulds have been filled up; here is a good shilling now lying in the flask, and here is a counterfeit which has been cast from it; there are in this parcel several counterfeit shillings resembling the good shillings in the flask; this is a crucible, there is metal now in it, it appears to be a mixture of silver and copper, by aqua fortis and water, they are purged, and the silver comes upon the surface; the counterfeit shillings want rubbing and filing to clean them, to make them represent shillings; and it appears that these counterfeit shillings have been cut off by scissors; there is sand paper here that is used to fine and clean them: when the moulds are made and the shillings turned out, the flasks are secured together in the screw press, which keeps, them firm, and of an exact thickness.</p>

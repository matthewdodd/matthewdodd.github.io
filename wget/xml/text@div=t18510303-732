                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live at Ware, in Hertfordshire. On 10th Feb. I drove to the Two Brewers public-house, at Ponder's End—I got there about half-past twelve o'clock at night—I took the horse out of the cart, and went into the house—I went into the tap-room to warm myself—after a little time I went and laid my bead on the table—I had then about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., all in silver, in half-crowns, shillings, 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-pieces, and sixpences—it was in a purse in my left-hand trowsers pocket—I felt it in my pocket when I laid down and went to sleep—I had not counted it at all—it was what I took the day before, and two days before, and some the same night—the ostler came in and awoke me up, and asked if I had lost anything—I felt, and I had lost my money—I went out, but could not find any one—I met the policeman, and gave this account.</p>

I was with my brother, at the Two Brewers—he laid his head on the table in the tap-room—I do not know that he was asleep—I laid down on the other table; I did not go to sleep—I saw three persons come in; the prisoner was the first that came in I believe—he came and stood before the fire—I knew him well—my brother was sleeping near a settle—the prisoner stood for a minute or two—he then went and sat down on the bench at the head of the table, where my brother was—he then laid as if he was laying his arm over my brother, as if he was going to sleep—he laid on him for some minutes, but I took no particular notice—the last I saw of him was, he was up, and was between the table and the window, which are about two yards apart—that was seven or eight minutes after he laid down, or hardly that—I did not see him go out of the room; he must have gone out very quietly—one of the other two men who came in was Revell—I know the other man by sight, but I do not know his name—the other man went out soon, before the prisoner laid on my brother—the ostler came in, and shook my brother—he said, "Jack, have you lost anything?"—he said, "What? what? I have lost my money!"—I said, "Amos Green has got your money, I saw him lie on the top of you"—we went out to search for Green, but did not find him.</p>

On the night in question the two witnesses were at the Two Brewers—Green, Revell, and Charles Love came in afterwards—I had been asleep, and these three men coming in, awoke me—when I awoke, I saw John Wren lying asleep on the table—I saw Love follow the ostler out—(the ostler had been in the tap-room after he had helped to take the horse out of the cart)—Revell went out a little while after—when the ostler was gone out, and Revell, I saw the prisoner sit by the side of John Wren, and lean over him—he <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> himself up a little, and began to fumble John</p>

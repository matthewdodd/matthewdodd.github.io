            , whose maiden name was Cooper. I first became acquainted with the defendant at Stowmarket fair, on the 12th of July, and saw him again on the 15th of August, but not between those times. I was often with my sister and never saw them together, except at those times. I never saw him at my mother's house. On Sunday afternoon, the 15th of August, I and my sister went to church; it was a rainy day; we were dressed in white muslin; we saw the defendant in the church-yard, while we were at church, and in a quarter of an hour we came out of church, we were walking in the fields, not going home; he came after us, and walked a little way in the fields, and it rained so fast that we turned back, and went into Mrs. Jarr's cottage; we had come out of church? between three and four o'clock - we sent for dry gowns to put on, and staid in the cottage, in the defendant's company, till about seven o'clock or later; it was getting dark. Before we left the cottage he went out, and returned in an hour: I do not know that he said anything to my sister, but she and him went out: I had heard no proposition made to her; we came out and walked a little way, and then saw a post chaise in the lane - I expected to see a pony and gig, not a post chaise. I saw my sister cry before she got into the chaise, but did not hear anything said to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to get in - A. He helped her in; he took hold of her arm, and the post-boy took hold of her arm too; they were close to the chaise when they took hold of her arm, to help her in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she willing to go in with their help - A. No, I do not think that she was. I was in the chaise afterwards - it drove to Ipswich; there were four of us in the chaise; they told us that they would not take us any farther than Stowmarket; we had an elder sister living there. Catherine wanted them to stop to see her sister, but the post-boy was told to drive on faster, and he drove to Ipswich - we got there between nine and ten o'clock - the defendant had a pistol, and said if any one came to the chaise to stop the horses, or meddle with us he would shoot them - we did not stop at Ipswich longer than a quarter of an hour. A coach came up which was going to London, and we were put on the roof of it. I sat next to my sister, and the defendant sat on the opposite side. We had no clothes but what were on our backs. We had no idea of going to town when we got into the chaise. The defendant carried the pistol to London with him; it was loaded. We arrived at the White Horse, Fetter-lane, about nine o'clock in the morning, and then went to the Bell and Crown, Holborn; went to church next day, and my sister was married to the defendant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley addressed the Jury on behalf of the defendant; and called several witnesses who deposed to his good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 4, Romney Street, Westminster and work for Jackson and Son, contractors and builders—on Sunday, 14th April, a little after eleven p.m., I was crossing Victoria Street, and saw the three prisoners and a smaller man not in custody, at the corner of the Palace Hotel and Tothill Street—I had seen them all before at various times—I passed them, and heard mumbling voices between them, but did not discern any particular words—whilst passing on to go to Great Smith Street the man not in custody walked past me (the others walked quickly behind)—when he got about four or five yards in front of me he gave some signal—I was then just across the street into Great Smith Street, they said either "Clock" or "Click," I took it to be "Clock," and the instant after<lb></lb>wards the taller man (<hi rend="italic">Archibald</hi>) throttled me from behind, put his hands over my mouth, and his knees in my back, which drew my head back and rendered me powerless, whilst Casey rifled my pockets—Archibald throttled mo so tightly that I could not breathe—Coyle fixed me by the hands and left side, whilst Casey rifled my pockets—he took a florin and a half-crown and a two-bladed pocket-knife from my right-hand trousers pocket, and a handkerchief from my jacket pocket—I had sixpenny worth of halfpence in my left waistcoat pocket, but they did not find that—there was the light of the gas at the side of the road—I am positive of the three prisoners—I saw all their faces—I saw Archibald's face as soon as he let go of me—I turned instantly round and looked him full in the face, to see who the fourth was—I had seen the others—I am confident of them all—I called "Police!" at</p>

               <p>the time, having hold of Coyle—I held him till Casey and Archibald came back to his help; no police came—the other two ran away, but they returned and got Coyle from me, tripped me up, hit me on the eye, and kicked me on the side, so that I was bound to release my hold—they tripped me up on my back, and all got away—the fourth man took no further part than giving the signal, he departed there and then, and never came back—I could not take much notice of him, because I only saw him as he passed, and would not be certain of him—I went back into Victoria Street, found a policeman on duty, and described the men who had attacked me—Coyle was dressed similar to what he is now, but he had no white slop on at that time—Casey was dressed as he is now, and Archibald had a black shabby coat on, and a different cap to what he was wearing to-day in the Court—I told the policeman that Archibald had a dark suit on, instead of the jacket he is now wearing—on the next Wednesday morning Cook fetched me to he police-station, Westminster—nine persons were taken out into the yard, and I picked out Coyle directly—I passed by once—I was cautioned by the inspector to be sure to pick out the right man, not to give the wrong man into custody, and keep him there—I am quite sure Coyle is the man—I saw Casey the same afternoon in the same station-yard, and eleven more with him—I picked him out at once—I saw Archibald on the following Monday, the 22nd, in the same station-yard—there were eight more with him—I picked him out as fast as the others—I am quite sure these are the men.</p>

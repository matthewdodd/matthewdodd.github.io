Bank of England note in his sob; I asked him where he got it, he said he took it out of my till.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise? - A. I told him, if he answered all the questions I put to him truly, I would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then do not tell us any thing he said after that - do you know that note to be your's? - A. I looked at the note and found it to be a note that I had paid my man for his wages on the Saturday night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was your man's note? - A. No; on the Monday my man's wife came and bought a gown of me. (Produces the note).</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the note, and tell me if you believe it to be the same note? - A. I believe it to be the very same note; I found a pair of stockings in his bed within an hour after I had found the note upon his person; he said he took them on the Monday; I cannot speak to the stockings.</p>

               <p>Q.But you had told him you would forgive him? - A. I said, if he told me the truth, but he did not tell me the truth, he told me he had no money at all, that he had no breeches pockets.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you write upon it? - A. I had wrote upon it before; I had received it for Mr. Fisher from a person at the other end of the town, what become of the note after I put it in the drawer, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 12th of August, I was behind my master counter, and saw this note lying upon the ground, not knowing it was my master's, I put it in my pocket, intending, if there was any mention made to give it back; I was sent out, and when I came back again, I forgot it; my master, in the evening, went to my mother's, and then searched me, and I being frightened, said, I had no pockets to my breeches, and then my master felt and found this note in my pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010916-7-verdict33" type="verdictDescription">

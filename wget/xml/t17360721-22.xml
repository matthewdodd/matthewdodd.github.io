               <p>Edward Berry. I had taken 100 l. and clapped it down in a great Chair in the Chamber, about the 10th or 11th of June I think it was. I thought my Wife would have look'd it up, but she forgot it. Some Time after, the Monday after (I believe) she said she did not remember she had lock'd up the 100 l. up Stairs we went, and saw the Bag in the Chair, but there was seven Guineas taken out. We had heard where the Prisoner had been merry-making, and where she had spent a great deal of Money; so my Wife challenged her with taking these Guineas; she told us several different Stories, and we concluded to take her up. At first she denied the Fact, then she confest she took six Guineas, but would not tell what became of the other. She owned at another Time, that my Wife was going to pay a Chapman, and her Hands being grease, while she went into the Yard to wash them, she took ten Guineas, and two Guineas out of a Closet, while the Bed was making. I asked her, if none of her Acquaintance had been in my House, she said yes; and that they had tried by a pick Lock Key to open my Drawers; but it not doing, if she had not been found out, she was to have had a whole Bunch the next Day, and then they should have taken all they found.</p>
               <p>The Constable. Her Mistress said she would not hurt her if she would confess, and she owned in my Hearing she took six Guineas.</p>
               <p>Defence. I am innocent; my Master and Mistress said they would not hurt me, if I would confess I took the Money. <rs id="t17360721-22-verdict114" type="verdictDescription">

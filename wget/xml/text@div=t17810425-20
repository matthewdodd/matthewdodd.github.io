               <p>On the 4th of March, between seven and eight in the evening, I was going along by the dead wall facing the Belvidere, near <placeName id="t17810425-20-crimeloc100">Islington</placeName>

               <p>Explain how he put his hands into your mouth.</p>
               <p>All the fingers of both his hands: as they threw me down, I saw a knife just at my mouth, lying on the ground, open; I took up the knife, and threw it in the ditch.</p>
               <p>What were the four men doing, when you took up the knife? - One pressed upon me, the others were trying to rob me, and this man had his hands in my mouth.</p>
               <p>Had you your eyes and hands so at liberty as to see and take up the knife? - Yes; my face and my gums were swelled; I halloo'd out Murder! three times; the last time a gentleman, Mr. Savage, was coming up, upon which three of them ran towards Merlin's cave; the prisoner, to save himself, jumped into the ditch, with my hat in his hand; the prisoner got into the field with my hat in his hand; I told the gentleman that was the man that had robbed me of my hat.</p>
               <p>Did they demand any money of you, or what did they say? - They did not demand any money, as I heard; they took nothing from me but my hat: they were with me about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>What were they doing all that time? - Trying to rob me; one was searching my pockets, the others kneeled upon me.</p>
               <p>Had you nothing in your pockets? - Yes; gold, silver, and my watch.</p>

               <p>How came they to take nothing? - Because I had my face downwards, and they could not get at my pockets so well; I had my face downwards all the time they were with me.</p>
               <p>Then how could the man have his hands in your mouth? - He had his hands in my mouth, and my face was downwards.</p>
               <p>Were you sober? - Yes; I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Did you know the gentleman before that came up? - No; I never saw the gentleman that came up before: when I told him that was the man, he pursued him down the road, and caught him in the ditch; he knocked him down; I went to him, and the gentleman asked me if I could swear to him; I said I could swear to the man who had his hands in my mouth: we took the man to the Blue Lion in Gray's-inn-lane, and charged a constable with him; they asked me what I had lost; I said my hat;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250029"></xptr> two men went with a lantern, and one found the hat, and the other the knife.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see the hat yourself? - I saw it in his hand, about twenty yards on the other side of the ditch.</p>
               <p>How far were you from the ditch? - About 27 or 28 yards.</p>
               <p>Was there any hedge? - No.</p>
               <p>This was between seven and eight in the evening; was it light? - The moon was just rising; I could distinguish him from the rest.</p>
               <p>Was it so light you could distinguish a man at the distance of 27 or 28 yards, with an hat? - Yes; I could.</p>
               <p>When you was in this situation, lying with your face to the ground, could you distinguish this man so as to know him again? - Yes; I am sure that is the man; I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>What did you observe him by? - His blue coat that he has now; I took particular notice of his face; he was the first person I looked at before I was pulled down.</p>
               <p>What did the others do, when they attacked you? - They did nothing but hold my head down.</p>
               <p>How came you to take notice of him? - I generally take notice of the first person I meet; I took notice of him, because I suspected they were upon no good.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A tallow-chandler; in business for myself.</p>
               <p>You was perfectly sober this night? - Yes, as I am now.</p>

               <p>The instant these men laid hold of you, they pulled you down? - I was down immediately.</p>
               <p>You have heard of 40 l. reward? - No.</p>
               <p>Did nobody tell you of it? - They told me of it at Sir

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Sunday the 4th of March, between seven and eight in the evening, I was coming down near the Belvidere; I heard the cry of murder; I immediately ran across the road; there was a young man got to the turnstile before me; I asked him what was the matter; he said he did not know, there seemed to be several people as if they were fighting; I made up to them as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>Who was the young man you first spoke to? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Were the people fighting at some distance? - Yes; under the wall by the reservoir of the New River; when I came near, three men ran one way, and one jumped into a ditch that goes across the field. I saw the prosecutor appeared very bloody, and very confused; he could hardly speak; I asked him what was the matter, and after a very short time, he told me these fellows had robbed him; that the fellow was one who had jumped into the ditch, and at that time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250030"></xptr> had his hat in his hand; I think I saw a hat in his hand myself, but I will not speak positively to that; I think I saw something in his hand.</p>
               <p>Had he a hat on his head? - I did not look; the prosecutor saying he had his hat in his hand, I looked, and ran after the prisoner immediately: the prosecutor had no hat; I ran round by the road to the end of the field; there was a ditch, and by the watch-box I saw this man, who appeared dirty, as if he had been in the ditch.</p>
               <p>About how far did you go round to come to the road? - I dare say it was 200 yards, or more.</p>
               <p>During that time was the man in your sight? - No.</p>
               <p>What sort of night was it, light or dark? - Rather light; it was a very fine evening.</p>
               <p>Was the moon up, or not? - I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Was you near enough to the man who jumped into the ditch, to know he was the man you found at the watch-house, exclusive of his being dirty? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I did not use any ceremony, but knocked him down, believing him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect whether that man had an hat on? - He had a round hat on at the time I knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Was you near enough to see what sort of a hat the man had in his hand who jumped into the ditch? - I was not; when he got up, he attempted to get away; I struck him several times with my fist; a little man came up, and I desired him to feel in the man's pocket; he did, and said he had nothing; I felt in one pocket, but found nothing; when he found I had got the better of him, he said, I had knocked him down before, and had robbed him of two shillings; I kept him by the collar till the prosecutor came up; I asked him, if that was the man he wanted? He said, yes; that was the man that came up, and put his hands in his mouth: somebody came up, and struck the prisoner; I desired them to let him alone; I had got him, and would take care of him; I never let his collar go till I brought him to the Blue Lion in Gray's-Inn Lane.</p>

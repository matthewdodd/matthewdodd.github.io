I went out about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, leaving nobody at home, it is only a shop and parlour. I slept there the night before, and intended to sleep there that night. I got home at half-past ten o'clock, and found a key broken in the lock; the door was shut, but not locked, and all the place completely ransacked. I had locked the door when I went out - all the drawers were taken out, and every thing value able gone. I lost upwards of 300 l. of property. When Purse and Pearson were apprehended, they each wore one of my waistcoats. I have found none of my jewellery.</p>

            . I am a single woman. Mr. Spiller bought me this pelisse at Jones's shop for 30 s.; he keeps a public sale shop. I have often bought things there - it hung up in the shop. I went to him on the 25th of June, and asked him if it was stolen - he said, No, I need not be afraid of wearing it - this was after I had seen Mr. Giles. It had been turned, and that I turned it again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You saw Mr. Giles on the 25th - A. Yes, I met him him in the Strand, and saw him after that at No. 4, Off-alley - it is difficult to speak to a thing after it is turned - all the work is taken out. I gave the full value of it. I wore it upwards of a month after Giles saw it. I bought it the end of April or beginning of May.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to meet Giles at this house - A. I met him in the Strand, and he told me immediately he got into the house, that the pelisse I had on was his; he gave me the name of Thomas, Cleveland-row, St. James's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. All that passed between you, was his claiming the pelisse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. GILES. These waistcoats are mine, and the pelisse my wife's. About five or six weeks after the robbery I met Bell in the Strand, wearing this pelisse; she is very much like Mrs. Giles's sister. Her two sisters had pelisses alike. I was going to speak to her, but found out my mistake; I merely went with her to find out where she bought it; I gave her a wrong address, not choosing her to come to my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How do you know the waistcoats - A. By the make; here is a mark of soapsuds which I frequently make in washing myself; there is a cut at the corner; my waistcoats are all made in this way. My servant absconded the morning after the robbery.</p>

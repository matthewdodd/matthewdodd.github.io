                  </hi>. I am the manager of the Shovel public-house, New-road, St. George's—on Friday afternoon, 11th July, the prisoner came for a glass of half-and-half which came to three halfpence—I gave it her, and she gave me a sixpence—I gave her change, and placed the sixpence underneath the tap by itself, not in the till—a few minutes afterwards 1 took it up and discovered that it was bad—I then went out with the sixpence in my hand, in search of the prisoner, and found her in Grove-street, and I gave her in custody, with the sixpence—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoe-maker, and live in Crown-row, Mile End-road, in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney, On Saturday night, the 12th of March, at half-past eight o'clock, I was sitting at work in my shop—the window was broken—I heard it broken—it was suddenly done—I observed a head in the broken pane of glass—I am quite certain the pris<lb></lb>oner Smith is the person whose head came thought the pane—it was not large enough in admit the whole of his head through, but there was not a bit of glass as large as a shillings left in the square—my wife ran to the door first—I at first thought it was a person intoxicated, but Smith did not move, because he was well aware that we could not get out, for my wife first ran to the door, and found it fast—I went myself, and found it was fast<lb></lb>ened from the outside—I immediately pulled away my wife, and with the assistance of my wife and daughter, forced the door open—I found it was tied with a cord, but I got my hand in, and three nails of the latch broke by my forcing it—the rest were drawn—I then got out, and saw three lads running—had it been daylight—I could have seen them further, but from the lamp of a butcher's shop I could see them running—a rope was tied on the latch, and then on the scraper of the door—when I got out, I found the three persons running—I had been very ill for several days, and for two days I was in bed, and I was sitting at work with my nightcap on—I had not been out of bed above three hours, and I dare say they thought I could not run—I did not know either of the prisoners before—I did not see Smith's face through the glass, it was his head&amp;—; when I got round the counter, I heard two shoes drawn out of the window—I missed them from the window—there were three lads running together—I was confident it was not a boy who stood under the window, by the bulk of him, and his jacket, he had a cap on, and of the three lads Smith was the most bulky—I am con<lb></lb>fident he is the person I saw through the glass—I only saw the top of his bead—I did not see either of them stopped—I called, "Stop thief"—I have no particular reason for saying Smith is the person whose head I saw through the window, only by his dress—I saw him brought in custody the same night, and he appeared to be dressed the same as the person whose head was through the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, at No. 22, Crown-row, near Mr. Tunbridge's shop. About half-past six o'clock on Saturday, the 12th of March, I saw all the three prisoners standing together, next door to the shop of Mr. Tunbridge—they walked about till about half-past eight, all three together—they passed backwards and for<lb></lb>wards, and passed me several times—they went as far as Bencroft's three or four times—they were walking up and down for about two hours—Thomas Hughes was with me—we watched them together—I called the attention of a policeman to them, and they crossed over directly—I told the policeman, and he took no notice of them, and they came on to Mr. Tunbridge's side again—I heard a cry of "stop thief," and they all ran from Mr. Tunbridge's window up to Crown-place, and went down Crown-place—Smith had a little stick with him, which he threw away—I went as far as White-house-lane after them, and Stone and Higgins came back about halfway—that was about half-past eight o'clock—Stone was secured and put into Mr. Tunbridge's house—at the time I heard the alarm given, there was nobody but the prisoners running in a direction from Mr. Tunbridge's shop.</p>

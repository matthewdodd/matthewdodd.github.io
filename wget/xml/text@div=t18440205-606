                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">widow, Broad-street-buildings, City.</hi> On the afternoon of the 20th of Jan. I was at the corner of Cornhill, coming from Leadenhall-market—there were three persons at the corner—the prisoner was one—as I walked towards Bishopsgate-street, they kept round me, and I felt something touch my side—I turned round, and the prisoner had got his hand into my pocket—I immediately called out, "You have robbed me," and he ran away—I had two shillings in my pocket, which were gone—I had had them in my pocket about five minutes before—a person ran and brought him back—he said he was very sorry for what he had done, that he merely touched me, and I was frightened; he hoped I would let him go.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you and Archer been talking about this matter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I am quite sure I had two shillings in my pocket—I had put them into my pocket before I went to market, at half-past ten o'clock—I had put 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into my pocket—I had been to the market, and paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for my marketing—I had the remainder when I paid the last bills—I am sure they were not in sixpences—I only know I had two shillings, from reckoning the amount I had paid away—I fancied I had lost a comb, but I found that when I got home—I fancied it, when a comb was found on the prisoner—I said that was not my comb—I know I had some shillings in my pocket, because I felt them when I put my hand into my pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am time-keeper at the Flower Pot, Bishopsgate-street About twenty minutes past one o'clock in the afternoon of the 20th of Jan. I was in Bishopsgate-street—I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—the prisoner ran down Great St. Helen's—I ran down Crosby-square, and took him in St. Mary Axe—I took him back to the prosecutrix—he was searched at the station, and nothing found on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you hear him say anything to this lady? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The lady identified him—he said he was sorry for what had happened, would she forgive him?—I am quite certain that was what was said—I did not hear him say, "I did not pick your pocket, I only pushed against you," I did not tell the Magistrate so.</p>

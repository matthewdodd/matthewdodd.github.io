            . I am one of the day-patrole of Bow-street. About seven o'clock at night on the 8th of February, I was going down Bond-street, with my wife; I met three men walking backwards and forwards by Mr. Allen's house - the prisoner was one of them: I went a little further down and returned back; crossed at the corner of Maddox-street; I found there was a fourth person stood talking to them. I passed close by them and went up Maddox-street, a little way towards the church, then crossed over, and then stood under the shade of a lamp, with my wife, In two or three minutes I saw them all in a bustle, near Mr. Allen's shop, which is the first house round the corner from Maddox-street. I saw two of them cross over to the opposite side of Bond-street, right facing Mr. Allen's shop - I then ran towards Bond-street; but before I could get to Bond-street, the prisoner turned round into Maddox-street, with a parcel under his arm; he was running towards me, but on the opposite side. I ran after him, and laid hold of him by the collar; he had the bundle under his arm when I took him, but I could not then tell what was in it. I kept hold of him, though he made a desperate struggle - I called my wife to lay hold of the property. The prisoner unbuttoned his waistcoat, and let down his coat and waistcoat as low as his elbows. I then took hold of him by the neckcloth, and took him back to Mr. Allen's shop - my wife followed me, and so did the shopman, who had come up. The parcel contained kerseymere; there was a number on it, but I cannot recollect what.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Daniel Allen; I have been there about ten months. I remember the kerseymere being brought from Mr. East's by Thomas Langdon, a little before four o'clock; it was put down in the shop, but not so near the door that any person could have reached it. Between six and seven o'clock in the evening I was at the back end of the shop, and I heard the door rattling, as if opening; I saw no one; I thought the wind had blown the door open; I then went on with my business, and presently after heard the rustling of paper; the kerseymere was in a paper, but was not behind the counter; I then went immediately to the door and missed it. I went to the corner of Maddox-street, and saw the prisoner and the officer struggling together, and saw Mrs. Dorrington with the roll of kerseymere. I assisted in taking the prisoner back to the shop. I saw the parcel opened, and it was the one which Langdon had brought; there was a number on it, and a bill of parcels, which was delivered to me; the value is about 17 l. or 18 l. The prisoner was taken to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). Though I feel conscious of my innocence - though I know myself to be guiltless of implication or intentional aid towards the crime, - yet I confess myself to be culpable; inasmuch as I have lent my assistance towards its perpetration, in the unconscious haste and inadvertency of the moment, without reflecting whether the person who employed me to carry the property from the premises had a right to its disposal. I most humbly implore you to consider the time and the place when I was engaged to perform this service. At so early an hour, and on premises so apparently unguarded, was it possible that I should entertain any suspicion as to the honesty of the transaction? A man (of whom I declare myself ignorant) meets me in the street - engages me to carry an article for him for a mile or so, and promises an adequate reward. I received the piece of cloth, and so firmly was I convinced of the honesty of the procedure, that even at the moment of apprehension I was fearless of any consequences injurious to myself. I had only two or three days before quitted a situation. I had been on that and the preceding day among my acquaintances, in the hope that I might gain early intimation of another. Perhaps on that unfortunate evening my friends might have induced me to partake of more than was consistent with propiety.</p>
               <p>One Witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

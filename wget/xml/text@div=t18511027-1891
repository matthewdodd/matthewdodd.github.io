                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Rosemary-lane. On 18th Oct., between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning, I came home, and kicked against t boy on the staircase—I called out to Elizabeth Haigh, who has lived with me as my wife for years, and said, <hi rend="italic">"Betsy,</hi> fetch me a light"—when the light was brought, I saw a boy, fourteen or fifteen years old—I asked him what business he had there; if he had a father and mother, and why he did not go home—he said his father would not let him in—I said he must be a very bad boy; and sent Elizabeth Haigh for a policeman, who came, and recognised him as a very bad character, and turned him out—on my sending for the policeman, the prisoner came from the second-floor, where she lives—she abused me, and called me everything that was bad; and abused my parents, who are dead—I said if she was anything like an honest woman, she had better be at home with her husband and two children—she went into her room, and returned again, and stabbed me in the nose and mouth—I had a candlestick in my hand—I did not see what she cut me with—I raid, <hi rend="italic">"Betsy,</hi> I am stabbed"—and she replied, "Yes, you are stabbed with a white-handled knife"—I said, "You go and fetch the police directly"—I put the candlestick on the floor, and with the loss of blood I dropped—a police<lb></lb>man came, and she was given in custody—I was taken on a stretcher to the London Hospital—I did not go into her room at all, or attempt to go to bed to her—she called out to her mother to come and assist me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Loney, as his wife. On this night, I took him down a lighted candle in an iron candlestick, and there was a boy lying in the passage—he asked the boy what he wanted—he said he was going to sleep—he asked him if he had a father and mother—he said he had, and they turned him out of doors—he said he must be a bad boy, and told me to get a policeman; I did so—the prisoner came down after the boy was gone, and abused Loney for having him removed—she used very bad expressions, and threatened to bring her brother next day to <hi rend="italic">wallop</hi> him—he said, "The man you fetch to <hi rend="italic">wallop</hi> me I value this," snapping his fingers—she said, "If I have not a man, I am man enough myself," and struck him down the face with a white-handled knife—she returned into her room, and said, "Mother! mother! I have done it; he may hang or transport me if he thinks proper'—Loney did not kick or ill treat the boy in my presence.</p>

After Loney was taken to the station, I went back to the house, and found two white-handled knives; but neither of them bad any blood on them—I found an iron candlestick, saturated with blood; I took it to the station, and on the following morning to the police-court—the prisoner said the candlestick was what the wound was inflicted with, and not the knife; and she should not have done it, but Loney came to her room, and knocked loudly, and asked her if she had lost anything, in consequence of a boy being on the stairs; that she said she had not; and said, "I think you might have been satisfied with beating the boy, without sending for a policeman to give him in charge," that he said he would beat her, and she struck him with the candlestick two or three times, and that might have been how the wound was inflicted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the London Hospital. On the morning of 18th Sept., Loney was brought there, extremely low from loss of blood; his nose and upper lip were divided with some sharp instrument—I could not say whether it was a knife or this candlestick; it might have been done with a candlestick, if it was used with great force—it will disfigure him; it will get very little better than it is now—it was dangerous; the loss of blood might bare occasioned loss of life, if it had not been attended to; it bad divided an artery.</p>

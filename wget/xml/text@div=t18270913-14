            . I am in partnership with Thomas Cross - we live at <placeName id="t18270913-14-crimeloc88">No. 44 and 45, Old Compton-street</placeName>

The prisoner was in our employ on the 28th of August, as a shopman - and, in consequence of suspicion, I employed Clements, the officer. On the 30th of August the prisoner was sent to Grosvenor-square, with some goods; he left our house apparently for that purpose - after he returned I saw him in the shop - no conversation passed between us that day; I called him up into my room next day, and asked him where he had been the day previous - he said he had been to Grosvenor-square, to a lady, whom he named - I said, "Powell, of course you took the goods under your arm as usual - walked all the way there and all the way back;" he said he did. I then asked if he had not got a lodging in Carnaby-market (we had furnished him with a lodging in Greek-street) - he said he had not; Clements was present, and said, "Have you, or have you not, a lodging in Carnaby-market, Powell?" and I think he said at an eating-house - he said "Yes, I have;" Clements searched him, in my presence, and found on him three keys; I afterwards went to a house in Carnaby-market, with the prisoner and Clements, and, on going up stairs, Clements asked him which was the door - he pointed to the front room on the second floor; we went into that room, which one of the keys opened, and found two deal boxes - Clements opened them with one of the keys which the prisoner had given him, and in those boxes we found all the goods stated in the indictment, which are worth 120l. or 130l. together - I knew them to be ours directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he said any thing, did you make him any promise or threat? A. No; he said he had brought the goods there - I had given him no permission to take any goods to any lodging whatever; I have seen him write - Clements produced an inventory of these goods in his hand-writing - I think it was in one of the boxes, but I first saw it in Clements' possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were any of these the goods he was sent with to Grosvenor-square? A. No part of them - they were all our property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is not the name of your parish St. Anue, Soho? A. No; I never heard of any other parish of St. Anne in Westminster - our house is in the liberty of Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the prisoner he could not he in a worse situation than he was, before he said any thing? A. No; nor any thing to that effect - I visited him after he was in custody, and questioned him. I know nothing about his being prevented from communicating with his solicitor - I know of no such order.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had he said the goods were yours, and taken by him before you visited him in prison? A. Certainly.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. In consequence of directions I watched the prisoner on Wednesday, the 29th of August, and saw him come out of his masters' shop with some rolls of silk, or something in a bulk - he went to the coach-stand in Dean-street, got into a chariot, and drove to Grosvenor-square - I followed, and waited till he came out of the house - he was in there above half an hour; he returned in the same chariot to Dean-street, then got out and walked to his masters' shop. On the following morning I saw him at Mr. Sewell's, and found the keys on him; I went with Mr. Sewell to Caruaby-market, and found the property, which I produce. Mr. Sewell's account is correct - when I searched him at Mr. Sewell's I found the keys - I also found this inventory on him; it remained in my possession till we found the goods - I had not looked at it till we found the goods. I produce the paper and the goods.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know he had been sent to Grosvenor-square on business? A. Yes; I watched him there and back.</p>
               <p>MR. SEWELL. This paper is in his hand-writing, and is anexact inventory of the goods in the boxes; I believe every piece of goods has our mark on it; the most valuable article here is a piece, containing forty-five yards, of black Genoa satin, which I am certain of; it cost us 4s. 11d. a yard, and is worth above 6l.; here are also twenty-two yards of Genoa satin, worth 4l. 19s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you measured this black satin? A. No; it has been measured in my presence since it has been found, by one of our shopmen, who is not here; there are about forty-five yards - I will swear there are forty yards. I saw the young man count it - 4s. 11d. is the cost price; it is certainly worth more than 5l. - we took him with the highest character, as a confidential servant; we had a good opinion of him; he had been four months with us.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence.</p>

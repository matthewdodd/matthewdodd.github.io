                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. William Stratton, who has two partners; they are linen-drapers, and live in the strand. On the night of the 16th of September the prisoner came and bought a stay-lace—I saw her looking over a basket, on the counter, with some remnants of ribbon in it—she took one from it, and put it under her cloak, and concealed it—I informed Mr. Stratton—he came round and spoke to the prisoner, and the policeman was sent for—the prisoner was searched up stairs, I believe.</p>

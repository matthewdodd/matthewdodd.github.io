                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the employ of Robert Nicholas Halfhead, of Walthamstow. On Wednesday morning, 19th May, about ten minutes past four o'clock, I came across a field near Mr. Halfhead's premises, and saw the prisoner standing in a field of Mr. Halfhead's, about a quarter of a mile from his premises—I stopped, and looked at him, and he went on towards Ferry Lane—I went towards Mr. Halfhead's shed, in the direction from which the prisoner was coming, and missed the lead off the shed, which I had seen safe the previous night when we left work—I went after the pri<lb></lb>soner, overtook him in Ferry Lane, and told him I wanted him to come back to Mr. Halfhead's; he said that there was no occasion for him to go back, but afterwards he went back, and when we got to the shed I told him I accused him of stealing the lead—he said that he should not steal such heavy luggage as that; if he did steal anything, it should be something lighter—I afterwards went to Ferry Lane with a policeman, and found the lead there, in a ditch, at a gate which I had seen the prisoner pass through—I compared it with the place from which it was missing, and it was the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How far was I from the foot path when you saw me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About sixty yards—the lead was found 100 yards from where I first saw you—I saw a person in the field going in the opposite direction, who one of my men went after—he was nearer to the lead than you, when we first saw him com<lb></lb>ing towards you—I saw you go out at the gate, you turned to the right, and the lead was to the left—one man passed the gate, that was not the same man—you walked about the premises pretty well half an hour before my master came—the lead was nailed down, it formed part of the gutter of the shed—you had no parcel when you went through the gate, nor were you different in bulk that I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you see the other person. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Ferry Lane, about eight yards from where the lead was found, coming in a direction from it—I do not know who he was, he had got a tin bottle and a handkerchief, as if he was going to work—the prisoner was sixty or seventy yards from the foot path—he said he was looking for birds' nests.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman N.</hi> 225.) On 19th May, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning. I was on duty in Ferry Lane about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Halfhead's—I received information, and went in search of the prisoner, but did not get him—after he was taken, I found these two pieces of lead (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)., weighing about fifty pounds, in a ditch in Ferry Lane—I compared them with the lead on the gutter and stabling, and they corresponded exactly—I saw some foot prints, coming from the shed towards Ferry Lane; I put one of the prisoner's boots hy the side of a mark which had been pre<lb></lb>viously made, close to the shed, and I observed another foot mark near another piece of lead, about 150 yards from the shed, and 2 or 3 yards from</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185806140079"></xptr>
               <p>the first print—it exactly corresponded with the prisoner's boots—when the prisoner was walking about near the shed, he did not go near the third piece of lead; I found no footmarks near that; it is hard ground there—the foot print was going away from the prosecutor's premises.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N.</hi> 19). On 19th May, about 6 o'clock, the prisoner was brought to me, charged on suspicion of stealing this lead—I searched him, and found this knife, which is hacked about a good deal, and a pair of pincers—I made an impression with the prisoner's boot, and the nails all corresponded—the other piece was found about three yards from the foot<lb></lb>marks, under the hedges, covered with grass.</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I know where the foot print was at the back of the shed—the prisoner did not go there with me, before the foot marks were examined.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> It is a case of mere suspicion; the man had time to take a quarter of an hour to go to his master's premises, and miss the property, and come back, and follow me; nothing was said about the footmarks on the two previous examinations; all I did wrong was to stray a few yards from the footpath; if there had been anything like guilt on my conscience, I had plenty of time to get away; this is a common pocket knife, and there are no marks on the lead, as if these pincers had been used; these are men's boots, and there are hundreds like them; there are no nails deficient; it is clearly proved that plenty of other men were about; who would be likely to have boots on like mine. I was first charged with trespass, and then it was turned into a felony.</p>

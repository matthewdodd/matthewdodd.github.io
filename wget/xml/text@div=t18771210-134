                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoners' Statements before the Magistrate. French says</hi>, "I went into a public-house with my two comrades and the other man, that was the last public-house we went into, and after we were in there about 10 minutes in all, came out. I said I should see about getting home, and I left my two comrades here along with the man. About five minutes after Dowsell came running down the road and caught me up. I said, 'Where is Baker?' he said "He is coming on, and after we had gone a little way Baker came up. I asked him where he had been and what he had been doing. He said 'Nothing much.' I knew nothing about the watch being stolen till I was put in the guard-room yesterday." <hi rend="italic">Baiter says</hi>, "I wish to say that I and Dowsell came out of the Rose and Crown. French went home. Arrow came out with us through being turned out, and said 'Let's come into the Two Brewers, we can get some more beer now;' so we went there and Dowsell paid for a pot of four-half ale. Then we was going home; as we was going along this man said we had stolen his sugar. Dowsell said 'Why, who stole your sugar?' he said 'Why, you did;' with that Dowsell struck him in the face, and he fell down in the road on the back of his head. I said to Dowsell "You had better go home, or else</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100112"></xptr>
               <p>you will get into trouble.' Dowsell then went on the road for home. I lifted the man up and saw that his watch was hanging from his pocket. with that I was tempted to take it. I did not strike the man." <hi rend="italic">Doir sell says</hi>, "On Saturday evening last, about the time specified, 9.30 or 10 o'clock, we was in the Rose and Crown drinking together. The prosecutor came in and began singing and dancing; he was drunk. We stopped in there for about a quarter of an hour afterwards; and the pro<lb></lb>secutor wanted some more beer, but, the landlord would not serve him, and he was turned out of the house.' When we got outside he said 'Let's come to another house and we can get some more beer.' We went to another public-house, I suppose the Two Brewers; we had some more beer there, stopped about live minutes, and then came out again. Just then French left us; we went to the corner of the street, where there is another public-house; we stopped at the corner of the street, and he said 'One of you has stolen my sugar.' I says 'Do you mean to say I stole it?' he said something and meant me; in the excitement of the moment I struck him. Baker told me I had better get home or I should get into trouble; from that I ran up the road and overtook French. French said 'Where is Baker?' I said 'He is behind, I expect he'll be up directly;' shortly afterwards Baker came running up and overtook us. I said 'What did you want to stop behind for?' he said 'Oh, nothing much.' We then walked up the road together till we got nearly to the barracks. I walked on a little quicker, and went into barracks by myself. I will swear I did not know anything about the watch or money being stolen till I was put into the guard-room."</p>

He wanted more beer, and the landlord would not serve him. We went to another house, I do not know the sign, and had some beer, which I paid for. When we came out French left us, and as we were going along there was a street about two minutes past the public-house, and we stood at the corner, and the prosecutor began blackguarding me, and accused me of stealing some sugar. I am very sorry that in the excitement of the moment I struck him and he fell down. Baker told me I had better go home, or I should get into trouble, and I went home, and Baker stopped behind. If I am convicted I shall be disgraced, and have to leave the service. There is a draft going out abroad next month, and I must ask you to allow me to go with them. It is very hard to stand at the corner of a street and be called a thief by a man, but I am very sorry that I struck him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Portman-market. I was in Mr. Souton's shop, in Newgate-market, on Good Friday morning; he is a wholesale butcher—I saw the prisoner there between eight and nine o'clock in the morning—I knew him before—he said to Mr. Souton, "Mind what you are about with that man, he it the b—st rogue in all England, and he will rob you, for he has robbed me"—I was dealing with Mr. Souton for some beef—he never mentioned any name—I went up to the prisoner and asked him for an explanation of what he had said—I said, "If I have robbed you, why not bring me to justice?"—he said, "Stand off, you b—thief, or else I will knock your brains out," or, "knock your head off," I am not certain which—he had nothing in his hand—I turned round to go away, and then I received a blow—I had not a chance to be on my guard against it—I did not see the blow coming—I did not see what he struck me with—I received a blow, and it made me senseless—the blow was struck under my right eye—it must nave been something tremendously hard, for it laid my cheek-bone open—I was knocked senseless against the window—the blood streamed down my face—I did not feel any pain, for I was stunned—it cut me to the bone—I had not struck him before he struck me—the moment I recovered, Mr. Venables said, "For God's sake don't let that man go, take him away, and lock him up;" I gave him in charge—I was led to St. Bartholomew's-hospital—I went to the Compter first, to give him in charge, and was led from there, to the hospital—my wound was dressed—they ordered me leeches and pills—they wished me to stop there, but I wished to go home, and I did—I was confined to my house, and did not go about my business—I kept my bed from Friday till the Tuesday evening.</p>

               <p>no hand on him—I said, "I want an explanation of what you have been saying"—I put my hand out, whether I touched him on the breast or not I cannot say—I neither touched him on the shoulder or collar—I may have touched him on the breast, but I cannot say whether I did or not, I was so confused—I will swear that when he said, "Keep your hands off, you villain," I did not say, "Not worse than you"—he did not attempt to push me away—when I went to him, he said, "Stand away, you b—thief, or else I will knock your brains out!"—when I first went up to him, he said, "If you don't leave off, I will knock your head off!"—there was not half a dozen words said before the blow was struck—I did not say, "It does not lay in your shoes to do it," to my knowledge; nor any thing to that effect—I did not touch him on the collar before I got the blow—I did not shake him or push him before I got the blow—I never touched him at all, nor he me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, did you not, after you got the blow, and were knocked down senseless, seize him by the throat, saying, "You b—, I will <hi rend="italic">scrag</hi> you?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not; I only caught hold of him by the collar after the blow was struck, and held him, till I gave him in charge—I never struck him, or tapped him on the shoulder, during the transaction—I was in bed for five days—I was not walking in Lisson-grove on that Friday, with my face tied up—I was never out of my room, I swear—I never heard the prisoner say I had robbed him of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and turned his wife and family into the street—he said, "Mind that man, he has robbed me"—he had said it two or three times—I walked up to him for an explanation—I was angry at it—I made this charge against him at Guildhall—I did not attend the first examina<lb></lb>tion, for I was confined to my bed, and did not go—the doctor wrote a letter and sent there—I was the prisoner's foreman once, and took his shop of him for six months—I paid him the rent of it, and acted in it solely on my own account—there was a written agreement between us—my at<lb></lb>torney had it when I entered an action against him for distressing me for rent—I paid for the agreement when I took the fixtures—the agreement was delivered to me by the prisoner, and the man who valued the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Souton, in Newgate-market. On Good Friday morning, Emerson was in the shop—the prisoner was there—I heard him say to Souton, "Mind what you are at, Sir, for that is the b—st rogue in England"—Emerson went towards him, holding his fingers out, and asked him for an explanation—the prisoner said, "Stand away from me, or I will knock your b—head off!"—the prisoner turned round, took hold of a hook, and struck Emerson with it—the hook hung on a hook with some more—he only had to turn round to get it—he struck Emerson in the right cheek—I should think it was a very hard blow—his cheek bled—Emerson had not struck him at all—he re<lb></lb>covered the blow, jumped up, and took the prisoner by the collar till the officer came, and gave him in charge—he was knocked down staggering.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was in Souton's shop—there was a dispute between the prosecutor and Souton—I said to Souton, "Don't let the man rob you as he has me"—he made no more to do but crossed the shop, came up to me, and said, "What do you mean?" he caught hold of my collar, and said, "You b—, I will shake you out of your shoes"—I said, "Keep off "—he caught hold of my collar, and shook me four or five times, and I hit him with the hook—he pushed roe several times with his hand before he collared me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carcass butcher in Newgate-market. On Good Friday morning the prosecutor was purchasing some thing of me—there was some little difference between us—the prisoner said, "Souton, take care of that fellow, for he will rob you—he has robbed me of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I did not hear a word about his wife and family—the prosecutor went up to him as if for an explanation—he put his hand against him, and said, "What have I rob<lb></lb>bed you in" or something—he put his hands three or four times against his breast, and said, "What have I robbed you of?"—he seemed very angry—he was not in a rage, but certainly was angry—the people then came into the shop so lost, I wanted to keep them out, I turned round, and did not see what took place—I heard the blow, and when I tamed round, I saw the prosecutor stagger and drop on the window—the prisoner wanted to go away, but the prosecutor caught hold of him, and would not let him—this was afterwards—he held him till the policeman was sent for—I do not think he was insensible at that time at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Strutton-ground, West<lb></lb>minster. I was at Souton's shop on Good Friday morning—the prisoner and prosecutor were there—Emerson and Souton were at the counting-house together—I heard the prisoner say to Emerson, "You have robbed my wife and family of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you villain; you know you have"—they were close together at that time—Emerson tapped htm on the shoulder, and said, "How many have you done?"—he only tapped him on the shoulder once—Beeson pushed his hands away, and said, "Keep your hands off me, you villain, do"—Emerson said, "Not worse than you," and pushed him with his hands on the shoulder—and pushed him backward, like, from him—he only pushed him once—he pushed him towards the rail where the hooks hung—the prisoner was going backwards—Emerson was not advancing on him then—he was pushing the prisoner from him—the prisoner then said again in a very great passion, "Keep your hands off, you villain, do, or else I will hit your head off"—the prosecutor then turned his hand back-handed, and took him by the collar of his coat, and said, "It don't lay in your shoes to do it"—he pushed him about two-yards back towards the rail, where the hooks hung—he had got hold of him by the collar at the time—he shook him a little, but not much, and pushed him with his left shoulder against the hooks—I am sure Emerson did this before the prisoner either struck him, or attempted to strike him with any thing—upon that, the prisoner put his hand up and took off a hook, and came back-handed and struck the prosecutor on the eye with the hook—he reeled a little from the blow, and then the prisoner put the hook up in its place again, and walked into the middle of the shop—as soon as Emerson recovered himself, he followed him, and somebody outside called</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in William-street, Lisson-grove—I know the prosecutor. On the Sunday following Good Friday, I remember seeing him in the neighbourhood—he stood talking to me at my door—I had heard of the occurrence that took place on Friday—I have no doubt it was the Sunday after Good Friday—it was between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—he had a plaster under his eye—we talked about the scuffle in the shop—I have known the prisoner upwards of ten years.</p>

I lost two silver table spoons, on the 4th of August, out of a drawer in the bar. I put them there about a quarter of an hour before I missed them. The prisoner came to live with me the day before; I had him from an office; he gave me a direction to go to Westminster to enquire his character, but I had not had time to go. I missed him before I missed the spoons; upon missing the spoons I went to Westminster where he had directed me, but could not find that he had lived there. I took him the Tuesday following in Westminster.</p>

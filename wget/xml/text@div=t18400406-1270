On Monday or Tuesday last the prisoner came to my house with a girl, and called for a pint of ale—they stood and drank it, and offered my daughter a sovereign, as I thought, and asked if I could give change—I said "No," and I told my daughter to go and get change—she went and came back, and said it was a French sove<lb></lb>reign—I said I should like to see one—I took it, and gave it back to the prisoner.</p>

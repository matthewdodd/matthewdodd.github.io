               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise of favour? - A.None in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Or any threat? - A. None in the world; I asked him how he came to take the stamps; he acknowledged having the Bank-note, and he acknowledged taking the stamps, but said he had lost them altogether.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Balmanno. Q. In what state were those stamps, had they been used? - A. Not to my knowledge; they were only bought the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not found? - A. He acknowledged having had them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search at the Stamp-office if they had been allowed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual for attorneys' clerks to get money for the purposes of business? - A. Yes; he asked me for some silver, I think it was to get a rule; I am sure there was nothing wanted that evening that could exceed twelve shillings; I believe, the whole that he had to do, was only four shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that business done? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Court. If you give a clerk a Bank-note for the purpose of doing business for you, and he takes the remainder of it for his own use, that is not stealing a Bank-note, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not frequently the case that attorneys' clerks take out stamps for the purpose of doing business? - A. Not in our office.</p>
               <p>Q. But is it not very frequently done? - A. I cannot say what is done in other offices.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LAMB sworn. - I am partner with Mr. Phillipson; I know no more of it than he does.</p>
               <p>Mr. Balmanno. Q. What character had you with the prisoner? - A. A very good one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at this confession that we have heard of? - A. Yes; he said he had taken the stamps, and lost them with the Bank-note.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not understand from that acknowledgment, that he meant to take this Bank-note and the stamps? - A. Yes, I did: I myself gave him the order to take out the rule, it was a rule for judgment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I left the employ of these gentlemen on the Friday evening, and the stamps might be in the office then, for any thing I know; these stamps I absolutely engrossed myself, and left them in the office.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 19th September, Mr. Garnham came to the police-station and gave information about the goods being stolen—I went out and made enquiries at different shops—on the Tuesday, I went to Smith about 7.45—I went into the house and went into Smith's kitchen, and found some hampers there in the fire grate, I saw the hamper on the fire, I went upstairs into Mrs. Nicholl's room and likewise saw some burning there, I went into the garden and there was apparently the lid of a hamper just consumed—on the Tuesday I went to Mrs. Little's and discovered the twenty-four pairs of boots—on Wednesday, about 12.45, a.m., I was in the Hackney Road with Cross—I saw Murray and Impsey arm in arm with a drunken man—I took them into custody—after they were charged a boy came to identify them—I charged them with stealing fifty-six pairs of boots from a barrow in Bishopsgate Street, on the 19th September—Impsey said he knew nothing about them, Murray the same—he said he had not seen Impsey from 5.15 that night—I took them in some water, when Murray said "Well old man, you seem to know about as much about this affair as I do"—I said "Yes, I think I do"—Impsey came up to Murray and said "If you don't tell him I will"—he then said "We should have had nothing to do with this if they had not made an arrangement with us on the Friday, the day previous to the robbery, that if we brought in the stuff from Johnson's they would</p>

"—Impsey made the remark—"Yes, we should not have had that had it not been for Day—Smith has not given us the sum"—they asked me who, <hi rend="italic">blowed</hi>—whether it was the <hi rend="italic">bloke</hi> at the Pawnbrokers—I said "No," do you recollect a man lending you a half-penny on the road"—"Yes,"That was Mr.—; Murray said Impsey went into Stacey's to get the envelope, in Shoreditch (Impsey heard that, he was in the same cell)—he asked the young lady whether she would mind putting the name of Mrs. Johnson on the envelope—with reference to Day and Smith they only said that Day had made the arrangement with them on the day previous to the robbery—after apprehending the prisoners I went to Smith's house about 3.30—I knocked about four times, and Nicholl's put his head out of the window and asked who was that there—I said "Police"—Smith opened the door, and before he opened the door asked who was there—I said "Police"—I said "You know. what I have come about"—the said "Yes, about the b——boots"—he said "All right, I will dress"—on the road to the station he asked what I thought he should get—I said "Penal servitude if there are previous convictions against you"—he said he hoped to God not, he had never been in trouble before and had only been married five months and in partnership with Day three week's and wished he had never seen him—at Guildhall he said he bad sold twenty-four pairs of boots at Mrs. Little's, and Day went with him to sell the others at Brooke's, he had heard that I went to the house, and the other twenty pairs they had burnt, there were twelve pairs of samples, that they could not sell—I produce the twenty-four pairs I received from Towers—Cross got the one pair from Brooke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have told you everything in regard to the conversation between myself and the two boys in the cell, with the exception that Impsey said "God blind me," or "So help me God, Smith ought to have fifteen years for the way he has treated us; he has not given as a halfpenny, and we should not have had a halfpenny, if it had not been for Day"—I did not begin the conversation by questioning them—I did not go for the purpose of questioning them—I was just coming away from the cell, from locking—them up—Cross was not with me—this was long before we took the receivers" into custody—Cross was not in the cell with, me at the time—he went with me to Smith's—I gave the directions for taking Day into custody—I told Cross where to go to—that was in consequence of what I had heard from the two boys, and a billhead given me by Mrs. Little with their two names-on, Day and Smith—I traced the property to Day's selling at Little's too—I did not take the boys on this charge originally—they were in company with a drunken man—I did not take them in charge for that—I noticed the description I had received of the boys, and directly I saw the prisoners I saw they were the two I wanted, and I said to Murray "Well, Donald, I hardly knew you"—he said' "Didn't" you"—I said "<hi rend="italic">No</hi>, your name is Donald Murray, isn't it"—he said "Yes"—I said to the other "And your name is <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> Impsey"—he said "Yes"—"Then, "I said, "I shall take you on a charge of stealing, on the 19th September, fifty-six pairs of boots"—that was after I got them in my custody—it was not after I got them to the police-station, that was as soon as I saw them—no con<lb></lb>versation passed on the road down, until I went into their cell to take</p>

A little after 3 o'clock on the morning of the 24th of September I went to Day's house—I took him into custody—I told him he would be charged with receiving fifty-six pairs of boots from Murray and Impsey on the Saturday—he said "I know nothing about it; I do not know them; I never saw them"—on the way to the station he asked me what he would be done to—I said "I really cannot say anything about that"—the same morning going to Guildhall he asked me again what I thought he would get done to—he said "What is the best thing I can do"—I said "I shan't advise you in any way"—he said "I tell you the truth, I bought the boots, I paid Murray one pound for them on Saturday, and gave him another pound on the Sunday morning; I sold the boots at Little's, and Smith was with me; that is my receipt; that is my name on the receipt."</p>

On Friday night previous to the robbery Mr. Day came to me to go to Mile End Road; Mr. Day and Smith were together—he said "Come away from Smith, I do not want him to know anything about this;" so he walked away from Smith, and he said "Will you do a job for me"—I said "Yes, Mr. Day, I am out of work and will be very glad to do a job for you"—he said "Well I want you to go and get some boots for me to-morrow morning"—I said "All right;" so I agreed to meet him in Hackney Road, at the corner of Temple Street—he said "Here's the boy coming out of Johnson's, you are to go up in the city and get an envelope; I have not got a pencil, or envelope with me, go into Stacey's and get one <hi rend="italic">wrote</hi> out if you can get a halfpenny anywhere," and Impsey borrowed the halfpenny—Mr. Day sent us to get an envelope <hi rend="italic">wrote</hi> out, and up to Bishopsgate where we got the boots—he sent us over to the boy to deliver the note and get the boots—after he saw we had got the boots; "That will do;" he says, "You go round Whitechapel way and I will go round Shoreditch—I have got a basket, and Smith will think that I have been taking these goods home that I took out"</p>

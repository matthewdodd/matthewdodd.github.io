                  </hi>. I was in Tollington-park on the 28th of August. I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I then turned round and looked, and saw the prisoner running towards me—I said before he came up to me, "Are you the person they are hallooing after?"—he said, "No; I have done nothing, it is not me they want"—when he got opposite me, I caught hold of him, and said, "You must stop, my man, till I know whether it is you they want, or not"—he said, "It is not me they want"—Boorman then came up and said he had come out of the window of Mr. Garrett's house and had stolen the plate; that the servant saw him, and cried "Stop thief!" and away he <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi>—I took him, and took him back, and the servant stood at the gate with the box of plate—she said, "You villain, this is what you would have robbed me of if I had not seen you"—I was then ordered to take him to the policeman—I took him to Highgate station, and gave charge of him.</p>

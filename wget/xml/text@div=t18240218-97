            . I had the care of this shop for my father-in-law. I was present on Saturday night, the 18th of June, when the boy shut it up. I went there on Sunday morning, about twelve o'clock; and all was safe - and on Monday, at half-past eight, I found the private door, which is up a gateway, on the single lock - I had left it double locked. I found all this property gone - the shop was nearly stripped - I can swear to the tea tray; I saw it at the door on Saturday, and know it by a particular scratch across the throat of the figure on it. I know the candlesticks by a private mark on them; and here is a pair of snuffers which I can swear were in the shop on the Saturday night, and likewise a sugar bason which I saw at eleven o'clock at night. I believe all the things to be ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The tea tray was bought to sell again - A. Yes; I suppose it has been scratched by a child with a pin.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with a search warrant on the 12th of February; to Walker's house, Vincent-street, Old-street; and in the bottom room found a tea tray, sugar bason, tea pot, milk pot, snuffers, corkscrew, tea cannister, candle box, and other articles. Walker was asleep upstairs, with his wife, some were in a cupboard, and some at the top of the cupboard. Walker said all the property was his own, and said something about buying them some time ago; but I do not perfectly recollect what. I went to Heath's house, City-gardens, City-road, and found a carving knife and fork in a drawer, a snuffer tray in a cupboard, a pair of curling irons, cork-screw, and nut crackers, in his table drawer; they were not concealed. Heath said they were his own, and that he had bought them. I found three picklock keys in his table drawer. I took one Goodman, who was in the house; but he was discharged, as none of the property was found in his room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you told all the truth - A. I have; except that Vann came down stairs with a picklock key at Walker's - we went there to take the two prisoners. Heath, I believe, is a shoemaker - we brought away three hides of leather from his premises, presuming they would be owned - there had been a robbery of leather; he said</p>
               <p>"The things are mine, I bought them;" not speaking particularly to any one article; he spoke of all the things in the room. I do not recollect that he spoke to these particular articles.</p>
               <p>This witness was cross-examined at considerable length respecting his evidence upon the trial of Easterby and others, pages 174 - 177 - 180, and gave the same account of the case, as upon those trials; it is presumed unnecessary to restate it.</p>

I helped him to move on the 23d of January, and saw it then - it was one of the same size and pattern. I cannot swear that it is the one. When he moved his goods, dishes were put in it, which might scratch it. I have drank tea off it twenty or thirty times.</p>

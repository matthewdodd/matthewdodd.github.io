The prisoner lodged with me—on Sun<lb></lb>day, the 20th of Sept., between five and six o'clock in the evening, he went out—I and my wife went out afterwards, leaving nobody in ray apartments—I occupy the shop, parlour, and kitchen—I fastened it all up and locked the door—the windows were shut down close, but not hasped—nobody could get to the shop and parlour without breaking in—we returned together in about two hours and a half, and found the parlour window about five inches up—it opens into a close back court—the door was still locked—I found a writing<lb></lb>desk, work-box, a drawer, and a cash-box, all open—I had left them all shut and the cash-box locked—I missed a tin box out of the cash-box, with a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and seven sovereigns and a half in it—I saw the money safe not two hours before I left, and had it in my hand—I had opened the note, and saw a hole in it, apparently cut by some sharp instrument—I looked at it particularly, think<lb></lb>ing it might have been cut when folded up, and that there might be four holes, but there was not—my wife had given it to me—I was with her when she received it from the Bloomsbury bank—when the prisoner came home I gave him in charge—he was discharged afterwards.</p>

            . Q. You are the beadle of Bishopsgate - A. I am. On the 4th of June, I observed the two prisoners in Threadneedle-street, I saw Russel take something out of her apron, I was not near enough to tell what it was, it rattled like halfpence. I then walked past them, I saw Luscombe with a black purse in her hand, I saw her give something to Russell, I saw Russel wiping and wetting it, she went up Finch-lane with it, she returned again in the course of a minute or two, Luscombe was then walking further on in Threadneedle-street, she stopped near against Merchant

             hall untill Russel came up to her, they had some conversation, and walked to the end of Threadneedle-street, Russel then sat down on the church-steps, Luscombe went into Mr. Wilsons, a stationers shop opposite of Threadneedle-street; Luscombe came out with this quire of whitybrown paper, and joined Russell, I immediately went into Mr. Wilson's shop, I made enquiry, a shilling was produced to me; I took the shilling, I have it now. I looked at the shilling, and judged it to be a counterfeit; I went into Threadneedle-street and caught hold of both the prisoners, Luscombe said what did I want, if she had done any thing wrong she was very sorry. Russel instantly clapped her hand to her mouth, I endeavoured to get my fingers in her mouth, I saw her swallow something. I then observed Luscombe have something in her hand; I seized hold of that hand immediately; I then called one of the waterman in the street to assist me getting them into Mr. Wilson's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there in that hand - A. Five shillings, four bad, and one good I believe; I took them into the shop and searched Luscombe first; in her pocket I found this black purse, this appears to be the purse I saw before, and in it were twenty shillings all had; I found this little box in her pocket containing three good sixpences, and one bad, and a piece of black ball; I found loose in her pocket six shillings and two pence farthing, all good halfpence; I searched Russel, I found nothing on her.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Wilson, stationer, in Bishopsgate-street. On the 4th of June, about eleven o'clock, Luscombe came into our house for a quire of whity-brown paper, that is sixpence; she paid by a shilling, I afterwards gave the same shilling to Mr. Sheppard, I am sure that is the shilling that was uttered by Luscombe. I told Mr. Sheppard what had past, he brought back the two prisoners: I saw the money that was found on Luscombe.</p>

They are all counterfeits, and the five found in the hand four are counterfeits, the other is an Irish one, but still counterfeit; the four sixpences, one of them is a counterfeit, and the other three are good, and this piece of blacking is usual to be found on persons of this description, its use is in taking off the brightness.

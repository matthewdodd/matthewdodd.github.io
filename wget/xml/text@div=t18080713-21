               <p>Q. On the night of the 22nd of June, what time did you go to bed - A. At eleven o'clock. I secured the shop the last thing before I went to bed; I saw the bolts of the door fast, top and bottom, and the screws of the windows were all fast.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is your shop the lower part of your house - A. Yes; I occupy the whole house; I got up a little after seven in the morning, and I went down to the shop a quarter before eight o'clock. I went to the shutters; in taking down the second shutter I perceived it drop into my hands; the screw of that shutter which was fastened in the shop remained in; it was cut in the wood; after I took down the shutters, I saw a pane of glass broke quite out; I then returned into the shop to see what I had lost; I discovered seventeen pieces of Irish linen gone; there were a great many pieces of prints taken down and very much disfigured by some person's feet; there were the print of feet upon the prints as if there had been more persons than one.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of these seventeen pieces of Irish linen - the whole amount - A. The cost price is about fifty pound. I found the shop door was left open; upon discovering my loss I went to the Foundling watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. There you got some information that led you up to St. Giles's watchhouse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of your property did you see - A. I saw six pieces of Irish linen; I looked at them; I knew them to be mine; they have my wife's marks upon them; the prisoner was there in custody; the goods were kept and produced before the magistrate by them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. I think you said you had been about a month in that business - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a very short time, you had not an opportunity of being acquainted with one thing any more than another, how do you know it was Irish linen - A. I know it by the invoice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you know Irish linen when you see it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. From the appearance of the things that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130019"></xptr>were thrown about, must it not take up a great deal of time - A. Yes, and to take out the glass in the manner it was done.</p>
               <p>COURT. What parish is your house in - A. In St. George, Bloomsbury.</p>
               <p>- COOK. Q. You are a patrol - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your beat - A. Down Russel square. On this night, just before three o'clock, I was going my round from Southampton row, I was going to Woburn place, about two hundred yards off; I saw the prisoner and another man, he had the bag on his shoulder; I stood up against the pillar of Bolton house, where I could have command of them and they could not see me. When they came abreast of me; I sprang out and seized the other man, I said what have you got here; the prisoner faced round and struck me upon the head as hard as he could; the blows rather stagnated me for a bit; the other threw the bundle upon my toes, and took towards Bedford place; I alarmed the constable; the rattles sprung in all directions; the prisoner got within two yards of Bedford place, by that time I had sufficiently recovered myself to pursue him; the prisoner at the bar seeing a watchman coming out of the box, run from him; I then thought to cross him; he being of lighter heels got away; the watchman in Guildford street stopped him; I am sure it was the prisoner at the bar, and he was the same person that struck me with a knotted stick, it was like a black thorn stick. When I saw the watchman in Guildford street stop him, I went towards the property which lay at Bolton house door, captain Blackhall's door; I heard him say when he was locked up in Marlborough street, D - n my eyes, we have made a crack, but we are spoiled; he was going on further in the discourse, but he saw me; then he stopped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. You saw him very distinctly - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure that you saw him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the 22nd of June - A. It was the 23d of June in the morning; it was break of day. When I stopped the other man, the property was tied up in two separate parcels, it was in a bag.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was not the prisoner that had the bag - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. It was just before three o'clock when you stopped him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did day break - A. It became light about a quarter after two o'clock, it was a dark rainy morning; you might pick up any thing down on the pavement that one saw, about ten minutes or a quarter past two.</p>

When I got into Guildford street I saw the prisoner running down the street as hard as he could from Russel square; I ran towards him as hard as I could run, I stopped him, I asked him where he was going, he told me he was going home, he lived in Gray's inn lane; I then asked him what was the occasion of the springing of the rattles; he told me he did not know, but he believed there had been some people fighting: I then secured him and took him back to two of the Bloomsbury watchmen; I am sure that is the man.</p>

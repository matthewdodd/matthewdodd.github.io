I asked him what he was doing; he said nothing; he was afterwards accused with wrenching the bars; then he threw the pole down, which he had before in his hand, and attempted to run away: I was informed that the bars were ripped, and then brought him back. The instrument he had in his hand was a paddock, or long pole about six feet in length, which is made use of in scaffoldings; this was about half past seven at night.</p>

I then asked him what he was doing with that pole; I said it was one of Mr. Bannister's; he said he was one of Mr. Bannister's men. Upon this I called my husband, and looking at the bars, I found one was ripped up out of the stone, and the other was loosened; thereupon he was stopped, and taken before Sir

               <p>I am as innocent as a child. I was going along Wych-street; I went just within the gate upon a pressing occasion; I had no thought of any such thing. The good woman asked me what I was doing there? I said nothing; I was going about my business. The porter ran after me, and cathed me, and said I was the person that had stolen the bar away two months before that, and hauled me away, and took their oath before Justice Fielding, that I had pulled the bar up before. I am as clear as the child unborn. I have nobody here at all.</p>

On the 26th of February the prisoner called at the shop—I had known him before in the employ of Mr. Brees—(he had left our account from Mr. Brees soon after Christmas)—Mr. Brees is a customer of ours—the prisoner brought an order, signed "Brees," on the 26th of February, and said he wanted the nails contained in the order—I read the order, and gave him seven thousand tenpenny nails, believing the order to be genuine, and that it came from Mr. Brees—he went out and got a porter while we were getting the nails ready—he said he was going for a porter—I have been in the trade about three years—the prisoner con<lb></lb>ducted himself as all men do that come for orders—there was no appear<lb></lb>ance of strangeness about him—this is the order he brought.</p>

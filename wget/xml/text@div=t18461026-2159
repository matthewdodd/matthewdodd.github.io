                  </hi>. I am carman to Henry Piper, a market-gardener. On the 1st of Oct., a little after five o'clock in the evening, I was driving my master's wagon and two horses along the Dover-road—Bassett came up to me and said, "I want the chain-horse"—I did not know him before—I said, "What for?"—he said he had left ray master at the bottom of the Dover-road, that he was gone up Kent-street, and had sent him to fetch the horse to carry a load of cabbages from the Kingsland-road—he said master had got his big cart and a chesnut horse with him, and was gone on to Kent-street with it. and had told him he would wait at St. George's church till he got there—I went there with him—my master was not there—he then said, "I dare say he is gone on towards London-bridge"—I went with him nearly to the Town-hall—he then ran forwards, and came back, and said he had overtaken master</p>

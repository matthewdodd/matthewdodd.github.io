The prisoner Baptista lodged in our house for about a week before this business happened; he got up earlier than is usual to get up in the house, he came down stairs, I spoke to him out of my room, I said who is coming down stairs; he went down and I followed him, I found the door open and he was gone; I saw him going away with a bundle in his hand. In about eight or nine days afterwards I saw him in Ratcliffe Highway, I asked him to return me the property he had stolen from me, and I would not prosecute him; he replied I was a girl of the town; he drew a mob round me and ran away; this was on the Saturday. Sunday I saw him again much in the same place, he ran away again. In consequence of information, I got an officer, his name is Mercury; I found the prisoner Baptista on the Sunday night; he was taken in custody and taken to the watchhouse. As we were coming out of the watchhouse Bonnas came up, he said if he could he would have me in a worse place before it was long. On the next day at six o'clock we went before the magistrate, the magistrate wished us to make it up. Not finding any thing upon Baptista, we all went over to the lock-up house for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any money to be paid. - A. There was one pound to be paid.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the magistrate order the one pound to be paid. - A. My money was fifty shillings that I demanded of my loss, and Bonnas made answer that he would pay a one pound note, whether I would take it or not, on account of his shipping the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. What is Bonnas. - A. He <rs id="t18070513-36-deflabel230" type="occupation">keeps a lodging-house, and ships men</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18070513-36-defend389 t18070513-36-deflabel230"></join>. He sent for the money, and his wife sent a guinea, it was paid into the officer's hands; we returned him a shilling; Bonnas said it was the last pound I ever should handle if he could help it. I sat down in the place, I did not like the parties; they went away before me.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, Bonnas and Baptista went away, and his wife also, leaving you and your brother behind. A. Yes, to the best of my knowledge, they went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130023"></xptr> away about a quarter of an hour before us.

               <p>Q. That is cut just about your waste. - A. Yes. And this is the gown, they were both cut. Upon that my brother came up and seized Baptista by the collar; Baptista then struck my brother, and they jostled one with another a short time. I saw Baptista fall twice during the time they were scuffling together, and the third time he ran towards him and struck him with an instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say strike him or stick him. - A. Stick him with the instrument; my brother screamed out, oh, sister, I am murdered, I am stabbed; Bonnas sprung forward and asked Baptista, he said did you do it; Baptista said yes. Bonnas stamped his foot, and told Baptista to run away. Baptista immediately ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Baptista's running away what did Bonnas do. - A. He knocked my brother down upon his knees; then Bonnas turned his back, took his wife by the arm and went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. What time of the evening was it. - A. Between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark then. - A. Yes, but there were lights in the shop, and the lamps were lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband is a crimp. - A. No, I do not think he is, he is a sadler by trade; it is my business if I can get a couple of guineas, I take it. I provide slops for the seamen that lodge in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. After your brother came over as you described, they were jostling together, did that continue very long. - A. About three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there were no blows that passed between them. - A. I will not venture to swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Baptista was throwed down twice before there was any injury done to your brother. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You made a complaint at the office, and they dismissed that complaint, and told you to settle it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have said when you come to put your foot on the pavement, that moment Bonnas came up and knocked you down without any words. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And a very violent blow he gave you. - A. No, he did not hurt me very much, the place was very slippery.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you was a little alarmed at such an unexpected salute. - A. No, it was what I expected.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you get out of the way. - A. I went out of the way as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Your brother came across the way after you had seen the knife, why did not you call out that the man had a knife. - A. I did not know that it was a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was an offensive weapon. - A. Of course I did. I cried out to him to take care of himself; in the flurry he did not hear. I said we will have him another day.</p>
               <p>Q. That was because you saw the cut upon your gown - you were examined at the police office two or three times. - A. I have been several times there.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon the oath you have taken, did you upon any one of the examinations that took place at the police office, say that you cried out to your brother to caution him of the danger he was in. - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. I know all your dress on that occasion - did not you wear a great coat, a pelisse, or any thing of that sort. - A. I had not, I had nothing outside but my shawl I had on me now.</p>
               <p>Q. Be cautious, I shall call witnesses. - A. You may call as many witnesses as you like, I had nothing but a shawl over my shoulders.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no ill will towards Bonnas till this day. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a great regard for him. - A. No, I had no regard for him; I only knew him by eyesight.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you never quarrelled together. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever travel to Gravesend. - A. Yes, I recollect being at Gravesend, and Mr. Bonnas seemed to be a great man, and he seemed to ridicule poor women.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do to him. - A. I gave him a slap on the face.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, have you not said that if ever you could find an opportunity you would hang him. A. No. I said if ever he insulted me again, I would try the laws of my country against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you persist in swearing that Bonnas was by at the time your brother was wounded. - A. He was close by when my brother was wounded, but he did not join in the scuffle.</p>
               <p>Q. After the transaction on that night, did you say any thing to Mercury - namely, that Bonnas was the person that handed the instrument to Baptista. - A. I screamed out, oh you villain Bonnas, you handed the instrument to Baptista, you are the cause of this; I said to Mercury are not you a bad man for not taking the man up after stabbing my brother. I believe I said this in Bonnas's house.</p>

Soon after we got out, we saw the prisoners on the pavement before us; my sister told me to cross over the way, we both crossed; my sister said she wanted a coach; I told her it was not worth while to take a coach; she went across the way before me, I heard her shout; I ran up to the place where I heard the noise; I saw Baptista striking her, and Bonnas was close by; when I came up Baptista struck her on the head; I seized hold of him by the collar; I asked him what he meant by striking a woman, he turned round and struck me on the face, I struck him again with one hand, and I held his collar with the other; then he stabbed me on the thigh; very soon I felt the blow upon my right thigh, upon the groin; after I felt the stab, and felt the blood running, I cried out murder, I was killed; I did not fall by the wound. After I cried out murder, I received a blow upon the back part of my head, which knocked me upon my right knee; I looked round and I saw Bonnas.</p>

            . - Mr. Gleed. Where do you live. - A. At 69, Ratcliff Highway. Some little time after this transaction took place, I went into Bonnas's house, hearing the officers was there, and knowing how his house was situated; I thought if a man had been guilty of stabbing a man, he might go out the back way. In consequence of that I went round the back way. I found Baptista by the wall of the gardens; he was there close to the wall, there is a little ditch there besides; I said, halloo, what are you about there; I was getting near him, he attempted to spring the wall; I took hold of his collar, I said, I suppose you are the person that has been cutting the man in the street; come sir, I says, you must go with me; he said he was no thief, no robber (in bad English), only cut the man; I kept hold of him by the collar, till I got him into the house; I delivered him to Oliver; we found a very little blood on his hands; I fetched a lanthorn and searched the place, and found no knife at all.</p>

            . - Mr. Gleed. You are under Mr. - , of the London hospital. - A. I am; Mr. Eddington was the surgeon of the house at that time; he examined him; the wound was in the upper part of the left thigh, just below the groin; the wound was about two inches in depth, and about half an inch wide; the wound was done by a sharp pointed instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wound in such a situation so that death might be occasioned thereby. - A. Yes, it was very near a principal artery in the thigh.</p>
               <p>Court. It might have been fatal. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. You considered it as a wound of a dangerous nature. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He has been under the care of the gentlemen of the hospital, and is now under your care. - A. He is.</p>
               <p>Baptista's Defence. One morning six o'clock, go to this house, they took me and put me in prison; six o'clock Monday at night, go to the magistrate, charge me with losing two handkerchiefs, broke the lock of the door, charge me with two guineas for that.</p>
               <p>Bonnas' Defence. My lord, I am an innocent man; I had been down to Gravesend, and while I was at Gravesend my wife received him; when I come from Gravesend I found this man, Baptista, in my house; I had five men in the house besides him. I asked my wife what that man did in the house, she said a captain wanted six men at night; the sailors told me that Baptista was taken for a robbery; I went to the watchhouse, one of the gentlemen told me he was locked up for a robbery. On Monday six o'clock I went to the magistrate, the magistrate said it was a quarrel about the crimpage; he told them to go away and settle it among themselves; we went to the public house with the officer Mercury; Mrs. Kashaw said she would have two pound ten shillings, I said, I cannot give that money, Baptista owes me four pound already; Mrs. Kashaw then would take one pound; I said that will be all out of my own pocket; I sent to my wife for a guinea, she came to me, after that was paid, Baptista walked out of the house first, then Mercury, my wife and me. After I came out of the house I missed Baptista; I never saw 
               <persName id="t18070513-36-person396">Baptista</persName>
             no more till the gentleman brought him into my house. Mercury came and told me that Baptista had stabbed the man; the parish officers came and said they must look over my house for him; I said with all my heart; when the gentleman brought Baptista in the house, they handcuffed me, and took me with him; the magistrate let me go home, and told me to come again tomorrow morning at two o'clock; the next day we had a hearing, the sister swore against me the most vilest she could; and then I was committed to New Prison.</p>

            . - Mr. Alley What are you. - A. I am a parish officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day this unfortunate accident happened. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. On that day do you recollect previous to the misfortune taking place, being at the public house, at which Mrs. Kashaw and this man was there. - A. I do</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when the parties separated, who went away from the public house first. - A. Baptista the sailor got up and went out; this was a little after eight o'clock, Mr. Bonnas, Mrs. Bonnas, and me went next; I was going home, a woman came to Bonnas and said, sir, a captain.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what she said to him, did he go away. - A. He took his wife on his arm, and walked away immediately. I heard the alarm, I went to Bonnas' house and took him in custody. Mrs. Kashaw came in Bonnas' house with some of the Shadwell officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she a pellisse on. - A. She had a bottle green pellisse on. I walked all the way home with Bonnas and his wife but ten or a dozen doors; I went into Mr. Elliot's a tobacco shop, I might stay there about ten minutes, and then I heard there was a man stabbed; I then went to Bonnas' house, took him in custody, and brought him to the public house opposite the office.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you at any time hear Mrs. Kashaw say any thing and when, that Bonnas had a knife. - A. I did not hear her say any thing of a knife, till the second examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any conversation with this woman about this business. - A. Mrs. Kashaw has often desired me to call at her house, and have a cup of tea with her; she has often said that she would be revenged against Bonnas, if possible, because he was a bad man. About a month or five weeks after this happened, I met her in the Highway; I asked her how her brother was; she said she was going to see him, he was very bad; will you take a walk with me. She said if it was to cost her ten or twenty pound she would not mind it, to be revenged of that fellow Bonnas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Is it true that two pound ten was what the woman required. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you reconciled the matter for twenty shillings. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of that did you have for your share. - A. Ten shillings and sixpence.</p>

The place was quite clear when I came back.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you happen to be in Ratcliffe Highway on the night this accident happened. - A. Yes, I was returning from Blackwall, a little after eight o'clock. In Ratcliffe Highway I saw a quarrel between a woman with a pelisse, or a long top coat on, done with fur, and a tippet; and two men, one a sailor in a jacket and trowsers, and the other a tallish thin man; I think the prisoners are the men; they were having high words about a guinea. The sailor in the jacket gave the woman a shove, and called her a b - r, and said he would have the guinea out of her; and after that the man catched hold of him by the collar, and several blows were given, and she struck him by the side of his head, and took hold of his hair; after several blows had taken place, by the woman and by the men, the sailor fell down and when the sailor got up he gave him one blow, and left him reeling; he ran away; the man reeled till he came by the side of the door; I called out to Mrs. Lawrence, that the man would go through the window; when the man fell, she gave the alarm that her brother was murdered.</p>

            , who lives at Newington-common. On the 1st of July, about half-past one o'clock in the afternoon, I sent my child to school - she is six years of age. She returned in about a quarter of an hour with her tippet and sleeves in her hand, and without her frock, saying, that a lady had taken her frock off, and was going to give her a white one with pretty tucks in it, and said the lady asked her name and where she lived, that she pointed to the house, and the lady ran down Shacklewell-lane. I went to look for her, and at half-past five o'clock, I took the child to No. 8, Stanford-lane, where the prisoner was drinking tea at her lodgings. I left the child at the door, went in, and asked the prisoner if she was in Shacklewell-lane, between one and two o'clock? she said she was not; she could not tell me where she was at that time. I called the child in, and asked the prisoner to put on her bonnet and shawl, which she did, and the child said she was the lady that took her frock. I said if she would produce it I would not hurt her. She took me to Stamford-hill, where she said she had been all day; she pointed to the house, but I did not go in. I sent for a constable. She then said she would tell the truth, and give me the frock. She went to one corner of the room, and pulled it from under her clothes half unpicked, and offered me 4 s. to let her go.</p>

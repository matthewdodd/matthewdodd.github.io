            . I am thirteen years of age; I live at No. 11, John's-row, Bath-street, City-road; I work for Mr. Skinner, whip-maker, in Finsbury. On the 28th of February I saw one man standing on the curb, and the two prisoners go to the back of this truck, and each take hold of one end of the box and take it out. I gave information, and pursued them toward Ropemaker's-street - I lost sight of them; I went back to the truck, and myself and the youngest man who was drawing it went and saw the two prisoners and the box in a coach, in custody. I saw them at the office the next day.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 28th of February, I was with Herdsfield in London-wall - I saw the truck which two men were drawing - the prisoner Bailey, and two others, were following it; one of them had a white hat on - we followed them along the pavement, and saw Bailey cross the truck two or three times; when they got between Ropemaker's-street, and Chiswell-street, I saw a man coming back with the box on his head: Bailey was ten or fifteen yards behind him; and a third person was behind him; we crossed the way, and the man with the box turned down Ropemaker's-street; Herdsfield cried,</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!" and when we got into Ropemaker's-street, the box lay on the ground, and Horling was in the act of picking up this knot - I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got here;" he made some answer, but I do not know what. I took him, and Herdsfield took Bailey. I did not notice the persons who were drawing the truck.</p>

I was not specially appointed to make the inquiry; it was one of the ordinary inquiries made by the poor law inspectors; and, under the authority of the Act of Parliament, I administered an oath, as I always do and always have done for many years past—I did not require the defendant to take an oath in this instance; when he first appeared before me, I asked him whether he would be sworn or not, I left it to himself, and he said he would rather be sworn—I asked whether he had any objection to be sworn—he said, not at all, he would rather be sworn—if he had said, "I had rather not be sworn," I should have taken his declaration, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, but not from any doubt that autho<lb></lb>rity was vested in me to administer the oaths—when I say I would have taken his declaration, I do not mean I would have administered the form of declara<lb></lb>tion to him, I mean I would have heard what he had to say—this is what I took down—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I am master of the St. Mary Newington Workhouse, and have been so for two years and ten months—there has been a great number of deaths in this workhouse since I have been here—the same contractor has always buried the dead from this workhouse while I have been here, his name is Robert Hogg—I keep one key of the dead house and there is another kept by the porter—I am aware there is a law which enables guardians in certain cases to deliver the dead bodies of paupers to properly licensed persons for the purposes of dissection—I do not know whether there is any order of the guardians in their books to this effect—Mr. Hogg was the contractor for burials when I came to this house—the clerk has informed me that although there was no record of the fact, nevertheless the guardians availed themselves of the 2 &amp; 3 William 4c., 75, s. 7—The next day after I came in as master, the dead body of a pauper was forwarded to a school of anatomy, it was taken away by Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">HOGG</hi>—I have a form of certificate under which I forward the dead bodies of paupers to schools of anatomy (<hi rend="italic">form put in</hi>) this form is always accompanied by a medical certificate (<hi rend="italic">form put in</hi>) I have for<lb></lb>warded many bodies of paupers to schools of anatomy—I remember Mary Whitehead, she died in this workhouse—her body was sent to a school of anatomy—I always send to the friends of paupers deceased—I can not recollect whether any of Whitehead's friends attended—I am satisfied that if any dead pauper has a friend who claims the body, that such body would not be forwarded to a school of anatomy—I have been at Guy's Hospital; for the last twelve months all bodies from this house have gone there—I have been twice at the hospital on business which I was sent for—the secretary sent</p>

                  </hi>. I am an undertaker, carrying on business in St. George's Road, Southwark.

                  <hi rend="italic">the person referred to in that section; and this objection applied to the first four Counts; the</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th Count appeared to raise the real question; for by the common law it was a misdemeanour to delay improperly and unnecessarily the burial of a dead body, and to sell a dead body might, at common law, be a misdemeanour</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">contended, that no authority had gone that length; he argued, that a misdemeanour at common law must involve a trespass, and referred to the cases of Reg</hi>. v. <hi rend="italic">Gillies and Reg</hi>. v. <hi rend="italic">Sharpe, as supporting that proposition; he, however, relied upon the statute, as, in any event, furnishing a justification for all that the defendant had done</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

On Monday the 6th of March, about a quarter before eight in the morning; I am a nurse in St. Bartholomew's Hospital. I left no person in my room, I am sure I left it secure. I locked my door, and left my key with Mrs. Riley, at another house in Field-lane. On the next morning Mrs. Riley came to me; in consequence of what she said, I went to my room; I found the door cut away where the lock goes. I missed all the articles mentioned in the indictment. Some of my things have been found since, and some not.</p>

Yes; she left her key with me for to light the fire for her before she came home; about five in the afternoon of the same day I went to her room, I had the key in my hand to open the door; the wood-work of the door was all cut away from the lock. When I got in the room, I missed a piece of carpetting that was on the bed, and the bed quilt was gone; I found her trunk broken open; I knocked at the prisoner Annard's room, I asked her if she had seen any body go into Mrs. Dorsey's room? She said no, she had been out all day at work. I told her that some person had broken Mrs. Dorsey's door open.</p>

             came in the room; she said she did not live there. I searched Annard and Jones, and found some duplicates upon them, they did not relate to this charge. Jones said she was an unfortunate woman, and had lodged with Annard a few nights, as she had not got an lodging.</p>

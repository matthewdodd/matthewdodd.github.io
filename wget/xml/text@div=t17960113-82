               <p>I am a watchman: On the 13th of this month, at night, between the hour of eight and nine, I stopped the prisoner, with this quantity of iron,(producing it); my box is in Nottingham place; I asked him, where he was going with it; he said, to Marybone-lane, which is one street and a bit of another, distant from Nottingham-place; very well, says I, I will go along with you; I asked him where he was going to; and, he said, he was going to carry it to the smith's, for Mr. Wellings; I asked him if Mr. Welling sent him with it; he said, no; one of the foremen; I asked him, his name; he said he did not know; I asked him again, where he was going with it; he said, he did not know justly; I told him, then he must go to the watch-house with me; when we came to the watch-house, I asked him, what his employment was, and where he came from, and many questions; to which, he would not give me any answer, but that he had worked at Battle-bridge; but, he would not tell me when, nor for who; nor would give any account of himself; upon that, I went to Mr. Wellings'.</p>
               <p>You must not tell us what passed there. - A. Then I went to Mr. Alsop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Then you must not tell us what passed with him. - A. I gave charge of him to the keeper of the watch-house; the prisoner asked me, if I thought, if he was to ask Mr. Alsop's pardon, and beg and pray of him, whether he would not forgive him; and, I asked him, how he could tell me such a falsity, to say, he brought it from Mr. Wellings'; he answered me, I did not know what to say about it: that is all I know about it: the iron was kept in the watch-house, till it was taken to the justices, at Marlborough-street, and then I took it to Hickes's Hall, and from there, to a public-house, and took care of it till the present time; I can swear to it, because I put a private mark upon it, at Marlborough-street.</p>

               <p>I am a wheeler; I work for Mr. Alsop: On Thursday morning last, Mr. Speller, whom I understand to be a watchman, came to our shop; young Mr. Alsop was there; he asked, if we had lost any iron; we did not immediately make any answer; we did not know that we had lost any; he described the iron that he had stopped; and we recollected we should have such a piece of iron in our tool-house; I went to the tool-house, and missed it immediately; I had had it in my hand twenty times, at least.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt, that such iron was there? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at it, and say, whether you are sure that iron was in your master's tool-house, before the 12th of December? - A. I can speak with the greatest certainty to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately, before that, had you seen it? - A. Perhaps a week before, or more; I have frequently made use of it, as a handspike, or a lever; it was always handy, and I frequently used it in that way; but I cannot say the last time that I used it; the last witness then described another piece of iron; I went into the tool-house, to fetch one, and asked him, if it was like that, and he said it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You had such a piece of iron? - A. Yes; it belongs to a timber carriage, we call it a stay brace.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect when you saw that? - A. No; there is so much old iron, and not coming often in use, that I cannot say; I have not the smallest doubt that this is the piece of iron that we had; I have had it so often in my hands, that I think I can speak with certainty to it; here is another remarkable piece that had been throwing about the old iron house a great while; it has been an additional iron to a cart, by way of repairing it; this piece of wood, that is fixed to it, is a piece of the cart that has been broken off in the iron.</p>
               <p>Q. That you well remember to have been on your master's premisses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But you cannot ascertain when you last observed it? - A. No; here are two more pieces of iron; one belongs to the axletire, and the other goes round the wheel; but I cannot swear positively to them.</p>

               <p>I am the brother of the prosecutor: I was in the wheelwright's shop, on Thursday morning, when the watchman came to the yard, about nine or ten in the morning; he said, he had stopped some person with some iron; and asked, if we had missed any; I went immediately to the tool-house, and missed a timber carriage bolt.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not missed it before? - A. No; he described the iron that he had stopped, and we then missed this iron; I can swear positively to this piece of iron, with the piece of wood in it; I have noticed it a great many times, in the yard; I cannot say when I had last seen it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130129"></xptr>Q. Had you frequent occasion to go into this tool-house? - A. I generally locked it up at night; I keep the key myself; the door is left open in the day, for the work people to go for tools; I had missed the key of this tool-house two days before this; it was left open one night, because we could not find the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - A. Yes; I hired him, to be a carter, about eight or ten weeks before; he went away on the Saturday week before; he was not turned away, but he neglected his work and did not come.</p>
               <p>Q. You had paid him his wages? - A. Yes; we wondered that he did not come again to work; he might have been there now, if he would.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to Kilburn, last Wednesday, and went after a job of work; I returned in the evening, and was coming near Mary-le-bonne, and picked up this iron, in Mr. Wellings's field; and the watchman stopped me, and asked me, where I was going with it; I told him, I was going to carry it home.</p>

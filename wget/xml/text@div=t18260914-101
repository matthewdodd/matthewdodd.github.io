               <p>MARY BRIGHT. I live with Mr. Thomas, in Claremont-terrace, Islington. I left a box, containing this property with Mrs. Hatton, at Mr. Rogers', in <placeName id="t18260914-101-crimeloc605">North-street</placeName>

I saw the articles safe in my box on the 2d of June, and on the 15th of August I went to it again, and missed them - Mrs. Hatton was then gone. I took the officer to search the premises of the prisoner, who had lived with Mrs. Rogers, but had then left; she said she was innocent, and would take her oath that she had left the box locked - the lace and two handkerchiefs were found on her.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went on the 24th of August to the prisoner's lodging - I told her I had some suspicion she had taken some property from the prosecutrix's box, in North-street - she said she had not taken anything, and I was welcome to search her, and she opened different boxes, but nothing was found; we then came to some dirty clothes, and found among them this handkerchief; I said I must take her into custody; she then said, "I will tell you the truth" - she went to a box, and took out three duplicates, which answer to the articles produced; she then took a pair of stays, and took this lace from between the lining and the stays; the prosecutrix then said, "You have one of my handkerchiefs on your neck" - she said, "It is," and gave it her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

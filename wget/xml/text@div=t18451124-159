I am a licensed victualler—I know the prisoner—saw him on the 14th of Oct., between eight and nine in the evening—he came to my house at New-cross, with two other men—he asked for a pot of porter—he said he had no money, he should have some presently—refused to credit him—I saw him and the other two men whispering together, and they went outside once or twice—I went after them—saw the prisoner call my pot-boy on one side, and whisper something tahm—I went into the stable—I sent an old man, named Hoy, who was acting as ostler there, for a light, and found a sack of turnip-seed—I asked if he knew how it came there—he said, "No"—knew it had no business there—I locked the stable, and went for a policeman—I gave the seed to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Bratt's service. On that evening saw a sack of seed taken into my master's stable by a man with a blue striped smock frock on his back—I was going out with a pint of ale, and in coming back saw the same man in conversation with the prisoner and two others—the pri-soner went to my fellow-servant first, and wanted him to go up stairs and borrow a sixpence of Henry, the ostler, which he refused—the prisoner and the man with the blue smock-frock were together—the prsoner then spoke to another boy—the man with the blue smock-frock wished me to go up stairs and borrow a shilling—the prisoner said, "Borrow two," not tellng me what it was for; but he followed me to the passage, and said, "Go up stairs and borrow 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Henry for me on a sack, I have left in the stable, worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Henry is the ostler—he was up stairs ill—I told my master.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk at the Bricklayers' Arms station of the South Eastern Railway. On the night of the 14th of Oct. the prisoner brought me an order for the delivery of thirty quarters of wheat—we had only fifteen</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184511240137"></xptr>
               <p>quarters in hand—seven quarters and a half had previously been delivered by me to Mr. Kingsford's man—I explained to the prisoner that we had only fif<lb></lb>teen quarters, and he said he must take that—the wheat was near some turnip seed—I sent a man to assist the prisoner in getting the wheat into his wagon, and I found that they had a sack of the turnip seed in the wagon—there was a man with a blue-striped frock, and a little boy, assisting in putting the corn in—I found that they had fourteen sacks of wheat in the wagon, and one of turnip seed, and one sack of wheat was remaining outside—that directed my attention to it—I looked at what was in the wagon, and was getting over the wagon to feel the sacks—the prisoner got over, and said, "This is seed," and he said to the man I sent to assist him,"Why did you put this in? I can tell seed from wheat in a minute"—the sack of seed was taken out of the wagon, I and placed with four other sacks of turnip seed—when I got that sack out of the wagon, which I assisted in pulling out, I put the sack of wheat in, which made fifteen—I counted them, and the prisoner went with me into the office to sign the book for fifteen—when be went in, the sack of seed was not in the wagon, but standing safe with the others—as the prisoner was going with me into the office, he said to the man, "Tie up, and see all is right," or, "All is right"—after he had signed the receipt, the prisoner went away, wagon and all—between the time that he came into the office to me, signed the receipt, and went out again, there was ample time for the other man to have put a sack of turnip seed into the wagon—I think there might have been time after the prisoner went out of the office, for him personally to have done it—the time would have been short—he might have done it with assistance.</p>

I could tell by the feel it was not wheat"—he then came to me to get his book signed—he might be with me five minutes—the South Eastern Railway Company are carriers—they were carrying this turnip-seed—I suppose it was common turnip-seed.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the business of William Thomas Treggon. He has many warehouses and manufactories; one is at No. 66, St. John Street, and his counting house is in Jewin Street—he is in the habit of buying zinc and cuttings at the warehouse in St. John Street—Creasy was warehouseman there—it would be his duty to weigh the cuttings, and to give the persons bringing them a note or invoice—he ought to weigh them, and enter the weight in a day book and in the invoice ticket, then tear it out of the book, and give it to the person who brought the cuttings, and enter a copy of the weight on the counterfoil—the note which he would give to the vendor would serve as a receipt for his having received these cuttings, and, being presented in Jewin Street, the person would be paid the money for them—Creasy was not to pay any one, the money was paid in Jewin Street by me or by the cashier—I remember a note being handed to me on Monday, 23rd March—this is it—the writing on it is Creasy's—it is for 1 cwt. of cuttings—Foreman presented it to me—we should deduct 4 lbs. for the tare, and give him 16*. a hundred<lb></lb>weight—I wrote a note for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said that he had received 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before, and I gave him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I deducted the tare, and gave him 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I produce the counterfoil of that transaction, No. 64—it is in Creasy's writing—in the day book there is an entry in Creasy's writing for 1 cwt.—the counterfoil No. 63 is not in the book, it has been abstracted—it ought to have been in the book; nothing ought to have been taken from the book—on Wednesday evening, 26th March, I was at St. John Street, when the two prisoners were taken—I heard Creasy ask to be allowed to retire to the water closet—I saw an officer follow him, and next morning these two notes and two counterfoils were given to me—the note was for 2 qrs. and the counterfoil, which has been torn out the book—they are both in Creasy's writing—they are both in a soiled state—I took the counterfoil book, looked through it in Creasy's presence, and asked him where the note was for the 2 qrs.; he said that he had destroyed it—I asked him where the counterfoil was; he said that he had destroyed it likewise—that was before he asked to retire—I heard the officer tell him he was taken for defrauding Mr. Treggon, and I think he said for obtaining money under false pretences—Creasy said that it was brought in in two parts, and there might have been about 1 cwt.—I asked him what he had done with the ticket for 2 qrs. which he first gave me—he said he had destroyed it—I turned it back to look for the counterfoil, and he said he had destroyed that.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in No. 7, Queen Street, Kingsland Road. I am a plumber—I have a brother named Thomas—I knew Foreman about three years ago—he was then a marine store dealer—I met him in Kingsland Road, with another man, in Dec. last; my brother was with me—Foreman asked us whether we used new zinc, and said he could get us some cheap—he did not say anything about old zinc that day, he did afterwards; he said that he could get us a good price for old zinc or for new cuttings in St. John Street—in consequence of this I made a communication to Mr. Treggon and to the officer—on Sunday, 22nd March, I saw Foreman; he said that if I had any zinc or cuttings, he would go with them to-morrow, Monday—I said that I would call on him, and I met him on the Monday—I went to Mr. Riley's, in Hoxton, and there bought 2 qrs. 20 lbs. of zinc cuttings; while I was buying them Foreman went to a public house—I had the zinc weighed in presence of policeman <hi rend="italic">G</hi> 145—after I had procured this zinc, and weighed it, I met Foreman—the zinc was in a bag—I then went with Foreman to Mr. Treggon's; before we got there, Foreman said that he had rather take it in two bags, and it was accordingly divided, and taken in two bags—I went with him to St. John Street; Foreman went in with the first lot; when he came out, he said he had given the man that weighed it 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he had got a ticket for 2 qrs.—he showed me the ticket, and I gave it him back—he and I went in together with the second lot, and I saw Creasy there; after he had weighed it, he wrote out a bill for 1 cwt.—Foreman gave him the bill back for the 2 qrs., and he put a shilling on the bill—Creasy gave the bill for the cwt. to Foreman, and said, "There you are, I have made you a note, for a cwt."—this is the note—I and Foreman then went to Jewin Street, and while on the way Foreman told me he had given Creasy 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I remained outside while Foreman went into the office in Jewin Street—he came out, and said that he had given 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and received 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave Foreman 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had previously given him the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he gave to Creasy—I did not give him the penny—when I went in the second time, I saw the quantity weighed, and it weighed 1 qr. and 9 lbs.—on 25th March I went to Mr. Treggon's again—I had pre<lb></lb>viously bought 2 qrs. and 7 lbs. of zinc—I accompanied Foreman in, and I saw Creasy there, and there was another man standing within about a yard of the scale—I saw Creasy weigh the bag of zinc in that other man's presence—I saw Creasy make out the note for it—this is it—it is for 2 qrs. and 8 lbs.—when Creasy handed Foreman the note, I heard him whisper to Foreman that he should not come so late, he should come sooner—it was then about 6 o'clock—when I and Foreman got outside, we met <hi rend="italic">G</hi> 145, and he ordered us both to ftp back—I saw Mr. Gale there, and Foreman</p>

I know that because I saw it weighed twice, at Mr. Riley's first, and afterwards at the coal shed—I never saw Creasy but once—he did not seem at all surprised at seeing me come in with Foreman—I was in trouble once, a long while ago—I have not been in any trouble besides that—I was not convicted of a burglary some time ago—I belong to the United Friends Friendly Society—I never was secretary to it—I was not expelled for defrauding it—I belong to it now—I have known Foreman about three years, he used to come to see some persons where I lived—I am not aware that I am to receive anything for my loss of time—I came forward on public grounds—my brother first spoke to Francis, the policeman, but I saw him afterwards—he spoke to me after my brother had spoken to him—he was conversing with me and my brother—I gave the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Foreman, because he asked me for it—he said that he wanted something to give to the man that weighed it.</p>

I got some more zinc, 1 qr.—I took that myself, and saw Greasy; he weighed it, and gave me this bill for 1 qr. and 8 lbs.—he said, "I had the beer next door"—when he weighed it, I put a small weight on the scale; he said, "We are not particular here"—he did not weigh the bag after the zinc was shot out—I took these notes to Jewin Street, and there I was paid the amounts 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—I saw Foreman several times afterwards, and I think I gave him a shilling or two.</p>

               <p>Is there any mark upon them? - One of them is twisted more in the middle than the other, and I have made such observation on them to swear they are my bars.</p>

               <p>I am a blacksmith at Hillingdon, the prisoner brought the bars, and offered to sell them to me the 24th of September, I live about a mile and a half from the prosecutor. The prisoner told me he found them at Red-hill. I did not chuse to have anything to do with him, I thought they were not honestly come by; I took him in custody, and took him to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court to Pearce. When do you recollect seeing these bars? - I have not seen them since I used them, they stood in the barn.</p>
               <p>Marshall. I saw them about a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Court. Does anybody know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I think I have seen his face with a waggon, but I am not sure: my barn was locked but there was a board broke behind.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I picked up the bars in the turnpike road, as I was coming for London with a waggon, I offered them for sale as I got them honestly.</p>
               <p>Was anybody with you when you picked them up? - Not a soul.</p>
               <p>What waggon was you driving? - I was coming up to London with one Mr. West, with the Worcester waggon, the waggoner was asleep.</p>

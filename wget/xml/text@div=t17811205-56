             was charged with having printed and published a libel as false in its assertion, as it was pernicious in its consequences.</p>
               <p>That in the beginning of the year 1780, a bill was brought into parliament for the purpose of repealing some laws which were a disgrace to any civilized country. The object of that bill was not as it was falsely represented, a design of giving any countenance to a religion so opposite to the genius of a free country, but the sole object was to repeal some cruel and sanguinary laws, which had been enacted in the days of darkness and superstition, which had so long continued a disgrace to this country.</p>
               <p>That notwithstanding this law had passed with the unanimous consent of parliament, some men thought this law had passed improperly; a very small body of men, at first, had thought fit to complain of it, and by making use of arguments to delude the minds of people in general, had procured a very large and formidable number of people, in order to join in a petition for a repeal of that law.</p>
               <p>I from my heart believed, that their motives were very laudable in petitioning, but I from my heart also believe, that their minds were imposed upon by arguments, and artifices of designing men, who had other purposes in view. The petition to parliament being rejected, produced a very considerable ferment in the minds of some people, and there were some people so lost to their duties, to their fellow citizens, they were determined by acts of violence to loosen the bands of society, to repeal that act, every one remembers the acts of violence committed on the very day of the petition; the Ambassadors chapels and houses being attacked, demolished and plundered, and some persons committed to Newgate for it. The very evening after the commitment of those men, the prisoner thought fit to publish this hand bill, the libel with which he is now charged, and a libel, a greater malignance calculated to produce worse effects, and which probably did produce worse effects, I believe never was stated to a jury. The obvious tendency of it was to inflame the minds of the people against the governing power, to induce the populace to trample upon the laws and constitution of this kingdom, and to substitute anarchy and confusion; the libel runs in these words (see the indictment.) It is impossible for any body to hear this paper read, without seeing its obvious tendency. This was at a time, when the minds of all men were alarmed, and the minds of the lower order of people in the highest state of perturbation; then it was introduced for the purpose of telling them what was intirely false respecting the introduction of popery, and for the purpose of hindering the laws from taking their course. It became the object of this man for the paultry purpose of recommending a trifling paper to sale, to inflame the minds of the people to commit outrages, which we can all recollect did follow. He employed two boys in distributing these hand bills amongst the populace, on the Tuesday, and on the Tuesday night those misguided<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050095"></xptr> persons, as he calls them, were rescued out of the gaol of Newgate; it is a fact notorious on the 6th of June, that great prison of this metropolis was consumed in flames; we all too sensibly feel the horrors that followed afterwards. The prisoner, as the author of such a paper as this, is a bad citizen, and deserving of punishment; as to the fact of publication that will be proved by two or three witnesses, and it will be your duty to find him guilty.</p>

               <p>I am a printer, I knew Mr. Moore in June 1780, and before it he applied to me several weeks and months before I printed the Scourge for Mr. Moore, it came out every Saturday; when I came home on Monday, the 5th or 6th of June, I believe Monday or Tuesday, I found a hand bill.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to put this question to the witness, whether he knows me, or where he ever saw me?</p>
               <p>Milledge. Yes; I have seen him several times, he used to come to my printing house often; I am satisfied of his person; upon the occasion of these tumults he sent me a hand bill, intitled England in Blood, it was left for me when I was out of town, when I came home in the morning I found it, I believe it was Monday or Tuesday, I don't know which; I sent it up stairs to be composed.</p>
               <p>Do you know the hand writing? - Yes; I have seen Mr. Moore write several times, and I believed that note to be his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Was that hand bill printed from that note? - There is one I put my name to, I should be glad to see. (a paper shewn him.)</p>

               <p>Who took them away? - I believe Mr. Moore ordered the boy to take it away.</p>

            , I don't know which; I believe there were two or three thousand printed; I came back and found they were printed, and I think I represented to Mr. Moore they were a little inflammatory.</p>
               <p>The paper was printed from the hand writing of Moore? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You should give proof of that paper being lost, before you give evidence of the hand writing, when the original is not produced.</p>
               <p>Counsel. What is become of that paper? - It was given to Mr. Wilkes.</p>
               <p>What Mr. Wilkes? - Alderman Wilkes.</p>
               <p>When did you see Mr. Moore after you had printed it? - The same day at my printing office; I believe it was while they were working off at press; it is a good while ago, I should be very glad to recollect myself perfectly; when Mr. Moore came to my office, I told him I thought they were rather inflammatory, on my advise he altered the first hand bill to the second; I had no more conversation with him about it; I did not see Mr. Moore when the hand bill was left.</p>
               <p>What did he come to you about? - I had connection with him for several weeks or months before, I thought it was his hand writing; I believe it was, he came to me when some were published; I told him I thought it was rather inflammatory, and accordingly Mr. Moore altered it to the second hand bill where my name is put.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the first hand bills were delivered out? - I do not recollect: I may be.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination by the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>You will not undertake to swear it was my hand writing you received? - I believe the very paper was delivered to Mr. Wilkes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That is not the question.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that paper which you received, and afterwards delivered up the prisoner's hand writing? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him write before? - Several times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether the hand bill was printed from your press as it was sent to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050096"></xptr> your house, and as you conceived to have been in my hand writing? - The first hand bill was printed verbatim from his hand writing; when I represented to him it was rather inflammatory, he himself came up, and altered it to the second.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That is no answer to my question, Mr. Milledge? - I believe it is, Sir.</p>
               <p>Whether you know the hand bill to be printed as it was wrote, and in my hand writing, for I have evidence here in court, or very near at hand, and you will be cautious in your declaration; the question is whether the first paper you printed was faithfully printed from the paper you think is my hand writing? - I believe it was, here is a man in court will be more particular.</p>
               <p>Whether I employed you, in the first instance, to print this paper? - I don't say you did; you employed one Mr. Barr; Mr. Barr turned it over to me, and you came to me, and brought copy; I was first engaged by one Mr. Barr, who is now engaged in the Morning Herald, his business at that time rather engrossed too much of his attention, and after he had printed three or four numbers, he asked me if I would take it on myself.</p>

I beg I may ask another question, which is this, when these bills, called England in Blood, which were delivered from his house, were delivered upon the 6th or 7th of June, it is a material matter? - My lord, I cannot be punctual to the day, I believe it was Tuesday; here will be clearer evidence than mine upon that question.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it the day before Newgate was burnt, or any other? - I believe it was the morning Newgate was burnt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were they delivered upon that day Newgate was burnt or nor? - To the best of my remembrance it was about noon of the day Newgate was burnt.</p>
               <p>I should be exceedingly sorry you in a court of judicature or justice should perjure yourself: now you can't undertake to swear it positively? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you swear positively, it was either that day, or the day following? - It was one of those two days.</p>
               <p>That you can swear positively? - I can.</p>

               <p>How long have you been with Mr. Moore? - I believe about ten or eleven weeks, as near as I can guess; I was employed by him in June last, to carry out papers and deliver them at shops, and to people as they passed along.</p>
               <p>Look at that hand-bill, and inform the jury, whether you was employed to do any thing with that bill? - Yes, sir; to deliver them out to people that passed and repassed.</p>
               <p>You was employed by the prisoner for that purpose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you in consequence of that, deliver any out, to people that passed and repassed? - Yes, sir; great quantities.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what day it was? - As near as I can recollect it was a Tuesday.</p>

               <p>Do you remember the burning of Newgate? -</p>
               <p>Do you remember whether it was that day, or any other day? - It was that day.</p>
               <p>Court. Let the hand-bill be read.</p>
               <p>The hand-bill (as stated in the indictment verbatim) was read in court.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination of Ward by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>At what time did you receive those hand-bills from me to be delivered to the public? - About three or four o'clock, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>There is no guessing in this matter, it is a matter of consequence; guessing will not do, you must speak as near as possible? - It was near about three or four o'clock.</p>
               <p>I will correct him or try to refresh his memory? - Did you ever see one of those hand-bills before seven in the evening, on Tuesday the 6th of June? - I did, Mr. Moore.</p>
               <p>You did? - I did.</p>
               <p>And where did you see them? - At the shop.</p>
               <p>Before seven in the evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon the 6th of June? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Pray had you not directions from me on Wednesday morning, and there could be very little time between six and seven in the evening, or before the shops were shut; had not you strict orders not to deliver another bill? - I had.</p>
               <p>Had you delivered any bills? - Yes; my Mistress told me to deliver a few, I had delivered a few just as the rioters went past.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He had orders from me not to deliver any on the next morning, I should have been exceeding sorry to have caused tumults or riots.</p>
               <p>To Ward. Did I not tell you strictly not to deliver any? - You said there was a mistake, Mr. Moore, you told me not to deliver them out till that mistake was altered.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you sure it was between three and four o'clock on Tuesday, you first delivered them? - As near as I can think of, I know I received them before seven.</p>
               <p>When did you begin to deliver them? - I delivered them just as the rioters came by Newgate, I delivered them just about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>I thought you said three? - That was when I received them; it was just as they came past, my mistress told me to do it as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord, I can only say this, I had no intention of inflaming the minds of the people; the hand-bill was written on Sunday the 4th of June, it was sent to Mr. Milledge's office, I believe upon the Monday, and not till seven in the evening upon Tuesday did I see one of the bills, they were delivered by his servant-maid, and they were not in Fleet-street till near eight; there were not more than one hundred or one hundred and fifty distributed, and they were all distributed by that boy; I was apprehensive that some advantage would be taken of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050098"></xptr> exigencies of the times, and the dreadful conflagration with which the city and metropolis was threatened; I told the boy he should not deliver another on the Wednesday morning. The bill your lordship will consider is not addressed to the rioters, but to the Protestant Association; the rioters I believe were a mere band of robbers, and disturbers of the public peace; the Protestant Association were a very different description of men; they had a very different object in view, no less than this, to prevent the establishment of popery by act of parliament; to promote designs of such sort, I hold to be laudable and proper; how far I am liable for that I submit to your lordship and the court.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses? -</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know that it is necessary to call any; I was used cruelly, had my doors broke open, was taken out of my bed, my sheets taken from my bed things, taken out of drawers; carried to Lincoln's Inn, then to Bridewell, and confined in a room not more than four feet square, and there kept ten weeks; and they took above 200 l. of my property, which I never have received, nor perhaps ever may; Mr. Chetham, whom I see in court, or Mr. White, might have found me if they thought proper; I wrote three letters to Mr. White, and desired he would restore what they took from me; he never sent to me, but there was an official letter went to one of my bail, Mr. Reynolds; I surrendered this day seven weeks, and now my trial is brought on, my lord, this witness I can bring, was taken out of his bed prior to this, and carried to Lincoln's Inn, and his drawers searched, to know whether I had correspondence with the French, or had French money.</p>
               <p>Court. That is foreign to the question now before us.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Therefore I would not call him; every step to prejudice me has been taken by the crown, and I know I have been obnoxious to them.</p>

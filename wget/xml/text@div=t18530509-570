                  </hi>. I live at Hillingdon, and am porter of the Uxbridge Union workhouse. On Saturday, 16th April, about 7 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came there for a night's lodging—he was a stranger, not a parishioner—we had a stable which was used for the purpose of giving a night's lodging to vagrants—another man had come for the same purpose about a quarter of an hour before—the prisoner was shown into the same stable as that man; it was called the vagrant ward—next morning the other man went away about half past 6 o'clock—the prisoner left about 7 o'clock—about five minutes after he was gone I observed flames coming out of the door and window of the vagrant ward—there was straw and rugs in there—after giving the alarm of fire, I went in pursuit of the prisoner—I overtook him about three-quarters of a mile from the Union—I asked him how long he had left the Union work-house—he said, "Not many minutes"—I said, "You set fire to the vagrant ward before you left"—he said, "I did not"—I took him back with me to</p>

               <p>the Union—when we got there, I said, "Give me those lucifers you have in your pocket;" I did not see that he had any, but I guessed that he had—he put his hand in his pocket, and gave me this box of lucifers which I now pro-duce—he said, "I did do it, but what for I don't know"—I sent for Smith, the constable—I examined the stable; the manger was very much burnt, the wood was charred—the manger is fixed in the stable—the floor of the stable is a moveable floor—that was burnt—the straw had nearly all burnt out—the rafters were burnt, one nearly through—the window was destroyed, there were thirty panes broken—that appeared to have occurred from the heat of the fire.</p>

                  </hi>. On 16th April last I was an inmate of the Hillingdon Union Workhouse. I took the prisoner to the stable that evening—another man also came; the prisoner was the first that went into the stable—I do not recollect whether he or the other man arrived first at the Union—next morning I let out the other man first; he was a young man, with a wooden leg—I let him out about 7 o'clock, and the prisoner about twenty minutes or half an hour afterwards—about five minutes after he was gone the porter called me, and said the place was all on fire—I observed that the stable was on fire; it was soon extinguished, as there were a great many of us.</p>

                  </hi> I am a brass cock finisher in the employ of Mr. Howard, an engineer, of Whitecross Street—on 4th July, about two o'clock, I was with Dingley in the workshop overlooking Charity Court—I saw the prisoner come up the steps, put his hand in his pocket, and pull out something wrapped in paper; he wrapped it in something black, and stooped and put it under the wall; he then walked down the steps and walked on towards Whitecross Street—Dingley and I then ran to the place and found a rag; we opened it, and found nine bad shillings wrapped separately in paper—we went to the window again a quarter of an hour afterwards, and saw a man similar to the one who came before; when he got to the hole he stooped down and seemed surprised; he then stooped and felt the hole again—Dingley ran down and I followed him and found the prisoner; he had a bundle of rope over his shoulder—I looked for a policeman, but could not find one and came back—the man who put something in the hole had something over his shoulder, and so had the prisoner.</p>

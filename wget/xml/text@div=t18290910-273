            . On the 9th of August, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was at the top of Cow-lane with a female; I felt my handkerchief go from my coat pocket - I turned, and saw the prisoner give it to another; I followed them. but the other got off - I followed the prisoner to Fleet-market - he began to run; I called Stop thief! and he was secured - I have no doubt he saw me; he stopped himself when I cried Stop thief! I am sure he gave the handkerchief to the other - I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where did you take me into custody? A. In Fleet-market; I did not take the other because I wished to secure you both if possible; you attempted to get away, but could not.</p>

I stopped, and went back towards the prosecutor - I took out my own handkerchief while I was passing the gentleman, and wiped my face with it.</p>

            . My handkerchief was a red one, and this is green - I did not see the prisoner take it out, but I saw him with it; he gave it to the other, who turned off to the right - when I got to the turning, the other was out of sight; I am sure it was my property - I had used it a few minutes before; it was a fine night, and just twilight.</p>

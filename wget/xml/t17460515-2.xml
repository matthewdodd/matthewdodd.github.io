               <p>Hide. I don't know the Quantity. Here are nine Pieces found at London-Bridge; I believe I have lost a hundred Pieces. This Gentleman, Mr. Corderoy, stopt these.</p>

               <p>Q. What Quantity did you miss then?</p>
               <p>Hide. I believe by the Bulk of them in the Place, for there were two thousand, I believe there are near one hundred Pieces gone.</p>

               <p>Hide. Yes, Sir; these are the Cloths produced in Court.</p>
               <p>Court. Then these two Pieces are yours.</p>
               <p>Hide. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Yards are there in these two Pieces?</p>
               <p>Hide. There should be twenty-four Yards in each Piece.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the Value of them?</p>
               <p>Hide. They are worth about fourteen Shillings a Piece, but they are valued at twelve in the Indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how you lost them?</p>
               <p>Hide. I have seen them since they stood in the Warehouse, and there are little Wooden Bars, so they have put a Stick in and book'd them out as you would a Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your Warehouse?</p>
               <p>Hide. At Brook's-Wharf.</p>

               <p>Hide. No, they were made for Hammocks of Men of War I made for the Government, and they have since taken a wider Sort, and they have been useless for a Year and a half.</p>

             desire you to go with her?</p>
               <p>Cart. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Cart. I consulted with this Gentleman first to stop these Pieces of Cloth, because I imagin'd they were not honestly come by. I went to Mr. Corderoy, the Constable, to consult with him what I should do in the Case.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Cart. Then I went to Mrs. Carlisle's House, and found both the Prisoners there. Carter said it was his Cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came and found the Prisoners at the Bar, who shew'd you the Cloth?</p>
               <p>Cart. That Man that stands there in Blue-grey, Carter.</p>

               <p>Q. When he shew'd you the Cloth, what then?</p>
               <p>Cart. Then I said, I wish you would carry it down to the Water-side. I told him, when he carried it home he should have the Money for it.</p>
               <p>Cart. Then you did not ask him the Price, nor bid him any thing for it?</p>
               <p>Cart. No. So he carried it down to the Waterside : I would have had him come over the Water, if I could; but he pretended that the String of his Breeches was broke, and desir'd this good Woman to bring him some Money directly. I wanted it to be carried to Mr. Corderoy's, under a Pretence of having Money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Carlisle say of these two Pieces? These two Pieces were at Carlisle's House?</p>
               <p>Cart. They had a Fullpot of Beer there, and Carter said, bring me what Money you can.</p>

               <p>Corderoy. My Lord, I deal in Sacking, and I am Constable too. My Lord, this Mrs. Cart and her Husband are Sack-Weavers; they work for me in weaving of Cloth; I have bought several Pieces of them at a Market Price, and have had some Suspicion that they were stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. What then, Sir?</p>
               <p>Corderoy. That was before I had a Suspicion that they were stolen. I had four before I had a Suspicion, and I had a Suspicion of the fifth Piece. This was on Saturday the 3d of May. On Monday Morning there was two more brought, and I desir'd them to bring the Persons to me. On the 6th of May they brought two Pieces with Mrs. Carlisle. I ask'd Mrs. Carlisle who she had them of; she said she they were the Property of a Person for whom she had the Disposal of them. I told her she must not take them away, but I must stop them and her too; so I takes her to Guildhall, and was before some of the Sitting Aklermen, and by her Directions went to Fleetditch, where they said Carter liv'd, but they said that

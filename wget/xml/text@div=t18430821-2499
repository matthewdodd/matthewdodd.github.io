I lost my watch, and was going about—Lanham and John Mann came up to me, and told me not to be frightened, it was all right, they would assist me to find my watch—I took them into a public-house in Essex-street, and called for some beer—I laid my head on the table, and went to sleep—the landlord awoke me, and asked me if my money was right—I felt, and missed from my pocket 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Bank of England notes, which I had received from Barnetts and Co., for a check for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I will suffer nothing wrong in my house"—Lanham said, "We are all friends, let this man have his nap out"—I said, "Let him have it, but you shan't go"—Lanham went into the yard—I followed him—I awoke the prosecutor, and said, "Search and see what you have lost"—he said, "I have got a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note changed," and he had got some silver and gold—I then said the prisoners might go, I begged their par<lb></lb>don—I then heard the prosecutor cry out, "I have lost 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Lanham had got out—I ran out, and challenged him with not paying for the beer—he came back, and at that moment I turned the key, and sent for a policeman—he was searched, and 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes found in his breeches' pocket.</p>

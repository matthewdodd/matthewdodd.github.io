               <p>Q. Was the headfast of the King safe? - A. It<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260042"></xptr>was; I went the next morning between six and seven, and found the King and the Four Brothers adrift; I immediately went on board the King barge to see if the headfast was safe, I found it was cut; I went home and got my breakfast, and enquired of a man what barge it was that lay along side the night before, and I found it was Richard Johnson's; I went after the barge, and met with her taking in coals on board a ship at Ratcliffe-cross; I went on board the barge, and looked down in his cabin; I asked him if he had seen any thing of the barges, and he said, he had left them safe, that he did not cut them adrift; he told me I should not search his barge till I had a warrant, and I went and informed Mr. Richardson, and left a boy on board; and when I came back, going into Johnson's barge, I saw the headfast lying under his hatches, which he pulled out himself, and said, that is not your rope, it is the rope I bought, and gave 18d. for it; he bought it of a purl-man.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of it? - A. Before it was cut, about 5s. it is not worth above 18d. now; then Mr. Richardson and Mr. Cooke came up, and he told Mr. Cooke he had bought it of a purl-man.</p>
               <p>Q. What is a purl-man? - A. A man that sells purl and beer about; and Mr. Cooke took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the headfast that belonged to the King? - A. Yes; and that is the property of Mr. Richardson.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you made any particular examination of this rope before hand? - A. Yes; part of the rope was left upon the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. But are not all the barge ropes much of the same sort? - A. Some are thicker, and some laid in a different form; some hawser laid, and some shrowd laid.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you can say, is, that it is the same sort of rope? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not thousands of barges in the river, with the same sort of rope? - A. Yes; for I have got five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare the two? - A. Yes; and they fitted.</p>

               <p>I am a police-officer: In consequence of a search-warrant, I went with Mr. Richardson, on board the prisoner's barge, the rope was then on deck; I told the prisoner I came on board to search for a headfast; he said, there was a headfast, and he had bought it of a purl-man; I asked him if he knew his name, he said, no; if he had, he should not have bought it; and then I took him before a Magistrate, and there he said the purlman had picked it up in the mud.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mud about it? - A. No; there was water, but no mud. (The rope produced.)</p>
               <p>Barlow. This is the rope, and this is what was left upon the barge; they correspond exactly.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER RICHARDSON, junior, sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to Ratcliffe-cross, after I had got a warrant, with Cooke, to the prisoner's barge; this headfast was the property of my father and myself; Barlow is our labourer.(The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read, as follows:)</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I stand here, indicted for robbing the prosecutor's barge of a rope, value 1s. 6d. It is a customary thing for the bum-boats on the Thames, to supply the river with purl; I was in my boat, the purl-man asked me if I would purchase a rope, which is the rope specified in the indictment; I told him I had no objection, provided he shewed it me; he produced the rope, and asked me half a crown for it, I told him, 1s. 6d. and a pot of purl was the worth of it, and he took it; it is true my barge laid next to the prosecutor's barges, and the next day he came on board my barge, and saw the rope, which he said was his property; I knew myself innocent, I refused him taking away the article that I had bought and honestly paid for; had I been guilty of this offence, I had time enough to make away with the rope after the prosecutor had seen it. I am now certain that the prosecutor has no idea that I stole the rope; I know myself innocent of the charge.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutor.) Do you know any thing of this man? - A. I never heard any thing to his advantage; I have heard a great deal to his disadvantage.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is a little boy that saw me buy the rope.</p>
               <p>A little Boy called. Q. What is your age? - A.Thirteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the nature of an oath? - A. No.(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

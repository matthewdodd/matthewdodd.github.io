                  </hi>. On the 17th of June I was in a public-house in the neighborhood of Drury-lane Theatre, from eight to ten o'clock in the morning—I was sober, but I felt unwell, as I had had a long walk on the Saturday—I went out of doors—the prisoner and another followed, and offered me their service—at the same time the prisoner put his hand into my pocket, and I felt my money gone—the other got away—I challenged the prisoner with the robbery, and he put his hand behind him, and put it into his coat pocket—I lost a half-crown and a shilling.</p>

On the morning of the 17th of June I was going some flour, and coming through Red Lion-court, Drury-lane, I saw the prosecutor standing leaning against the wall—the prisoner was by his side, with his right hand on the prosecutor's waistcoat pocket—I heard the pro<lb></lb>secutor say, "For God's sake don't rob me"—the prisoner said, "I have not a farthing in the world"—the prosecutor said, "You have; I will not (let you go till I give you in charge"—I did not see him take any thing from the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose your pellise - A. On the 17th of February. On Friday the 16th I left it in the room. I did not look for it till Saturday afternoon; and on that Saturday afternoon, about half-past two o'clock, she went to fetch the pots in as I thought; she never returned. I went up stairs and missed my pellise.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. On the 27th. A young man met her opposite of the monument, and he brought her to the Duchess of York.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THOMAS. I am a servant to Mr. Flemming Fleet-market. On the 17th of February between twelve and four the prisoner pledged this pellise. I lent her 17 s. on it.</p>
               <p>PETER MASON. I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 27th of February I was sent for to the Duchess of York; the prisoner was there crying, she was charged with stealing this pellise; she acknowledged that she had pledged it at a shop in Fleet-market, and she had destroyed the duplicate on the step of the door as she came out. I took her with me to shew me the shop, she found the pellise by the apron it was in, and Mrs. Benham claimed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went out I asked her to lend me a pellise, I went out and pledged it. I asked her for some money, she denied me, I was ashamed to return. When I met this young man, I said I would go home with him, as he said they would not hurt me if I would own it.</p>

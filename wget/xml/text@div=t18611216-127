                  </hi>. On Saturday, 16th November, I saw the prisoner at my shop, 47, Sooth Andley-street, a confectioner's—she asked me for two plain buns, which I had not got—she took two Bath buns, which came to fourpence, and gave me a half-crown, which I put in the till—there were no other half-crowns there—I gave her a two shilling piece and twopence in change—a few minutes afterwards my porter came for the beer for the men, and I gave him the half-crown—he gave it me back and said, "I think that is a bad one"—I examined it, and it was bad, so I put it away by itself—on the 7th, I think, of this month, the prisoner came again—I was sitting behind the counter reading the paper—I recognised her immediately she came in—I waited for my young woman to serve her, and the prisoner gave her a half-crown—I said, "Let me see the half-crown," she gave it into my hand—I went round the counter and said, "I must detain you, you passed a bad half-crown to me some little time ago; this is a bad one also"—I sent for a constable, and gave her into custody with the two half-crowns.</p>

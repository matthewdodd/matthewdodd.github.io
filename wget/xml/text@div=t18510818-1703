On 26th July, between 3 and 4 o'clock, Easton brought a load and a half of straw to the Arthur-mews—I told him to take it back and tell Roberts I had no room for it—the veterinary-surgeon was there, the prisoner waited while he looked at eight or nine horses, and then came to me and said, "What are we going to do with the straw?"—I said, "Take it to Roberts and tell him I have no room"—he said, "Look here, we can <hi rend="italic">swallow</hi> it"—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "I know where I can take it, and we can get 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece, he has signed the ticket"—I said I did not do business in that way—he said, "It is all right, if you do not tell Roberts"—I said, "I shall tell him"—I went up-stairs to have my tea, and he called out, "Shall I take the straw to the home-yard?"—I said, "Yes"—he went away, and I sent my wife to watch him.</p>

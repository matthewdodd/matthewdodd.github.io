I am eighty-one years old—I live at Liverpool—I am the father of Ann Archibald—she was married to a person named Archibald—I saw the prisoner at Liverpool in 1840—he was acquainted with my son, and used to come to my house repeatedly—I saw him after he was supposed to have been to church, but I cannot say the time—I heard of his marrying my daughter, but I was not present—all I know is I took it for granted that he was married to her, and they lived together as man and wife—he called her his wife in my presence, and called me his father—I went and looked at the register in St. Nicholas church, Liverpool.</p>

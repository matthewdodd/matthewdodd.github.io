               <p>John Jukes. On the 7th of May, either that night or next morning, I lost a cow calf out of my coop, where were three others.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of that coop?</p>
               <p>Jukes. It is the place where I keep them to feed in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Jukes. I live at <placeName id="t17590425-7-crimeloc38">Edmunton</placeName>

               <p>Q. When did you see this calf last?</p>
               <p>Jukes. I saw it over night and suckled it, and missed it at five the next morning: it was worth 45 s. that I was bid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found it again?</p>
               <p>Jukes. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jukes. I went and got a warrant, and searched about the parish, and after that, a woman that is here, came to me about seven months after, and said, she saw me as I was going by the prisoner's house, and she went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250007"></xptr> backwards to him, and said, we shall be all hanged, here is Jukes searching about for his calf; she said, the prisoner had just mopped up the blood, and covered the calf up under some wood; I took up the prisoner and charged him with stealing my calf; he told me himself how he took it, and led it away; he said it was in the morning, when the larks were singing as he led it to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any others hear this confession?</p>
               <p>Jukes. Yes, there were several other people by at the time.</p>

            . The prosecutor keeps a Publick House: I called there, there was the prisoner; the prosecutor charged him with stealing his calf; the prisoner own'd he did, and said, he led it to his home; Mr. Jukes asked him if he had any body to help him; he said, no body but the Devil.</p>

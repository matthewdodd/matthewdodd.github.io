                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Button, 9, Collingwood Street, Bethnal Green—on Friday evening, 8th April, I was in Commercial Street, Shoreditch, about 7.55, carrying a bundle of linen, containing two window blinds, a night dress, and other articles, worth 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—as I passed the top of Keat Court the prisoners came up to me—Thomas struck me on the mouth, Monroe stood in front and took the clothes from me, and Emeway stood by my side, gave me a push and said "Don't halloa, my good woman; I will go and get the clothes if you will come down the next street, it will lead you into Keat Court"—Monroe kicked the clothes out of my hand after I received the blow—Monroe ran down Keat Court—I called "Police!"—a mob came round—three persons came up, one of whom went with me down Keat Court—I gave a description of the men, and saw Thomas and Monroe together at the station, on Monday, the 11th—they were placed with six or seven men, in a row, and I identified them—there was a man very much like Monroe, who I thought was him, but when they said "Right about face," I identified Monroe by his back—I could identify him better by his back than his face, because I saw him running away with the clothes—I saw Emeway on the 24th, at the station; I picked him out from six or seven others—there was a man very much like him at first sight, but I had not got the words out of my mouth when I said "That is the man" I am sure these are the men—I have not seen my bundle since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thomas. Q.</hi> Am I the one that struck you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on my mouth—I am certain of you, because you were some minutes before you took the clothes away, and the other two men were some minutes talking to me, looking in my face.</p>

               <p>with him"—I saw you run away, and identify your legs, because they project out—you are knock-knee'd—your trowsers were not quite full, nor quite tight, and your knees seemed to project in—I also know you by your face—you looked as if you were going to stare me through—I did not tell the Magistrate that you snatched the bundle—I said you kicked it—I was at two Police Courts, Spital Square and Worship Street—you used bad language, and said "Give me them clothes"—I said "No, they belong to me," and you kicked them—I stated the same at Worship Street as I did at Spital Square and here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Emeway. Q.</hi> Can you swear that I was with these two men? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—you stood and looked in my face—I did not see you talking to them; but you were certainly with Thomas—you pushed me—I did not pick you out directly at the station, I picked out another man first—I know you by your general features, you came up and said "Don't you halloa, my good woman"—the man who I picked out, Crawley, was hardly an inch taller than you—I had scarcely picked him out when I saw you, and said "That is the very man"—the constable did not pick you out for me.</p>

On Monday night, 11th April, I went to a lodging-house in Flower and Dean Street, with Burrows—as soon as I got in Monroe jumped off a sack, rushed to the fire, and commenced putting coals on—Thomas was sitting on a stool—I went to Monroe and said "Turn round"—after a second he turned round, and I said I should take him for being concerned in stealing some clothes from a lady in Com<lb></lb>mercial Street, on the 8th—he asked me what night it was—I said "Friday night"—he said "Very well," and I took him to the station—Thomas was taken by Burrows—we placed him with ten or eleven others, the nearest to their size that we could possibly find, and the prosecutrix went to a man very much like Monroe, and about his size, and said "I think this is some<lb></lb>thing like the man"—the inspector said "Right about"—the row turned their backs, and then she identified Monroe by putting her hand on him—on 17th April I saw Emeway in Old Nicholl Street, Shoreditch—I was with Burrows, in plain clothes—as soon as he saw us he got off the pavement and ran away, up a short street, which is no thoroughfare, but which has a public-house at the end, having a thoroughfare through it—this being 4 o'clock on Sunday afternoon the doors were closed, and I met him coming back, as he could not get in—I told him I should take him for being con<lb></lb>cerned, with two men in custody, in robbing a lady and stealing a bundle of linen—he said "Very well, if I am <hi rend="italic">buffed</hi> to, I will stand to it; but I don't know anything about it; I hope you will give me a fair chance; I am not the man that done it"—he said one man we had in custody, named Monroe, he believed was right; but that the other was wrong—I placed him in the station with several others; the prosecutrix looked at him, and was going to point to a man an inch or an inch and a half taller; but when she saw Emeway she said "That is the man who pushed me"—I know the prisoners—I have seen Monroe and Emeway in company frequently—I have seen Thomas before; but not in their company.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Thomas.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Monroe.</hi> I own I gave that to the young woman. I used to live with her mother, who brought me up. It was asking her to come up and prove where I was.

Tell my mother that if she can get my brother to say I was there all day on Friday up to 12 o'clock at night Tell her that I come up next Tuesday for my witnesses.

                  <hi rend="italic">Emeway's Defence.</hi> I was taken for stealing a watch, and the gentleman picked out a different man altogether. Since that, this policeman has had his eye on me, and when he sees me with a bundle he stops me if anything is lost; this is the second time he has taken me on suspicion. He would not take me himself, but sent his brother to do it. I never saw these men before. I don't suppose there was one honest person round the woman at the time. There are nothing but prostitutes and thieves in Keat Court.</p>

            . I live in Pleasent-row, Brick-lane. I owed Mr. Hales 2l. 9s. 2d.; the prisoner called in February, and I paid him 10s. on account - he wrote on the back of the bill, "Received, 24th of February, 10s., T. Bulger;" I paid him 10s. more in April, and wrote a receipt for that on the bill; and in June 5s. - I saw him write a receipt for these sums; he brought me the bill himself; here it is - (read.)</p>
               <p>MR. HALES. I never received these sums from him, nor did he ever tell me he had received them; he was my under servant for two years, and behaved well; he then had 12s. a week and his breakfast, but afterwards I only paid him for what he did.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He never told me the charge till Monday: and then he said, "Your master is very partial to you - you had better make it up;" I said I had neither money nor friends: he said, "Your master is worth plenty of blant."</p>

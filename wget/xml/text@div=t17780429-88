               <p>I am bar-keeper to the prosecutor. There was 28 l. 11 s. 6 d. in the drawer in the bureau; I counted it the night before, and put it in the drawer in the morning. I did not leave the bar till ten or eleven o'clock; during the time I was in and out, I had the bar constantly in my eye; nobody entered the bar, but the prisoner, who went there to cut some bread and cheese; he had an opportunity, if he thought proper, to take it, of opening the bureau, and taking the money out without my seeing him. The gold was in a green silk purse, the silver in a bag; the sum consisted mostly of gold; there was about 50 s. in silver, all the rest was in guineas and half guineas. The prisoner went out, and I missed it, about ten minutes after; he ran away, and never returned again.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher. I pursued the prisoner and found him at Waterfield, in Hampshire. I took him to the sign of the Drum, and asked him what he had done with the money he took out of Mr. Walker's bar; he immediately acknowledged that he had made away with all of it, but 1 l. 14 s. I found a watch and trinkets, and other things upon him, which he confessed he bought with part of the money. I made use of neither promises nor threats to induce him to confess. I said afterwards on the road, that if he behaved well I would do the best I could for him; but I did not say any thing before he confessed.</p>

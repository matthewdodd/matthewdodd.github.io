                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Harmondsworth—I have one partner. The prisoners were in our employ—when they go to London with their cart I allow them a truss and a half of hay for their horses, but no corn—the mixture of oats and beans produced corresponds exactly with my oats and beans—I have no doubt they are mine.</p>

I was on duty on the 31st of March—I saw May bring a horse drawing a cart from the prosecutor's premises into the high-road, and Gray brought two horses out of another entrance round to the cart—they put the two horses to the other in the cart; and then May went into the yard, brought a bundle of hay out, and gave it to Gray—they went on the road—I stopped them, and asked what they had got—May said, "A load of straw"—I said, "What else?"—he said, "A truss and a half of hay"—I said, "What is this hay?"—he said, "I took that bit for the horses up the lane"—I asked if he had got anything else—he said, "No, nothing else"—I called my brother officer to search the cart—he found there oats and beans—there were 15lbs. of hay beside the truss and a half.</p>

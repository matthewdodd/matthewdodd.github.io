                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Lansdown-terrace, Notting-hill, and am in the service of Mr. Ullathorne. On Wednesday night, 17th Sept., I went to bed about 10 o'clock—I fastened up all the doors in the lower part of the house, except the front-door—the next morning, I came down about 7 o'clock—I went into the dining room; there is a sideboard there—both the cellarets were open—I missed a plated waiter, a bread basket, and many other articles—I called up Mr. Ullathorne—I know the prisoner, he had been employed at Mr. Ullathorne's about three weeks or a month ago, in repairing the house—there is a knife house in the front of the house belonging to my master, with a window in it—I had left it quite secure the night before—I think I went to that knife house on the Thurs<lb></lb>day morning, before the officer did—the shutter had been burst open, and the hasp of the window had been broken open—the door of the knife house was not locked—it had been closed the night before, but not looked—in the morning it was open, I believe—there is a second door leading to the pas<lb></lb>sage, leading to the kitchen; it had been bolted, locked, and chained the night before—in the morning there was a panel cut out, and the door was open—there is a door on the top of the stain—that was shut and fastened, but not locked—in the morning, I think it was open—there is no window in that door, but glass by the side to give light—the window was whole the night before, and in the morning one pane of glass was taken out, which was by the side of the staircase—there is a side door leading from the lower apart<lb></lb>ments into the carriage drive—that door was feat the night before, and it was open in the morning, and the catch of the door was forced away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On the night of 17th Sept. I had a writing desk in my bedroom, and seven or eight postage stamps in it—on that evening I tore up several letters, and left the pieces on the table—I left the postage stamps in the desk—they were in a small box—on the next morning, I found the dining room was in a state of confusion, the sideboard was broken open—I missed a plated waiter, some spoons, some dessert knives, a sugar sifter, and other things—my writing desk was lying on the floor, and all the things thrown out—I missed the postage stamps—since then this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) has been shown to me, it is one of the pieces that I had left on the table on the evening of 17th Sept—here is the writing on it of a friend of mine—it is part of a letter which I tore up.</p>

On Thursday morn<lb></lb>ing, 18th Sept, I was fetched by Mr. Ullathorne—I went to the house, and examined a knife house in the front area, which is about sixteen feet deep—the clasp of the window had been wrenched off by means of a chisel or something like it—there were marks on the window sill—I examined the inside shutters—they had been cut and forced open—there was suffi<lb></lb>cient opening for a man to get through—I examined a door leading from the knife house into the passage of the kitchen—the panel of that door was cut out, which I now produce—it was cut from the bottom of the door just</p>

               <p>underneath the fastening; the door had been fastened with bolts, a lock, and a chain—the key was in the lock—by means of the opening made by the panel being taken out, the door could be unlocked, the bolts drawn, and the door unfastened—on the top of the stairs I found another door which was ajar—a pane of glass was nearly all taken out at the top of the kitchen stairs—by taking that glass out, supposing the door had been fastened, they could have put their hand through and opened the door, if the lock had had the key left in it; but there was no fastening more than a catch—that door opens from you as you go up the kitchen stairs—a person going up, and polling the door to him, would imagine it was locked—I observed marks of an instrument on the window where the glass had been taken out—on the side where the putty ig used—I went into the dining room, and found a cellaret, the doors of which had been broken open—I observed marks on them which had the appearance of a chisel, used to force open the doors—I saw a workbox lying on the floor—I went into the breakfast room, and saw a case there—the door had been forced open, with marks on it as if wrenched open by some instrument—a side door leads from the bottom of the house to the carriage drive—I observed the lock of thai door, a portion of it had been wrenched off—a rope ladder has been shown to me—I have examined it—the length of it corresponds exactly with the depth of the area; it had been lately tarred—I was not with the other officer when the prisoner was taken—I saw him searched on the 22nd, in the charge room at Notting-hill, by Dyas, who took some postage stamps from his coat pocket, wrapped in this piece of paper, and they were wrapped in one more piece of paper—the prisoner said, "Don't say they came out of my pocket."</p>

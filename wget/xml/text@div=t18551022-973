                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Miller Whittaker, of Black heath. The prisoner was in his service—she came on 10th July, and remained three weeks—six or seven weeks after she left I missed a merino dress, which had been kept in a box in her bedroom—I then made inquiries and found that the prisoner was living with Mr. Kennedy, at Belmont-hill—I went there, and told her we had a charge against her, but did not say what it was—she said that she was prepared for anything we had against her—(my husband and a policeman were with me)—I asked her to come with me—she said that she would not; her master was out; she should wait till he returned, and after that she would get her bonnet and shawl, and come with us—she asked a charwoman who was there to go and get her bonnet and shawl—she refused—she then asked me to go with her—I refused, as her master was out—she then ran up stairs, and I heard a window open—I went up and followed her—after a long time, she came down, dressed—while in the bedroom, I asked her where ray drab French merino dress was—she denied having it—when she came down my husband asked her if I had told her what I had against her—she said, "Yes," and denied it—he said to her, "Have you one of that description in your posses<lb></lb>sion at all?"—she said that she had, but it was hers—I asked her to product it—she said that it was down stairs—some one went down, but could not find it—afterwards she said, "Come out in the garden"—we searched, but could not find it—she then went up to search for it herself, but could not find it—she then went to the window and looked out—I said, "Yes, that</p>

Q.</hi> When did you engage with me, and under what circum-stances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was in June, a few days previous to your coming—you had a black dress on the first time you called—after you had been in the house a week, you asked me if you suited, and I told you that you did—I identify this dress by the make of it, and by the watch pocket which I have had sewn up—you asked me to look in your boxes when you were about to leave, and I refused—you never told me that you could not do the work—I never said that if you would not live with me you should not live elsewhere—I identify the neck tie by its colour—I have pieces of this dress in my pocket (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>ducing them</hi>)—they are just the same, but the dress is dirty.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). After the prisoner was apprehended, I went to Mr. Kennedy's, and found a dark box, in a double bedded room, at the top of the house—I found in it these two pieces of French merino, a pair of stockings, one of which had the name of "Whit taker" on it, and a white pocket handkerchief, with the name of "Aspin" on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I entered the service on 12th July; it was to be an easy place, and all the washing to be put out; but there were twelve in family, eighteen rooms, and all the washing done at home; fifteen dozen for one pair of hands; I felt my health and strength so fast declining, that I was unable to do the work; I told her that I could not do it; she said that she would have her revenge on me if I did not stay with her. and I should not go elsewhere; I was wearing that dress seven weeks in the neighbourhood, passing and repassing that house three times in the day, and they passing me, and never accusing me of it; when the prosecutrix came, it was half past 10 o'clock at night; she followed me up stairs into my bed room; I could hardly get up, as I was suffering from inflammation in my side, and I think she was in the room before me; she searched my box, and took me into custody, without any authority; my master and mistress were at a party, and I said that I would go when they returned; she called me all the vile wretches she could, and said that she thought Mr. Kennedy would be glad to get such a vile wretch out of the house; I told my master that I had purchased the dress at Mr. Shene's, High-street, Guildford, five years ago; I went into mourning for my mother, and after<lb></lb>wards, found that it was too small for me, and was obliged to graft it, as if you look you will see; if I had had the money, I could have brought twenty</p>

               <p>witnesses forward; there is a witness who I was with, but I could not get her here; I have been six weeks in prison; the prosecutrix has nothing to identify the dress by, except that her niece has one like it, made by the same dress maker, and if one has a dress like it twenty may; she and her niece have bonnets alike, and may not I have the same? all her revenge is on me because I left her, and got into a comfortable situation without her; she dragged me from my bed when I was ill, and it has settled a cough and cold upon me which is bringing me to my grave; the hand<lb></lb>kerchief could not be found the first time I was taken up, how is it that it was found afterwards? she emptied the whole contents of my box on the floor, and took them up piece by piece; I am not the first person she has served so; a young woman who had lived there met me before I went there, and implored me not to go, but I went, and found what she stated to be true; she said in my bed room, "I will have my revenge, now is the time;" she knew my master and mistress were absent, and she said, "If you will only say you are guilty, I will forgive you; "I said, "No."</p>

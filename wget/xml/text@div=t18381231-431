               <p>the shop, and left, at eleven o'clock at night—the prisoners lodge in the house—when I went to open it next morning, about nine o'clock, I thought the hinge of the cellar-gate had been removed, and found the beer had been turned on—the cellar-flap in the back-yard had been put down, but was unfastened—next night I shut up the place at eleven o'clock, and made a noise, as if I was going away—I then returned to the shop to watch—I sat down there in the dark, and about twelve o'clock, the two female prisoners came down with a light—they said the hinge had been removed, and one said they would have a drop for the next day—they then went up again, and the male prisoner came down and boltta the street-door—his wife then came down, and they went into the yard—I heard him say to her, "You go down"—she said she would not <hi rend="italic">go</hi> down, and by the sound of his voice directly after, I found he was in the cellar—he called "Ann," twice—the two females came down into the yard, and the male prisoner was in the cellar, with the flap open, and I heard beer running into the pot—I fetched in a police-man, and found about three pints of beer in a can, down in the cellar—the prisoners were then all up in the yard, where the flap opens—all the beer in the cellar belongs to my husband—the pot belongs to Mr. Mason of the Royal Standard—neither that nor the can were in the cellar when I left-Gaines was standing in the yard with a light—the male prisoner is blind.</p>

Mrs. Clark got me to sit up in her beer-shop to watch, and in about half-an-hour one of the female prisoners came down, looked about the yard, and went up again—I afterwards went into the yard, and saw the male prisoner in the cellar—the Women were at the water-closet door, looking at him, with a light in their hands—I said to the man, "Holloa, <hi rend="italic">Gentleman,</hi> what brought you here? we have caught you now"—he said, "Yes, you have indeed, master"—I said, "What do you do here?"—he said, "I was just going to have a little drop, at Mrs. Clark is going to leave"—a policeman came, went into the cellar, brought up a can and pint pot—the pot was about three parts full, and there was nearly a quart in the can.</p>

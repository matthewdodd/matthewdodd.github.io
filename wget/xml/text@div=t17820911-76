            , 13 Years old.</p>
               <p>Court. What is it to take an oath? - To tell nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>And if you do not speak the truth, what is the consequence? - It is a very bad thing.</p>
               <p>Sworn. I live with Mr. Griffin; I was left to take care of the shop on the 8th of July in the afternoon; as soon as Mrs. Griffin was gone out, the prisoner and another woman came in and asked for half an ounce of worsted, the prisoner did not like the colour; she came behind the counter, and said the gentleman used to serve her from there, she kept her eyes on the parlour; there stood a glass by the window, and a chair and two cloaks on it; she went up to the other woman and whispered; and she asked me to let her look at her eyes in the glass, she had two very black eyes; I said I would fetch it, and they both followed me into the parlour, the prisoner stood at the window with the glass and talking to me, and asking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110086"></xptr> me if she should not lose her eyes while the other pocketed the cloak, I heard something rustle like silk, I saw her with the other cloak in her hand, I saw her throw it down, I looked her full in the face, and she said, child what do you look at me for? we have not any thing, and I said, I thought there were two cloaks on the chair, and they went away; a gentleman came in, and I ran to my mistress. The prisoner held the glass, and I am sure she could see what the other did, the prisoner was one of the two; she is very remarkable, I have seen her several times in mobs in the streets.</p>

               <p>I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Griffin. I suppose the value of this cloak is not quite forty-two shillings? - If I should say it was not, I should say it in the behalf of the prisoner.</p>

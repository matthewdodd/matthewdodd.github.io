The prisoner was in the habit of coming to my masters - he came there on the 23rd of April, to ask after the butler's health; I left the prisoner alone that day on two occasions, for about five minutes, in the pantry where the plate was - when I returned the second time, I asked the prisoner to walk out into the servant's hall; I then counted the plate, and missed three table-spoons - I sent for Mr. Perceval Cresswell, and he missed the spoons; the prisoner gave up three table-spoons - the constable, Mr. Perceval Cresswell, and myself were present, and the servants; the prisoner did not deny that he had them, but denied having any more property about him - he was then taken to the station; he there denied having any thing on him - he was then searched, and two desert-spoons and a large table fork found on him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was it in consequence of what you said that he went into the pantry? A. Yes, I asked him to go in and assist me, because I had suspicion of him, and after the second occasion, I missed the plate.</p>

            . The witness sent for me- I went into the butler's pantry, and found he had the prisoner by the collar; the prisoner was crying, and begged I would forgive him and let him go - I said if he had stolen any thing I certainly should not; I thought it necessary to prosecute him for the protection of the other servants - the constable came soon after; I desired him to take him into the servants' hall, and search him - I went in with him; the constable said, "If you have taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120031"></xptr>any thing, you may as well give it up, without giving me the trouble of taking it from you;" the prisoner again asked me if I would forgive him and let him go - I said if he had taken any thing I certainly should prosecute him; he then took three table-spoons from his pocket, and handed them to me - I gave them to the constable, and desired him to take him to the station-house, and the servant to go with him; I called there the next morning, and saw this fork, and these two desert-spoons, which I can speak to as my father's; the fork has not initials on it- I cannot swear to that.</p>

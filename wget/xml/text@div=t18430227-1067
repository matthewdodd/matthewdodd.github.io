                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant, stationed at Dagenham, in Essex. In consequence of information, I went to Chadwell-heath on Sunday evening, the 12th of Feb. to the house of Mr. Bacon—the prisoner Tinsworth lodges there—I saw him sitting by the fire—I asked him where he was the pre<lb></lb>vious</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270226"></xptr>
               <p>night—he refused to tell me—I asked him if he was at his lodgings—he said no—I told him I apprehended him on a charge of stealing a sheep the pre<lb></lb>vious night—I searched his lodging, found a pair of smallclothes and a shirt, which I produce—there are marks of blood on it, red marks, on the back of the neck, and spots of blood in different places—I asked him to account for the blood—he said his nose had bled the day previous, and that was where he wiped it—I asked him if these were the breeches he had on the night previous—he said they were—they are cotton corded breeches—they would make a mark on the soil of the field—I have compared the knee of these breeches with some marks I saw in the field at Chadwell—they correspond exactly—there are marks of blood on the knee where he had been kneeling down—I gave him into custody of Crawford, the policeman—on Monday morning I saw some boots produced by Crawford—I compared them with some marks in the field leading towards where the sheep appeared to have been killed, in seve<lb></lb>ral places—they were quite distinct—it was the pair that was taken from Tinsworth that corresponded—I was not present when they were taken—this is the boot that I compared the following morning—it corresponds minutely, and I have the clay impression of the foot-mark—I compared some pieces of mutton, produced by Crawford, with the skin found in the field, and it corresponded in several parts—I have been a butcher—the meat was in such a state of decomposition we could not preserve it—I was able to match it—part of the shoulder-piece of the skin was left on, and the part left on the skin exactly corresponded with it—the sheep was very badly cut up—this is the clay impression—it is not a mark that I made myself—this is the actual mark taken from the field—a portion of the tip of the heel corresponds, and some high nails—it was far more plain when first taken than now—I did not make any impression by the side of it—I afterwards apprehended Blunt at Chadwell-beath, on Monday evening, at his house—I told him I came, from information, for the purpose of apprehending him, charged with being concerned in stealing a sheep the Saturday night previous—he said he was willing to go with me, he knew nothing about it—I inquired if he had a smock-frock which he had worn on the Saturday—on the following morning I got a smock-frock from some woman in the house—I went to his house to ask for it—it came from a bed-room—they had but one room—he was not present when it was produced—it came out of his bed-room—there are marks of blood in three places on it—the boots taken from his feet did not agree with the foot-marks in the field.</p>

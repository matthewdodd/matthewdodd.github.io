When we came into the room there was a woman in the room; then Moore asked me for some money; I gave her a three-shilling piece; she gave it to the other woman to go out for liquor; and then Moore came close to me and unbuttoned my breeches. In about five or ten minutes I lost a purse, containing four one-pound notes, and twelve shillings and sixpence; four three-shilling tokens and a sixpence. I accused her of taking of it. She said that she had not. Then the other woman came in, and another woman with her, they abused me very much. Moore ran out of the room as far as the corner of the house, and I after her. I brought her back. I took a candle and looked about the room to see if I could find my money. I could not find it. I have never found my money or my notes. The next morning I went to the constable; he said he knew the girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same girl - A. Yes; he took her in custody on the evening following.</p>

               <p>Q. Who had this paper when you first saw it? A. Mr. Driscol wrote what he had to say on it, and after, he wrote the first witness' name at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he first write on the paper what there is there? A. Yes; it was him I first saw with it; I saw him writing on it - I cannot exactly say what he wrote, but I saw him writing on this paper; I saw him write this name at the bottom here, and then I signed mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name he wrote? A. I cannot read - he wrote a name that was not his own.</p>

             is the female prisoner - she went by that name then; I do not think the name of Elliott was mentioned at that time; I knew that when I went to the proctor's - I was in the room - all day, I dare say; Fullen and his wife lived in the room - I do not know whether Driscol brought the paper in; he came about the middle of the day - Mrs. Fullen and I were both sitting at work; Mr. Fullen came in, and Driscol came in not a great while afterwards; I cannot say who first began to speak about it; I was sitting down, and, to the best of my recollection, Driscol said, "Why, it is no harm for you, mother Francis to sign your name to it;" Mr. and Mrs. Fullen said it was no use waiting for Myers, for he would not come - I did not take particular notice whether they both said so; I think it was Mr. Fullen - he spoke so that the whole party could hear; he said it was no use waiting for Myers - Mrs. Fullen told me that Myers was to be concerned in the will; that he was to have been a witness to it instead of me - when it was said it was of no use waiting for Myers, Driscol asked me if I could write; I said I could write my own name - Driscol gave me the pen, and I wrote my name at the bottom - the paper laid on the table before Driscol and me; he put the paper to me, and I wrote my name - that was after I had seen him write - Fullen was there in the room, sitting very near the table; he could see what was doing, and hear what was said - the female prisoner was near enough to hear what took place; she was not two yards from me.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to sign your name as Carnell? A. I lived with a man of that name formerly; he is dead now- when I put my name to the paper, Driscol, Fullen, and all of them said that would do; they all said they would take it up to the procutor to ministrate for the man's money, Driscol did not stop there any time after it was done - Mrs. Fullen kept the paper; I went with Mrs. Fullen to the proctor as a witness three or four days after the paper was signed; Mr. Burchett was the proctor - Mrs. Fullen said they could do nothing unless I went up as a witness for them: it was at her request I went - she told me what I was to say when I got there, about knowing the man a good while, and that he used to be backwards and forwards at the place for a year and a half; they told me the man's name, but I cannot think of it now - I told the proctor what she told me; he wrote it down, and I signed it - this is it; I believe it was read over to me before I signed it - I had no knowledge of the man I went to speak about; I never saw him in my life - I went with Mrs - Fullen over to the proctor's for the probate, but it was not ready; I saw Mr. Burchett when I went - we went out and waited till about half-past three o'clock, then went again, and it was ready: she paid for the probate. and took it away with her - this is it (looking at it)</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did you go with her to Great Alie-street? A. yes; I waited outside while she went into the owners where the money was to be paid - she told me she was going to get the money she had been administering for, and it was under 5l; she came out and told me the clerk was gone, she must go again next morning, and that she had left the probate there-she had it when she went in; I did not go with her the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Who do you live with? A. At the house of one Mrs. Jones; I support myself by my own labour - nobody has given me any money, nor maintained me - I lived with Carnell, who is now dead; I was married to Pringle, and I lived with one Francis - I never went by any other name; I signed an affidavit in the name of Elliott, for Mrs. Elliott.</p>
               <p>Q.Who is Mrs. Elliot? A. The female prisoner; I am almost sure I called myself by the Christian name of Mary- as far as I can make out the name in the will it is Ellioty; I do not know whether it is tt or ty - I made my mark to the affidavit; I got no money, nor the promise of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170017"></xptr>any; they afterwards gave me 3s., which they owed me; I am sure it was a debt - I work at slop work; I never walk the streets, nor pick men up; I was sent to prison for a month once from Lambeth-street - I never signed the name of Pringle but once; I signed the name of Carnell and Elliott at the proctor's, Mr. Clarkson's - that was on another occasion; it was an affidavit - when I signed the name of

            , Mrs. Peacock asked me to go as aunt to the man, but I was not his aunt; I signed my name for her, as she said she could not do it, because she had business at Clarkson's; I told them I was the aunt of Johnson - I did not look over Driscol when he was writing, and do not know what he wrote; I did not know what I was signing at the time - they said it was no harm, I might as well do it as not; it was the first paper I signed - I afterwards signed an affidavit for her, and they were the only two I ever signed; it was at her request - I had nothing from her except what she had borrowed of me; she gave me 3s. to get my gown out of pawn - I never made an affidavit on any other occasion: I positively swear that no man was in the room except Fullen and Driscol - I told nobody what I had done; I was taken into custody on Mr. Frind's business - they put me down as a legatee in that business; when I was taken to Lambeth-street on Frind's business, the two papers I had signed were brought forward, and I owned to them; Lea took me to the proctor's, to see if I knew my own handwriting, and if I knew the gentleman - I was not placed at the bar of the office; I was there as a witness.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What were you sent to prison for a month for? A. For pawning a cloak; I made the affidavit in the name of Elliott, at the request of the female prisoner - Morgan and Fullen also requested me to go and make it; I was not taken into custody as being concerned in Frind's business - they took me to the office, and asked if I could find bail; I said not: the gentleman said there was no occasion for bail, as I was a witness, and I was discharged.</p>

               <p>THOMAS MILLER. I am clerk to Mr. Burchett, a proctor of Doctors'-commons. In January last this will was brought to our office by two women; to the best of my belief the last witness was one, and the prisoner Peacock the other; Peacock said she had brought that will to be proved - I looked it over, and handed it to Mr. Burchett, who came in; he then put several questions to Pringle, who was called

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know Pringle about Christmas, by the name of Francis? A. Yes; I never knew her by any other name - she used to do slop work with Mrs. Fullen; they had it from the shops, and gave out work to another person.</p>

               <p>Driscol's Defence. I have to remark that I know nothing whatever of the transaction in any shape; with respect to what the woman swears, I consider it will be quite invalid; she admitted before the Magistrate that I had no money for it, and that, I believe, the evidence for the prosecution will corroborate - it is not likely I should implicate myself in such things without fee or reward; she admitted before the Magistrate that she had committed perjury, and said she did not know the obligation of an oath, and said she supposed she would willingly swear to more if she was desired - as to my calling at Fullen's house, I had business there; I kept a shop in the provision business; Fullen had meat and things, for which he owed me a few shillings, and sometimes I owed him a little, as he knew seamen, and got me lodgers, for which I had to make him a recompense; I know nothing of the transaction - I have never seen or heard any thing about it; I was taken to give evidence in another case about a week before; the evidence I gave did not satisfy the prosecutors - I was let go, and on that occasion Lea mentioned something to me about a will at Clarkson's, but I took no notice of it, and in about a week he took me at my own place; if I had been aware of any thing of the sort against me I should certainly have left home - the only evidence against me is Pringle's, and if she is to have credit before a respectable Jury, I know not what will become of the liberty of the subject.</p>
               <p>Fullen's Defence. If it was written in my place I know nothing of it - I can neither read nor write, and never saw the man write.</p>
               <p>Peacock's Defence. I am entirely innocent - I never proved any thing at Mr. Burchett's office: I never received any money at all.</p>

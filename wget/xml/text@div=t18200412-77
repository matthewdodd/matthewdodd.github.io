I lost these things about the latter end of December; the cloak was very old fashioned, and had not been worn for some years - it was in a box on the landing-place of the top of the house. On the 16th of February I had him apprehended, taken to Hatton-garden. I went to him afterwards to the lock-up-room, and asked him his motive for robbing me? He said he ought to have been the last person to rob me, in consequence of the kindness I hat treated him with - he enumerated the several articles that he had robbed me of, began to cry, and said that if I would forgive him, he would confess all. I said on no condition would I forgive him? he said he had sold the cloak to a Jew in Gray's Inn-lane. I got a warrant and found it there. I found the other things in pawn.</p>

            . I keep a sale-shop in Gray's Inn-lane. About three weeks before the officer came to my house, a man, whom I knew before, brought this cloak for sale - I offered him 6 s. for it, he refused that, and I told him to go and see if he could get more. In about an hour after, he brought it, and said his brother sent him with it - I gave him 5 s. for it; it was very old fashioned.</p>

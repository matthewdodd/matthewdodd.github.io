                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the telegraph office, 68, London-road—on 24th April, the prisoner came to my office at about 11 in the morning, with a message to be forwarded, but it was retained for non-delivery—the person to whom it was directed was not found—she paid half a crown, the message was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave her the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and put the half-crown in the till—she came again about half-past 2 on the same day, and then gave me a message to send—I did not forward that—she paid with a half a crown—I sent it to be changed next door by McDonald—he brought it back and I then told the prisoner it was bad—she said she should not think of passing a bad one—I examined the till while she was there, and found three more bad half-crowns—I bad other silver in the till, but the bad half-crowns were all lying at the top—I cannot tell exactly at what time I received those without looking at the messages—there was one at 1.25, another at 1.35, and the prisoner came first about 11—those were not the only messages I took that day, but the only ones paid by half-crowns—I told the prisoner the half crown was bad, and that she had been before that morning—she denied it—I gave the half-crowns to the constable—I am quite sure she had been at the office—the two messages produced, I received between 11 and the prisoner coming—the other two (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I took from prisoner—they all four appear to be written by the same person.</p>

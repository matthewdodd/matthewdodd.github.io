            . I live in Seamour-yard, Bryanston-square. On the 24th of February, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was driving my cart in <placeName id="t18210411-114-crimeloc708">Hyde Park</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18210411-114-crimeloc708" type="placeName" value="Hyde Park"></interp>

I ran round and laid hold of him, but he got away, but was taken in about half an hour; he left the coat and his hat behind - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HONE. Q. You was before the cart - A. By the side of the horses - it was a thick fog, but I saw him distinctly; he must have pulled it out of the cart, because it had two horse cloths over it; it was impossible that it could have fallen out - and after it was on the ground, he pulled it to him at least two yards.</p>

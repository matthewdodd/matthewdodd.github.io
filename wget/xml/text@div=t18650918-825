                  </hi>. I live at 26, Seething-lane—I have known the defendant nearly thirteen years, he lived at 12, Barking-churchyard—prior to June,.1862, I had been in the habit of lending him small sums of money—in that month he came to me and said, "Bob, I want to borrow 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Yes; but it is a large amount, what do you want it for?"—he said, "I am going to pay my partner, we are going to dissolve partnership, and I want the money"—I said, "What are you going to give me as security?"—he said, "I will give you the lease of my house, when can I have it?—I said, "I will go up stairs and see if I can let you have it now, and if so I will let you know"—I went and got the money ready, had it counted out, and said, "Harry, that is the money," and he said, "And that is the lease of my house, "giving me this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) wrapped up in a piece of thin paper, and an I O U for the amount—I should not have parted with that amount of money, if I had not believed that was the lease of his house—he was to pay me 5 per cent, interest; he paid the interest for two years—I found out what this document was about four months wince—I then discovered that it was an old lease, dated in 1833—I went to him and told him of it, and he said, "Oh, my God, you have found me out"—I said, "Yes. you had better see about settling it, what are you going to do?"—he said, "All right, Bob, you shan't lose, I will make it right, come on old boy, come and have a glass of ale."</p>

               <p>first husband kept a baker's shop, the prisoner carried it on a little while I believe—he told me he was a bankrupt, that was a month before this—I said, "What am I to do about this lease"—he said, "Oh, never mind that, Bob, don't say anything about that"—I did not fold up the I O U with the lease—I did not see his mother bring down the lease—I went to his house to say I had got the money ready, and he brought the lease after me to my house—I did not see his mother there—the I 0 U was shoved under the string on the top of the lease which was tied up.</p>

I have lately been married to Mr. Badcock—I remem<lb></lb>ber my son, the prisoner, borrowing the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Snell—I said, "What security are you going to give him"—he said, "I think the lease of the house, mother"—he asked me to fetch him down the lease—I went upstairs to my iron safe, opened it, took out what I thought was the identical lease, the then existing lease, brought it down and handed it to my son, at that time the other lease was in the same chest with several others—I kept the key of that chest; we found out that it was the wrong lease, I should think, very nearly two years afterwards—my son was a bankrupt at that time—I think it was about May or June of this year, that he filed his petition—I think it must have been last year that I found it was the wrong lease—I was look<lb></lb>ing over other papers and found the existing lease, and I brought it down and said, "Mr. Snell must have got the wrong lease"—the existing lease was afterwards sold to Mr. Badcock, he was not aware of this transaction—my son was not aware that Mr. Snell had the wrong lease up to the time I found it out, nor was I.</p>

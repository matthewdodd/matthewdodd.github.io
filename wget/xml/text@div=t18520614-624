                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, of 82, St. John's Wood-terrace, Regent's-park. In the beginning of March I was introduced to Mr. John Pace, whose offices were at 3, Sherborne-lane, King William-street; I believe he is a Custom House and shipping agent; the firm is Pace, Nephew, and Co.—I was in the habit of seeing Mr. Pace almost every day afterwards—he asked me about the beginning of April whether I thought I could get a promissory note of the firm discounted at three months, leaving as security 300 shares in the Galtymaen Silver Lead Mining Company—I had then known the prisoner about five or six months—on 10th April I again saw Mr. Pace—I had seen the prisoner, and asked him whether he thought he could get the promissory note cashed for me—he said yes, he believed he could—I gave him the particulars in writing—after that I received from Mr. Hunter, a partner in Pace's firm, some scrip certificates and a transfer paper of the shares—on 14th April I saw the prisoner in King William-street, Strand—he told me he had seen the gentleman who would discount the pro<lb></lb>missory note, but he wanted to be satisfied that the shares were actually in existence—I produced them to him—he asked me whether I would let him have them to show the party—I said, "Yes;" and he gave me this memoran<lb></lb>dum which he drew up and signed, and I gave him the shares—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"London, April 14,1852. Received of Mr. Watts, 200 shares in the Galtymaen Silver Lead Mining Company, to be returned to-morrow morning at 12 o'clock. John Fiddes")—next day I saw the prisoner again; he said</p>

               <p>he had seen the gentleman, and if I would get the promissory note, the matter could be carried out at once—I said I would go into the City, get the note, and meet him about 4 that afternoon—he still retained the shares; he said nothing about them—I went to Messrs. Pace, got from them this promissory note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and kept my appointment with the prisoner—he came, I think about half past 5—he asked me whether I had got the promissory note—I said, "Yes; but it is too late to carry it out to-night, I will meet you to<lb></lb>morrow"—he said he did not know that it was—I showed him the note, and we walked towards Oxford-street; when we got there he said, "The gentle<lb></lb>man who will discount this note only lives two or three doors round the corner; if you will let me take the note to him I may get the money this evening; I will bring the note back to you, or the money, within ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, at the latest"—I said, "Very well;" and gave him the note—he said, "I am going down to Mr. Pace's to-night"—I said, "You won't be longer than that?"—he said, "No"—I waited three hours, and never saw him—next afternoon I received this note and enclosure; the note is in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"P.S. Read the enclosed—my dear Watts, I have great trouble in the business, but it is all right for Monday and Handley at 4 o'clock. J. Fiddes."—<hi rend="italic">Enclosure read</hi>—"16th April. Re Pace.

I am sorry the delay has occurred, but it is inevitable. James Harrisson")—the prisoner had not mentioned a person of the name of Harrisson before I gave him the note—I am quite sure of that—I afterwards went to Mr. Pace's, and made a communication to him—he told me something, and I went down to Scotland-yard, and saw an inspector—I afterwards heard that the prisoner was subpoenaed on a trial at Westminster Hall—I went there and saw him—(<hi rend="italic">note read</hi>—"London, 15th April, 1852.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Jeffery-square. On 19th April, a person named Henry Davis called on me with this note, and applied to me to get it discounted—I suggested that some inquiries were necessary, and in consequence of what my clerk said to me I said there was something wrong, and detained the note—Pace and Co. called on me, and in consequence of what they told me I refused to give the note up, and have kept it till to-day; when I refused to return it, Davis brought me this memorandum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), notwithstanding which I still refused to give the note up; an action was brought against me—Pace and Co, have indemnified me.</p>

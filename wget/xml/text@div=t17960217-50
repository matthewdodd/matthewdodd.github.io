               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen. On Wednesday night last, I went out about a little business; I was out later than I should have been; it might be after twelve o'clock; I could not get a coach to go home; I took a walk round James-street, Covent-Garden; I went into a public-house; the prisoner was there; he asked if I was Irish; I told him I was, and he offered his service to see me home; the landlord of the house said, it was fitter for him to go to bed; he followed me out of the house; I did not see him for a good way; he came up to me in <placeName id="t17960217-50-crimeloc286">Greek-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you hear the foot behind you before the prisoner had his arm round your waist? - A. Exactly at that time; I charged him with taking my muff, and charged him with the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the muff in his hand? - A. No; I don't know what became of it; there was neither man, woman, nor child there, but the prisoner; I charged the prisoner with the watch, and he charged me, and we both went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bid the watchman look for the muff? - A. No; I did not believe it was of any service; I had not the recollection of mind, or I would have done it with pleasure, but I was quite frightened; it was very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him take it? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner continue with you after you had lost the muff, and before you called the watch? - A. Five minutes, we walked on together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with taking it before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170087"></xptr>you got to the watchman? - A. No; I did not, I was so frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a widow? - A. A Captain of a ship's widow.(The prisoner was not put upon his defence.)</p>

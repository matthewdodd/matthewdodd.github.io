I had seen my barrow in the course of the day. I found a barrow full of mortar shot behind the Bell and Anchor Hammersmith, by Hammersmith Turnpike, about three hundred yards from the mortar heap. I went to where the prisoner lived, there I found the barrow empty, the prisoner was at home and going to bed, the barrow was wet as if mortar had been in it, the mortar could not have been out of the barrow but a few minutes, because I could take it out with my fingers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Suppose he had robbed you of the mortar, you did not think that he meaned to steal the barrow. - A. That I cannot say, I only knew where I found it.</p>
               <p>MR. STANHOPE. I live at Fulham. I am a carpenter. On the evening of the 1st of April, I saw the prisoner on Mr. Plowman's premises about eight o'clock, I saw him wheel the barrow out, he stopped and looked round to see if any body was coming, he then wheeled the barrow to the back of the Bell and Anchor, to one Dalley's, it is a Cottage. I went and informed Mr. Plowman.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030015"></xptr>Q. Did you go with him to the Cottage. - A. Yes, I saw the mortar lay, it was fresh.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A poor man living by there asked me if I would give him some mortar to fix up his fire place, I brought a bit of mortar there in the barrow, and in the morning I meaned to take the barrow back again, it was not half a barrow of mortar.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The barrow was as full as it could be wheeled, it was worth about eighteen pence, I valued it only at a shilling.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

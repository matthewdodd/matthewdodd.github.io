                  </hi>. I live at 13, Colton Street, Mile-end—I was a warehouseman in the service of the Carron Company, in Thames Street, for two and a half years—I am 23 years of age—the company sell ranges and ironwork of all descriptions—when I sell property I do not know the price of the articles, they have a number—on Thursday, 17th January, I was at the warehouse—about 12 o'clock I saw the prisoner there, he had been there on previous occasions and I had sold him goods—I knew his name but not his address—he asked me for a jamb-plate and copper door (I wont with him into the underground part of the warehouse) the value of which I believe would be 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—after selecting them I went with him upstairs—he said he wanted to look at some ranges—I took him up to the third floor, and he selected a closed range—he then said "Can you let me have the range without the people in the counting-house knowing anything about it?"—we went on explaining the working of the range for a few minutes, after that he said if I would</p>

               <p>let him have it he would give me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I hesitated for some time and afterwards said I would try and do so—nothing more passed—we went down into the warehouse—I saw Mr. Stevens, the warehouse clerk, and had the jamb-plate and copper door booked—I got this check and filed it in the counting-house—that was to enable the cashier to make out the invoice—I left the prisoner in the counting-house to pay for the articles—I returned to the third floor and lowered the range into the prisoner's truck which was in the yard, in charge of his man, Bryant—I then went over to a public-house, the prisoner beckoned me there—we had a glass of ale, and he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he was short of money, or he had no more money—nothing was said about my getting the other 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we did not remain more than two minutes in the public-house, and when I went back to the yard the truck had gone—next evening, about a quarter-past five, Bryant came to me, he made some statement—I then found that when I had lowered the range the stop-cock and the bottom plate had been accidentally left behind; I gave them to Bryant—I did not have them booked—shortly afterwards I was sent for, and Mr. Young spoke to me on the subject; he had the stop-cock and bottom, they had been taken from Bryant—I told Mr. Brown, the assistant manager, all that had occurred with the prisoner the previous day—on Monday, the 21st, I went with Moss, the officer, to 37, Pigot Street, Limehouse, and there saw a kitchen range, which I identified as the one I had lowered down.</p>

I am a labourer—I cannot read or write—on Thursday, 17th January, I went with the prisoner and a truck to the Carron Company—a range was lowered by Lambert down into the truck which had the prisoner's name on it—I wheeled it away—I thought it was all right—next morning the prisoner gave me this bill and told me to go and get the bottom and cock and see Lambert—I went and got them from Lambert, and as I left I was stopped and the things were taken from me—I afterwards told the prisoner what had occurred.</p>

             sworn. I am servant to Mr. Newport at the New Prison. On Wednesday the 26th of March the woman was brought into our custody; it is a usual thing when they are brought into custody, to demand their bonnet, accordingly I asked for hers, she denied it, and the only reason was, there was so many men present she did not like to take her bonnet off before them: I took her to the women's side, then I asked her again, she rather refused, I was under the necessity of taking it, she put her hand up to the top of her head, and took the watch from the top of her bonnet; I immediately took it from her, and related the circumstance to the governor; he told me to take it to the sitting magistrate at Hatton Garden. I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) You took her up immediately, and took her to Hatton Garden. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they search her. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me the watch when he got into my room, he told me he had no money, he told me he would pledge the watch and give me some; in the morning I asked to let me go with him to pledge the watch, he refused, and I refused giving him the watch; I never had a single farthing of him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I gave her two shillings, and I had fourteen shillings and six pence remaining; I did not give her the watch, the watch was taken out of my breeches pocket when I was asleep.</p>

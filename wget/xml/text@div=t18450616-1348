                  </hi> I am the wife of William Napman, and live at No. 1, Park-terrace, Kensington. A week and three days before Christmas I went out to nurse a lady—I returned home in three weeks and missed gold ring which I had left in the drawer of a little box—the male prisoner is my nephew, and the female is his wife—they were in the habit of visiting at my house—I afterwards had the female taken into custody—she said the ring was pawned for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of Adams—I do not remember that she said she had pawned it, but she said she could get it without the ticket—in consequence of inquiry I went to Mr. Stevens, a pawnbroker, in Wardour-street, and there found the ring—this is it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mary Hanniford.</hi> Many people visited at the house besides me; there was a young woman lodging there, and a young man slept in the house the night she left. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is not so—nobody visited the house but them.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoners were in the habit of coming to the house while my wife was away—one day, early in Jan., when the male prisoner was there, I was turning over the tea-caddy, and my wife's ring was in it, the one now produced—I took it out—he said, two or three times over, "What a beautiful ring!"—he had seen his aunt wear it—he took it up, put it down again, and I put it into the caddy which I left on the drawers—it was not locked—I left the room at different times while he was there, for five or ten minutes at a time—he went away about two or three o'clock—there was no one else there—my wife came home about three or four days after—I never saw the ring again till I saw it at Hammersmith last Thursday week—no one but the prisoner came to my house between the time of his seeing the ring and my wife's coining home—I go out at six</p>

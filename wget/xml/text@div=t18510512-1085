                  </hi>. I am a trunk-maker, of the Edgeware-road. The prisoner was my errand-boy; he had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, but not board, or lodging—he lived with his father and mother—on 17th Feb., I gave him a sovereign to get change, about half-past two o'clock; he left my shop with it, and did not come back—the next time I saw him was in Edgeware-road, on 15th April—I had in the meantime made inquiry of his father and mother, and could not find him—when I saw him in Edgeware-road, I told him I wanted him for stealing a sovereign—he said he did not steal it, he lost it—I gave him in charge</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He knew where I lived, he never inquired after me for two months—my father offered to pay him so much a week—he took my brother to work it out. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I inquired about him—I went to the station—his father came and said, when he found him he would bring him to me, and if I did not prosecute him, he would—I took his brother, because I wanted a boy—I had him only five days; be was younger than the prisoner—the father did not promise to pay me so much a week—I never went to his father's house—I went to the Mews—his father came to me—I saw him twice, I believe—I spoke to the police on the evening of the day the prisoner went away with the sovereign—the police-sergeant came to my house in private clothes, and took the particulars about three weeks afterwards—the prisoner's father came to me the morning after the prisoner left me—I am sure nothing was then said about the money being lost—he said he had not seen him—I went to the Mews, to try to find the prisoner; I had not his proper address—the reserve policeman went with me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had the misfortune to lose the sovereign—he sent me for change several times before, and I always brought it correct—he knew where I lived; Mr. Finch, our landlord, lived in Quebec-street, and is known all over the parish.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's father. When the sovereign was missing he did not come home—I met him accidentally in Oxford-street, four days afterwards—he went home with me, and never left my place afterwards—the next morning, he offered to go with me to his master, but I said it was not necessary, as Mr. Baker seemed perfectly satisfied—I had thought it necessary to call on his master, as my son did not come home—his master said he had sent him for change of a sovereign, and he bad not returned—I said I would make it up when I could get a situation—he consented to take the prisoner's younger brother at a shilling a week leas than he paid he prisoner—he kept his brother four or five days, and then discharged him—I went on the Monday following, and asked what he discharged him for—he said a dreumitance had occurred that he could not keep him—I then repeated my promise that I would pay him the sovereign—I did not specify any time—the boy was afraid to return home, or to his master's—when I met him, he was in a most deplorable state; he had parted with his coat and shoes to support himself—I never said I would prosecute my child.</p>

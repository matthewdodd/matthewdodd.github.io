I am a baker, and live in Bermondsey-street prisoner was in my service—I received information, and on the 31st of when he came out of the bakehouse into the shop, I told him I wanted him to fetch me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of milk—he seemed very much alarmed and said, "Now</p>

               <p>Sir, before I serve the coffee-shop"—I said, "Yes now"—he turned round and ran down into the bakehouse with his basket—I followed him and detected him taking one bag of flour out of his basket, and the other I stopped him with before he took it out—I asked him what he had got there—he said a little flour, and he had taken it out of the trough.</p>

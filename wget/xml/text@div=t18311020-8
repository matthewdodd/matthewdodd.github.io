            . I am one of the inspectors of the Mist, and have had considerable experience in the examination of materials for counterfeiting coin, and of counterfeit coin; this pair of moulds are made of plaster of Paris for the purpose of casting a shilling; on the impression, on the reverse side, a portion of the plaster is come away, and I find, on an imperfect shilling, which has been produced by Edwards, precisely the same defect; here is the obverse part of the mould; that has also a trifling defect which is perceivable<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200012"></xptr>on the shilling - here is the get, which fills the nitch in the mould; here are four counterfeit shillings, finished as perfect as the mould would make them, but they require to be filed where the get has joined them - they are imperfect, and could not be passed in the present state; they appear to have been cast in the mould now produced, for on the obverse side is a small defect in the beading round the edge, and on the reverse side is a very trifling defect in the mould, between the line of the shield containing the arms and the garter which surrounds it, and immediately above the figure 4, in the date 1824, is a small scratch - the mould and the shilling correspond with these marks; the date and the rest of the impression corresponds - one of the five good shillings I have no doubt at all has been the shilling the mould was made with, because it has on it the peculiarities I have before described; here are four perfect shillings - they have all been made in the same mould, and resemble the pattern shilling which I have produced, and correspond with the mould; the rough sprey is taken off the shilling by a file; this file would do it - the only part requiring to be filed is where the get is; this white metal on the iron plate has been fused - the tin band is used to form the mould, the plaster of Paris being in a liquid state at first; this spoon is Britannia metal, which the coin is made of - a tobacco pipe is used to pour the metal from some larger vessel into the mould, and there is white metal in it - I have known it used to fuse the metal; there is plaster of Paris in this bag.</p>

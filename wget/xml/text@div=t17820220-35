               <p>How far did you pursue them before he said here take him? - It might be a hundred yards; as soon as I got to the surface of the earth, I saw them running a-breast, within ten yards of each other, and they continued to run a-breast, I said it did not signify their running away I should catch them, Davis, said, here; I laid hold of Davis as Collingwood took hold of his breast, and turned him round to me, Collingwood came back voluntarily; the trunk lay in a ditch within two hundred yards of the church, it was taken to the Justice's; it is the same trunk that is here, I never saw the prisoners before, I was the first that got up along side of them.</p>

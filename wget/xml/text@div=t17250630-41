I went, and found this Man in Company with the Prisoner; and he bid the Prisoner go along with me for the Money to his Uncle Strange, at the Salutation Tavern in Lombard Street. I left my Goods at the White-Hart, and went with the Prisoner to the Salutation. He stept up to the Bar, and presently came back, and said that his Uncle was gone to the Coffee-House. Then I began to mistrust him, and was going to lay hold on him; but he was aware of me, took to his Heels, and bid me go look my Cloth and be damn'd.</p>

When I and my Chapman came there, the Prisoner sat drinking by himself; and my Chap told him that he had bought the Cloth for his Uncle Strange. I left the Cloth, and went with 'em both to the Horseshoo. The Prisoner lighted his Pipe; and the other Man went out. In a little while after, I ask'd the Prisoner were he was gone? Why, says the Prisoner, he's gone to a Brother of mine at the Hercules Pillars; but I'll go and see for him; and so he walks out leisurely with his Pipe in his Mouth, and never came back to pay the Reckoning; but he was afterwards taken up with a Search-Warrant. <rs id="t17250630-41-verdict214" type="verdictDescription">

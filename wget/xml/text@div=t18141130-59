            . I am twelve years old. I and Luker went to Mr. Spencer's house in Mecklenbourg Square, on the 28th of October in the morning, a quarter before seven. We took the lead off that house the day before; we went up the joists and got on the roof; we cut some lead from the skylight; we chucked it down in six pieces; we went and sold it to Hunter, in Bell Court, Brook Street, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell it for - A. I think it was half an hundred weight; he gave seven shillings for it; Luker sold it: he told us to bring more, there was not weight; he gave the money to Luker. This is the lead.</p>

            . I live at No. 20, Mecklenbourg-square; on Tuesday the 25th of October I missed lead from off the house; it rained, and the rain came in; I waited until the 28th, and then I went on the house and examined it, and at No. 28 I saw two boys at the top of the house, Luker and Carey, and with assistance I took the two boys. The watchman went to the top of the house, he saw Carey in the chimney; and when he came down, I took him into custody; the watchman took Luker; we took them to the watch-house, and from the wathhouse to Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>JAMES HANCOCK. As soon as the two boys were brought to the office, I and Limbric went with a search warrant to the prisoner Hunter's house, there we found this lead. I went with Partridge, and fitted on one piece to the top of No. 16, and they fitted the rest, it fitted completely. I and Limbric found this lead in Hunter's shop.</p>
               <p>George Hay. This lead matched with No. 16, that house belongs to Messrs. Spencer's; there was lead taken from different houses.</p>
               <p>Luker said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Hunter's Defence. On the 24th of October, Luker and Carey came into my shop, and said, do you buy lead; I said, where is it? Luker said at his father's; he said his father bought the lead of old houses. I gave him three halfpence a pound for it; I can only make twopence a pound of it myself. On the 25th he came again with some more lead; I bought it at three halfpence the pound, that is the market price. I thought the lead was the boy's father's; he said his father lived in Gray's-in-lane.</p>

               <p>Hunter called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

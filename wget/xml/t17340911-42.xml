               <p>Prisoner. I live hard by the Prosecutor, and ask'd him to lend me a Hat? He said I might take it, and so I did. But I had been drinking Two-penny, and being in Liquor I laid down to sleep in the Stone cutter's Yard in Shoreditch, next Door to the Gin-shop, and somebody came and stole the Hat away, and this is two Years ago.</p>
               <p>Court, to the Prosecutor. Why did you not prosecute sooner?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I found him at a Brandy-shop 3 Hours after the Exchange, as he call'd it, and ask'd him where my Hat was? He answered, Damn it, I have none of it. I carry'd him before Justice Manly, but not having my Witnesses there, he was discharged. And after that, he was gone, I don't know where, for above a Year, and I took him as soon as I cou'd - I heard that he offer'd to sell the Hat - But I have no Witnesses here that can prove it. <rs id="t17340911-42-verdict202" type="verdictDescription">

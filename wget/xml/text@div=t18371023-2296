On the night of the 24th of December, 1834, the warehouse, which is part of the premises, was made safe in the usual way—it is in the parish of Hillingdon, near Uxbridge, in Middlesex—on the 25th of December I came down, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and found tie warehouse broken open—the pane of glass was broken in the window, which would admit the hand of a man to undo the fastening of the casement, an might arm be put in, and the goods which were within reach taken out I found the casement unfastened—there was not room for a person to get"—the goods had been stored away on shelves in the warehouse—I missed a considerable number of tea-trays and waiters—about thirty in all—can not tell how many of each—fifteen waiters and four trays have been found, and were shown me by Birch and Arnold.</p>

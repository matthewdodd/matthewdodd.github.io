            . I am superintendant of the London Gas Light and Coke Company. In consequence of information, I went to the pig market in <placeName id="t18220911-27-crimeloc147">Smithfield</placeName>

I told him there were witnesses to prove he had taken it from the spot; he then said he had taken it, and would shew us the place it was in; he took us to a house in Field-lane, which he said belonged to one Sheppard. The officer found the pipe there, broken in three pieces. Sheppard said he believed the prisoner to be the person he bought it of, and that he gave him 6 1/2 d. for it; it cost the Company 5 s.; I do not know the value of it when broken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It lay in the open street - A. Yes; it was six feet long. The officer told him he had been seen breaking it with a stone, and taking it away.</p>

            . I live at the corner of the pig market. The prisoner was one of the paviours there; I saw him take the pipe from the corner to the end of the market, and break it with a large stone. I followed him to Sheppard's shop in Field-lane with the largest piece, and saw it laid in the scale. It is an old iron shop.</p>

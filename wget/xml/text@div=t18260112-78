I stumbled against the parcel and fell - I got up and took it up, and again ran after the prisoner. In about two minutes I heard the watchman say "It is all right - we have got him."</p>

            . I was on duty, and heard the rattle - I saw Magrath run up Middle-row - I went the other way, and met the prisoner, with Magrath at his heels - he was running fast, and no person was before him - he said why did I stop him - he was not the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you seize another man? A. No; two Irishmen came up and said "That is not the man, it is this man;" I took the man they pointed out, but he was set at liberty at the watch-house; there might be half a dozen people.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Holborn, and saw the watchman with a man in custody - I went up to him, and he let go of the man and took me - I had been walking slowly.</p>

                  </hi>I am a salesman in Long Acre. On the 15th of June, Wilkinson came to my house, looked at some clothes, and asked me if I would take a gun in exchange—that he had one given him, and his father and mother said it was no use to him, he should get clothes in ex<lb></lb>change—I said if he would bring the party who gave him the gun, I would speak to him—in the evening he brought the gun, and said the gentleman was in the country, and I said, "Bring your father and mother"—he left the gun with me, and was to bring his father or mother on the Saturday—he did not, but on the Sunday he knocked at my door, and asked for the clothes—I said as he had not brought his father or mother, I would give him the gun back, and then he went away—he came again on the Monday morning, with his mother, and said, "The first tale I told you was un<lb></lb>true, I won it at a raffle, " and that his father and mother had an aversion to it—I asked for the house where he won it—he left the gun—on the Wed<lb></lb>nesday he brought Betty, and said he had the gun from Betty, and Betty said the gun belonged to Wilkinson, and that he gave it him.</p>

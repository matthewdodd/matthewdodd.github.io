                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Princes-street, Ratcliff-highway. I take in needle-work—the prisoner worked for me thirteen or fourteen months ago—one Saturday in Oct. last year, I cannot say what day, I came home, found my door burst open, and missed this pair of trowsers—they were safe when I went out about one or two o'clock in the day—I had locked my door, and taken the key in my pocket—in conse<lb></lb>quence of something I heard I spoke to the prisoner about it in the morning, and said, "Betsy, these trowsers have been taken away from me, if you know anything about it tell me, and I will not mention it to anybody; go and help to get them out of pawn if you have pawned them"—she strongly denied knowing anything about them—I saw her again in the afternoon—I had then heard she had taken the trowsers—I said, "Betsy, will you come to work in the morning?"—she said, "Yes I will," but she did not come—I said nothing to her about the trowsers then—I did not see her for a long time after that—I met her, and said, "Betsy, you have taken my trowsers"—she said, "I did"—I said, "Did you burst open the door?"—she said she did, but the lock was bad, and the knew it was off the lock—I let her go then—I met her about two months afterwards and said, "Betsy, you promised to send me the trowsers"—she said, "I will send them," and she gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which she owed for lodg<lb></lb>ing-money—she went away that time, and there was no policeman by—I met her again, took her to give her some beer, and while she was drinking it I went out to get a policeman, but she was off before I returned—I saw her no more until I gave her in charge about a fortnight ago—I did not know where to find her—these are the trowsers—they belong to Mr. Brotherton, who keeps a warehouse—I made them for him, and am answerable for them—my money has been stopped for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 13, Glasshouse-street, in the same house as Mrs. Murphy. She lives above me—the prisoner used to work there for her, and live there too—one Saturday in Oct., last year, the prisoner and Mrs. Murphy had been out drinking pretty well all day—between five and six o'clock the prisoner came home, and said Mrs. Murphy had told her to pledge two pairs of trowsers to pay her and others—she had something under her apron—I do not know what it was—Mrs. Murphy was in the habit of sending her to do such things, and I took no notice—Mrs. Murphy came home about one o'clock, very much intoxicated—she</p>

On Tuesday evening, 5th December, about a quarter to 1 o'clock, I saw two persons in the Regent's Park-road, one dressed as a female, and the other as a man—I followed them thirty or forty yards—the woman looked rather curious; I turned my light on her legs and saw a man's trousers—it was Rose—I asked him what he had under his arm; it was a bundle—And range turned on me quite indignant when I took hold of them, and asked what I meant—a struggle ensued with both, and Andrane escaped—I took Rose to the station—this is the bundle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it contains the property he was dressed in, part of the stolen property—I described Andrane to a policeman, and he was taken next day—I had not known him before.</p>

About half-past 11 on Monday, 5th December, I saw Andrane lying on the railway bridge at Chalk Farm, looking over at the engines—I saw a man who I believe to be Rose close by, and heard him say to Andrane, "Come on, do not stop there"—Andrane said, "All right, which way are you going?"—Rose said, "This way"—Andrane joined him, and they went towards Primrose-hill did not know Rose before.</p>

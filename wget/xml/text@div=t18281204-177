            . I am a pawnbroker. On the morning of the 6th of November, the prosecutor's mother came to inform us her son had been robbed of his pocket-book, in which were some of our duplicates; and about twelve o'clock, the prisoner presented this one - I asked him where he got it; he said he bought it on the Saturday, which was the 1st of November - the date of it is the 22d of September; the date of this other duplicate is the 11th of October.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said I bought them that day, about eleven o'clock, in Whitechapel. Witness. No; I pressed him three or four times about it, and he said he bought it on the Saturday; I then said "Have you any more;" he pulled out this one, and said he bought that that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Sears, and live at 26, Hartley Road, Penge—on Tuesday, the 24th September, the prisoner came to my house, and I gave her a dress to make, and she agreed to get it done in three days—she asked me if I had got any trimmings for it, and I told her no—she said if I would allow her she would get them much cheaper than I should—I gave her half a sovereign to get them—I next saw her on the Wednesday morning when she came to work, with the trimmings—I asked her for the bill and the change, and she said she forgot to bring it, and would bring it next day—next day she brought me a bill for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said that was what the things come to—I asked her for the change and she said it came close on to the money—I felt dissatisfied and went to the shop in the evening, and they made some communication to me—I saw the prisoner next morning but I did not mention about the bill, because I wanted her to get my dress finished—she wanted the money on Friday night for her day's work, and I said I would settle with her altogether, because she had not given me the right change, I told her I had been to the shop and that she had charged a great deal too much; more than half—she said dressmakers were allowed to have half the money for discount—I gave her into custody on Saturday night.</p>

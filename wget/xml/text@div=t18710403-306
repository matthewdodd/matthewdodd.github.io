                  </hi>. I live at the Green Lanes, Stoke Newington, and am private watchman to Mr. Rydon, a brick-maker there—on 20th February, about 2.30, I was in my garden, and saw a flame shoot up from a straw stack</p>

               <p>in Mr. Rydon's brick-field, about fifty yards off, and the three prisoners ran away—I ran after Bland, and stopped him about 100 yards from the stack, and the two others were stopped—they are the two—Bland said "Let me go, and I will tell you who did it; I did not do it, the others did"—I said "No," and took him to Mr. Rydon's office, and then to the station—the stack was burnt to the ground.</p>

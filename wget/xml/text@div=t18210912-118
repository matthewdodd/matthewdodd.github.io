He had been there at half-past nine that night. The nuts were in cannisters, not boxes. Thompson shewed them to me next morning; they were full of nuts then, I know the cannisters to be mine, but cannot swear to the nuts.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 2d of September about half-past eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner ran against me in St. John's-street, with one of these boxes on his shoulder, and ran into No. 42, St. John' street. I followed him into the passage and up stairs, and lost him, and went with Thompson to search the house. He was brought to the watch-house next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Your sight is not good - A. No. I saw him go into the house, and found the box in the passage. I was twelve or fourteen yards from the house on first seeing him. I am certain he is the man.</p>

I went over the house with Thompson, about eleven o'clock at night, I went to the top of the house and could not find him, I was on the roof three hours - one of the boxes were found on the roof. About half-past four o'clock that morning, I went on the roof again and saw him there, about one hundred yards from the house we searched, and took him - he was concealed in a hole under the tiles. I had seen him on the roofs before I went up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was on a roof one hundred yards from No. 42 - A. Yes; when I first saw him he was about one hundred and thirty yards, and when I took him he was further still. I did not halloo to him - I knew him before.</p>

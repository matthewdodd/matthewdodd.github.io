               <p>Mr. Curson depos'd, That he was sitting in the Room when the Prisoner and the Deceas'd were playing a Game at Cards, but his Back was towards them; that he heard some Words, but not with much Warmth, and the Prisoner retired, and drew his Sword; that he went and held Mr. Fitzgerald till the Deceas'd had drawn his Sword, and he saying to him, will you hold me while I am Sacrific'd? He was obliged to withdraw, that they were both in a Posture of Defence, and were engag'd about half a Minute; that the Deceas'd said, I am a dead Man, make your escape as fast as you can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stone depos'd, The Prisoner came in to the Thistle and Crown, where himself, Mr. Curson, and the Deceased was, and the Prisoner being ask'd to play for a Sneaker of Punch, that he seemed unwilling, but said, he came in to spend 18 d. with the Widow; but that he did play with the Deceas'd, and some Words arose, Mr. Fitzgerald said, there had been some Mistake in the Play, but he believes the Prisoner had won the first Game, and the Deceas'd propos'd to play for a Two Shilling Sneaker, but the Prisoner not being willing, the Deceas'd called him, either Villain, Rascal, or Scoundrel; and the Prisoner retir'd, and drew his Sword, and the Deceas'd drew his, and put themselves in a Posture of Defence; and when he was wounded, desired they would let the Prisoner go, and that going Home with the Deceas'd, Madam Whitley said, it was what she expected.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harris, the Surgeon, depos'd, That he being call'd out of his Bed about 3 o'Clock in the Morning to the Deceas'd, search'd his Wound, and it went into the Right Breast, near the Pap, and touch'd the descending Trunk of the Vena Cava, and passed into the Cavity of the Breast, going slanting down on the Rib, and that it was the Cause of his Death.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Whitley depos'd, That the Deceas'd said to her, my Dear, I was not the Aggressor, Mr. Fitzgerald drew first; I thought of no Quarrel, my Dear, do not think me in Fault.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzgerald pleaded, That having been at Supper at a Gentleman's House, he was going Home, and being grip'd, went in to get a Dram, and there found Mr. Stone, and telling him he was out of Order, Mr. Stone took a Pen and Ink, and prescribed for him; that the Deceas'd was there at Play, and would have him play, but he refus'd, not understanding the Game of Cribbage, but did play with him at All-Fours for a Bowl of Punch, and the Deceas'd would have him play for another Bowl, but he desiring to be excus'd, the Deceas'd thereupon called him Rascal and Scoundrel; that he reply'd, that was Language he was a Stranger to, and he seeing the Deceas'd drawing his Sword, did draw his own, that after the Deceas'd had receiv'd the Wound, he said to him, you know it is not of my seeking, he answered no, and bid them let him go.</p>
               <p>He called a great many Persons to his Reputation, who gave him the Character of a peaceable, inoffensive Gentleman, not given to Quarrel; but had taken and born patiently such Affronts, as few others would have born; upon a full hearing of the Matter, the Jury <rs id="t17300228-29-verdict153" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I keep the Half Moon public-house, Strutton-ground, Westminster. On Saturday, the 21st of November, about one o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at the bar of my house—she asked for half-a-pint of porter—I served her—she offered me a shilling in payment—I put it into the till, and gave her 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in charge—there were other shillings in the till—she went across the road, and was gone about five minutes, and then came again, and asked for half-a-pint of porter—It was rather more than five minutes—I had not taken any more silver in that time, but had taken a quantity of halfpence—there was other silver in the till—she gave me a shilling for the second half-pint of porter—I served her, and noticed that the shilling was a very bad one—I then opened the till, and looked for the other one, and found a bad shilling on the top of the other silver—the second shilling had not been out of my hand at all—I took the first shilling round the counter with the one she gave me on the second occasion—they were together, and I cannot distinguish which was the first or second, but they are the two—I saw her put her hand into her bosom several times, and asked what she was doing—she began to cry, and I said, "You have got some money about you, I am quite sure, by your appearance and ways"—I called in a policeman, who took her into the yard of my house—she was searched there, and I saw him take 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from her—I gave the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the policeman—I marked them first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called to Mr. Garner's shop, and took the prisoner into the back yard—I felt breast, and felt a sub<lb></lb>stance inside—I found thirteen counterfeit shillings, and a penny-piece in her bosom, and sixpence in a purse—I received two counterfeit shillings from Mr. Garner—the prisoner said she was persuaded to go and pass bad money; as she would get a better living by that than being on the streets, but she had taken a solemn oath never to state who she had them from—I have kept them spates ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Mint. The thirteen hail<lb></lb>longs produced by the officer are all counterfeit—the two are also counter<lb></lb>feit—nine of the thirteen correspond with one of the two produced, and the rest correspond with the produced—they are made of Britannia metal, in a plaster of Paris mould, which is east with a good shilling.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that a respectable man met her, and gave her some liquor—took her to a house of ill-fame—after which, he gave her the money in question, and that she had only tendered one shilling to Garner.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 3, Union Street, Bishopsgate. I was at the corner of Finch Lane on 9th Nov., between 11 and 12 o'clock in the morning—the Lord Mayor's procession was coming up Finch Lane—I saw a crowd of men hustling a gentleman, and I saw the prisoner, who was standing with his back towards them, receive a watch, which I should say was silver, from another person, and place it in his waistcoat pocket—it was more like silver than gold—I collared him; he resisted me, and I called "Police!" several times, but they were all engaged with the Lord Mayor's procession, which was then coming up the lane—I never let go of the prisoner—after I had calked "Police!" I said to the prosecutor, "Sir, this man has got your watch"—I saw the gentleman in the middle of the crowd being hustled, and I said, "Here is a man that has got a watch, if you have lost one"—I could not get a policeman for a moment or two, till the officer that I gave him in custody to came round, and then I said, "This man has just stolen a watch, it is in his pocket"—while I had the prisoner another man came and kicked me in the leg, and said, "What has this man done? he has done nothing; let him go"—I said, "I shall not let him go; he has got a watch"—he came and tried to rescue the man, and then he struck me on the hat, and my hat went off—this transpired before the policeman came up—the policeman took him into custody—I did not see the watch found on him—I held him by the collar all the time till the policeman came up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Bank of England. On 9th Nov., between 10 and 11 o'clock, I was endeavouring to make my way into Lombard Street, through Cornhill—there was a great crowd near Finch Lane—I felt a snap at my pocket, and missed my watch; it was a silver one—I collared a man who was close to me, and who I supposed had taken it; I accused him, and he denied it—Golding directly said, "Here is the man, Sir; here is the watch"—I then let go of the man I had hold of, and gave the prisoner into custody—I have not seen my watch since.</p>

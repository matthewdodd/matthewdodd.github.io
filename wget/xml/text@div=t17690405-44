I went in, and fetched it out, and he stood at the door the while. I delivered it to him, and he carried it to a place called Cowley-Field. There we broke it open. There were eleven pounds in money in it, four shifts, several handkerchiefs, a dozen caps, and a cloak. We sold the linen in Monmouth-Street all at once, and shared the money between us.</p>

They said they were brothers, that their mother was dead, that she had been pilfered of most of her things, and that they had supported her all her life-time. I told them, God would bless them for being so good to their parents. (She produced an apron, a fearlet cloak, a shift, a piece of old point, four caps, and a handkerchief.) I bought about five shifts of them. I have sold some of the things.</p>

            . I am a merchant, and live in Upper Thames-street. On the <rs id="t18271025-47-cd301" type="crimeDate">24th of September</rs>

As soon as I had recovered the shock, which the circumstance had occasioned, I went up to the dray; the prisoner was then approaching; he certainly was not with his horses at the time of the accident - his was about the centre dray. I remonstrated with him on the impropriety of being away from his dray, and pointed out to him the consequences; he expressed great sorrow, and said a call of nature had kept him from his dray for a few minutes; he followed the deceased to the hospital, and there expressed his great regret. The deceased was Ann Hold, the wife of a man who lives at the Bull and Mouth stables.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you certain there were five or six drays? A. I am sure of five; each was drawn by three horses - they were going at a quick walk, in the usual way, at no improper speed; the near-wheel caught the post.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he had stopped the dray while he expected to be detained? A. Certainly not - he could not have done so; he might assist to convey the woman to the hospital; he behaved exceeding well.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he stopped a short time for a necessary purpose, and requested his companions to mind his horses, but they did not hear him - that the accident was quite unavoidable, and would cause him sorrow all his life.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Lancaster Road, Lower Norwood—on 24th June, the prisoner was employed papering a bed room in my house—I was sitting in my parlour, and heard the report of a gun, not in my house, some little distance off—I then heard some person rushing into my house violently—I went into the hall, and saw the prisoner there with his hand to his forehead—he said, "My God, sir, come and help me, I have shot a girl"—I went with him to No. 4, Lancaster Villas, and there I saw a little girl, dead—the prisoner asked me what was to be done—I said "I should get a policeman—a policeman afterwards came.</p>

I am a gardener, and live at 4, Lancaster Villas—the gun in question was not mine; it was in my possession—I had loaded it myself, and I left it loaded in the kitchen, at the back part of the house—I employed the deceased girl to take care of my children—she was in my house that day—the prisoner lodged with me—he had not had the slightest quarrel with the girl, to my knowledge—I was not there at the time it happened.</p>

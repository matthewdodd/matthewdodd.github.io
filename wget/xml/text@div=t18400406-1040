                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Ebury-street, Pimlico. On the 28th of February, about a quarter after eleven o'clock, I was in a crowd in James-street, Covent-garden, as her Majesty was leaving the theatre—a person asked me for a light for his pipe, which I gave him, and then missed my handkerchief—it was not the prisoner.</p>

I was on duty in James-street, in plain clothes, on the 28th of February, soon after eleven o'clock—I saw the prisoner with a map named Jones—I saw Jones put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, take the handkerchief, and pass it to the pri<lb></lb>soner, who made off with it—Jones has been convicted—I am sure he handed the handkerchief to the prisoner, who saw him take it—he was standing behind him, covering him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer at Hampton. On 3rd April, the prisoner was at my house on business—he is a dealer in sheep and cattle—I accom<lb></lb>panied him to Twickenham—in going along he said, "There is a man who talked of buying some ducks of me, but I don't think I shall sell them to him"—I said I would buy the five ducks of hhn at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was about the fair value for them—his father keeps the Three Kings Inn, at Twickenham—I called there on my way from London to Hampton that evening—I saw the prisoner's father, and paid him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the five ducks—I sent Rogers for the five ducks the next morning, and received them from Rogers—I had some</p>

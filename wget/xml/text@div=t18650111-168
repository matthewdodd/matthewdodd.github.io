                  </hi>. I live at East Moulsey—I am not in business there—on 27th December, about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Bushy Park, going towards Teddington—I met the prisoner—I knew him to be a neigh<lb></lb>bour, nothing more—I talked with him, and he turned back with me—we went together to the Adelaide Tavern, Teddington—I asked him what he would have—he said a pint of half-and-half—I gave it to him—we then went into a room, where I saw a person who recognised me, and asked me to taste some purl they were drinking—I did so, and said, "It is very good; we will have a quart"—we stopped there till a little after 6—we then left, and went towards the park—Stone then wanted to go back, and we went back to the Adelaide—he said something to Mr. Hammerton; I did not take any notice of it—I went back—we had very little more to drink; we only stopped a very few minutes—they then went and fetched a policeman to see whether I was right, and the policeman said, "There is nothing at all the matter; I don't consider you want me"—Stone then caught hold of my stick, and said, "Come along, uncle"—I said, "We have come here together, and we will go out together"—he told the others he was going towards my house, he would see me home—after we got some distance into the park I was tripped up—there was nobody else near—I received a blow, had my coat torn open, and my watch, locket, and two chains taken—I said, "Don't do that"—he said, "I can take better care of it than you can"—he left me on the flat of my back, and I never heard anything more of him till the Thurs<lb></lb>day morning—he called me "uncle"—we are no relations—I knew him by</p>

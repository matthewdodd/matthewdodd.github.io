                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 113.) On the night of the 15th of September, I was in the station at Bow-street—the prisoner was there, locked up in a cell with the prosecutor—I heard something in the night, looked through a grate into the cell, and saw the prisoner with a lucifer match alight, and feeling the pockets of the prosecutor, who was lying asleep on the seat—he rubbed him round, put his hand into his trowsers' pocket, and then put his hand into his jacket pocket—I did not see what he took out, as he put out the light—I went in, and asked if he had not been searching the prosecutor's pockets—he said, "No"—I awoke the prosecutor, and asked if he had lost any money—he said he had not—I began to search the prisoner, and he let this comb drop from under his smock-frock.</p>

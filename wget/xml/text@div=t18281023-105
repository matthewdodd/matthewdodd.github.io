This copper was fixed in the wash-house of a house which I let out in tenements; I had not seen it for six months before; I saw it in the prisoner's hands on the 22d of September - she was coming out of the passage with it - she was not a lodger of mine, and had no right there; I went in and missed it, and then went after her and asked her about it - she said she had sold it; this is it.</p>

            . I am a broker. The prisoner came to me in September, and asked if I would purchase a copper, as she was removing, and should have no occasion for it; I said Yes - she said it was one that would hold twelve pails; she brought it in about two hours, and asked 12s. or it - I gave her 9s. 6d.</p>

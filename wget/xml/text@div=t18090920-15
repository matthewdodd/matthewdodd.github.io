I saw the prisoner, he was wheeling out a wheelbarrow of rubbish, I perceived some lead, it struck me that he had got something that was not proper.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was a <rs id="t18090920-15-deflabel80" type="occupation">labourer</rs>

I believe he was; he was in the dress of a workman. He wheeled the barrow across the Strand into Swan-yard, I there asked him what he had got; he said nothing of consequence. I put my hand in the barrow, moved the rubbish, and saw the lead. I said you have got some lead here, you must take it back again; he was very loth to do that; he said you shall have part; I said no; take it back. He took it back to the commissioners side, by Mr. Goslen's; Mr. Bensfield stopped him; I went to the pay office and brought a constable. He told Mr. Bensfield that he got the lead from the gutter. It appeared to have been a chimney pot; it has been knocked up, there are marks of the bricklayers hammer upon it.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLING. Q. You are assistant architect to Somerset House - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there workmen on the top of Mr. Bobery's house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there leaden chimney pots upon the top of Mr. Bobery's house - A. Yes; there were a considerable number of chimney pots missing. The prisoner was a person employed on the top of Mr. Bobery's house. I consider the whole of the property his Majesty's.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was unfixed or fixed you cannot tell - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I always got my bread by the sea; after the loss of my wife I went to work with the bricklayers to maintain my children. The lead was in the gutter, I never took it away from the chimney.</p>

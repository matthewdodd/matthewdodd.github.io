The first Evidence was the Chaplain of the Fleet, who deposed, that he did marry one Simon Johnson and Susanna Cornwell, and did believe that the Prisoner was the Man; and the Clerk deposed the same. As to the second Marriage, the Prisoner confest the same, saying he would live and die with her; but denied the first Wife, altho' he had owned before that he was married to her; but she having some mistrust that he was going to be married to a second Wife followed him to Knights-bridge in a Coach, where he was married a second time before she came; and the Prisoner looking out of a Window and seeing his first Wife, ran away into Hyde Park, leaving his Hat behind him, never coming near his last Wife after. Another Evidence was the Minister of Knightsbridge, who deposed that the Prisoner and the last Wife came the 23d of September, about eight a Clock in the Morning, with a Licence, upon which he married them. Another Evidence was the Clerk, who deposed that after they were married he earnestly desired him to keep the matter secret. Another Evidence deposed that she heard the Prisoner own when he was in Custody, that he had two Wives, and that the first Wife told her she was with Child by him, and where they were married. Another Evidence deposed, that when he was going to Newgate he did confess that he had two Wives. The Prisoner for himself said, that he was not married to his first Wife.

I was working at my wheel, heard a bustling in the room like furniture being moved; I sat still, and soon after heard a noise - I went down, and saw Kied struggling in the passage with the prisoner - the other had escaped before I got down - I went into the room, saw the drawers pulled out, the locks broken, and a black bag containing this property; the room was covered with property - I went down stairs; two hats were produced, one full of caps and lace.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KIED. All this property is mine - it was in the bag - there were other articles scattered about - the prisoner was never out of my hold till the constable took him.</p>

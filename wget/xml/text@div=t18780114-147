                  </hi>. I am a dairyman, at Lamb's Conduit Street—on Christmas morning between 8 and 9 o'clock I served the prisoner with 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of milk and ¼lb. of butter—he put 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into my hand—I turned it round to the light and said "This is a bad one, I shall give you in custody, you have <hi rend="italic">had me</hi> before."—he said "I hope not"—I said "I have got a florin you gave me about a fortnight ago in my desk"—I could not see a policeman, and I took him to the station myself—he had been there on Sunday morning, 9th December, for a pint of milk and 1/2lb. of butter—he put down a florin, I gave him the change and he left—I put the florin in my pocket, where there were only sixpences, and afterwards gave it to a boy with 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in change for a half-crown—I had no other florin in my pocket, only sixpences, and I put no other coin into my pocket before the boy came—Mrs. Smith, the boy's mother, afterwards handed me a bad florin, which I kept by itself till the prisoner came again, when I gave it to the policeman with the shilling.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I know that the florin was taken by George Watts to his mother, and by her to Mrs. Reeves, and back again to Mary Watts, before it came back to me, therefore I cannot swear to it—I generally take down sixpences and small change—that is not applicable to Sundays only—this was 9th December—my milk-book gives me the date—I did not hold him by the collar all the way to the station—he walked by my side.</p>

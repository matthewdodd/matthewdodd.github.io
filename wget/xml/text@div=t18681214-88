                  </hi>. I am now living in Pimlico—at the time of this affair I was residing at Limehouse—on the morning of the 5th of December, between I and 2 o'clock, I was going along the Commercial Road—four persons passed me, and after passing me the prisoner Harvey seized me by the back of the arm, and kept me back in that way, while the others rifled my pockets of my pocket book, and twelve half-crowns, and some papers—they returned the papers into my outside coat pocket, finding they were of no use—Wilde was the one that rifled my pockets—I called out for the police, and ran after Harvey—they all ran away—Harvey came back again and I said to the police who came up, "Officer, take him in charge,"—he was bolting again, but the police caught him—Wilde was taken on Saturday night, the 5th—I was present at the time, with a constable and the lad Townsend—he identified Wilde in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you had not seen those persons before that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it occupied about a minute and a half—I saw them before I was seized, as they passed me—I had just come from New York—I had not had anything to drink at all, only one glass of brandy with a friend in the City—on the 9th of December I went to a public-house in Shoreditch, and pointed out a man as one of the men who did this—I did not know that Townsend did so as well—it might have been an error in judgment on my part—the man was taken to the station, but I did not press the charge—the inspector sent to Whitechapel workhouse, and some of the officials came and said the man was in the workhouse on the night of the robbery, and he was discharged—I don't know whether there was a coffee stall near the place where I was robbed—it happened just at the end of Flower and Dean Street—I was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Smith's lodging-house, Brick Lane—on the morning of 5th December, between I and 2 o'clock, I saw the prosecutor and Harvey, Wilde, and two more <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>—I don't see either of the other two here—the four went up to the prosecutor—Harvey caught hold of his neck, and the other three rifled his pockets—I have no doubt as to Harvey, and Wilde was one of them—I did not see Wilde again until the Saturday night following—I then saw him in a chandler's shop—the prosecutor was with me—Wilde was taken into custody, and we then identified him—after the four persons had rifled the prosecutor's pockets, they ran down Flower and Dean Street—the prosecutor followed, calling "Police!"—I saw Harvey come back out of Flower and Dean Street, towards Fashion Street, and when he saw the prosecutor and the policeman he walked back again—the policeman went after him—he attempted to run, and the constable took him.</p>

I am a tobacconist of New Cross-road, Deptford—on 14th October, in the afternoon, a little boy named Ryan came for half an ounce of tobacco—he put down a bad florin—I questioned him, and in consequence of his answers went with him to the Church-path, where I saw the prisoners looking round the corner—when they saw me with the child</p>

I am ten years old—I was playing with James Ryan in the Church-path on Wednesday, the prisoners came up and spoke to Ryan—the one who had a watch-chain gave Ryan something that looked like money, and I went with him to Mr. Mercer's shop—I stayed outside, and he said that he would give me half of what he would buy—the prisoners remained up the Church-path arm in arm—I saw Mr. Mercer come out with the boy, and when the prisoners saw him coming they ran away, and I lost eight of them—one jumped over a fence, and one ran Mercer's way.</p>

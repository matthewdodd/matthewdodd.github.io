               <p>STEPHEN THOMPSON sworn. - Examined by Knapp. Q. You are an officer belonging to his Majesty's revenue? - A. I am: On the 11th of November, between three and four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner on board the Britannia; I was on board the Rocksea; I saw him go down into the cabin; I then saw another man go to the cabin door where the prisoner was; then I saw the end of a sail launched by the prisoner to the other man; as soon as this man had got half the sail upon deck he went away and left it; he took hold of the other end and laid it down by the companion; he directly went down into the cabin and put his coat on; he came up again with his coat on, and he went to the head of the ship and looked round, and then to the stern; I then went on board the Britannia, seeing him rather confused, I said hold of the end of the sail and asked him what he was going to do with it; he said his master had ordered him to take the sail on shore to be aftered; I looked outside the ship and saw a boat with a sail in it; I then went into my own ship, and in a few minutes saw Johnson take the sail and put it over into the same boat where the other was; Johnson then got into the boat and went away towards Rotherhithe; the ship laid at Limehousehole; when the Captain came on board I acquainted him with it.</p>

               <p>GEORGE WRIGHT sworn. - I am Captain of the Britannia: On Wednesday evening, the 11th of November, in consequence of the information I received from the last witness, I stopped the prisoner on board my ship; the Custom-house officer said he was the very man he would give his oath; the prisoner at first denied it; I told him it was of no use to deny it; he then admitted that he had taken the sails; I said, what in the name of fortune possessed you to do it; his reply was, the devil got into my head, but can't we, master, make this matter up between ourselves, without its going any further; I said that is impossible; I asked where he had taken the sails to, and he said he did not recollect; he afterwards said he had taken them to a house on the other side of the water, nearly opposite the ship, which was Mr. Winter's, the sign of the Horns, near Cuckold's Point; (The fails produced and identified by Captain Wright.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not go to steal the sails: the Captain had engaged me as mate of the ship; I was in liquor and being hard of hearing, I thought he ordered me to take them to be mended; I put them into a boat, and when I came ashore the waterman disagreed with me about his fare, and he threw them up against Mr. Winter's house; I asked Mr. Winter to take care of them, and I went back to the ship; the Captain behaved like a gentleman to me, and always did; understood him worng. <rs id="t18011202-70-verdict372" type="verdictDescription">

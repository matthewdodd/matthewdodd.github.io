               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did you not know him to be a very honest man? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FEAVER. I am one of the firm - the prisoner never paid this money to me; he ought to have paid it on the day he received it - it was never known to us that he did not pay on the day he received money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not taken into custody immediately after the very money was paid to him? A. Probably this was one of the items we charged him with; he denied having received them, till the vouchers were shown, and then he did not deny.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LLEWELLIN. He was taken about twelve o'clock in the day; we had not found this out then.</p>

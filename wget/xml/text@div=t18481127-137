                  </hi>. On 30th Oct. I was in the service of Mr. Silvester Lewis Samuel. Between ten and eleven o'clock that night the prisoner came, and said he had brought the bloaters which the gentleman and lady had ordered, and he was sorry he could not bring them before—I went to the top of the kitchen stairs—I returned, and he was very much confused—he took them, and retreated back, and went away—I then missed a coat from the passage.</p>

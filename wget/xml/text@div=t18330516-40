               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say you heard your former husband was dead, from the mate of the vessel? A. Yes, he heard he said that he died in another ship into which he removed; the mate did not say that he was in the vessel when my husband died - I married my husband, at Stepney church, sixteen years ago; it is ten years since I first knew the prisoner; I married him at Limehouse church, that is Limehouse parish, I am sure of that; my father was present at my marriage, and the bride-maid - I was very intimate with the prisoner ten years ago, I lived next door to him - I was almost too kind to him, I borrowed money and gave him; I was as familiar with him as I have been since we were married - he was not frightened into this marriage with me; he used to leave me every other night after we were married - I had intercourse with him ten years ago, but not often; he then went to sea, and came home fourteen months afterwards.</p>

Yes, I was in a family way by another person - he did not sleep at my father's nor at my house at that time; he did not sleep at my house afterwards - I do not remember going to his bed-room to awake him one morning; I will swear I did not; I never had any intercourse with him after he found me with child by another man - he was very angry and quitted me, and I did not see him again for some time - I cannot tell the name of the father of that child, I had only intercourse with one man - I had two children by my first husband, and I have had this child in my arms by the prisoner since our marriage - I have had four children in all; I cannot tell the name of the father of my third child; it is so many years ago; I cannot tell whether I had intercourse with him the first time I saw him; he was a bricklayer.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you live in the house with her? A. Yes, I know she had a child fourteen months after the prisoner went away - I never knew the name of the father of it; I never had the curiosity to inquire; I don't know whether my father or mother did; I had enough to do to look after my own business - the policeman is here who was with me when I took the prisoner; he was examined at the police office, he did not state there that he never heard the prisoner say it was a bad job.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you the certificates? A. Yes, I got one from Stepney and the other from St. Anne's, Lime-house - I got this in the vestry-room from the minister and clerk, I compared it, it is a true copy.</p>

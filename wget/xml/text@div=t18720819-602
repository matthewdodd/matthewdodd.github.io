At a quarter past eleven o'clock last night I was in the kitchen; there were one or two other lodgers there. Prisoner called me up stairs, and said we had charged his mother for more hay than they had cut, then he punched me and kicked me. I did hit him somewhere in return with my fist. Mr. Shannon and two or three others pulled him away, and I went down stairs. I was putting on my waistcoat to go when prisoner came down, and with a piece of iron, or a hammer, he struck me on the head—I fell; it made me insensible, but I recollect the prisoner's kicking me on the shoulder and back when I was down; the vio<lb></lb>lence</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> R 45). I took the prisoner at 14, Short's Gardens, Drury Lane—I found him concealed on some coke under the kitchen stairs at the back of the basement, about 2 o'clock on the morning of the 27th—I said "You are William Doherty, I must take you into custody for violently assaulting a man named Robert Alway, who is now lying in the Charing Cross Hospital"—he replied "All right"—on the way to the station he said "I am not William Doherty, you have made a great mistake; I know nothing about it"—I searched the premises, but did not find either a hammer or a piece of iron; there was a small piece of iron used for stirring the fire in the kitchen, but that would not have caused the wound—there was a heavy fender, but no fire-irons—there were no marks of blood on the fender—I examined under the stairs but found nothing there.</p>

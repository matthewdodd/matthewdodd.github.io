The prisoner came to our shop about six o'clock in the evening, on the 29th of March last, to match some French cambrick; in consequence of its being rather dark, she said she would call to-morrow, and she left the pattern with me; she came about the same time on the Saturday, and I had then matched the cambrick for her; she then said she had lost the piece of thing which was to guide her in the length she was to purchase; she then wished to look at some prints; none of them would suit her, as she said, she wanted a pattern the same as one which a friend of her's had, who lived at the Marqurs of Hertford's, where she lived also, and she said, she would send on the Monday for the gown and the cambrick. She then went away, and from the manner in which she quitted the shop, I had an idea that she had got something which was not her own; I thought she had something under her shawl; a young man at the door followed her, and I followed her also; in going back I took from under her shawl a piece of cotton, which was Mr. Rickarby's property; it had been laying on the counter against a desk, near where she stood.</p>

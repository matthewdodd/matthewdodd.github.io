                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Joseph Harris, a pawnbroker, in High-street, Deptford—on Saturday, 8th March, about half-past 11, I was behind the counter in the front part of the shop—I heard a crash of glass, and saw a hand and a stick going from the window—I immediately ran out, and laid hold of the prisoner—his hand was bleeding—he said, "I beg your pardon, I was drunk," or "had been drinking, and in falling broke the glass"—I found at his feet one gold chain, and two others, which I threw back into the window through the broken pane of glass—I took the prisoner into the shop, and sent for a constable—he took him away, and when I had got about six yards, from what I heard, I went and asked the constable to bring him back, that he might be searched, in case he should pass anything—he was searched in my presence—the policeman put his hand into his left-hand pocket, and I put my hand into his right-hand pocket; and took out a gold watch, and this ticket—it is part of my master's property—the prisoner afterwards assumed to be drunk; but he was not at the time.</p>

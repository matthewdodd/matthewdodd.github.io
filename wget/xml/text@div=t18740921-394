                  </hi>. I am a stock and share broker, carrying on business at the Royal Exchange—in October last year my father was assisting me—on 22nd October I saw the prisoners in my office—my father had been there previously—he directed me in their presence to go over to the Bank of England and identify them—that is always necessary on the occasion of a transfer of stock—the necessary documents were made out in my office—I don't think I went over with them on the first occasion; Mr. Goldsmith, one of my clerks did—on their return my father gave them a cheque for 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that cheque was subsequently cashed, through my bankers, Messrs. Smith, Payne and Smith—this was on 22nd October—I saw the prisoners again on 2nd December—on that occasion a transfer of stock was made and I attended at the Bank to identify them—I gave a cheque for the amount which had to be transferred—I saw them sign the transfer at the Bank on</p>

               <p>each occasion that I went—I identified the woman—on 8th January I attended again, and again on 16th April—my father died on 5th July—on 16th April I had the necessary documents for the transfer made out in my office—I attended with them at the Bank and witnessed the execution of the transfer, it was signed by the two prisoners. (<hi rend="italic">This was a transfer of</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Three per Cent. Stock; by Richard Croucher, the younger, of Brighton, builder, Elizabeth Croucher, of Cuckfield, Sussex, widow, and Charles Webber, of Duke Street, Bishopsgate, wheelwright, and was signed in those names</hi>)—the female prisoner signed "Elizabeth Croucher"—I heard Webber address her as "Mother"—these transfers of 3rd December and 8th January were executed in the same way—I was a witness to them—having witnessed the transfer on 16th April I gave Webber a cheque for the amount minus my commission—I saw the prisoners again on 22nd or 23rd May and again in June when the balance remaining in the books of the Bank was transferred—the same persons attended and executed the transfer—the same process was gone through on each occasion—that disposed of the sum of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first introduction of these persons to our firm was to my father when I was not present—I believe somebody introduced them except on that occasion: I was always present more or less—I was not present the first time when Woolfe was introduced as Elizabeth Croucher—they first came to the office in October—I think it was on the occasion of my making the first transfer, I think in October, that my. father told me this woman was Mrs. Croucher, and I was to go and identify her—it is a transaction that does not take very long—I do a great many in the course of a day occasionally, it generally takes about half an hour—Webber always appeared to be the person principally concerned—there was a man accompanying them as well, who gave instructions—Webber and the other man: were the persons that took the active part in it—I don't think the woman ever made any statement to me, she only went over to the bank and signed her name—she appeared to be a very illiterate and uneducated woman—in the transfer of 3rd December the name Croucher is spelt with a small "c"—none of the signatures are well written—I heard the woman addressed as "Mother," not as Mrs. Croucher—Webber generally called her "Mother," it was, "<hi rend="italic">Now</hi> then mother, sign here."</p>

                     <hi rend="smallCaps">WEBBER</hi>.</hi> A man named Robert Holmes was the first one that got me to do this; he always went to Mr. Watson's first and prepared everything. I got acquainted with this man Holmes through a builder that I did work for at Hackney, who used to know him, and he was great friends with him. Through my getting acquainted with a man named Lawrence I got acquainted' with this fellow Mr. Holmes. 'We were in a public house one night doing business and talking about money matters with Lawrence, and he said to me "You have got some money coming to you, have you not?" I said "Possibly I might have some day," he said "Where is it?" and I told him I did not think of anything at that time. He said "Why don't you sell some of it out? I could give you 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "I said I had no idea of it. He said "You can by getting a man and woman to forge the name; I can guarantee it shall be paid back again; I could give you 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "He knew. old Mr. Watson, he goes to him and makes it all right for us. Whether he went and got this lady, or whether any one else did I don't know. I think I had an interview with the man first, to ask him whether he would be persuaded to leave some little out or not. It was not done intentionally to rob the Bank. He said "If you think you can do any good with it I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187409210018"></xptr>
               <p>should not mind having a try." I went and told this man what I had done, and he tries and persuades me to sell some of it out, and he or somebody else goes and asks this lady, and gets her to come and pass as Mrs. Croucher; then they go to old Mr. Watson and sell out two lots before I saw this gentleman at all. The money was sold out. I said to him "What have we got to give this lady and the other man?" He made a proposition what they were to have. I really could not say what they had the first time. When it was sold I said "Now what have we to give you, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will suit you, won't it?" He said "No, I have done most of it, and I want most of it; I want 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "He used to do the writing, and I used to carry the cheque book, and if I wanted 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I used to get him to write out the cheque and I signed my name, and if I wanted 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would put a I down before it and make. 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it, and rob me that way. Several times he did this. On one occasion he said to the other man "I don't see what we want with Webber; if we go to a fresh broker and get another man we can sell out the stock and have it ourselves, and let Webber down. "They worried me so I was like a madman, but I did not like to upset him, because I was frightened if I did, that I should get nothing at all. Then, in order to try and satisfy me after he found it was very nearly all gone, he comes to me when the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sold out, and says "Mr. Webber, I have had bad luck with the money I have had of you, but a friend of mine has money coming to him; I will take you to Doctor's Commons and show you the will. The two trustees are dead and they want to get two more trustees; you seem poor, and you can have your money back if you can only find money to do it." He took me up to Doctor's Commons and showed me the will. I have no question to ask the witness. We had this money certainly, but not with the intention of robbing the Bank. It was done by this man persuading me to do it; it was to be paid back again. I never went to this lady's house at all; the old gentleman went and fetched her out.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to belong to Worship-street now? - A. One of the Magistrates recommended me to another office.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you discharged from Worship-street? - A. Not to my knowledge; Mr. Colquhoun recommended me to the Magistrates at Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known M'Gaun a long while? - A. I never saw her before that day.</p>
               <p>Q. It was your scheme sending her in this way? - A. It was by order of the Magistrates.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw a shilling marked in that way? - A. Not exactly the same, I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see a shilling with two cuts like that? - A. I may have seen shillings with cuts, but not exactly in the same manner as that.</p>
               <p>Q. After M'Gaun returned, you went to the house? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The half crown was not found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time M'Gaun came out, that you went into the house? - A. In a few minutes within ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. You were not an officer belonging to the Bow-street office? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What house do you keep? - A. A private house.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not a silversmith? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no knowledge about coin, but by having the misfortune to give evidence against a great many people here? - A. No; but I have had a great deal of experience.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no other means of knowing it, but by seeing a good deal produced in this Court? - A. None in the world; I have no doubt in saying they are counterseit, from my experience.</p>

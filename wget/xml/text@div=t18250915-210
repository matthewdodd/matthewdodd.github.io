On the 28th of July, about eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners two or three times - my apprentice pointed them out to me, as they passed my window. I gave directions to my workmen, in the back shop, to be on the alert; and very soon after, I saw them cross on the opposite side of the way, and soon after Bullock placed himself in front of the square of glass, which was broken before - it was cracked in three directions - the piece was not out; it was sufficiently secure to keep together, unless force was used. Samuel then came up, and placed himself in front of the window, near the door. Bullock immediately put his hand under his apron, and I saw him cutting the putty from the glass. After he had been at work some time, he forced the glass in with his hands still under his apron. Salmon then came alongside him, and Bullock put his hand through the aperture which had been made, and took out six pairs of spectacles, which lay in a little tray; they both turned from the window, and were moving off very gently - they were close together. Samuel concealed Bullock from persons who were passing; they went from the window. I went out and laid hold of Bullock with the spectacles in his hand. I then laid hold of Samuel, who was separating from him - my men came out. I came to the warehouse, searched Bullock, and found a piece of wire bent at each end on him - Samuel had nothing - the spectacles cost me 46 s. Bullock reached his arm half into the shop to get them.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor. I was in the back shop, and saw the prisoners at the window. I saw Samuel by the door, and Bullock by the glass, which I afterwards perceived was cracked. A man came to the door, and wished to speak to my master. I came into the front shop to call my master down, and opened the door to let the man in - he came in. I then saw the prisoners walk from the window. I called my master, and while he was coming down stairs, I looked at the window where Bullock had been, and found it had been cracked. I had opened the shutters about a quarter past six o'clock - it was safe then. I pointed them out to my master standing on the opposite side of the way, and saw no more of them till he had secured them, when I assisted in taking them to the watch-house. I saw Bullock drop the spectacles on the stones, after my master had secured them - Goddard picked them up.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Richardson's employ. On the 28th of July, I was in the kitchen under the shop window, and saw the prisoners talking by the shop. I looked up to watch, and in a few minutes they came up to the window, placed themselves there and said "Now look out, look out;" the other prisoner replied "It is all right, go on." I then thought it time to go up. I spoke to my master, who stood in the passage, then went round the back way, and met my master, who went out in front - I met him with the prisoners. Bullock said "We have done nothing." I saw him drop the spectacles from his right hand on the ground - I picked them up, followed him to the watch-house, and gave them to my master.</p>

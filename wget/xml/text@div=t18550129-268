                  </hi>. I am assistant secretary to the Electric Telegraph Company, in Lothbury. The prisoner was in the employ of the company in Sept., Oct., and Dec. last—in Sept. last, I received a written application from Mr. Harrison—I have it in my hand—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>, "Sir,—I sent a message to Weston-super-Mare, to Miss Harrison; I paid 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the message; I was informed that she had paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. must be returned"—on receipt of this I caused inquiries to be made, and I found Mr. Harrison was entitled to the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I instructed the prisoner to write a letter to Mr. Harrison; he did not write it in my presence—I saw the letter after it was written, he brought it to me and I signed it—I hold the letter in my hand—it refers to an order, which I hold in my hand—an order for the payment of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., from the company to Mr. Harrison—the order was made out by the prisoner, and signed by myself—having signed the letter, and order—the prisoner's duty was to copy the letter in a book for that purpose, and to put the letter and order in an envelope, and give it to the person whose absolute duty it was to send the letters to the post—having put it in the envelope I fastened it, and it was the prisoner's duty to pass it to another clerk to pass it to the post office—there is a drawer in the office of which the prisoner had the use, and of which he had the key—I know of no other key to it—it was a drawer for the prisoner's use—I believe there was no other communication from Mr. Harrison—the original application was dated in Sept., I cannot tell the date—the letter written by the company to Mr. Harrison, was on the 2nd of Sept.—in consequence of something that took place I made inquiries, and about the the latter end of Dec. I found accidentally the letter which I directed the prisoner to send—I found it in the drawer in the secretary's office, of which the prisoner had the key—I found also several letters—I found the envelope directed to Mr. Harrison—I have it—there is no post mark on it, and no stamp—it is apparently in the same state as it was at first—the stamp would be put on by the persons who attend to the absolute posting of the letters—the money has been paid to Mr. Harrison since the 2nd of Sept.—I issued the order for it.</p>

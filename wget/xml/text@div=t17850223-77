             to me; I had some doubt about paying the money to Mr. Scam, and I desired him to go and tell his master I would be glad to speak to him; Mr. Withey came himself a short time after, but I did not see the prisoner till he was examined before the Justice, and the question that was put to him, how Black came to make his mark to the will; and he said the will was executed at Portsmouth, I think at the New Dublin; and he said Black had been in a quarrel some few days before and cut his thumb; and therefore he had made his mark; I had not seen, as I know of, the prisoner before that time; he said that he lodged at that time at the sign of the Princess Royal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Did Johnson say any thing to you at the time about hurting his thumb? - He said, that a few days before the executing that will, he cut his thumb.</p>
               <p>I presume you always put your initials in the same manner? - It has not been in my possession ever since, but I have not the least doubt of it; it was in my possession till I parted with it to Mr. Chetham.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Torriano. Did any body come with the person that came for that probate? - I cannot recollect, it is half a year ago.</p>
               <p>(The power of attorney read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. I would not encroach upon the time of the Court; but I think it my duty, in a case of life, to submit every objection that may occur in favour of the prisoner. My Lord, I doubt whether the entry in that book can be received in evidence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230113"></xptr> as an authentic record of the court: it may be a copy, but in all events the register ought to be here. He is the proper officer to prove his own act; and might have been here with as little inconvenience as the gentleman who produces it. Will your Lordship permit the register's hand writing to be proved, when he himself might have been here? as to the will nothing can be more clear than this; it ought to be produced by the proper officer, whose province it is to take charge of such instruments; and to exhibit them when legally called for. Your Lordship knows, that in all cases of this kind, the best testimony should be given which the nature of the thing is capable of. The proper officer might have been here as well as the parties that are. I submit it is not the best evidence that might be given to this Court; and therefore it ought to be rejected.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I submit it is written upon the will itself; it would be very inconvenient if the officers themselves were to be obliged to attend.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. My objection are these? the officer in whose custody the will was, might have been here with as much ease as the gentleman who produces it, and the decree ought certainly to be proved by the register.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the book, there is not a colour of objection to it, because that is a record of the Court, and is proved as the original record of the Court, it is the best evidence; with respect to the other objection, if there was no evidence to authenticate that to be the precise instrument which Johnson brought, it would give weight to your objection.</p>
               <p>(The will read and the decree of the Court read.)</p>

               <p>Did you shew him the letter of attorney and the administration? - I did not shew him the administration, only the power of attorney; I then asked him how long he had known the deceased, he said about six years; then I asked him if he had heard the deceased say, he had any family or relations; he said, no; I then asked him the age of the deceased; he said 26; he said the deceased was indebted to him about ten pounds; I asked him where the will was made; he said, at the Princess Royal at Gosport, which house he, the prisoner, kept; I then asked him who the witnesses were and he told me they lived at Gosport; they were watermen, I sent down to Portsmouth that night, but no such persons could be found; he said the deceased had hurt his thumb, and that was the reason of his making his mark to the will.</p>

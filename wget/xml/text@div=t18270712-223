I saw them found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it usual to throw money about your floor? A. It is impossible to prevent money falling sometimes - it is usual to bring me what money is found.</p>
               <p>Q. If you or your master are not there, would it not be proper to keep it till you came? A. No; for there are three cashiers - Colson is the principal one; I cannot say whether he was in the shop. It could not belong to customers, because it was in the desk-rail, on the floor; only the cashier sits in that desk - the prisoner sweeps it out in the morning; we have had no other prosecution of this kind - the bowl was under the desk. I believe the prisoner has been there four years; he has been searched once before - he said that he found the shilling under the desk; he has returned money before. I put it there to see whether he would take it.</p>
               <p>Q. You left it there to try how many temptations his honesty would resist? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Where was the bowl of farthings? A. About three-quarters of a yard from the floor, under the desk. I counted the farthings the last thing at night, and could not have dropped them.</p>

            , I am in Mr. Harvey's service. On the 29th of June the prisoner returned me a shilling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a witness on the part of the prosecution? A. Yes; when I was subpoenaed first the prisoner's master did not say I should not attend - Mr. Cook, the foreman, wanted to know whether it was really necessary for me to attend. The prisoner said he found the shilling in the desk, when he swept it out.</p>

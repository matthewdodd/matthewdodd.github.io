                  </hi>. I am a carman, of 28, Essex Street, Commercial Road—on Saturday night, 9th November, soon after 9 o'clock, as I was near Church Lane, four men came up—I cannot swear that the prisoner was one—onetook me round the neck, another put his hand over my mouth, and the othersrifled my pockets and took my money—I halloaed "Stop thief!" and ranafter them, but lost sight of them—two policemen pursued them, and Iafterwards saw the prisoner in custody, but could not recognise him—I hadhad a drop of drink.</p>

I heard a cry of "Police!" ran to thespot, and saw two men stooping or kneeling on the prisoner, about 100 yardsoff—the two got up and ran away, and two others came towards me; theprisoner is one of them—they got within 50 yards of me before they saw me—they separated just as they got to an alley—I got within 2 yards of theprisoner, when he dodged me and ran back again—I pursued and caughthim—I never lost sight of him, as the alley is in the same direction.</p>

I heard cries of "Police!" and sawthe prisoner and a man not in custody coming from Whitechapel Churchtowards us—that is near Church Lane—they turned sharp to the left, andran through Spectacle Alley, which runs into Church Lane again—I saw Gorerunning, and I ran too, and kept him and the prisoner in sight till theprisoner was captured—he was running, not walking—I was only half adozen yards from him when he ran down the alley.</p>

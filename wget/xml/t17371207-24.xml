               <p>Henry Udall. The 27th of May about 10 o' Clock at Night, I had the Tankard. The Prisoner and the Evidence was with him then in the House, I had been walking with my Child to give him a little Air, and when I came Home I told over my Tankards; this was about 9. A quarter before 10, I told them over again, and they were all right; the Prisoner and the Witness were then in the House. I missed one immediately after they were gone, but I can't say they took it.</p>

The Prisoner I know has been out of Business; on the 11th of May he work'd for me: I am a Philosophical Instrument Maker; he went then away from me; and I saw him when he was ill, and paid him 3 s. which was due to him when he went away. He has work'd with me since; the 27th of October was the last Time. As the 27th of May, I can't Swear where he was then.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard a great disturbance on my beat, and a call for Watchman! the prisoner ran by me; I did not stop her because I thought there was something serious up the court; I then met the prosecutor, who said he had been robbed; I told him I knew her, and should see her again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the man; he would go home with me, and followed me to the door, and came in; I said"What do you want here;" he said "Do you think I have no money" - he took out three sovereigns and threw them down on the table; I said were they for me - he said Yes; after being in the room some time, because I would not give them to him, he called the watchman.</p>

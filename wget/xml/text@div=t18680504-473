I live at Anerley—on the 11th of October, I bought five pipes of wine of a Mr. Cohen, at that time lying in the Metropolitan Docks—on the afternoon of the 16th, I saw Maude in Cannon Street—he was carrying on business in Water Lane, as Garnant, Nunn and Co.—he said he was a partner—he wanted the wine, but could not pay cash, and would give me a bill for 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him the bill would be useless, as I had no means to discount it—he said he knew some persons and would write to them—on the following day he showed me a letter, and tore off the top, which he gave to me, on which it said "Ladell and Co., Merchants and Commission Agents, 86, Hatton Garden, Holborn, London, 12th October"—the purport of the letter was, that they would discount his acceptance at five per cent per annumn—it was signed "Ladell and Co."—an arrangement was made to meet at Hatton Garden, at 11 o'clock on the 17th—I went and he said Ladell was out, but would be in in half an hour—we went into the Bell—he there asked for a receipt stamp, which I said I had not got—he went out to see if Ladell was in, and remained about twenty minutes and said he had got a receipt stamp—he asked for a receipt—I said "Wait till I have been to Ladell's"—I had drawn the bill</p>

               <p>the day before—it was produced at the Bell—I had the warrants, and accidently left them on the table at the Bell—I left Maude there, too, while I went to Ladell's—he was not in—I was coming out and met Meyer in the passage—I said "Mr. Ladell"—he said "Yes, walk in"—I said "I am come for the money for this bill"—he said "Come again in an hour"—I said "Mr. Maude told me you would give me the cash for it at once—he said "Where is Mr. Maude"—I said "Just round the corner"—he said "I will go and see him"—we walked round into the coffee room at the Bell, but Maude was gone and the war<lb></lb>rants too—Meyer said "I thought you said Mr. Maude was here," and laughed—I said "I left him here"—he said "Where is he?"—I said "That I cannot say, he has got my warrants"—he then said "Well, I would not discount his bill for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he has no account at the bank, besides, the drawer of the bill was represented to be a person I knew; but you are a stranger to me, wait and I will make some inquiries"—he went away for ten minutes—I said "They were my warrants," and I would go and stop them—and I at once took a cab, intending to do so—I did do so, as far as I could—I searched for Maude, and met his son, who went with me; but we did not succeed in finding old Mr. Maude—I can't account for leaving the warrants—I did not intend to part with them—I had no suspicion—I called in at Ladell's on the following morning, at 10 o'clock, and he said "Well Mr. Halford, things are not so bad as we thought yesterday, and I do not say that I will not discount the bill, but understand that I am not going to discount it at the bank rate; if you will look in at 3 o'clock, I will tell you—I went, and he sent the boy somewhere, who was gone about a quarter of an hour, and returned and said "Yes"—I don't know what that meant—Meyer said "You see, Mr. Halford, it is all right; and I will do the bill—I will give you 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it"—I said "Certainly not, I can't take that, but I don't mind giving you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the discount"—after a little haggling I made it 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he agreed, and said "To show you I am in earnest, I will give you a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "If you will come at 11 o'clock to-morrow, I will give you the balance"—I went on the 19th—he said "What do you want with me?"—I said "It will be 152<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he drew a cheque, handed it to his clerk, and said something in German which I could not understand—he said "You have not cashed the other cheque"—I said "No"—he said if I would put my name on the back he would give me the money—he laid down the money—he then sent the clerk out with another cheque—he returned in five minutes, and said something again in German—he then said "Well, Mr. Halford, this is a <hi rend="italic">bond-fide</hi> transaction"—I said "Clearly sir, because Mr. Maude has got my warrants, "Well, give me a memorandum to that effect"—and he wrote out that memorandum, and gave me a copy—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:—"London, 15th October, 1867, five pipes of wine sold to Messrs.

Halford)—I signed that while the clerk was gone for the money—Meyer said "While he is gone you can stand a glass"—I said "I have no objection—we went out and he said he had an appointment, and would be back in five minutes, and asked me to go back to the office—I did so and waited about half an hour, till one o'clock, when the clerk that was in the office said he was going to shut up the office, as he left at 1 o'clock on Saturdays, and I was obliged to go—on the Mon<lb></lb>day</p>

               <p>I went again and asked for my receipt—Meyer said "I have no<lb></lb>thing belonging to you, I saw the rightful owner and gave it to him"—I said "I shall advertise that these warrants have been stolen"—he turned to the clerk and said, "You hear what he says; I will have you looked up"—I said "If you don't choose to give them to me, I shall take measures to get them"—he said "Oh you go to the Devil and hang yourself"—instead of doing that, I gave him into custody—I never in<lb></lb>tended to part with the warrants without receiving the cash.</p>

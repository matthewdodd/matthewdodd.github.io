             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a fisherman, residing at Stroud.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember, in December last, a person of the name of Drake making any application to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney objected that this could not be evidence, unless they could shew that the present prisoner and Drake were in company with each other.</p>
               <p>Court. I am perfectly of opinion that he must be connected with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Mr. Raine. We shall certainly prove a connection between Turnbull, Honey, and Drake.</p>
               <p>Q. An application was made to you by Drake? - A. Yes; for the boat to go a pleasuring in; in consequence of which I came up to town along with Mr. Drake; I went to his house, the sign of the Bell, in Lower Thames-street; when I had been there about half an hour, Bryce came.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the Bryce that was tried and convicted here? - A. The same.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you first saw Honey? - A. I took it to be Pollard's Inn, but it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect where the house was? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the Pollard that was tried and convicted here too? - A. Yes, the same; there was Pollard, Bryce, and Honey altogether at the inn, and two chaises were ready.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What day was it you came up to town? - A. It was on a Friday or a Saturday, I cannot say which.</p>

               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. How long did you stay in town? - A. One day and a night; we went away on the Saturday about six o'clock in the evening, Pollard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080085"></xptr>Turnbull, and myself, went in one chaise, and Bryce and Honey went in the other, they went off one chaise just before the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to? - A. I do not know the name of the place; we went about twenty-two miles, changed horses, got tea, and set off directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the name of the landlord? - A. No; I did not hear his name mentioned to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you stop next? - A. We went eleven or twelve miles.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the place? - A. I do not know; there we hired a guide to conduct us over the marshes to Holly-haven House, by the river side, and a man to carry the portmanteau, and our fowling-pieces, we gave him half-a-guinea for his trouble; they had two guns in their chaise, and we had one in our's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps Holly-haven House? - A. One Richmond.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get there? - A. As near as I can tell, about four o'clock on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that what they call the Sluice-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you breakfast there? - A. Yes, and dined there, in the same party; the boat was not there till three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You went on foot to the Sluice-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that? - A. About six miles, over fields and marshes; it is a by-road, like.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of walking was it? - A. There was a great deal of snow upon the ground, we were over our knees sometimes in snow; we tumbled up and down, it being quite dark, and in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you left the chaise? - A. About one in the morning, I think it was, as near as could be, and we were about two hours going.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the Sluice-house, do you remember what became of Bryce in the course of the day? - A. Yes; he went in a short wherryboat about half past two, or three o'clock, from the Sluice-house to Gravesend, in search of my vessel, to see if it was come away; my vessel was to meet me at the Sluice-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he to go? - A. Seven miles from Gravesend; before Bryce took the boat, he and Pollard went out a shooting the whole day, and the prisoner Honey was at the Sluice-house with Turnbull and me all the day, he was not out of my sight, I dare say, ten minutes the whole of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did your vessel come? - A. At three o'clock in the afternoon on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go on board? - A. A little before six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went on board your vessel? - A. Only Turnbull and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Just before Turnbull went on board, did any thing pass between Turnbull and Honey? - A. Pollard and Honey shook hands with him, and wished him a pleasant voyage.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positively sure Honey is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you get for this? - A. I received ninety-eight pounds; I let Bryce have two pounds out of the hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you take Turnbull? - A. It blowed very hard on Sunday night, I took him to Sheerness, it blowed so much wind I could not go to sea; then we went into Ramsgate Pier.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go over the water? - A. No; he wanted me to go to France, to Calais, Boulogne, or Oftend; but I would not go there for pleasure, unless he would go into Dover and get a pass, to protect me and my people; then I took him to Dover, and he and I went to the play together; we were three days and three nights before he was apprehended; he never tried to get a pass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You thought this was only a party of pleasure? - A. I thought no otherwise; if I had thought it had been Turnbull, I should have brought him to London, and have made a good job of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought you were to take him upon a party of pleasure for three or four days? - A. We made no agreement about the time.</p>
               <p>Q. It was charming weather for an excursion on the water? - A. It was not very fine weather.</p>
               <p>Q. It was last July, or August, was it not, that you had this excursion upon the water? - A. Just after Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. In pleasant weather, I dare say, a person would give a very handsome price for an excursion; how many tons is your vessel? - A. Ten.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hands has she? - A. Myself, two men, and my son.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the guineas down? - A. No, I had no guineas, it was in Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were paid in London? - A. No, only fifty pounds; I received the other forty-eight from Turnbull, Bryce gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. And you made an agreement for one hundred pounds, with Bryce and Drake? - A. No, Drake made an agreement with me.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had no doubt upon earth that it was for a party of pleasure upon the English Coast? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. And you looked to Drake and to Bryce for payment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, will you look these gentlemen in the face, and swear that you supposed it was for a party of pleasure, and in such weather, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080086"></xptr>which you received so enormous a sum? - A. I thought the gentlemen were going on a party of pleasure.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the most you ever received for such a trip before? - A. I never went on pleasure before.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go for then? - A. Oysters and fish, and soon.</p>
               <p>Q. You never carried a gentlemen before? - A. No, only just for pleasure up the river, or so.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you receive then? - A. A guinea, or so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever receive ten guineas before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose I wanted you to take me out in your boat for a fortnight, what would you expect? - A. Twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not think of asking one hundred pounds? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make diligent search to find him? - A. I did; he had not been there, nor was expected there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use all the means in your power to discover whether he was there or thereabout? - A. I certainly did, but could learn nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any letter from Honey's wife, during this search of your's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards continue your diligent search there and elsewhere? - A. Yes; I attended night and day at his house for six weeks, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the first of your search, till he was forthcoming? - A. From nine to ten weeks, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use all the means in your power? - A. Yes, night and day; we employed five or six officers at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had followed his occupation, and resided at his usual abode, must you have found him? - A. Surely.</p>
               <p>Q. Rufford went with you to the Marine Police-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you him in custody of an officer? - A. No; he surrendered to me at Stroud, and gave up the money immediately; I went from Stroud to Sheerness after him, and missed him, he had come round another way; when I came back I understood he was returned; there was a gentleman of considerable fortune with whom I understood he was intimate; I went to him, and he produced him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he berray any reluctance to give up the money, or himself? - A. No; he sent his wife for a parcel, which, he said, had never been untied, and she brought it immediately; the parcel contained a forty pound, and ten pound, and other small notes, to the amount of ninety-four pounds; it was tied up in a white rag</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come with you to town willingly? - A. Yes; indeed I placed some confidence in him, for I was tired, and went to sleep in the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not in custody after he came to town? - A. No, he lodged at a public-house within a few doors of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, at that time, he was not under the controul of any body? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Then you went into the country to search for Rufford, supposing he was a party concerned in aiding Turnbull? - A. Yes; when he told me the story, I asked him where the money was; he said, at home, at Stroud.</p>
               <p>Q. But before he told you any of the story, did you not tell him you came for the purpose of apprehending him? - A. I told him I came down to take him into custody, supposing him a party concerned with Turnbull; I had a warrant in my pocket, which I never produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080090"></xptr>Q. Did you tell him you had a warrant? - A. I don't think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Rufford ever give you any account till you told him you had a warrant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a pistol in your hand? - A. No, I had pistols in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you, if he had made any resistance, have let him escape? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have let him escape, before he came to the office? - A. He might have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have thought it right in you to have permitted him to escape? - A. I knew he would not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not consider it your duty to keep him in custody till you brought him to town? - A. Surely I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then was he not in your custody? - A. When I brought him to town, I left him in Holborn to go where he pleased, before he was examined at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he would tell you every thing he knew, provided he was not prosecuted himself? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You went down to Ware? - A. Yes, seven or eight miles below Ware.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, perhaps, it may have happened to you to tell your wife you were going to one place when you were going to another? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not this man come, and voluntarily surrender himself to justice? - A. Yes, he did; after being promised that no advantage should be taken of his person.</p>
               <p>Q. He came to your house, and told you, if no advantage was taken of him, he would go and surrender at the office; and you, like an honourable man, did not take advantage of him, and he did go and surrender himself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. If you had found it necessary, you would have taken Rufford into custody? - A. Most certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did not find it necessary to take him into custody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is your situation? - A. I am a gun maker, and attend prosecutions on the part of the Mint.</p>

This put me into a great flustration. I heard no more of this affair till the 10th of May, and then I understood the Prisoner was taken up. When I saw him at the watch house at Norton Folgate , he acknowledged he had entered my house, and robbed me; he said we should find all the goods at his house, and pulled out a key - I did not see him pull out the key and deliver it.</p>

               <p>Atkinson. I went close by it, and looked at it, and saw it was fast down.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the window fastened?</p>
               <p>Atkinson . There is an iron in the middle, and I fastened that myself - it is an iron that turns round.</p>
               <p>Q. to Stratford. What sort of a fastening is there to the window?</p>
               <p>Stratford. There is a nut in the middle, it will turn, but it takes so little hold that it is of little or no use.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is it a screw to go in, or a hook to catch hold of the other sash ?</p>

            . On Thursday the 10th of May I heard an outcry of thieves, and went to Mr. Elkins the constable's house, and there I saw the Prisoner; I said it would be proper to search him there; the constable desired me to search him, and searching him I found a key and some other things in his pocket belonging to another man. Quarendon, said I, here are some of the things, where are all the rest? With that, Sir, taking the key out of his pocket (he was loth to part with it) I said, this is the key of a chest of drawers. Yes, said he, so it is. Then Mr. Stratford and the officer went to his house, and some time after I saw them come back with a great many things; there was a white quilt, two gowns, and some caps; the white quilt Mr. Stratford brought back himself, and I heard him say he took it off the Prisoner's bed. Afterwards in searching the house, I took a shirt marked R. S. N. out of the washing tub wet; his wife was there, I asked her how she came by that shirt; she said she could not tell how her husband came by it, (there were some caps and other things of Mr. Stratford's.) I asked the Prisoner how he committed the robbery; he told me voluntarily he came over the back wall by the tenter ground into the yard, and seeing a window without a window shutter he got to the top of the shed, then went up to the window, pushed his finger against it, found it lifted up, and so pushed it up far enough to get in, and then got into the room, went to the chest of drawers, and pulled one of the drawers out, took the quilt off the bed, and put these things into it, which he took out of the drawers; and out of the second or third drawers, I cannot tell which; he said he took about half the things, as much as he could carry away, and put them into a dyer's bag, got out of the window again, dropped the bag down, and came to the shed; he held the bag by the mouth, dropped it down, then jumped down himself , and made the best of his way through the next dyer's yard, and so home.</p>

            . About eleven o'clock at night I heard of the Prisoner's being taken, Mr. Elkins the constable said I have not searched him yet; when he talked of searching him, the Prisoner put his hand out and put a watch upon the shelf. He confessed he had broke into Mr. Stratford's house, and had got the goods at his house; when I came there I opened a drawer with a key which he had in his pocket, and took out some things which I have here sealed up.</p>

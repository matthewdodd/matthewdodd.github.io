            Recollect yourself a little, because you swore before the coroner, that she ran towards Hurley's wife - I don't know. She ran towards the entry where Hurley and his wife were, as near as I can tell, saying, she wanted a candle and candlestick. When murder was cried I went in, and Hurley's wife was the first woman that I met with, and I took her by the shoulders and put her towards the door, and when the light came I see this woman all in a gore of blood, and I did not know where the blood came from; I could not see her face disfigured, or a black eye or any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing else happen besides? - She cried out murder! murder! and called out for the watchman, and said, that Hurley was the man that murdered her.</p>

After having given the necessary directions how to proceed, I went home and sent some medicine, in hopes of a recovery.

Then this company in which the deceased was sat very comfortable, as it seemed to me, I never entered their company; they had a pot of beer, and by some unluckly unhandiness the pot of beer was spilt, then the deceased and another in company began quarrelling; the deceased in a rage got up and used very scurrilous expressions to Hurley and his wife; directly Hurley's wife said, I believe you are cock of the walk; that is meaning a governor in the house. In a little time the deceased person got up a candle and candlestick, and called Hurley vile words, and she took up the candlestick, in order to throw it at Hurley and his wife, and the candle fell out of the candlestick; I called for a light, and it came. Then the deceased woman withdrew into the tap room, and she came in again in two or three minutes, and ran again at Hurley's wife, and tore her cap off, and it fell to the ground; I stooped and picked up the cap and said, go along home, let us be all peaceable. Hurley was behind my back, and he said, I will have your cap off as you had my wife's; and Hurley came over my shoulder and took hold of the deceased woman's cap, and at the same time, according to my best belief, and according to my conscience, I believe she was spent in passion, and had been drinking to excess, and by her own fall she lost her life. I never see Hurley lay hands on her, but just laying hold of the cap.

             is my late wife's mother; she lived with me and my wife before my wife's death and since, to take care of my family and my property; I paid her no wages; at that time I kept a grocer's shop; I left her in care of the shop while I was on duty, and on the 4th of September she left my house, and left some duplicates on the chest in my sleeping-room; I examined the house, and found the property mentioned in the indictment gone; I missed the things the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. They might have been taken at different times? - A. Yes; in about two days, or thereabouts, I saw her again, and took her to Mr. Morritt's shop, a pawnbroker; the duplicates were some of them Mr. Wright's, and some Mr. Morritt's, where I found most of the wearing-apparel; I let her got then, because I had not the duplicates of all the property I missed.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you let her go, if you supposed she had robbed you? - A. I was in hopes of discovering the rest; I did not see her again till she was taken up, the 8th of this month; I went for an officer, and took her up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where to find her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then can you give any reason for letting her go the first time, if you did not know where to find her? - A. One of my neighbour's children told me where she was; she was taken before the Magistrates at Queen-square. (The property was produced).</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against the prisoner, Darking? - A. She lodged in one of my rooms, and some of the things were pledged by her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Darking entrusted with any of your things? - A. No further than the goods in her room.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner, Powell, in the parish workhouse, and I apprehended Dorking at her own lodgings, in the serjeant's house; I searched her, and found some duplicates upon her, (produces them); she gave them to me very freely, and said, she had them from Mary Powell.</p>
               <p>Powell's defence. I had this house to take care of; he had but thirteen shillings a week, and I had six shillings a week to pay out of it, and there was hardly any thing in the shop when my daughter died; they were obliged to pledge things to support the family; I have redeemed them, and pledged them backwards and forwards, it had cost me three shillings a week to pay interest; I thought I had as great a right to the property as him; there was nothing there that was of his buying.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Cutler). Q. You were married to the woman that is dead? - A. Yes, and these things were all bought after we were married, except two candlesticks.</p>

            . In the month of August I lost several things out of my house. I had great reason to suspect this woman's husband, and tried him last sessions.</p>
               <p>See No. 603. in the last Mayoralty.</p>
               <p>This woman was detected offering some of the goods to sale to a worthy tradesman in Monmouth-street, named

            . He came to my house, and asked me if I had not lost such things, he having read my advertisement. My wife knowing the things better than I, she went and owned the things. So the woman was taken up. [The goods produced by Mr. Holland.]</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tompson. These are my property. I am very certain of it.</p>

            . In mine. The prisoner at the bar, brought these things to me, and went away again. And after that came again, as we did not agree for the price the first time. The second time she was to have had the money or the lace. We thought them too good for a journeyman tradesman's wife to wear. So I detained the lace. I went the next morning to see for her at the place where she lived. She was gone and never came again. She was taken up near Turnham-green, in the Bristol waggon. Mr. Tompson had delivered a bill at our house of such and such things lost, which was the occasion of my going to his house to inquire about them.</p>

               <p>I did not offer the things to him, but to his wife I never was in the prosecutor's house in my life, only at the door. I found the four pieces of lace five weeks ago last Monday, in the Strand, between York-buildings and Exeter Exchange.</p>

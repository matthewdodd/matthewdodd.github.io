On Friday, the 29th of May, between one and two o'clock, I lost my watch out of my parlour - I had seen it hanging over the mantle-shelf half an hour before; I was not at home at the time. A person must go through the shop to get at the parlour. I had left my wife in the shop; when I returned she said it was gone. The lodgers have no communication with the parlour. On Monday the officer brought it to me.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On Monday, the 1st of June, I apprehended the prisoner in Brick-lane, Spitalfields, and found the watch in his fob. I asked him where he got it? he said his mother left it him about three years ago. I found the prosecutor's name on it, and told him it was dated 1818, and that he could not have had it so long. He said he had had the cap made to it since his mother gave it to him.</p>

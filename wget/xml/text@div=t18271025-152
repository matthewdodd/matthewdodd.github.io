               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were they married by banns? A. Yes; I believe he has left her for twelve months; I know nothing of their separating by mutual consent - they have two children.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH FRY. I married the prisoner - I did not know he was married before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had the consummation of the marriage taken place? A. No; that was not his fault, for I prevented it - we dined together, but did not spend a very pleasant day: the reason why we did not sleep together was, because I was not to leave my brother's till the Thursday, and I was very ill; he told me his name was Morris, but he had passed by the name of Smith - Mr. Gerrard first gave me information respecting it - I had no property - he could have no motive of that kind.</p>

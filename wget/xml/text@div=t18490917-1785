He contended that this letter contained no such demand; that it only amounted to a request, or a suggestion; and that as it contained no menace of a personal nature, it did not come within the statute.—See Rex</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Pickford</hi>, 4 <hi rend="italic">Car. 7 Payne</hi>, 227, <hi rend="italic">and Rex</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Carruthers, Vol.</hi> 20 <hi rend="italic">of Session Papers</hi>, p. 821.</p>

                  </hi>: <hi rend="italic">The Court, as at present advised, considers this let<lb></lb>ter so completely within the meaning of the Act of Parliament, that it would be very slow indeed upon a technical objection to put an end to the prosecution, and therefore, for the purpose of having the matter argued in another place, the point shall be reserved.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>: <hi rend="italic">I submit not; it is now part of the record, and must be disposed of. I contend that my friends by demurring admit the facts, and if they wish more conveniently to bring the matter before a Court of Error, the prisoner must plead Guilty, and then there must be a motion in arrest of judg<lb></lb>ment. I would not object to the demurrer being treated as a nullity; but if, having failed upon the demurrer, they now wish to try in the ordinary way, I object; and I contend that the Court has no power to allow the demurrer to be withdrawn. If a prisoner has pleaded Not Guilty, and is given in charge, is what way would your Lordships dispose of that, except by the finding of the Jury?

The exercise of that power is at the discretion of the Court. The practice has always been to allow a prisoner indicted for felony, if he fails upon a demurrer, to plead over; the original ground of that rule, was</hi> in favorem vitae; <hi rend="italic">but it is not to he said, because a felon is not liable to be executed, that he is to lose that privilege.

               <p>I could not see whether his hand was under it or on it—he rested one hand on the pipe while he stooped and put the other hand downwards—he did not make water or do anything on that occasion—he then came out of the ditch and joined the female—they waited about the Park a short time, and then went through the lodge-gate into Kensington-gardens—about an hour and a half after that I saw Vian come—the prisoner was waiting about the whole of that time—he went into Kensington-gardens and sat on a seat—I did not go into the gardens, but I never lost sight of him—the seat he sat on com<lb></lb>manded a view of the pipe and of anybody going down to it—he did not sit there the whole time, he got up and left the female and went behind the trees, but I kept my eye upon him—I saw Vian go down to the pipe, and saw him leave—about two minutes after he was gone, the prisoner went from where he was standing direct towards the pipe—he was about thirty yards off at the time Vian was putting the letter under the pipe, leaning on a railing—he could see Vian, he was straight before him—the prisoner was down in the dyke a very short time, about two or three seconds—he then came out and joined the female, who had been waiting for him, and they then went away towards the Duke's statue, in the direction Vian had gone—I followed them—he turned and saw me coming, they mended their pace, and I saw him give the female a bag—I went up to him and told him who I was, and that I was going to apprehend him for trying to extort money from Messrs. Herries and Farquhar, and to give me the bag that he had taken from under the pipe—he said he had not got it—I said, "No, the female has it"—he said, "What bag do you mean?"—she was going away from me while I was speaking to him, I went after her and brought her back—she said to the prisoner, "Shall I give him the bag?"—I said, "If you don't give it me, I will take it by force"—he said, "Yes, give it him"—as he was being taken to the station, he said he had been down there to make water, and saw a piece of red tape under the pipe, he did not know it was a bag, and did not know its contents—Sergeant Shaw told him he must go back, and he went back—I did not go down—this is the bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it contains one shilling's worth of coppers and a half-crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper. This paper of Wednesday, 5th Sept., was published at our office and circulated by us—there are none but pass through my hands—all the papers circulated on that day would contain the same advertisements—this is one of the papers we published—our circulation is sometimes 40,000 a day.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Letter, marked</hi> A.)—"Gentlemen,—Anxiety induces me to write to you, provided you will assure me that no other person but the firm will ever know what I wish to inform you. I can save you from degradation, from an immense loss of capital, and from perhaps something still dearer to you. I have been entrapped by a gang of cold-blooded, desperate villains, and hunted by them from the pinnacle of fortune to the lowest sink of iniquity; but should one syllable be known, or the slightest stir be made, my lift would pay the forfeit. I cannot, I will not allude to their vile and cruel machinations; my soul shudders to bear and see their evil and cursed designs; and though I am now suffering the most severe privations, I can endure them rather than be driven from the path of honour and honesty which I have hitherto supported. Will you pledge me your honour and faith, as you hope for mercy in heaven, never to make known one syllable of what I may communicate? and will you lend me your assistance to obtain an honest living by lending me means sufficient to get some business, and trust to my honour and honesty for its repayment? If you will comply with these terms, I will save you, or lose my life in the attempt; but you must be punctual. You are marked out for victims to these accursed villains. A few hundreds will carry me from their reach, which if you accord me will save you from destruction and the loss of thousands—if you accept my proposal, put a sen<lb></lb>tence in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of to-morrow and Wednesday morning, as follows: 'B.O.N. will accede to the terms proposed, and will send part of the means to any place which may be named.' 3d Sept. You must not lose a moment." (<hi rend="italic">The advertisement was in the terms dictated.</hi>)</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Letter B.</hi>)—"Gentlemen,—You say that B.O.N. will accede to the terms proposed, and send part of the means to any place which may be named. You would have had an answer yesterday, but was prevented. If you act</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184909170068"></xptr>
               <p>honourably with me, and not by any means deceive me, or allow any spy to watch me, I will save you or perish in the attempt, though I hazard my life in so doing. I must have means sufficient at my disposal without delay, or all will be lost. I am fully assured that 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not cover this horrid catastrophe, which would not only stop your bank for a time, but perhaps for ever, as the books would be all destroyed. The match, that most dreadful and last resource, has been contemplated by the <hi rend="italic">cracksman</hi> or captain of this most horrid gang, which I fervently pray to be relieved from. I have never yet, so help me God! done a deed I am afraid or ashamed of, and the only way I can privately obtain means will be the following. At the London end of Kensington-gardens, on the Knightsbridge-side, there is a dyke slope, which divides the gardens from the park, and a carriage road, where the roads meet as you turn to ride or drive across the bridge. It is a short distance from the first lodge, where the keeper remains, within the gardens. On look<lb></lb>ing up the dyke, you will see large iron pipes which convey water into the pond—a large-elm tree stands in the middle of this road, betwixt the park and gardens—there is sufficient room under the first pipe to conceal a small bag. If you will therefore send a man you can confide in, and lodge beneath that pipe 250 sovereigns, unseen by mortal eye, I swear most solemnly by Almighty God, to prevent the evil; if, when I have completed my task and informed you all is safe, or denounce the villains, you will let me have 250 more, which, if God prosper me, I will repay with gratitude, as I cannot get into business for less than 500 to obtain a respectable living. Let the money be lodged to-morrow, Saturday-morning, by half-past eleven o'clock, but not one moment sooner, and all shall be well with you; but if I am at all deceived in any possible way, all must fall upon yourselves."</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body there besides her? - No, not then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there? - About half an hour, I lost the half guinea then.</p>
               <p>Q. That you gave her perhaps? - No, I did not, she took it out of my pocket, and I asked her what she meant to do with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010047"></xptr>it? and she ran out of the room, and I see her again in about two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you stop her immediately? - I was laying down in the bed, rather drowzy in liquor, and she ran off, then I was going homewards, and I met with Margaret Prosser in Bishopsgate-street, we went and drank together, and then went to her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was her room? - Adjoining to the other room.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the first time you had seen her? - Yes, the first time I had seen either of them. We had something to drink, and I laid down on the bed, and I slept, and when I awaked I missed the watch and the guinea; she was gone into another room, I found her, and challenged her with the watch, and she denied it; and

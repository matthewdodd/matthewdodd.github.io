On the 10th of April, about ten o'clock at night (I had been collecting money in the City) and was met in Lemon-street by a black woman, and went with her to a house in <placeName id="t18210606-21-crimeloc123">Wentworth-street</placeName>

I said, I wished to go away; the male prisoner M'Phelan stood at the door, and would not let me go out - he stood with his back against the door; a candle was burning on the table, he, with others, insisted on my giving them some money for drink. I said,</p>
               <p>"I would go and fetch them what they wanted" - my object was to get out. The man with the wooden leg, said, to M'Lachlan, that I owed him 3 l. (I had never seen him in my life before) she replied, he does, I saw him have it. I said,</p>
               <p>"I did not owe him any such money;" on which the other man with the wooden leg collared me, and with the assistance of the black woman, got me down on the floor; then the wooden legged man called out to the female prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Bring me a knife;" she stood in the centre of the room, and the male prisoner stood against the door - the black woman and wooden-legged man were on me at the time. I saw her go out of the room for the knife, he called loudly five or six times for it. I could not see whether M'Phelan moved to let her out, as the candle was put out, but in a very little time she returned; I cannot positively say she brought it, but I heard somebody come in, and the knife was brought. I still remained on the floor, struggling the whole time; the wooden-legged man then cut my left-hand pocket off; he then asked the others if he should cut my throat - I do not remember the exact answers, but they signified it was to be done - I think they said, do so, two distinct voices answered - I consider it to be the black woman and female prisoner. I put my hand to my throat, and received three stabs on my right hand, and lost my recollection - I was left for dead; when I came to, I found myself laying on the floor on my back, in the middle of the room; nobody nor any light was there. I searched round the room for the door, found it, and got down the two pair of stairs out of the house, into a kind of square. I found two landing places as I went down, but had not observed that I went up two pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060014"></xptr>stairs. I was not quite sober when I met the woman - I had not drank much. I had been out collecting money most of the day, and was neither sober or badly drunk - I was not acquainted with that part of the town. As soon as I got out, I called Watch! I was then in a stinking ditch opposite the house. A headborough came instantly, and presently another. I had not left the house more than a few yards, and could not mistake it on account of the ditch behind it. I returned into the house with them; the door which I came out of, and which appeared a back door, was open - I had entered by another door; we did not re-enter at the door I came out of, but at the front, and I think that door was open. We went into a room on the ground floor, and found a candle had just been extinguished - part of the fire in the wick was visible and still smoking; we there found the prisoners on the floor, with their clothes on, standing up; the watchman held his lanthorn to their faces. I saw they were the two who came in to me - I gave them in charge, and accompanied them to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time your pocket was cut, what did you lose - A. One 5 l. note, and six 1 l. notes, and about 27 s. I have not recovered it. I have not been able to find the wooden-legged man and black woman. The prisoners were dressed exactly the same, as when they entered the room, except that the woman had a coat on over her other clothes, which I had not observed before - I am sure they are the people. I think I met the black woman about ten o'clock - it was two o'clock when I was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How had so much time been employed - A. It is some way from Lemon-street to Wentworth-street; we must have entered the house at half-past ten o'clock, and I think it was a quarter of an hour before I found myself overpowered, it took about ten minutes to go to the watch-house - I must have laid a considerable time insensible.</p>
               <p>Prisoner M'PHELAN. Q. Was I not asleep in bed, with my coat, waistcoat, and shoes off - A. He had his coat on I think, when I saw him - there appeared a bed in the room. The constable of the night detained them at the watch-house. I was in a very serious situation, from the effects of the struggling, and I was kept there, laying on the seat. I was locked in one of the places - there was no charge against me.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 11th of April, about two o'clock in the morning, the prosecutor came and said he had been robbed of 12 l. 7 s. 6 d.; the house not being on my beat, I called Endersbee; he described the people, and knowing a black woman, and wooden-legged man lived at this house - we went there; he could not point the house out at first, we went into two or three. Where he came to me he was about 100 yards off, there is a dirty back yard like a ditch, which leads into a square. I have seen the male prisoner at the house before, but not the female. I do not know what floor the black woman and wooden legged man lived on - it is a public-house in front; there is a backway leading to it. On the first floor we found the prisoners in a room, the candle was just put out - there was a bed laying on the floor, the male prisoner was laying on it with his coat off - there was no bed clothes. On going in, the man sat up, he did not appear to have been a sleep, he spoke as soon as we entered the door; the female was sitting on a coat or blanket, near the window, with all her clothes on. On going up with a light and shewing the prisoners to the prosecutor, he said, they were two that were in the room; my brother went up for the black woman and wooden-legged man, but came down without them. Hogarth was in a very confused state, his neckcloth appeared to have the print of a person's hand, and there were three distinct cuts on the back of his hand - I cannot find the other two.</p>
               <p>Prisoner M'PHELAN. Q. I was in bed with my coat, shoes, and hat off - A. His shoes and hat were off - there was a rug and blanket on the bed - it appeared to me that they heard us and laid down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MC. LACHLAN. Q. Was not I laying under the window on the same old clothes - A. She was sitting on a seat, with a coat thrown over her shoulder - her arms were not in it.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Wentworth-street; the house is on my beat, I went there with Tait - his account is correct. I went up stairs and saw the room in a very disturbed state; a chair stood on its back leaning against the wall, on its two hind legs - I know the black woman lived in that room. Hogarth appeared very much confused; his shirt was torn out of the pleats, and there were marks of a hand on his throat.</p>

               <p>MC. LACHLAN'S Defence. I had some words with my mother, and left her three days before. I went to lodge with this man and his wife, till I could make friends with my mother - he had only a few old clothes for me to lay on.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 12, New-street, and also keep a stall at the corner of the Custom House—I have kept it there upwards of twenty years—on Friday, 14th October, the prisoner came to my stall; she wanted a penny bottle of ginger beer—she gave me a bad shilling—I bent it, and told her it was bad—she said "Pray let me go, here is a good two-shilling piece for you"—she threw the two-shilling piece down on the stall—I said "If you were to give me the Mint and the Custom House you should not get away now"—I said "You have been here before on the 5th or 6th of this month, and gave me another bad shilling"—there was a mob of people</p>

               <p>round us—she begged me to let her go, but I said No; I would not—I had the shilling in my pocket which I had taken on the 6th or 6th, and I showed it to her and asked her if she knew that shilling—she wanted to go, but I would not let her, and then the policeman came up—she snatched both the bad shillings out of my hand—I gave her in charge to the police<lb></lb>man; she had them in her hand then—I kept the first shilling in a bit of paper in my pocket—I am quite sure she is the woman who passed the first bad shilling.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 537). On Friday, October 14th, about half-past 12 o'clock, I saw a crowd in Thames-street, and went up to it—I saw Mrs. Kelly there holding the prisoner by the hand—Mrs. Kelly said to me "I shall give this woman into custody, she has given me a bad shilling, and she gave me one last week"—the prisoner said that she did not know it was bad—I took hold of the prisoner's right hand with my left—she had got a <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi> in her right hand, and this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I took hold of her wrist, and took the <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi> and found in it a good half-crown, a good shilling and a bad one—she had two aprons on; there was a pocket to the under one, but not to the outer one—when we got to the station, she put her hand under the top apron and took out eight good shillings, a good sixpence, and ninepence in copper money—at the time I had hold of her right hand, she had something in her left—I tried to see what it was, but she put her hand to her mouth and appeared to swallow something—she had in the bag three different purchases of meat and some potatoes—they were wrapped up in different papers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you receive a piece of mutton from Mrs. Kelly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the prisoner laid it on the stall—I only produce one bad shilling—I received the florin from the prosecutrix—I know the man Foley; he was in the crowd that afternoon, standing on the left-hand side of the prisoner; I wan on the right—he said at the time that the prisoner had swallowed something—he said, "She has put a shilling in her mouth"—he was not</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

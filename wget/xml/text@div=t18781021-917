I am the son of William Edmunds, who has stables at 8, Chester St., Kennington Lane—on June 1st he let a stable to the prisoner Palmer—there were two stalls and a yard in which carts and horses can stand—there is a gate to it, which is closed at night—I used to see Palmer, Goulty, and Parker there—Parker employed me to groom the horses after the beginning of August from time to time—Goulty groomed the horses too, and used to ride and drive the horse at times—I never saw Harding there—Parker told me that Palmer had met with an accident on July 6th, but I afterwards found out that the accident was being taken into custody—there was a roan mare in the stable at that time, which was brought on a Thursday night, and a bay horse or mare—Parker told me that the gate was fastened, and they had to jump over, and he opened the gate and brought the horses in, and that he had been to Wales and brought the roan mare from there—the bay was a darkish one, that was the animal that Palmer took out on Saturday morning as he was arrested in the evening—I never heard Goulty's name; I did not hear him called <hi rend="italic">Tit</hi> till he was at the police-court—I did not see him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187810210144"></xptr>
               <p>at the stable on the Friday before the Saturday when Palmer was taken in custody—Goulty told me that he was working for Mr. Palmer, and used to do down at the other stables; he did not say where they were on the Sunday after Palmer was arrested Parker came there to groom the bay horse—the roan mare that he brought from Wales was there at the time—I have seen Parker take out other horses and mares and bring them back again—from August down to this taking place I have seen another chesnut and a rat<lb></lb>tailed bay there from time to time. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Goulty</hi>. I have seen you go out of the street with a horse which Palmer has brought back—he has told me that you were his man—on July 3rd you cleaned the stable, which made a great stink, and I did not see you there for a week afterwards. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Parker</hi>. I first saw you on a Sunday after the roan mare and the bay mare were there—you employed me, but you came on Sunday to feed the horse—you said you could do it up—I was not work<lb></lb>ing for you when you employed two men—you told my father that you and Palmer were brothers, but I did not hear that. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I did not know Palmer by any name, but I thought he was Parker's brother—when Parker came on the Sunday, the day after Palmer took away the bay mare, the roan mare was in the stable, <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM EDMUNDS</hi>. I am a cabinetmaker, of Edward Street, Ken<lb></lb>nington Lane—at the beginning of June I had some stables to let and let them to Palmer—he never gave his name—I asked him for a reference, and he said that if he paid a week's rent in advance that would do—I was satisfied, and he paid me four shillings for a week's rent—he said "Sometimes I shall have things here and sometimes not"—I saw him at the stables several times, and—Tit also—I have never seen Harding—I cannot say that I know Parker—Palmer paid the rent for about two months, and when he did not come to the stable Parker paid it to the best of my knowledge, but he had no whiskers or moustache—I knew him by the name of Parker—I first saw the roan mare there on a Friday morning—Palmer told me that when they came in at night let got over the rails and broke some of the railings down to get the mare in—Goulty is Tit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Goulty</hi>. I knew you were, backwards and forwards at work for Palmer occasionally—Palmer said I and <hi rend="italic">Tit</hi> have been down to Wales and bought some horses, and Tit got over the palings and got in—you did not deny that—you may have been there between 3rd and 11th July, but I was never at home, my business is out of doors—I never saw you bring horses there, but I have seen you go out with them.</p>

I keep the Haveringland King's Head, near Norwich—on 27th June, about 7 o'clock, Goulty and Palmer pulled up in a gig at my house—Goulty, who had been in my service some years before, said "I want to feed my mare and stop the night here; you don't know me"—I said "Yes, I do; I recollect your being in my service"—the mare</p>

               <p>was put up, and they came and had supper, after which Goulty said something about going to see his father and mother at Horsford, which is about two and a half miles off, and went away—Palmer slept at my house, and remained all the next day—they said they had been a devil of a long journey, and the mare was stiff and sore—in the evening Goulty came back—he had worked with me as a lad, and went by the nickname of <hi rend="italic">Tit</hi>—I dealt in horses, and he assisted me—on Saturday, the 29th I drove Palmer in my trap to Norwich, and I believe Goulty went by the carrier's cart—I put Palmer down at Norwich market, and in the course of the day saw him with Goulty—I went back alone—on Sunday, June 30th, Palmer came back and slept at my house, and on Monday morning, 1st July, Goulty came, and we all three went to Reepham Fair—Palmer went away the same night with the gig and mare—Goulty left us at the fair, and I did not see him again—Goulty said that he lived at Bramber, and Palmer said he lived at Newmarket.</p>

               <p>we went for a drive before we had the conversation—I said to Harding, "Whose mare is it?"—I don't think I said at the police-court, "I did not contract with Harding for it, I did not ask him whose it was"—I supposed it to be Parker's—Parker gave me his card, not paying the full value until the Monday I took that as a warranty—I thought I was paying the full value for the horse for my work—Parker told me he had bought rather heavily at a sale at Clapham, and wanted to make up the money—Harding was then close by—I dare say he could hear it—I promised Harding a sovereign for his trouble—I did not tell him to call for it on the Monday—he did call on the Monday, but not with Parker—they left together—Harding may have come about 10 a.m., Parker came about 12—I don't remember Harding asking me for the sovereign—I did say "If you will wait a week I will make it 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," but I can't say when he said that I ought to give him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had to send my wife to London for the money to pay, as I was not very flush at the time—I have not paid him the sovereign yet—he came several times for it—we had some bread and cheese together while my wife went to London to get the money—when Parker came on the Monday he offered to buy the roan mare back, and to give me a considerable profit on my bargain, which I refused—I did not ask him where he got her from, or what he had paid for her—I did not ask for a warranty with the second horse, because I had heard his character from Harding, who said that he was an adopted son of the gentleman at Clapham, whose name I did not hear—my wife was present; I cannot say whether she heard that—he gave me as a reason for disposing of the horse that he had come into property by the death of this old gentleman, and yet he said he was obliged to dispose of the horse because he had overbought himself.</p>

This gentle<lb></lb>man (referringto Parker) has a horse for sale"—Goulty drove the horse up and down while my husband and Parker watched it—my husband then got up and drove—I saw Goulty and Harding talking together very quietlywhile my husband and Parker were driving—I said to Hard<lb></lb>ing, "What do you know of this gentleman?"—he said, "He is a friend of mine; I knew him when I lived at Clapham"—I said, "What is he?"—he said, "He is the adopted son of a gentleman, who died and left him all his money"—I said, "He is a lucky one; I am afraid we shall never have nothing, only what we work hard for"—he said, "The gentleman (alluding to Parker) must have some money. He has been to a sale, and has bought a quantity of things"—that was why the horse was to be sold—I said to Goulty, "How long have you lived with the gentle<lb></lb>man?"—he said, "About 12 months," and that it was a good horse,</p>

               <p>and one that would do a little man service—I said, "We don't want to lose money by buying the horse"—he said that if he called again we should be pleased, and would give him a good dinner—I said, "I shall only be too pleased"—Goulty said, "I have often seen my missus with tears in her eyes; she will be in a way when she finds he has sold the mare"—I said, "Where do you come from?"—he said, "I come from Essex"—I called his attention to the mare having a sore place on her shoulder, and asked him how it came there—he said he was in a hurry one morning to get out and put the wrong collar on—I said, "What, have you another horse besides this?"—he said, "Yes; he has a bay horse at home; a better horse than this"—I understood that the gen<lb></lb>tleman had died at the Cedars at Clapham, where the sale was—on the following Monday I went to the bank to get some money, and when I got back I found Harding and Parker there—the balance was handed over to Parker—I had no conversation then, as they were anxious to get away to pay some money at 3 o'clock for the things at the Cedars—a few days afterwards Parker brought a bay horse, and on the next day Harding called and said, "Has that gentleman been again?"—I said "Yes," and that my husband had bought the horse—Harding said, "I have been waiting at home for him all day"—when Parker came the bay horse was in a dreadful condition, and the yard was one mass of steam—it had been very badly used—that was about 12 o'clock—my husband had it put in the stable at once, and gave it a good feed of corn.</p>

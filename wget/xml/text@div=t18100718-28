            . I am an office of Marlborough-street office. On Monday the 25th of June, between three and four in the afternoon, in company with Craig and Jackson, officers, I went to a house, <placeName id="t18100718-28-crimeloc165">No. 17, Field-lane</placeName>

               <p>COURT. What do you call blanks - A. They are blank pieces of metal, apparently for sixpences, they are not coloured; they are a metal which has a colouring in it, but not compleat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. When your talk of blanks you mean unfinished pieces, do not you - A. Yes. The table having in part fallen many of the blanks fell about the feet of the prisoners, and about the bottom of the table, which I picked up, most of them, in number, I think, sixty, many of them are bent, and many of them bear the punch mark of the letter P; upon looking round the floor, close to where the prisoners were, I found upon the blanket, and upon the floor this fine sand paper, most of it having been used. On the floor also, close to the prisoners feet, this punch, bearing the letter P, a pair of pincers which Jackson picked up and gave to me, a small bag also upon the floor close to the table, having in it two counterfeit shillings. In some part of the room this pair of scissars, a paper of cream of tartar I found in one of the cupboards, which I gave to Hawkins, with, I think, nineteen pence halfpenny in copper, which I also gave to him; I then searched the pockets of the prisoner Stinson, and found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180018"></xptr>six good shillings, two good sixpences, two counterfeited sixpences, and a counterfeit shilling the shilling bearing the punch-mark of the letter P, tied up in a bit of rag, the good and the bad shilling and sixpence that I have described. On the fire side, there being a fire in the grate, I found one blank of the small size, bearing the punch-mark of the P, which was red hot. On the mantle shelf of the same room this small ball of blacking. After having secured the prisoners I went again with Craig and Hawkins, and in the same room we found this pocket, which from some liquid appears to have been burnt, bearing some green stained marks, and now very tender; this a blanket also found at the same time, with the pocket, which has in many parts of it, principally in the middle, the stained marks of green. I have the table here which I brought from the same room, it has the same marks of green.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went in first did you make any observations on the hands of the prisoners - A. I did, that ther fingers were very dirty, as if they had been at work at some metal.</p>
               <p>Q. It was different from ordinary persons having dirty hands - A. They were discoloured as if they had been using and rubbing of metals; I made an observation to the prisoner Stinson that it was a bad job, her answer was, that they were making button tops.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a curtain in the room - A. There was, which was down when we went into the room, it was a dirty red check curtain; when we went into the room we put it up. The back premises were so situated, I think, that it was impossible to see into the room with the curtain quite down. I have a vial, but what it contained I do not know.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I went to this house with the other officers, I entered the room with Hamilton; I picked up some sixpences that dropped from Stinson, they are three blanks, they are bent and in an unfinished state; two of the sixpence are marked with the letter P. I tried the punches to one of the sixpences, it fitted exactly to the letter; I picked up the punch and gave it to Hamilton. I secured Stinson while they were searching the room, and while I had hold of her hands she said they were making button tops. The room was searched over and over again, no button tops were to be found. This is the punch.</p>

I secured Jones, she said she was making button tops, I found no shank nor wire; I found these rags, some about the room, and others in the cupboard, they are dirty greasy rags, as if they had been used in some process and stained green; here is very near a dozen rags.

            . I am by trade a button-maker - a button-chaser.</p>


               <p>Q. Do you know the two prisoners - A. Yes, I know them perfectly well. On the 25th of June I unfortunately went to their house, that was the first time, I went there about eleven o'clock in the morning; the first time I went there was the 3rd of June.</p>
               <p>COURT. I thought you said the 25th of June - A. The first time was the 3rd of June, then I went to the front room, one pair of stairs, to a young woman that I was acquainted with, she lived in the front room; Stinson came into that room to me, and this young woman that I was with expressed her surprise of her coming into the company of a stranger. At that time the prisoner Stinson had a bag in her hand, and she was rubbing in this way. I am come here to speak the truth, and you may depend upon it I will.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do not chatter so - A. Then afterwards she pulled some sixpences out of the bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had she done any thing before that - A. Yes; I saw her file some of the sixpences at the edges, then afterwards we had a little conversation; she asked me whether I wished to have any of them; I had three of her sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she had filed the edges and put them into the bag, where did she take them from - A. I cannot tell; after she had filed them she put them into a bag and rubbed them, before she put them in the bag they appeared brassy, and afterwards, when they came out, they were quite while. I went several times afterwards to see my friend, and I saw Stinson most times, I saw them both, they were making sixpences; once I saw them cutting out the oval sixpences with scissars, she had a flat iron without a handle, she struck a punch marked with the letter P, upon the sixpences with a pair of pincers; they were such pincers as them are; then she bent both ends with a pair of pliers; that was Stinson; Jones was rubbing some of the blanks with sand paper upon the table, with a cloth upon it, that was to get the rough marks out of the blanks, then they put them in a leather bag, and rubbed them with the bag and brought them out quite white.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was in the bag - A. Some kind of white dust.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you know aquifortis - A. I saw some there at the same time, but I did not see it used.</p>
               <p>Q. What is aquafortis to do to them - A. To prepare them. I know what it does to buttons; when we solder them it takes out the rough marks, and prepares them for silvering or gilding, it clears them.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you were there - A. I think on the 24th of June; it was Sunday, and I had a shilling, which I took to Mr. Sewell, who is an assistant to Mr. Powell; I gave it to him, I purchased it of the prisoner, I was to give fourpence for it, I did not; I gave that shilling to Mr. Sewell; I told Mr. Powell what I had seen. The last time I went to the house Stinson told me that they should be ready in about an hour, what I went for, some shillings and sixpences, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180019"></xptr>was to have three or four dozen, she was going to get some blanks; Stinson went out and Jones stopped at home, and when I came back Jones told me to wait, she would not be long; I stopped, Stinson came back soon after; when she came back they both set to work at the table in another room; Jones began first to rub the blanks with sand paper, the blanks were ready cut out; at that time Stinson was striking the punch on a coblers last; she then bent them with a pair of pliers, and after they were bent I left the room and went to tell Mr. Powell what I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw some aquafortis in the room, where was that - A. It was standing in the lid of a window with a feather in it. Stinson told me they were very good things, she and Jones had done three or four dozen in the morning, and they had both been out, they had got a great sale for them; as many as they could do they could part with them.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what you had seen did you communicate every thing to Mr. Powell - A. I did. I have told the truth and no more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you ever learn what powder it was - A. No; it was white. Before they were put in the bag the edges looked brassy, and when they came out of the bag the edges looked white.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what cream of tartar is - A. Yes, I know it perfectly well; this is the cream of tartar; they use cream of tartar and tin shavings to hardware buttons; I do not know what that other paper is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are a button maker - A. I am a button chaser.</p>
               <p>Q. You unlucky enough got acquainted with the prisoner on the 3d of June, I think that was your expression - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was owing to your going to a girl that lodged in the same house - A. Yes; I got acquainted with these two by knowing the girl in the front room, she was a very slight acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray where did you carry on the trade of button chasing - A. When I am at home at Birmingham; there is very little button chasing in London.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you were a housekeeper at Birmingham - A. My father is.</p>
               <p>Q. Your grandfather may - When did you carry on the button chasing at Birmingham - A. Three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you been doing in London for three years past - A. I have worked in two places and can have a good character from them.</p>
               <p>Q I am sure you are a man of good character because you are doing good service to the public - when was it you came to London the last time to settle here - A. It is now twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. About ten months I suppose you worked at button making in London - A. No, I have not; I worked at Allen's and Butler's in Nevills-court, they carry on the spectacle trade; a person that comes to London must change his hand; I worked with them five months.</p>
               <p>Q How have you got your livehood the last five months - A. I have got very good friends; my father is very well to do, he has sent me up money, and I have received money from my friends.</p>
               <p>Q Have you ever travelled the country much - A. Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. justice Grose - A. I know him very well, I have seen him at the bench, but I was never before him.</p>

               <p>JURY. Did you teach these women their business - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ask you any questions as to the process of making buttons - A. No, never; they seemed very shy of me, but this woman told them it was all right with me. I never instructed them in the art of making bad money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp Did you ever know any thing about making bad money before this - A. I never saw any person in my life making money before this time.</p>

            . Q. I believe you have assisted the solicitor of the mint for a great many years - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q You are perfectly well acquainted with the apparatus, and things necessary to be used in coming - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Take these sixpences, look at them - these are the sixpence found by Hamilton dropping from the women, and tell me what is the appearance of these sixpences - A. They appear to be finished ready for circulation; they are now a little rough, they are a little different from what they were the day when I first saw them, they were quite fresh, new coloured, I should suppose first of all they were cut out of the plate with a pair of scissars; there is another sixpence exactly of the same appearance cut out of the plate with the scissars, and that is complete for circulation, it would deceive now, at the time when I first saw it it was new coloured. These are the blanks. Here is a file which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180020"></xptr>would be useful in filing the edge, after it has been cut out of the plate in order to give it a smooth and circular form; here is a sand paper for rubbing the surface to prepare it for colouring; it is a particular sand paper that is applicable for this purpose particularly, so a great deal of it appears to have been used in the rubbing of metal: the blanks, after having been so prepared would be coloured with aquafortis and cream of tartar only.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not the effect of aquafortis bring the silver there was to the surface - A Certainly; I am satisfied of that particular circumstance by taking one of the blanks which were unfinished which I coloured with aquafortis and cream of tartar only; that is the one that I coloured. The colour of silver would be produced by aquafortis, it would be then black and be put into water, and the cream of tartar would take the black off, and produce the whiteness. Here is a number of blanks, of the size of sixpences in an unfinished state.</p>
               <p>Q. What would the act of shaking them in the bag do to them - A. The powder in the bag I believe to be nothing but chalk, which would be a quick way of drying them by shaking them in the bag instead of drying them with chalk. The blacking would be the last thing to take off the new appearance of silver, so as to deceive and make them appear as if they had been in circulation. I have looked at the rags, the blanket, and the table, produced by the officers, they appear very much stained in a way which would be the case if aquafortis had been used; I have no doubt that these stains came from aquafortis being used with metal. One of these papers that have been produced is cream of tartar, which has been spoken to. Here is a paper which I believe to be fine chalk. There is a tin pan, I have seen such kind of things frequently before, I have known them to be used in putting the blanks in to heat them over the fire; it makes them take the aquafortis sooner, it makes them take the colour better and easier, and the colour would be much better in the metal, and wear longer; it appears very black, as if it had been over the fire. I have compared the marks upon the blanks before, and I found the mark of the punch to correspond.</p>
               <p>Q. Take these two sixpences, are they counterfeit - A. They are counterfeit. A number of people make use of punches in good money, and a number of people will not take them without it, and the bending of the edges make them appear more like an old sixpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I do not see that any aquafortis has been produced to day - A. No liquid aquafortis has been produced to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think that aquafortis is necessary in making counterfeit money - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard a witness swear that he found a pen in aquafortis in the bottle, would not the aquafortis burn it up - A. Yes, it would by being constanty in the bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. How many are there that you suppose to have been cut with a pair of scissars - A. I confine myself to two in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. I see here are thirty or forty that appear to have been cut with a punch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Morris - A. Since January.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, from what you know of him, do you not believe he is as big a rogue as is unhanged - A I know nothing of his character but what come within my own observations; I certainly believe him to be a man of bad character.</p>

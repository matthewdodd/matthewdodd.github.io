                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>).

               <p>called Baxter and Co., who carried on business at 27, George Street, Chelsea Market—their alleged business was corn, potato, and provision dealers—in the course of that inquiry we apprehended four persons, White, the two Carruthers, and a girl called Florence Nuth—they were convicted here last May, with the exception of White (<hi rend="italic">See Vol.</hi> 82 <hi rend="italic">page</hi> 67)—I found at 27, George Street a number of bags containing sawdust in the front parlour—there was no appearance of legitimate business being carried on there—Florence Nuth lived on the premises—we could not find the person there who took the premises, but he has been found since, his name is Charles Nuth—the business was carried on in the name of T. Baxter—in the course of our inquiries we found that another business was carried" on at 6, Oxford Market? in the name of Byrne and Son, and we had many complaints in reference to that business—I know of goods beng forcibly removed from there by the police and being sent back—I was present at the May Session last year when Nuth and the Carrutbers were put on their trial, and Browning, Baxter and Renouff also; they were convicted; I heard them tried; the charge was obtaining—by false pretences and fraud—I have seen the writing in which, the conspiracy was carried on and know it as the writing of J. Baxter and Byrne and Co., and in my judgment they were the same writing—Smith and Renouff carried on business at 16, High Holborn, those were rooms—taken for the purpose of receiving letters only—they were horse dealers and general agents for the purpose of the purchase of cattle—I have sail that I have seen Browning go there, but from inquiries I have made since I I had rather withdraw that statement—the business of George Johnson was carried on at 776, Old Kent Road as corn dealers and general merchants, and another business was afterwards carried on in the name of Robinson at 21, St. John Street, Smithfield, as meat salesman, poultry dealer, and pro<lb></lb>vision and general merchants, and they had a room at Adelphi House, Strand to receive letters—I apprehended the prisoner Houghton on 7th March last at Buttesland Street, Hoxton, and told him he would be charged with con<lb></lb>spiring with J. Humphries, a prisoner in custody, and others, in defraudiug people in various parts of the country by purporting to carry on business at Chelsea Market and other places, 16, High Holborn, 6, Oxford Mar<lb></lb>ket, and 50, Barbican, in the name of Baxter and Co., Smith and Renouff, Byrne and Son, and J. Robinson—he said "I am very sorry, I have been led into <hi rend="italic">this by Jim Humphries and others</hi>, all I did at Chelsea Market was to fetch the letters for which I was paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week," and he said "All I did at John Street was to take the shop, for which Humphries paid me," and that he had taken goods from both places and did not know where they came from and he got very little for them, but that Humphries was the prime mover in the whole affair—he further said that he had tried to get away from this business, but that Humphries was continually persuading him to assist in carrying on these frauds—I had assisted Inspector Sayer and Ser<lb></lb>geant Roots in apprehending Humphries the day before, and saw some thou<lb></lb>sands of documents found in his lodging—he was living there in the name of C. Parry—there were a great number of newspapers, directories and other papers—I do not know by whom the shop in Oxford Market was carried on.</p>

               <p>obtaining goods by false pretences and sentenced to five years' penal servi<lb></lb>tude, and then tried with nine others and convicted of a general conspiracy to defraud—I cannot go into the evidence against Browning, but he was found guilty on several charges—Baxter pleaded guilty and they tried him only for conspiracy—I do not produce any letter from Baxter—I cannot say that I have had considerable experience in long firm cases, but I am acquainted with more than fifty or sixty names in the metropolis—I know George Bristow well; I will not saw whether he is a swindler, he is not in custody here—I followed you and spoke to you on top of an omnibus; I told you that you would be charged with defrauding different people in the name of J. Robinson, you said that you never heard the name, you would not get off the omnibus and I said that I would pull you off if you did not—I never threatened your wife—I had watched you at the news rooms copying advertisements largely for some time—I went into a public-house and found your wife drinking with a little ginger-whiskered chap and brought her outside—am I bound to answer these questions?—the man is not here but he is in custody in Newgate—he told me that he had been led into frauds by you, and it was only by getting you given in custody that he could escape from you—I watched him into Charles Street, Knightsbridge—he took me there in order that he might escape from you; his motive was to get you apprehended that he might escape from your toils—I had not arranged with him that your wife might be decoyed from home that I might gain possession of the papers—I told him to come to you and tell you that the detectives were after you—Ringer has not absconded from his bail, I saw him yesterday afternoon—I shall not say whether the little carrotty man was Frank Hall—I rang the bell and he opened the door—I had to pretend that I was a friend of yours before I could get the door open—I did not then rush upstairs, I spoke to him, and he at once admitted it, and said that you had let him into it—I found nothing in your possession connected with any firm, except one paying-in book of the Provident Bank—it is not possible that I wrongly heard what took place, because he repeated it several times, and sat down and cried till he was nearly broken hearted—there was a long conversation, I was there half an hour—when I had finished my evidence at Bow Street, Houghton said something, and I believe he denied what I had said—he said that you were the means of preventing his getting an honest living—I did not put Ford in the box because Mr. Vaughan stopped the case and said that his time was engaged; and it was not for me to put witnesses into the box—Mr. Wontner had charge of the case.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLE</hi>. I have been two years and a half making inquiries about other frauds in different parts of the country, and I know a great deal about them—I never saw any writing of Houghton's except in a copy book at his lodgings, in which he was learning to write—his writing is very imperfect, he is a most illiterate man—I found a lot of bill heads and memoranda and all kinds of writing, but I do not think I ever saw any of Houghton's writing—we had some conversation at the door, and I told him I must go up and search the place; he said "I am very sorry for it, my name is Houghton, I took the shop for Humphries, I was paid to do it"—he also said that he had been led into it by <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> Humphries, who was the prime mover—Houghton had been in the employment of Messrs. Butterfield and Co., Goswell Street, bonnet shape makers, up to that day, and they knew him very well—he has, I believe, been some years with them—I also find</p>

               <p>that he was at Hardings', a bonnet shop, but I do not know how long—I know that Houghton and his wife kept a beer-house for several months, they left it in September—when a person goes into a beer-house, the police make enquiries as to his character—he has to give his address and a reference where he has been working, and I believe in the case of trans<lb></lb>ferring a license to another person the Inspector at the Sessions would make his report as to the character of the man—Houghton has lived in that district almost all his life, but I do not know how many addresses he had.</p>

I was examined at Bow Street on 21st March—I was sent to watch the premises by my inspector—I know it was 12th January, because I made a note of it—I have seen goods displayed and people going in and out to buy them—the place was under my observation very nearly a month.</p>

I was present when Rock searched Hum<lb></lb>phries' lodging in Charlotte Street, where he lived in the name of Perry, and saw everything found—I saw a die there and found these impressions from it and a stamping machine—this order bears the impression of the same die; it is in Humphries' writing and is signed J. Robinson—these letters in Johnson's case, signed Robinson, are in Humphries' writing—this other is in the same writing, and it is the same on eighteen different others which I have in my pocket now.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. John Street, and am agent for those premises—I let No. 21, St. John Street, to the prisoner Houghton—he gave me the name of Robinson, and I think he said J. Robinson—the rent was 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he took them about three weeks before Christmas and had his name painted up in very large letters—he said that he wanted to open it in the general line, poultry and game—he paid the rent and brought it himself—no one slept there until the female prisoner came four or five weeks afterwards—she told me her name was Robinson and she had come at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week to conduct the business—up to that time there was nothing to sell—I received fifty-three letters in a fortnight from Scotland, Ireland, and dif<lb></lb>ferent parts, addressed "J. Robinson, Esq.," "J. Robinson, poulterer," "J. Robinson, salesman," and so forth—lots of ducks, geese, and rabbits came, two tremendous pigs and a smaller one, but no boiler—the goods remained three or four hours and then went somewhere else to be sold—I did not see Houghton there superintending the business; the saleswoman said that she was thereto receive the goods sent—I saw no one else on the premises—I asked her to give up possession after owing four weeks' rent and borrowing 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of my wife, which she has never received—when I found out that it was the long firm, I got some paint and painted the name out—the salewoman's bedroom was a very large hamper and she packed herself in it <hi rend="italic">every</hi> night—when I asked her to give up possession she said that she had had advice and asked me to give her money to go out—I said that I should consult a very old friend of mine, and so I did; it was a screw driver, and I took tie lock off the shop door—when she found that she said "I won't give you any more trouble, you and your good <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> have been so kind to me, if will allow me to sell these flats and to sleep here to night—I told her she ouble to find a customer for the <hi rend="italic">flats</hi> for nobody would be <hi rend="italic">flat</hi> enough to buy them, but she got 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—a flat is a hamper—the owners' names were on them—a porter came one night and wanted to be paid for them—after they left, goods still came to the premises and I sent them back to the railway—she used to treat me to a good deal of music; she was as happy as a pigeon <hi rend="italic">muck;</hi> she used to lay in that flat and sing herself to sleep, and I used to say "Happy be thy dreams."</p>

               <p>—I never saw Houghton take away any of the goods, they vanished—he came to me a fortnight after last Christmas—I am quite certain that he said his name was Robinson, not that he took them for Mr. Robinson—the rent was paid by him the first two or three times—he used to send another young man when he did not come himself and that young man came three times—he was quite a young man and he said that he came from Mr. Robinson—I did not hear Houghton give the orders for the name to be painted up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of Neyland, South Wales—at the end of last December I received a memorandum from J. Robinson on a printed heading, inquiring at what prices I would supply meat, his address was 21, St. John Stroet, Metropolitan Meat Market, and Adelphi House, 25, Strand—I answered it and got another letter, and on 11th January I got a telegram and this letter. "Please consign, as early as possible, to my ware-house 21, St. John Street, five porkers and two fat hogs as samples at prices quoted. If satisfactory, will take regular supplies: and invoice with them. Will remit amount when dispatched." I sent four porkers and two large hogs, and a day or two afterwards I received this telegram. "Labels by to-night's post. Send me the porkers and five fat hogs if you can get them cheap next week;" but I did not send anything more than I have mentioned, the value of that was 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it was by the Great Western Railway, and I sent an invoice with the prices by post—I afterwards received by post a draft for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at six days; I took it to my bankers to have it put to my credit, but they would not accept it, and it was returned—I then wrote to ask for a respectable banker's cheque, but did not get it or anything in the shape of money—I had ordered some sheep on the strength of this order and had engaged to supply them on the faith of these telegrams—I supplied these pigs because Mr. J. Robinson represented himself as a salesman in the Metro<lb></lb>politan Meat Market, and knowing that the gentlemen there were respect<lb></lb>able I thought he was an honest man.</p>

            , he brought it to be mended; after I missed it I could not recollect where it was; about a week after Mr. Galaway came for it; we had, as usual, given him a note upon the delivery, which he brought with him; from that I took the name and number upon a piece of paper, and searched the shop all over, and could not find it; about three or four days after we advertised the name and number, &amp;c. Mr. Tombs, the constable of St. Margaret's Westminster, sent us word we might see it if we came to him, he had advertised the watch before; my father and I went and swore to the watch; the constable asked me if I thought I should know the man; I said I should; we went to the Gatehouse, and from amongst a number of people I pitched upon him directly, I am certain of him. The watch produced in court and sworn to.</p>

The prisoner used to come to my house; he came on the 11th of last month and was offering to pawn this watch in the neighbourhood; I bought it of him for 30 s. when he was taken up for a thing in the neighbourhood the people asked him how he came by his clothes; he said he sold his watch and bought them with the money; then I advertised the watch at my own cost; after that I saw Mr. Stevens's advertisement.</p>

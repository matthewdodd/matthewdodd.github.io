             sworn.</p>
               <p>Last Sunday se'nnight, at half after five o'clock in the afternoon, I was upon London-Bridge looking at the waterworks; there had been a fire there. I came out of the country. I was looking at the wheels as they went round, and one Jones, who sells goods about the country, whom I had seen at my brother's who keeps a publick-house at Marlborough in Wiltshire, came up to me, and said he hoped my brother in the country was well. We went together into the Borough and drank two pints of beer at one publick-house, and one at another. We staid in the Borough till about nine o'clock. He asked me which way I was going; I said into the city, I lodged in the city. He said so did he. We went together, and he took me to the prisoner's in <placeName id="t17800223-16-crimeloc87">Turnagain-lane, Fleet-market</placeName>

               <p>A publick-house? - No, it is a private house; that was about a quarter after nine. The prisoner was in the room dressed in deep mourning. We supped there; in discourse at supper, the prisoner said she lived servant ten years in Hatton-garden, and went every night to lay out the supper.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - About half an hour. While Jones's wife was putting away the supper Jones shammed to be asleep.</p>
               <p>Was Jones's wife there? - There was a woman who passed for his wife. I stood up and the Prisoner came and stood by me, and unbuttoned both the buttons of my breeches, and took my purse out. I found my breeches unbuttoned, I buttoned them, and said, ma'am, what are you doing. I felt in my pocket and missed my purse. She immediately started down stairs, and I pursued her.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober at this time? - As sober as I am now, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>When you missed your purse did you say any thing? - As soon as I missed my purse she flew down stairs; I had no time to say any thing; I pursued her down stairs into a room; she made at my breeches again, and put the purse into my pocket and immediately ran out; the gold was in one end and the silver in the other. I found my gold was lightened. I followed her to the Magpie in Newgate-street. She slipped into that house; there is a glass door. I stopped half a minute or a second and looked through to see if she gave the money to any body. I thought perhaps she would give the money at the bar, or to some acquaintance. Not seeing her give it to any body, I went in and saw a good many russian kind of people; I knew nothing of the people or of the house; she called for two glasses of shrub, I drank one with her and she drank the other.</p>

               <p>How long did she stay there? - Not above two or three minutes, no longer than while we drank the stuff; when we came out again the watch was just set, it was ten o'clock. I met a watchman and charged him with her.</p>
               <p>Did you charge her at all with any thing while you were in the publick-house in Newgate-street? - No.</p>
               <p>Why did you not? - There were many kind of russian-men; I did not know whether they were my friends or no; I was afraid I might have my brains knocked out; I thought when I came out the watch would be set, and I would charge the watch with her. She was taken to the watch-house. She delivered a guinea to the high constable, and told him that was all she had about her. She was searched, and there was nothing more found upon her.</p>
               <p>She did not say that was your guinea? - No, she did not. I examined my purse in the watch-house, and found I had lost ten guineas, a half crown, and three shillings.</p>
               <p>What money had you in your purse before you went into this house? - Twenty-two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230030"></xptr>guineas, eleven shillings and sixpence. I counted my money in the morning as I got out of bed.</p>
               <p>How often had you had your purse out during that day? - I had my purse out twice.</p>
               <p>You took it out to pay something? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you pay away some of it then? - Not of that money. I paid away one shilling and four-pence in the Borough. I paid two-pence at one publick-house; we went over to the King's-Bench, there I paid for a shilling's worth of punch and twopence.</p>
               <p>Was your purse tied up? - Yes, and the money was safe in it at the King's Bench.</p>
               <p>Had you counted the money any time in the day after the morning? - No.</p>
               <p>How do you know the money was all in the purse then? - Because I did not miss any. I was very sober. I never get drunk, and indeed I had a cold and could not drink. I drank but little of the liquor that was called for.</p>
               <p>How long was you in the house before Jones pretended to be asleep? - As soon as the supper was over.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing to you when she unbuttoned your breeches and took the purse - in what manner did she do it? - She pretended to give me a kiss. She gave me a good tug when she undid my breeches. The button hole of the pocket was broke; they were very roomy breeches, made two years ago when they wore them very large; macaroni breeches I believe they call them. She was not very softly about it; she almost pulled my breeches off. She was very impudent in doing it.</p>
               <p>When you went down stairs, you say, she came to you again? - Yes, in the same manner, to undo my breeches; and made a pretence to kiss me again, and said Hum, and put the purse into my pocket.</p>
               <p>You pursued her directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever lose sight of her? - No; only while she turned into the room below stairs. I followed her into the room immediately; she had time enough to conceal the money.</p>
               <p>Was the purse tied or untied when she put it into your pocket again? - Untied.</p>
               <p>Did you know Jones before? - I had seen him at my brother's house at Marlborough; he is run away; I have never been able to hear of him since. I took up the other woman, she was discharged before the sitting alderman; I have not been able to find her since. When the prisoner was examined before the alderman, she denied ever being with me; she said I knocked her down in Newgate-street, and attempted to take her cloak away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He told the alderman that I picked him up in the street, and took him home to supper. - It is all false.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A serjeant. I was employed on the recruiting service at this time. The twenty pounds was the the colonel's money.</p>
               <p>How much was left in the purse? - Twelve guineas and six shillings.</p>

               <p>I was constable of the night; the prisoner was brought into the watch-house. I was going to search her; she said she had only a guinea, and produced it. We took her into a private room, and searched her, but found no more money upon her. She denied being along with Mr. Bailey; she said Bailey seised her in Newgate-street; that he catched her by the back part of her cloak and struck her, and used her very ill.</p>
               <p>Was you present when she was examined before the alderman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he give the same account he has now? - Yes, as far as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Whether he said he was taken by Jones to the prisoner's house, or that the prisoner picked him up in the street? - Exactly the same as he has described to you, my lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether he did not say he was robbed in a house in Fleet-lane or Field-lane? - Mr. Bailey was not certain to the street; he thought it must be Fleet-lane, but the next morning he found out the house.</p>

               <p>I never saw the man in my life till he met me in Newgate-street; he asked me to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230031"></xptr>to a bagnio; I would not go; then he said I should go in and drink with him; we went in and drank; when we came out he asked me again to go to a bagnio. I would not; then he said I was the person who had robbed him; that he had been robbed in Fleet-lane, and he charged the watch with me. I told the constable in the watch-house that I had but a guinea.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, upon your oath, between the examination and this time, and during the time that you have been here, have not the constables told you so - A. No, Sir, they never told me any thing about it, nor no one told me any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Where have you lived since the robbery - A. At Mr. Bray's, in Bartholomew-square.</p>
               <p>Q. At whose expence is this prosecution carrying on - A. I do not know; I cannot pay it, I am quite certain I know the men</p>
               <p>- LLOYD. I am an engine maker, I work for Mr. Harland, in Fenchurch-street. On the 3rd of September last, I was passing by Bartholomew square, I was going to St. Martin le-grand, I heard a lady, within a few yards of me, scream violently; she said, stop thief. I turned round and saw the prisoner, Trueman, run away from her; at the time that I first saw the prisoner running, I might be the distance from the prisoner to the other side of the court. He was running towards Smithfield: he ran from Bartholomew-square to the corner of Hosier-lane. It was a dark place and no lamps lit; he observed two or three people coming up, I was close to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever out of your sight - A. Never. At the corner of Hosier-lane he saw two or three people coming up, he turned and went towards the George-inn. At the time that he was at the corner of Hosier-lane, he threw the watch down Hosier-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the George-inn - A. The George Inn is about the middle way in Smithfield. At the corner of Hosier-lane, he seemed to throw something out of his hand, and it seemed to me to be a watch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you think at the time that it was a watch - A. Yes. I pursued him exactly to the George Inn, he made a stop as if he had been shot. I immediately ran up against him, and collared him, and said, he was the person that committed the robbery; the prisoner, Trueman, said, he was not the person; I made answer, and said, he was. I took him in custody by the collar. When I had him five minutes in my custody, the lady came up, she said, that is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>COURT. You mean the young woman that gave her evidence - A. Yes. I then told him he must go with me into the public-house, the George Inn. I immediately took him into the George Inn, he went quietly with me.</p>

               <p>Q. When she accused him of being the person that robbed her, did he say any thing - A. He made no answer. When I got into the George, I took him by the side of the fire, I had hold of his collar, I had him about five minutes there; when the lady came in, and said, you are the man that robbed me; he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the young woman repeated it that he was the man - A. Yes. I still kept hold of him; in a few minutes, a person came in, and said, is the lady here, has she lost any thing; I said, yes; she said, I am here, I have lost my watch. He immediately made answer, make yourself easy, here is a person here that has got your watch; he produced the watch with half the chain, the chain was broke in two; half of the chain was hanging to the watch the other part was lost. They then said, they would find the rest, probably, if they took a candle and lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it found - A. Yes, by a little girl, and it was produced; they might be the best part of half an hour gone. I insisted upon going for a constable; there were several people came up to me and said d - n your eyes, let him go, the lady has got her watch, what does she want more. I immediately said, I will not let him go until he was secured; then Finnagin came up and said, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310035"></xptr>will not deliver the watch up until I deliver it up to a magistrate, or into the officer's hands. Griffin, the constable, came and said, you will assist me to take him to the Poultry Compter. Griffin and I went to take him to the Poultry Compter. When we came to the corner of Hosier-lane, the prisoner said, what do you hold me by the collar for. I said, to make secure of you; and immediately I said the word he, the prisoner, kick'd my heels up, and slipped upon me, and the officer on the prisoner. There was a party pulled the officer away, and I held the prisoner by his legs. I arose up as soon as I could, and then I found one or two that came to my assistance; the prisoner did not effect his escape. I was no sooner up than I was knocked down on the same spot, and dragged twenty or thirty yards to the pens.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that by the prisoner - A. By the prisoner and fifteen or sixteen that there were in the gang. I then got up again, and dragged the prisoner towards Mr. Gent's, a public-house. I desired Mr. Gent to let me in; he said he would let no thieves be brought in there, and shut the door. I was then dragged into the pens. I had still hold of the prisoner. When I was standing at Mr. Gent's door, a party came up and said, d - n your eyes, cut his coat, and let him slip away. At that time I had hold of his coat and waistcoat; they cut his coat round and said, d - n your eyes, cut his bloody arm off and hamstring him. I let go then and fell down, and got hold of him by the thighs; they then immediately dragged me into the pens again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the constable still assisting you - A. Yes; and when I got up again which was in about ten minutes; I found one of the constable wrestling for a stick; I had still hold of him; the prisoner said to the constable, d - n your eyes, let go the stick; the constable said, I will not. When there was a cry of hamstring them, the constable gave a wrench and got the stick out of the prisoner's hands. I then began to drag the prisoner towards the folding gates of the George public-house; there were more collected together; then the number of the gang had increased, with knives drawn and sticks, and they said, throw him over. When I got to the gate, I heard a voice say, throw him backwards, or throw him over. When I turned round, I saw a man stand at a small wicket door; I then took and threw the prisoner's heels up, threw him in there, and fell upon him; somebody cried out, you will break my leg; I said never mind your leg, shut the door. I took him into the public-house, and Griffin the constable came in; I said you must have this man more secure if we take him another time. Griffin got a cord and tied his arms behind him. There was a person came up, and asked the prisoner to have a glass of ale; that person is not taken; I saw him from first to last attempting to rescue him; he said, where does your mother live; he told him; he said he would go and let his mother know; the landlord said, I will let your mother know. We got a coach, and four constables were procured; we got him into the coach, I never let him go, and when we got out of the yard they gave a great shout, and just as we got out of the yard, some one cried out, damn you, stick true, we will have him yet. The coach was brought within the great gate down to the lower part of the public-house; this took place after the coach go through the gates; we proceeded to about the middle of Smithfield; I had hold of the prisoner by the collar in the coach, the coach doors were forced open; I received four or five blows here between my neck and right shoulder by a stick; I then said to some of the constables, give me a stick that I might defend myself; he got it back again in half a minute; I held the coach door by the tassel; the coach stopped all of a sudden; I learned that they cut the reins; the coachman proceeded as far as Newgate-street; I told the coachman if he did not go on, we would blow his brains out; we had no fire-arms. When we got into Newgate-street, the coachman got off his box and went to ride his horses; when he went to ride his horses he found the traces were out; he drove about five yards; when the coach came down altogether; the main braces of the springs had been cut; the constables all then jumped out, excepting me and Griffin, and the prisoner, leaving the prisoner in my care and Griffin; in the course of six or seven minutes, Bray came up; he said, Oh, they have broke my arm; and I am cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Bray one of the persons who were assisting you in conveying the prisoner - A. Yes; immediately Griffin jumped out of the coach the prisoner and me were left alone; there were a number of coaches passed; they would not stop and take the prisoner in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this gang about you - A. Yes, some of them who had been assisting us had gone off to the Poultry Compter; when they returned Stanton came with a brace of pistols. I still keeping hold of the prisoner, the prisoner began to cry, when Stanton came up to the coach-door. He had not been there above a minute; the man who had given, the prisoner a glass came up; I immediately said to Stanton, that is the man that attempted to rescue him; drive him away; Stanton immediately put a pistol to him and said, if he did not go away, he would blow his brains out. I handed the prisoner out of that coach into another, with two or three more officers with me. We were obliged to turn and take him into Giltspur-street Compter. The gang at that time had encreased to the amount of thirty; one of the knives they threw up against a tradesman's window in Newgate-street. It was about half past nine when we got to Giltspur-street Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the time that you left the George - A. About eight o'clock; it was about an hour and an half before we got him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the prisoner is the man that ran from the prosecutrix to Hosier-lane - A. I am positive of it. When he had got hold of the officer's stick, he struck me, and said, d - n your eyes, let me go; he broke my nose, and gave me two black eyes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The first you heard was the cry of stop thief - A. The first I heard was a scream, and then stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the lamps lit - A. The day-light was sufficient to see the features of any man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Are you sure from the first to the last that he was the same person - A. Yes.</p>

I was coming up Hosier-lane within a few yards of Smithfield, I felt something strike my leg, I picked it up, it was a watch without the outside case; it had part of the chain; I put it in my breeches pocket, and kept my hand upon it. When I got into Smithfield I asked what was the matter, they said a lady had been robbed. I went into the George.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it at last - A. I gave it to the peace-officer, his name is Griffin.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect this night the robbery happened - A. Yes. I went with the person that came for me to the George, I found a number of people about the door, I asked where the prisoner was, Lloyd had him in custody, he had got hold of his collar; I told him I was an officer; I requested the name of the person that kept hold of the prisoner, and the lady that lost the watch, and the person that found the watch; they gave me their names; I told the prisoner if he would go quietly I would neither tie him nor handcuff him; the prisoner said he was innocent, he would go quietly; I told Lloyd to aid and assist me in taking the prisoner to the Compter. On my looking round the room I saw Bray near the door, I said, Bray, assist me with this prisoner; he gave me his assistance. We came out with the prisoner, and a great number of people after him.</p>
               <p>Q. You were with the last witness Lloyd, you have heard the account that Lloyd has given of the attempt to rescue the prisoner, is that the truth - A. It is exactly the truth, but he has not mentioned when I was thrown across some hurdles. Here is the watch, here is the coat of the prisoner's that was cut, and here is one of the knives. This knife was knocked out of some persons hand, that were engaged in this affray I have every reason to believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How many knives do you suppose you saw drawn in the attempt to rescue this prisoner - A. Seven or eight drawn knives. This is the watch that I received from Finnagin, this is the side of the coat that Lloyd had hold of; it is Trueman's coat, they cut it, and he slipped out of it. We at last secured him, after undergoing this violence.</p>

            . I am a box-carrier to Bartholomew Hospital. The prosecutrix has been under my protection because of the gang coming about her house. I was in Bartholomew Hospital about half after six, I heard the cry of stop thief; I run; I saw the prisoner Trueman run; he was running, to go across Smithfield, I pursued him, and was very near to him when one of the gang knocked me down, just by Hosier-lane; when I was within two or three yards I was knocked down; I got up again; while I was down several of the gang tumbled over me, picked my pocket, and turned both of my pockets inside out. I went to the house where they dragged the prisoner, in the George. At the George a coach was sent for, I assisted Griffin in the first attempt to get him into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have heard the violence that Lloyd has described to endeavour so rescue this man - A. It is true, and it was me that was cut; I stated that my arm was broke; I received a violent blow on my arm by a stick while I was in the coach, and my fingers were cut by a knife.</p>
               <p>COURT. How many knives do you think you saw drawn - A. There were a great many, I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think there were so many as twenty - A. I dare say there was, and a great numbers of sticks, which appeared to be broken from the hurdles in Smithfield. On our coming to the Compter the prisoner Trueman, when he had got Griffin across the hurdles, he said d - n your eyes, hamstring the b - s. They had got Griffin across the hurdles, trying to wrench the stick out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there persons with knives drawn at the time - A. Yes; I knocked two of them down with the stick that I had in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the opportunity of seeing any person besides the prisoner Trueman - A. There were two of them had been patients in the hospital, but as soon as they saw me they withdrew.</p>
               <p>COURT. If you ever see those persons that drew their knives, do your best endeavours to have them taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Did you see Holbrook that evening - A. I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. The next day you were before the sitting aldermen - A. I was, I was outside of the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing the other prisoner there - A. I do, he was standing among the concourse of people that came up with the prisoner; there were several in fustian jackets, I believe they were of the gang, and there was a nudge made at the elbow, one among the other, immediately one in a fustian jacket came up and asked if I was not the young man that was cut on the Sunday night; I said no, I was waiting for a letter for the hospital; I turned-round and immediately saw the young man that was assisting me on the Sunday evening, his name is Huggins; he said, that is the young man that struck me; Holbrook walked down Blackwell-hall, I followed him and took him by the collar, one of the officers came up immediately to my assistance, and brought him into the office.</p>

Yes, Jackson sent for me, I directly went, When I came there I found Trueman in custody, I saw Holbrook there, I am quite certain I saw him there; I received a violent blow from Holbrook; I was aiding and assisting the officer to get Trueman into the George Inn gateway, just before the coach was sent for.</p>

               <p>Q. Then your attention was entirely taken up by holding of Trueman - A. It was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any thing more of Holbrook that night - A. Not that night.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning you were at Guildhall - A. Yes; I saw Holbrook there, he was standing in the crowd along with some more, there were six or seven together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether either of these persons he was standing with were any of the persons that were attempting to rescue Trueman - A. I cannot say, he was conversing with these persons; as soon as Mr. Bray saw him he said he believed that is the young man that attempted to rescue Trueman away; Bray said that to me; I knew him when he was pointed out by Bray directly; I have no doubt but he is the person: I am convinced that he was one of the persons; I had no doubt then.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of some information this night you went to Smithfield - A. Yes, I did, a little after eight; I took a brace of pistols with me; I run as fast as I could towards Smithfield, when I got down Newgate-street, about half way, I saw a coach surrounded by a mob; when I got to the coach there were some that knew me, they said, stop him; I took no heed of that, I pulled out my pistols, I put them on the half cock; some one tried to stop me, I said, if any one of you try to stop me; I will blow your brains out; I got towards the coach door, they were fighting with sticks; they were striking at the coach with sticks, trying to rescue him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of knowing them that were around - A. No; when I got to the coach door there was one of them pointed out to me; I told him if he did not go away I would fire at him; I told them that were in the coach not to fear, I would lose my life before they should rescue him; they tried to shove me under the coach, I put my back against the coach and said, the first that comes I will shoot him.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the state of the coach when you came up at first - A. It was cut down, the body was hanging on the axle tree. I spoke to the coaches that came past, they would not take him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the traces of the horses cut - A. Yes, they could not go on any farther.</p>
               <p>COURT. And this in the very heart of the city - A. Yes, just by Warwick-lane. When I looked in the coach window I knew him, I said, it is you! When the coach came up that I got to stop, the prisoner said, I will come out with you; I got him into the coach. After we got him into Giltspur-street Compter Griffin said to me, there is a man that you turned away that gave him some ale, I should like to have that man, he is gone to his mother's. We went to this Trueman's mother that lives in Long-lane; I was on one side of the way and Griffin was going to knock at the door; it is very near the corner of the timber-yard; I was along with Huggins, Griffin was on the other side of the way, I saw three of them together, I saw a person exactly of the size of Holbrook; he was beating his his coat as if he had fell down in the dirt; he said d - n his eyes, if it had not been for that b - r at the Compter, we should have had him away.</p>

            . Q. Are you the coachman of the Harwich coach - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drive that coach up to London on the evening of the 23d of September - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the other side of Rumford to London did you take up a young man to bring him up to town - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner Holbrook, and tell me whether you believe he is the man - A. I have no doubt in the world. I arrived at the Spread Eagle Gracechurch-street, a quarter past nine in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that were you brought up before the sitting Alderman - A. On Tuesday evening, when I came in, I saw a requisition for me to go before the sitting Alderman; on Wednesday morning I went, I did not see the prisoner before the Alderman. That was the next Wednesday after I drove the prisoner to London.</p>
               <p>Q. When you so saw him before the sitting Alderman did you call to your mind any circumstance in the course of your journey, and so on, calling to your mind the conversation that passed on the coach which he related before the Alderman - A. It was dusk when he got on.</p>
               <p>Q. He related the conversation, which convinced you that he was the person - A. Yes, he related every word that was mentioned on the coach from the time he got on till he came off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for him to mention that without his being the person you brought up - A. I think it is impossible. I took him up, about half after six o'clock, at the fourteen mile stone. I have no recollection of his person.</p>
               <p>Holbrook called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

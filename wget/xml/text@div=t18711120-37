                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, living in Grundy Street, Bromley—on the night of 22nd October, about 12.30, I was in the Com<lb></lb>mercial Road—I heard cries of "Father! Mother! Murder!"—I ran across and saw a little girl running; and the deceased walking behind her towards a coffee-stall which he, the prisoner, keeps—the prisoner came into the middle of the road and met him, and said "Have you been insulting my daughter?"He said "I did not," And with that the prisoner knocked him down and hit him while on the ground, and kicked him about the neck or face; the deceased fell on the stone tramway—whether his head fell on the stones or not I can't say—the prisoner struck him five or six times with his right fist while he was down—he did not kick him more than once, to my knowledge—I never saw the deceased move afterwards—I went and fetched a doctor, and he was taken to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It all occurred in two or three minutes—he was down and the blows were rapidly struck afterwards—I had not been in five different public-houses that night—I would not say whether it was three or four—had not been turned out of any—there was a little disturbance at one and we were cleared out—I don't think the place where the deceased fell was forty-five yards from any lamp—it was not very dark, it was betwixt and between—I mentioned the kick when I was first examined, but it was not put down—I said the constable must have seen it if he had been looking—Henry Walker was with me at the time—a woman struck the deceased and she was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had heard the child cry out twice—she seemed excited, and in great distress—not two minutes elapsed from the last cry till I had my hand on the prisoner—I had just left his stall, and was close to him—I only saw him strike once or twice with his fist—I saw no kicking—I think I should have seen, if there had been any, if I had been looking—I did not actually see them fall—I was about 20 or 30 yards off.</p>

Mother?"—I turned back, and saw the deceased following the child across the road—the prisoner came up—the child, I suppose, made some complaint to him, and he said "Is this the man—she said "Yes, father," And thereupon the prisoner knocked him down, and struck him several times; four, five, or six times—I did not see him do anything besides strike bun—I saw a woman strike him, and kick him in the back—it was a very slight kick; it would hardly leave a mark—the constable turned on his bull's-eye, and the man appeared nearly dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 2, Victoria Place—I was called to where the man was lying on the pavement—he was to all appearance dead—I noticed a wound on the right temple, a swelling, from which blood was flowing over the face, and beard, and mouth—he seemed to have left off breathing, but there was a pulse; so, hoping to save his life, I went with him to the hospital, in a cab, and handed him over to the surgeon there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—the deceased was admitted there on the night in question—he was dead when he arrived there—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there was a small laceration on the bridge of the nose, an extensive bruising over the right eye-brow, and two lacerated wounds in the middle of the bruise—those were the only external signs of violence I could find—on opening the head I found effusion of blood at the base of the brain, and in the ventricles—all the other organs were healthy, except the left pleura, which showed signs of previous disease—the wounds and bruises were such as might have been caused by blows with a fist, and a kick—either of the wounds might have been done by a kick or a blow—the effusion of blood on the brain was the cause of death—I believe that was the result of violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> All the external signs were slight—I did not come to the conclusion that there was a kick—all I saw was consistent with two blows from a fist—I could find no evidence of his having been drinking—the effusion was recent, I should say within forty-eight hours—I could not put it nearer than that—it might have arisen from a fall.</p>

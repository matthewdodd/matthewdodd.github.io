On the 19th of June I was on my road to London—I called at the White Lion, Lock's-bottom, in the afternoon, about one o'clock—I stopped there to dine, and balanced my cash there—I had Bank-notes, and gold and silver—I rolled the Bank-notes up carefully together, and tied them with red tape—there were several £20. £10. and £5. notes, amounting to £340.—I secured them, and placed them in my left-hand trowsers pocket—the button was off, and I put pin to the pocket—I had gold and silver in a bag, in my right-hand pocket—I left Lock's-bottom about half-past eight o'clock—I got to Bromley about nine o'clock—I left there at half-past nine o'clock—I got to the Black Horse and Harrow at Rushy-green, at a quarter to ten o'clock—Is</p>

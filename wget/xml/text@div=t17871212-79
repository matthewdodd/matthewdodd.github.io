            ; are you? - Yes, Sir, I am.</p>
               <p>You keep a rag shop? - Yes Sir, I do.</p>
               <p>You know this man by sight? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Just know him by sight; never no acquaintance with him? - None at at all, never.</p>
               <p>You told my Lord he was a constable? - Yes, Sir, he is.</p>
               <p>Now how often, upon your oath, has he searched your house for stolen goods? - That was the third time, but I never had any acquaintance with him at all.</p>
               <p>How long is it since he found all the saddles and the seats of the sedan chairs at your house? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Not in the Plant? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did not he himself find out the Plant in which you kept the two new saddles, and twenty-seven sedan chair seats; he never found these at your house in his life? - Never at my house in this world.</p>
               <p>Never in your house; where did he find them? - No, he did not in my house; is there any body here to prove it?</p>
               <p>Whose property were they? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>In whose custody were they when he found them? - In Mrs. Young's.</p>
               <p>Honest Mrs. Young! How far was Mrs. Young's house from yours? - Mrs. Young lived in Peter-street; I knew her very well.</p>
               <p>You had nothing to do with these things? - No.</p>
               <p>That you swear? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot ask this woman whether she received stolen goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, Mrs. Cottrell, had you nothing to do with them? - I never had.</p>
               <p>You knew nothing of them? - I knew nothing of what she had got in her place.</p>
               <p>How lately before this had he searched your house for stolen goods? - May be two years agone.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that he had not searched your house for two years? - I cannot justly say when it was.</p>
               <p>Was it a year? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it six months? - It is last summer was twelve months when he searched it last.</p>
               <p>Is your husband here to night? - He has been in the hospital these eight weeks.</p>
               <p>He is very ill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Very ill since the business of the cart; don't you know he is indicted for stealing a cart? - What my husband does I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Your husband is indicted for stealing a cart? - I do not know that he is.</p>
               <p>You never heard he was indicted for stealing a cart? - He is in the hospital.</p>
               <p>What hospital? - In the Borough.</p>
               <p>In St. Thomas's hospital? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That you swear? - He was there.</p>
               <p>When was he there upon your oath? - I have nothing to divulge about my husband.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath when was he there? - Last Sunday.</p>
               <p>You saw him there last Sunday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120097"></xptr>Do you mean to swear that? - I seed him on the outside.</p>
               <p>When did you see him last in St. Thomas's hospital? - Last Sunday, I saw him on the outside of the gate.</p>
               <p>Was he at that time a patient in St. Thomas's hospital, upon your oath? - Yes Sir, I believe it is St. Thomas's Hospital; it is in the Borough.</p>
               <p>Will you swear he was in any hospital last Sunday? - I will swear it; I will swear he is very ill.</p>
               <p>Was he a patient on last Sunday in any hospital in the Borough? - Yes Sir, he was.</p>
               <p>That you swear? - I swear I feed him there.</p>
               <p>Will you swear, that last Sunday he was a patient in any hospital in the Borough; give me an answer, yes or no? - I am but a foolish woman; he is there; he may be there now for what I know.</p>
               <p>When did you see him last a patient in any hospital in the Borough? - Last Sunday.</p>
               <p>Am I to take that so? - He was there last Sunday.</p>
               <p>Did you see him there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In an hospital in the Borough? - Yes, I did see him in the hospital; he does belong to the hospital; he has belonged to it some time.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you, last Sunday, see your husband in any hospital in the Borough? - I spoke to him at the gate.</p>
               <p>Was he in the hospital? - Yes; I dont know whether he may be there now.</p>
               <p>Court. It is easily known; it is a fact that will appear by the books of the hospital; and I tell you fairly that is a fact of a kind, which, if not true, you can be convicted for perjury on: therefore did you, or did you not see your husband in any hospital, in any of those hospitals as a patient last Sunday? - I spoke to him at the outside of the gate last Sunday.</p>
               <p>When did you see him in the hospital last? - I can't justly say when it was.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - It may be a month or two.</p>
               <p>Is it a month? - It is more than a month.</p>
               <p>In one of the wards of the hospital? - In the hospital I saw him.</p>
               <p>Was he in one of the wards of the hospital? - I saw him walking on the outside.</p>
               <p>When did you see him in the hospital, within the gate of the hospital? - I always send my girl to him.</p>
               <p>When did you see him last in the hospital? - I can't justly say when it was.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him in any hospital? - I have seen him in the hospital.</p>
               <p>In what part of it? - I can't justly say.</p>
               <p>Was it in the wards of the hospital? - It was in the yard.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that he was a patient there? - He was a patient for any thing that I know.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that you believe he lodged in the hospital at any time during the last month? - I don't know, I can't tell; I saw him and spoke to him; he is not with me, I can't say how long it is since he left me; it is more than two months.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, don't you know where he has lodged for the last two months? - He was at work at Brentwood.</p>
               <p>What is his complaint? - A spotted fever.</p>
               <p>Did you see him in the hospital when he had the spotted fever? - He was at Brentwood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At the time the things were stolen, this man came to search the house? - What things, Sir?</p>
               <p>The things for which he is indicted; he was searching the house for stolen goods? - Yes Sir.</p>
               <p>How many pair of sheets with the names taken out, did he find at the time; that choaks you; I don't wonder at it? - Did you speak to me?</p>
               <p>It is my luck to speak to some of the greatest rogues in the kingdom? - I mean to swear that he found no sheets in my place, with the marks picked out.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, recollect, Mr. Mason and Mr. Pasan were both present, and can convict you of perjury; upon your oath, how many odd sheets did they find with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120098"></xptr>marks picked out? - They never could find any; I am certain they never could find any, for the pair I lost was not marked.</p>
               <p>Never was marked at all? - They never had been.</p>

               <p>How many had you with the marks cut out? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Now, Mrs. Cottrell, to come nearer home; how long is it since you were indicted last; (No Answer.) that I should think you must remember? - I can't justly say that.</p>
               <p>Take your own time and tell me? - I was indicted; it is pretty nigh two years; it may be between a year and a half, and two years.</p>
               <p>Where was that little mistake? - At Guildhall, Westminster.</p>
               <p>There you contrived to buy them off, and left your neighbourhood? - Buy what off?</p>
               <p>I must not ask you any more about that; my Lord will stop me if I do; you was tried though? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was for no good, of course; did you keep a rag-shop then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And have kept it ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You went to make a complaint to Mr. Parker, the Justice, of this man's robbing you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he heard your story? - Yes, he heard my story so far, that be only bantered and abused me.</p>
               <p>And refused you a warrant? - I never asked for a warrant.</p>
               <p>He did not give you one? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>When I came in, I saw people in the house.</p>
               <p>Who? - Mr. Percival; the child told me there was some people in the house.</p>
               <p>Did you see yourself who they were? - I went up to dinner, I went down afterwards, and saw Mr. Percival getting in at the window of her bed-room; he got up by the help of a linen horse from the ground.</p>
               <p>That was after you had dined? - No, Sir, I had not dined, I was gone down to fetch some water, and I saw him getting up on the horse, and getting in at the window; I asked the child for the key, I opened the door, and I saw Mr. Percival by the side of the fire place, and I saw him take from the saucer something that appeared to be a guinea, and as he took it from the saucer, it fell upon the shelf.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do any thing else? - I then locked the door, and hung the key up in the same place as I took it from.</p>
               <p>Who was with Percival? - No living creature in the world in the room only myself standing at the door; the room was very small, and I could easily have seen if there had been any body there.</p>
               <p>Did any body come to the house with him? - There was a man followed him, and came into the room, and searched my room.</p>

               <p>Was that before or afterwards? - Afterwards.</p>
               <p>Where was he at the time? - I know not, I never clapped eyes on that man before in my life.</p>
               <p>He searched your room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he search it for? - He said for some things that were lost,</p>
               <p>How lost? - They suspected, Sir, the things that were sold there, had been lost; I know not what.</p>
               <p>How lost? - The man's house at the ship had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do any thing more than this? - I have no more to say about it.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow.)</p>
               <p>You told my Lord, your name was Crannis? - That is my own name, I never was married in my life.</p>
               <p>Was not you married to Wild? - That man was never any thing to me; I never was married in my life.</p>

               <p>You saw him before he was hanged? - He never was hanged.</p>
               <p>What became of him? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Did he go to Botany? - I can't tell.</p>
               <p>So when the soldier was hanged, you took up with a drummer? - Why should not I? that is not any thing I come about.</p>
               <p>You knew Mr. Percival by sight? - I have seen him many a time.</p>
               <p>Where? - Walking in the street.</p>
               <p>Do you know the Park? - I never frequent the Park so often.</p>
               <p>Not above once a night, unless you have a good quick trade, then three or four times; how often has he taken you up as a common prostitute in the Park, in his life? - I never was taken up as a common prostitute in the Park in my life, by him; I have been taken up for debt; Mr. Percival never took me up.</p>
               <p>You never was taken up but for debt; do you mean to swear that? - I don't mean to swear any thing, more than I have sworn.</p>
               <p>Have not you been taken up within the last twelve months as a common prostitute, and how often? - I am not obliged to relate here how often I have been taken up.</p>
               <p>Is it so often that you cannot tell; we cannot whip you for it; was you never taken up, yes or no, except for debt? - I am not obliged to relate that to the Court.</p>
               <p>I don't ask you whether you are a prostitute or not; but whether you have not been taken up as one; have you ever been taken up as one? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you have never been taken up as a prostitute, don't you know that, as a street-walker? - I am not obliged to take my oath on that; I don't chuse to relate that to every body.</p>
               <p>How often have you been taken up in the last month? - I have no business to relate that to you; what I have said about that man is just.</p>
               <p>How lately is it that Mrs. Cottrell took you up? - Mrs. Cottrell is here, let her speak whether she had any just cause.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath has not she taken you up? - She gave me a piece of paper with a shilling, and brought me here.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, don't you know that she has at this moment a prosecution over your head, unless you swear for her in this? - No, Sir, I did not rob her.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath has not she threatened to prosecute you for a robbery, unless you swear for her? - She never did in this world.</p>
               <p>Has not she charged you for the robbery? - I never did it in my life.</p>
               <p>Has she never told you that she would prosecute you for a robbery? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Has not she told you, that if you swore for her, you would have from the Court half a crown a day for your attendance? - No Sir.</p>

            . Then Mrs. Cottrell never said to you, in the hearing of Mrs. Bolton, that if you did not go on with this matter against Percival, that you had perjured yourself, and would have the law against you? - No Sir, if you will give me leave to speak; there was a man lodged in Mrs. Cottrell's house; I had a girl lodged with me in distress, and who had lived along with him; he told her if she would swear every thing she heard me say, she never should want clothes.</p>
               <p>This is a long story instead of an answer: I ask you, upon your oath, has Mrs. Cottrell never said to you, that if you did not go on against Percival, you would have the law against you? - No, Sir, she did not.</p>
               <p>She did not say this to you, that you would have half a crown a day for every day you had been with her about prosecuting Percival? - No Sir, she never did say that.</p>

               <p>What part of the house is the plant in? - I do not know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Don't you know what the plant is; why the place you put the stolen goods in? - I know nothing at all about it; I never saw any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Was the child in a situation to see this man take the guinea as well as you? - I saw him take it off the shelf, and I told the child I saw him take the guinea.</p>
               <p>Before he went out of the house you told her that? - I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Is that your mark? (Shewing a paper-writing.) - Yes, I believe it is my mark.</p>
               <p>You made information before Mr. Parker, the Justice? - When I went before Mr. Parker, there was such a laughing at me, that they would not give me leave to speak; they jeered me, and made game of me.</p>

               <p>"you saw him clap his hand upon the shelf,</p>
               <p>"that you saw him take a guinea off the</p>
               <p>"shelf, that you then locked the door, and</p>
               <p>"hung the key on the nail from which you</p>
               <p>"had taken it, but did NOT tell the child</p>
               <p>"that the said Percival had taken the guinea." Did you swear that before the Justice? - Mr. Parker was the gentleman that read that over many a time to me, and I told him I did tell the child.</p>
               <p>Then it is not true, that which is put down here,</p>
               <p>"but that she did NOT tell the child that she saw Percival take the guinea?" - I did tell Mr. Parker over and over again.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? -</p>
               <p>Court. Let me caution you: that gentleman has in his hand an information, taken upon oath before a magistrate, signed by you; you will judge whether you are strong enough, in your own knowledge, to support a charge against that magistrate, of setting down the contrary of what you said upon oath before him; the evidence of that gentleman, and of his clerk, and of every body else present at the examination can be had; and will you now venture to swear, that you did not say what is there specified? - I said, over and over, to Mr. Parker, that I told the child of it.</p>
               <p>You told Mr. Parker, before you made your mark to this information, that you had told the child that he had taken the guinea, before you went up stairs? - Yes, Sir, I told him over and over again.</p>
               <p>Then you did not tell Mr. Parker, that you did not tell the child so? - I did tell Mr. Parker; Mr. Parker asked; I told Mr. 
               <persName id="t17871212-79-person740">
                  Parker

             I did, just as I hung the key up.</p>
               <p>Then this is not true, that you did not tell the child? - I told Mr. Parker that I did tell the child of it.</p>
               <p>Do you know where Cottrell is now? - I have heard the children say he is in some hospital.</p>
               <p>How long is it since he left home? - I never trouble my head about his affairs.</p>

               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>

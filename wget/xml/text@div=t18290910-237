            . I live with my father, who is now in the Fleet-prison - I keep house for him there. On the 24th of August I met the prisoner in the New-road, between twelve and one o'clock in the day; he first spoke to me about the weather, and then asked if I would have something to drink - I said No, several times, but at last said Yes; I had never seen him before - I walked with him for about half an hour, and then went to my uncle's, in Gloucester-place; he waited for me at the end of Gloucester-place - I went to see my uncle, but he was out of town; I sat talking with the housekeeper nearly three-quarters of an hour, not thinking he would wait so long, but when I came out he was where I left him - he took me into a public-house, No. 75, <placeName id="t18290910-237-crimeloc1307">Norton-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you in any way of business? A. No - I have been with my father; I have not been to service or any business - I was with Mrs. Hart on liking, for two or three days, but the place was too hard, and I left her, finding my health declining; it was between twelve and one o'clock when I met the prisoner in the New-road - I was conversing with him for half an hour or an hour, before I went to my uncle's; I did not make any appointment with him, he said he would wait - I then met him at the corner of Gloucester-place; we went to the Little Cannon in Norton-street - I was not in the Goat and Compasses at the corner of Fitzroy-street, I am quite sure of that; it was between one and two o'clock - we had the beef-steak at the Little Cannon; I think he had a pint of ale afterwards - he might have had three pints in all; I did partake of it before he went away he had a glass of gin and water; I had some of that - he had a pint of beer; I had some of that - he put his arm round my waist after that; he had not done any thing to me before - people kept coming in; no fondling had taken place between us, or any thing of the kind - I do not say he did not kiss me; it was only once - that was early in our sitting; it was not all the time we were there - he paid for what was had; he did not make me any present - my watch was gold, but the chain was not gold; my father is in prison through a person he had been a great friend to - the lights had been lighted an hour before the prisoner went away; the room was not a dark one - I did not see which way he went; I showed the tape to him at the barracks, he took it from me and it fell on the floor - he said, "I have no knife, and how could I cut it;" I did not feel it done, but it was very easy for him to break it - I told the quarter-master my name was Parlett, and I was residing at a friend's; I did not tell him my name was Parker, and that I lived in Britannia-row - I was quite sober, upon my oath; the pot-boy did not conduct me to any place.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was the kiss given? A. About an hour and a half before he left; no one was in the room at the time - I do not know whether the light was gas or not; I mentioned to the landlady that my watch was gone.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see one of your potboys conduct her to the water-closet? A. No; I thought the prisoner belonged to the first or second regiment of Life Guards, and went with her to the Regent's barracks the same night - when I went into the parlour she was sitting close by the prisoner on the bench; the lights were not lighted more than twenty minutes before they went - the witness was not drunk; she was the worse for liquor.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What time was it? A.

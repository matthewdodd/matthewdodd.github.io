At 2 a.m. on 30th Novem<lb></lb>ber I saw the prisoners loitering in Broad Street, Golden Square—I concealed myself, and saw them go to the door of No. 40; they struck a match, and I heard the click of the lock of a door—I went across, and was about to enter, when the prisoners pushed to the door; it caught me in the breast—they were then inside; one of them said, "Push up, Jack"—I forced my way in, and closed the door, and said, "Well, young men, what are you doing here?"—Murphy replied, "We have come to lie down"—I said, "What do you do with your boots off?"—he had one boot in his hand; he said, "Nothing, sir"—Goldsmith had this lantern in his hand, and he raised it up to strike me; I said if he struck me I should hit him with my truncheon; he then gave it to me—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—I live at 33, Perth Street, Stepney—I did not live with the prisoner at this time—on Saturday, 11th May, about 11 o'clock in the evening, I was in the Mile End, at the corner of the Cambridge Road—I met the prisoner there—he asked me if I had anything to give him—I said I had not—he asked me if I would treat him—I said "No"—he then struck me on the side of the face; I cannot remem<lb></lb>ber any more—he crossed the road—I crossed too and said "You are a bad man to hit me because I have nothing to give you"—he put his fingers in my mouth and stretched it—a policeman came up and I said "I charge this man"—he said 'I did not see him strike you and I cannot charge him, you go that way and he shall go the other"—I crossed the road and he went another way, towards Commercial Road—I went straight down the Mile End Road till I came to the Three Cranes public-house—I bought a trotter out<lb></lb>side the door; that is about five minutes' walk from where the policeman separated us—the prisoner came round the corner from behind and took hold of me by one shoulder and I felt the knife in my throat, he held me by one shoulder and put the knife along my neck with the other hand, and he said "Now, where are you"—I don't remember any more, I felt the knife cutting me, I felt two cuts—I then got away from him and got into the public-house somehow—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife, I know it quite well, it is a table knife that we had in use when I lived with him.</p>

I did not speak to you that night, only in answer to your question, we were very unfriendly—I did not say I would knock your eye out—I am sure you wilfully put your fingers in my mouth—we have been separated more than once, thrice, or thrice, but at this time about a month—my friends were supporting me and have been ever since; I have not been well enough to work—I have three relations to help me, my sisters support me—I don't walk the Mile End Road till 12 o'clock at night—when I left you I took an empty room and bought a bed and put it there, and that was the only thing there when you were locked up—I never stayed from home except from your violence when I was really afraid of you.</p>

When she has met me on former occasions she has scratched my face and blacked my eyes, we have both been bound over to keep the peace. On this occasion she came up to me and said she would knock my eye out. I never thought this was a knife. I thought it was a pair of callipers, and I made a slash at her with it.'</p>

               <p>On the 9th of January, I was in search after Lyons and another man that had got away from me, and I found them both in bed together; I never heard Lyons say any thing concerning this robbery; I went after the other, I could not find him, on the 27th of January I apprehended him, I searched him, nothing was found upon him, I put him in the coach and Dorman, and he swore d - n his eyes, when I was bringing him in the coach from the Borough, he was talking about the robbery of Bowers's house; he said, he could not blame Farrel for what he had done, for he had been cheated as well as him, for Lyons had cheated them both.</p>
               <p>Was it mentioned before you, that Farrel had turned evidence? - He knew it.</p>
               <p>How do you know? - He asked me whether Farrel had turned evidence; I said, I believed he had, but he had not been sworn, nor I do not believe he had at that time; he then said, he could not blame him for he had not above five shillings and three pence or five shillings and nine pence, or something of that kind, any more than he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220099"></xptr> had, for Lyons had slanged him out of the ten pounds note, I am not sure to the exact sum, it was above five shillings; he said, that Lyons he had heard, had offered the note to change, but he would be d - d if he told where Lyons had offered it.</p>
               <p>Did he say any more? - No more.</p>
               <p>Had you, before he said this, made him any promises of giving him any expectation of favour, if he confessed any thing? - No, my Lord, he did not expect it, he judged that Farrel had turned evidence.</p>

               <p>I know nothing more, than on the 9th of January, I suppose it might be about twenty minutes before eleven, the two prisoners Farrel and another man, came into the Black-boy, Salt-petre-bank, where I lodge.</p>
               <p>How came you to remember it was that particular night? - Because I lodge in the house, I remember the day of the month very well, because I saw it put down in the book before Justice Staples; I told it to the Justice the day after, the 10th.</p>
               <p>What did you hear them say, or see them do, after they came in? - They called for a pot of beer, they drank once, and they called me by my name, and said Denmore, will you have any beer; I saw them do nothing, but I could perceive them have some papers, but what they were I could not tell, I saw no more.</p>
               <p>What sort of papers were they? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Had they any book? - No, I did not see any book.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay? - About six or seven minutes, they only drank once a piece out of the pot.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any conversation about these papers? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did they all go out together? - Yes, they did, they came in together, and they went out together.</p>
               <p>You did not observe what papers they were, nor you did not see any books, I think you say? - No, I could not perceive any books, but in the morning when I came down stairs, the boy shewed me a clasp of a pocket book, and he asked me what it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that boy here? - No, he was bound over, and he is gone out of the way; he picked up a clasp, and asked me what it was, I shewed Bowers the clasp of the pocket book.</p>
               <p>Did you see the boy pick up the clasp? - No, I did not, he shewed it me, at eight o'clock in the morning, when I came down stairs, he said, he picked it up in sweeping out the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Do you know what is become of that boy? - He is gone into the country where he came from; he got too saucy, and the landlord discharged him.</p>
               <p>How long ago was this that he went away? - I dare say it may be a month or better than a month.</p>
               <p>How came the landlord to send him away? - Because he found he would not do any thing that he bid him.</p>
               <p>What part of the country did he belong to? - Some part of Essex.</p>
               <p>The landlord knows, does not he? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Nash. I went by order of the Justice, to enquire about him, and the landlord said, he did not know any thing about him, he was gone away.</p>
               <p>Court to Dinmore. You cannot at all tell what sort of papers you saw them have? - No, I cannot indeed.</p>
               <p>Nor you did not see them with any book? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. How old was that boy? - About thirteen or fourteen.</p>
               <p>Court. That boy ought not to be out of the way.</p>

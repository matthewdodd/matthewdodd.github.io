               <p>About 7 at Night the Prisoner and Wood (who pretended to be a Captain) came to the Prosecutor's Shop for 2 Ounces of Nutmegs. Mrs. Shaw had then 5 or 6 other Customers in her Shop, and tho' she offer'd to serve the Prisoner and the Captain, they very civilly refused, and waited till those who came first were served and gone. Then She took out a Drawer of Nutmegs, they tumbled them over, telling her they would have the largest they could pick out. Captain, says the Prisoner, these are very fine ones, you had as good take a quarter of a Pound, and that will serve us all the Voyage. She put some in the Scale; the Prisoner turned them over there too, and the Captain again got his Hand among those in the Drawer. She saw the Captain put his Hand twice to his Pocket, which giving her a Suspicion, she watched him more narrowly, and the third Time, perceiving that he took some Nutmegs in his Hand, pray, says She, buy; but don't Steal. What do ye mean? says the Prisoner, you mistake the Captain, he's no such Person. Upon that, she catch'd hold of the Captain's Coat, and felt the Nutmegs, and while she held him, and was taking them out, Mr. Osborn her Neighbour came over: She told him how they had served her, but the Captain giving a Spring got loose and ran away. The Prisoner said, he was surprized the Captain should do such a Thing, and offer'd to pay for what was missing. She told him, she believ'd he had done the same, by his being so busy with his hand in the Scale. Mr. Osborn offer'd to search him, but the Prisoner swore he should not, and endeavour'd to get out; but Mr. Osborn stopt him at the Door, and in struggling the Prisoner fell in the Street. Mr. Barclay coming to Mr. Osborn's Assistance, they brought the Prisoner into the Shop again, when the Prisoner making a Motion with his Hand to his Pocket, 27 Nutmegs, 17 d. and a Handkerchief fell on the Ground. The Prisoner own'd the Handkerchief; but said he knew nothing of the Money or the Nutmegs. He was carried before Sir

               <p>His Defence was, that meeting the Captain whom he had never seen, but twice before, they got drunk together, and went to buy Spices for the Captain's Voyage; but knew nothing of stealing the Nutmegs.

                  </hi>. I am a coal-whipper, and live in King-street, Shad-well; I have heard that the prisoner kept an office for coal-whippers before the recent Act of Parliament came into force, but I never bad any connexion with him. On Tuesday, the 8th of Feb., I was returning from work by Gold's-stairs, Shadwell, opposite Gold's-hill—I stopped to have some con<lb></lb>versation with some friends at the corner of Gold's-stairs, about seven o'clock in the evening—the prisoner, who was standing there, said, "You scoundrel, walk about your business, we don't want you here"—I made no answer—I afterwards went into the Plume of Feathers public-house, and had a pint of beer—the prisoner followed me in, and called for half-a-pint—he called me a dirty scoundrel—I had not said a word to him—he called me all the dirty names he could—I walked out, and he after me up Gold's-hill—I was crossing the road—he came up to me—I said, "I have got 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I am going to have a pint of beer"—he said, "Is that you, you scoundrel?"—he said no more, but struck me on the hat with a thick stick—it knocked my</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-whipper, and live in Queen-street, Ratcliffe. On the 8th of Feb., about seven o'clock in the evening, I was at Gold's-hill—Morris was standing against a stationer's shop—I saw Kelly going from the stationer's shop to his own door, which was two or three doors from it—he came out, and met Morris against the stationer's shop, and struck him with a light-coloured walking-stick on the head, knocked his hat off, then struck him on the naked head, and knocked him down—I cannot say whether he had the stick before he went into his house—I saw two women there—they took him up, and took him to the doctor's—I did not see Morris with a knife in his hand, nor see any mob there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, and live in High-street. On the night of the 8th of Feb. I happened to come to my door, at the time the prisoner had crossed the road—he had scarcely passed my door when a woman, looking in at my window, accosted him with, "You are a vagabond," or something—he returned and said, "Madam, I advise you to keep a still tongue in your head"—she said, "Madam; who do you call madam?"—the prisoner going still closer to his house, said, "Lady"—then she pushed him away from her—he then left her—she went after him and pushed him into the road—he ran home, and knocked at his door with a stick which he had in his hand—in consequence of his running, I think there was a laugh raised, and com<lb></lb>bined with something the woman said, (but I am not aware what) caused the prisoner to return to the woman—after something passing he again left the woman and went to his doo—something more was said by the woman, which caused him to return—at that moment I noticed the prosecutor come and stand by his side—he had scarcely got alongside the woman before I saw the prisoner raise the stick and say, if she was a man he would strike her—almost</p>

               <p>directly after, I heard him say to Morris, "Hold your tongue, sir"—he then raised his stick, gave him a blow by the side of the head, and knocked his hat on one side—he then gave him another blow on the top or left side of his head, which caused him to reel in the road—he then set his back against his own door and said, if any body insulted or touched him, he would serve them the same—customer came in who I went to, and saw him no more—I did not hear what Morris said to the prisoner—it was very few words—Mrs. Alex<lb></lb>ander is the woman who the prisoner had the altercation with.</p>

The prisoner lodged with me from the latter end of September till the 8th or 9th of April - she had my front parlour - I gave her notice to quit, but I could not get rid of her for some weeks - I missed a coal-scuttle, a gilt watch, a table-spoon, a metal tea-pot, a pair of sheets, and four table-cloths - Mrs. Carter came and told me something, and I had the prisoner taken up - I had had her taken up about six weeks before, but she was released - I received six duplicates from Mrs. Carter - I went with them to Mr. Williams, the pawnbroker, and was foolish enough to take two table-cloths out of pawn - they were mine - the officer has them - at Mr. Walker's I saw a pair of sheets, a coal-scuttle, a metal tea-pot, and two more table-cloths, which were mine, I have no doubt - the prisoner had the use of the scuttle, and I had seen it about two months before - I took the duplicates to the pawnbroker's, but my son, I believe, had the duplicates of what was mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you married? A. No; I have been. I have three daughters grown up - there was a gentleman lodged in my house - I am not aware that he became attached to the prisoner - I do not know that I hoped he would become attached to one of my daughters - I never was asked any thing about it - I have some money in the Bank, but very little, and two of my daughters have some - I never mentioned that to the lodgers, nor to the prisoner - I do not know how she found it out - the lodger is gone to America now - he did not tell me he was going there.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that he was going there? A. He said so to the whole firm of the house - I am mistress of the house - I meant myself as one of the firm.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if he told the whole firm, and among the whole firm yourself, he told you that he was going to America? A. Yes. I can give no reason why I said he did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you mean by the whole firm? A. My daughters and myself.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150066"></xptr>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember Mr. Marshall leaving your house a fortnight before the prisoner? A. Yes; he was going weeks before - he gave no reason for leaving - I did not hear of any reason given in the house - the prisoner never complained of losing any thing in the house - she might complain of losing a comb - she did not complain of losing a petticoat, till she was at Lambeth-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she complain of losing before Mr. Marshall left? A. I do not know of any thing beside the comb before Mr. Marshall left - I do not wish to swear it - she said the comb she lost was a tortoise-shell comb - I think it was a comb to keep the hair up - I have my doubts whether she lost it - my daughters are not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever challenge any one with wearing the comb that she said she had lost? A. Yes; my daughter Maria. I forgot that - it is not a common thing to happen to my daughter, but I forgot that she charged my daughter with stealing it; and I forgot that she said she had lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she complain of losing any thing else before Mr. Marshall left? A. She might, but I do not know that she did - I cannot swear she did not - I believe she complained of something, but I forgot what - I do not know that she charged any one with stealing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not complain of losing a card-case? A. Yes; she charged that it was stolen in the house - she did not insist that the carpet should be taken up - I forgot that she had complained of losing a card-case when you asked me - it was to me that she complained of losing it - I do not know that I asked her any question as to who was in the room - I do not recollect that I asked who was the last person in the room, nor that she told me my daughter Maria was the last person - I do not know that I said there something very mysterious in all this - it was after she had accused my daughter Maria of stealing the comb that she said Maria was the last person in the room - I think she did say that Maria had been in the room last, but I cannot be certain - I do not know whether it was after or before she accused her of stealing the comb.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you take the prisoner before in the first instance? A. I do not know - it was at Lambeth-street - I believe I charged her there with stealing a gilt watch - I am sure it was a gilt watch, a table-spoon, a pair of sheets, three table-cloths, a coal-scuttle, and tea-pot, all of which I swore she stole - the watch was left me by my father - I never told the prisoner that my daughter, Maria, stole that watch, and that she need not worry herself about it - I stated to the magistrate that the prisoner stole all these things, but he discharged her once - I do not think she was up but twice - I have known Mrs. Carter since last Sunday week (I think it was) when she came and brought me the duplicates - the prisoner had a few things - she had a comb.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the carpet taken up to look for the cardcase? A. No - I did not believe her when she said my daughter Maria had been the last person in the room - there were so many people in and out - I do not know whether she did say that my daughter had been in the room - it is a long while ago - there was a bed in the prisoner's room - I have been in the room, but I never saw the bed down - she had no linen of me - she said she had sheets of her own - I never saw any of her sheets - she complained of losing sheets when she went away - I forgot that - my memory is rather bad - I forgot the comb, the card-case, and the sheets - my sheets were marked G. A. P., but it is picked out - there is no mark on them now, nor was there at the police-office - I know they are mine, because I have others like them - I missed the watch about Christmas - I searched for it - I did not apply to any office, nor call in any officer - I suspected it was stolen, but I did not suspect any one in the house - I then missed the sheets - I searched for them, but did not call in any officer, though I thought they were stolen - I next missed the table-spoon - there was nothing remarkable happened in my family the week I lost my watch - my daughters lived with me - some of them slept out - Maria did not sleep out - she did not leave my house and go away; I did not say, I wondered where she got the money - she slept in my house every night after I missed the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not remember letting her in one night? A. No, Sir; I never kept her out - I do not think she is at home now - she went out with a friend this morning - I do not know that my other daughters may be at home - Maria never slept out at night - I remember the prisoner being out late one night - I did not tell her if Maria knocked not to let her in - my daughter never stayed out a night in her life - I do not remember what the prisoner was out late one night for.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not tell you it was to go on board a ship to see Marshall? A. Oh, yes, Sir; I had no notion that there was a sneaking affection between them - on his side I am sure there was not - the prisoner did go to see him on board the ship - she returned at night - I do not know who let her in - Maria was at home - she never sleeps out - it might be ten or eleven o'clock when the prisoner came in - I do not think it was so late as twelve o'clock - I asked her where she had been staying so long - she said she had been on board ship to take leave of Marshall.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who brought the message to her from the ship? A. No; I have only one son - he is now here - I do not know that my son brought the message to her to go on board the ship, to see Marshall before he sailed - I will not swear positively whether my son told me he brought a message from Marshall for her to go on board to see him - I will not swear he did not - I do not recollect it - he might have told me and I forget it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath is not this whole business the result of a base conspiracy - now, before God and man, answer it? A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where is Maria? A. She is gone out into the City with a friend.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who is the friend? A. I do not know - I do not know where the house is - I have not kept her back on purpose - I think I heard her say the place was in the City - I never heard the name of the friend, nor the house she was going to, nor how long she was to stay - I do not know whether it is a male or a female friend - I do not know whether she dined at home, because I was here - she told me she was going out for the day - she is seven and twenty years old - I left home at eight o'clock this morning - I do not think my son knows that she is out for the day - I have not seen my daughter Maria about this Court to-day<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150067"></xptr>- I do not think my son has seen her - she is dressed in mourning, and is tall and thin - she knew I was coming here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the prisoner went away she said she had lost some sheets? A. Yes; and before that complained of having lost a comb and card-case - I had made a charge against her about a month before she left.</p>

            . I am son of the prosecutrix. I produce five duplicates which my mother gave me - I know that she took the prisoner in as a lodger in September last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you present? A. No; I am in the habit of visiting at my mother's frequently, every evening - I was not there last evening - I have not been there to-day - I have not seen my sister Maria for this week, as I have been detained here on business - I do not know where my sister Maria is to-night - I cannot say whether she is in the habit of going out.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she in the habit of going out with a nameless friend, to a nameless house, in a nameless street? A. I cannot say - I have been in the habit of visiting at my mother's when the prisoner lodged there - I advised my mother to get rid of her - I began to give that advice a few days after she got there - I never heard of the prisoner making any charge upon the firm.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you not think it very strange if this young woman should charge your own sister Maria with a robbery, and you not hear it? A. I might have heard it - there might have been two charges against her and I not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of her charging your sister Maria with stealing a tortoise-shell comb? A. There might have been a hint of the kind - it is so long ago, I cannot say I have any strong recollection of it - I never heard of it from my mother - when I said "a hint," I thought you alluded to these things that we charge against her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about any sheets? A. There was something about it; it must have been after she left the house - I know that she wrote on a piece of paper to my mother, that was the way I heard of it - I think I was at my mother's house when it was brought by some one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of her charging "the firm" with stealing any thing? A. I really cannot tell; I might have heard of it, but such girls as these I do not take notice of- I remember Mr. Marshall living with my mother - I went on board the Moffat, but not with Mr. Marshall - I do not know who I went on board with - I went to see the captain - I saw Marshall on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any message from him to any body in your house? A. I cannot say whether I did or not - I am sure I cannot say whether I told my mother that I did - I do not know that he gave me any message to any of my sisters, or to any female in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Must you not know if he sent any message by you to any one, to come and see him? A. I cannot say - I do not know that he sent a message to the prisoner by me - the time is so far elapsed that I cannot recollect it, it is about five months ago - I had a bad opinion of her - I cannot tell whether Marshall sent any message by me to her, to go and see him - I have no recollection of it - I cannot swear I did not deliver the message to her from Marshall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not send that message by you, and in addition, that she was to take down with her the knives that he bought at Mr. Carr's, in Whitechapel? A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take a letter to her? A. I really cannot tell - I cannot answer it - I had not been intimate with Marshall - I paid him that courtesy which he paid me - I never was in private company with him - I forget whether I brought a letter from him to the girl - I did not dislike her - I had my suspicions of her - I thought she was not respectable - I did not think her unchaste: I thought her rather too intimate with Marshall - he had been in her room - I did not tell my mother that - I cannot tell whether Marshall was living there when she came - I do not know that Marshall ever paid any attention to any of my sisters - I do not know that he did to Maria - I do not know whether Maria has any property in the Bank - I do not remember my mother complaining of her stopping out one night.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you again, whether Marshall did not give you a letter to this girl? A. I really cannot say - I cannot say whether he might desire that she should bring the knives - I have forgotten it - I cannot say whether I heard of her charging my sister with stealing a card-case.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the girl, in your own presence, tell your mother she had lost her comb, and that it was in your sister Maria's head? A. Never in my presence - I heard there was something missed - I do not recollect hearing from my mother or sister that such a charge was made - I remember a watch being lost about January, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever mention any thing to the young woman at the bar about it? A. I do not know whether I did or not- I do not know whether I said any thing to her with reference to my sister Maria and the watch, to the best of my knowledge I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, is not that phrase put into every answer, to save yourself from an indictment in future? A. No; it is not - I heard no conversation with the prisoner about my sister Maria and the missing watch to my knowledge - I think I could not have forgotten it - I do not recollect that I ever said to her, "Make your mind easy, my sister Maria has the watch" - I cannot swear that I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you mean by saying you were never in private company with Marshall? A. Never; but with my mother.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you not played at cards with Marshall and your mother? A. I might have done it - I cannot say whether I have played with the prisoner, my mother, and Marshall, over and over again - I will not swear it - I cannot say whether we have played over and over again at speculation - I have played at whist with my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the other two persons? A. I really cannot say - I never played at cards in the prisoner's room to my recollection - I never played at cards with her and Marshall, in her room to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner about the duplicates you found? A. I do not think her worth speaking to - she left my house bag and baggage, but she forgot the duplicates, and she left this pack of cards - they are cards of her business as a dress-maker - my husband did these cards, and never was paid for them - the address is No. 4, Spring-garden-place - that is where I lived then.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MRS. HART. Q. What marks were on your sheets which you lost? A."G. A. P." - there was nothing else on them - I am sure of that - I missed tablecloths - they had nothing on them - these are my sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is a 2 on this sheet; did you not say there was nothing else on it but "G. A. P.?" A. I thought you meant letters, Sir; I remember there was a figure.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this your table-cloth? A. Yes; the letter "S" is on it now; but that has been marked since - it was not marked S, in my name - I have other table-cloths like them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at the coal-scuttle and tea-pot; are they yours? A. Yes; I have looked at them - they are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever pawn any thing in your life? A. No, nor my daughter, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JAMES LAMB. Q. While these things were in your possession, did you take any mark off, or put any mark on? A. No, Sir; as things are brought, they are wrapped up and put away - this one sheet was pawned with a parcel of other things which belonged to the prisoner for 10s., and among them several books with her name in them.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Williams's, a pawnbroker. I produce the duplicates of two table-cloths, which were fetched out of pawn - I cannot say whether these are them; but I gave the table-cloths which were pawned at our house to Mrs. Hart - they were pawned in the name of Ann Haigh, No. 26, White Horse-street.</p>
               <p>MRS. HART. These are the two which I got out and gave to the officer - they were pawned for 2s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You swore to the table-cloths at the magistrate's? A. Yes - I examined them before I swore to them - the marks I expected to find had been at the corner - I examined the four corners - I did not tell the magistrate that the letter "S" was on them - I said it to those about me.</p>

            . I am a police-constable. I took the prisoner in a green-grocer's shop in Limehouse-fields.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was accused of taking a tablecloth, a silver spoon, and a coal-scuttle. I was acquitted. I was accused again, and acquitted. I was then sent for again, and Mr. Hart said, "What, old offender, have I got you again!" - and he said, if he could give me three months, he should be satisfied. There are a great number of my things lost.</p>

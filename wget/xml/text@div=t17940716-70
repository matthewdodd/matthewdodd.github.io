            Did you make her any promise if she would tell you how she came by the things, or did you threaten her? - Neither; she said, she received it from her daughter the over night, the candles, the red lead, and starch; I asked her how she came by the soap, up stairs; and then she said, she had it from her daughter.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say when? - She did not. The daughter told us that her mother had been with her the Sunday evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Don't you know that she and her husband are bound over by recognizances to answer this charge at the Surry assizes? - Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are bound over to prosecute them? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. This was all that the old woman said, all that you have stated in the court? - It is.</p>

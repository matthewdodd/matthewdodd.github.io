I was in the skittle-ground of the Lee Hoy public-house, Mile-end, on the 26th of July—I pulled off my coat, and put it on the table about half-past five o'clock—the prisoner took it up, and said he would take care of it—I told him it would do by itself—I had occasion to go out after that, and on returning he and the coat were gone.</p>

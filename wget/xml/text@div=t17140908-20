            </rs>. It appear'd by the Evidence for the King, That the Prisoner stepping on the Deceased's Hoy, in order to go over, the Hatches broke, upon which high Words happen'd betwixt them, and the Prisoner stepping on Shoar again, went up to the Deceas'd, and gave him a Shove, who return'd it by a Blow on the Face, which made the Prisoner's Nose bleed; whereupon he drew his Sword, and made a Blow at the Deceas'd, and then the Witness stept in and wrench'd the Sword out of his Hand, but he could not say the Deceas'd receiv'd any Wound: That when he had so taken away the Sword, he gave it to the Deceas'd, who gave it back to the Prisoner, and so all was over. Another depos'd, That coming over Tower Wharf, he saw the Deceas'd (with whom he was well acquainted) between whom and the Prisoner, he understood there had been a Quarrel, and that he perswaded them to be Friends, and take a Glass of Wine together; and all seem'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="17140908003"></xptr>to be very well, the Deceas'd not knowing any thing of his being hurt: That he and the Deceas'd did go and drink together, and a Gentleman in Company seeing some Blood about the Deceased's Hand told him he believ'd he was wounded, but he said, no, he believed 'twas some of Thompson's Blood which issu'd from his Nose, however, upon looking, he found he had a small kind of a Hurt a little above the left Wrist-bone, but made nothing of it, That the next Morning he sent for the Witness (who is a Surgeon) and he found his Arm swell'd, and out of order, and applied proper Remedies; and upon the Day mentioned in the Indictment, the Deceas'd dy'd, but he could not say the Wound was the Cause of his Death, he being otherwise an infirm Man. The Prisoner in his Defence deny'd he push'd the Deceas'd; but said he came peaceably up to him, and took him by the Button, asking him the Cause of so much ill Language, and that thereupon the Deceas'd gave him a very violent Blow on the Face so that the Blood gush'd out of his Nose, which did provoke him to draw his Sword, but he was not sensible he struck the Deceas'd. He had also some Witnesses who depos'd, that the Deceas'd first assaulted and struck the Prisoner, and that they knew not how he came by his Hurt in the Scuffle. There were several Surgeons and others, who took it upon their Oaths, that they believ'd the Wound was not the Cause of his Death, he being of a very ill Habit of Body, and frequently ailing before.

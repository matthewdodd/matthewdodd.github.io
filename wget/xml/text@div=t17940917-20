               <p>Q. Did you find any other of the things? - No otherwise than what she owned.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to her, to induce her to confess? - No, nothing at all, we had not seen any thing of her till then; she said that she pawned them somewhere by Swallow-street, but we could not find them out, but we traced them at two or three places, and heard of the things at several different places, where she had offered them to sell.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 30th of August, Mrs. Farmer sent to the shop where I was at work, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and the man informed me that she had got intelligence where the prisoner was to be found, and desired if I would be so good as to come, to go with her at seven o'clock in the evening; accordingly I left work at seven, and came down to her house; she desired me to go up to Grosvenor-gate with her, I went, and accordingly the prisoner at the bar was at Grosvenor-gate.</p>

            Was she in any house by Grosvenor gate? - No, she was waiting there for a coachman that she had lived with; accordingly I then told her she must come along with me, for she had stole many things from Mrs. Farmer; I went across the Park, and Mrs. Farmer came up Park-lane, she came up soon after; accordingly Mrs. Farmer challenged her with the things that she had taken from her; then Elizabeth Panton directly said how that she had got the gown, and an handkerchief, and an apron, and two pair of stockings; accordingly Mrs. Farmer told her to let her have the things, for she wanted them, for the gown was not her own, then the prisoner began to cry, and said that she had not pawned the gown, she had sold it for six shillings in Brewer-street; she then asked her where the rest of the things were? she said they were at Richmond, she could not get at them that night, but if she would let her loose she would get them the next day; accordingly with this we walked on till we came as far as Conduit-street, for Marlborough street; Mrs. Farmer said she would have the things or duplicates; accordingly we went into a public house there, Mr. Jacob's, the Coach and Houses, and Mrs. Farmer desired me to search the woman; I pulled out of her pocket two pair of stockings, one pair Mrs. Farmer owned to, the other she could not.</p>

She stood about an hour after, and seemed very bulky, and I said, what have you got in your pocket? and she put her hand so, and said, d-mn me, do you think I am going to rob the woman? And she staid in the house about half an hour after she had taken the stockings, and she said, she was going down to the washerwoman's; but she never came back again. In about an hour and a half after, Mrs. Farmer came home, and then I asked her if these were her stockings that were on the drawers, that

             had taken? and she said, yes; and I never saw her from that time, till Saturday evening I saw her at Grosvenor-gate, I went with Mrs. Farmer there; there she acknowledged that she had taken the gown, apron, handkerchief, and two pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you take a pair of stockings one day when you went to the Hospital? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to speak the truth, and no more. I lodged with Mrs. Farmer one week; she is a very bad woman: one night, when she had two men on the bed with her, she sent me for a pot of beer; when I comes back, the door was locked; that woman the next day, took away a pair of stockings and handkerchief, and took them away, and desired me never to let Mrs. Farmer know; and she sold rags, and put the money in her own pocket; she has only done this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170069"></xptr>because I would not bring a parcel of men into her house, and do as she would wish. She cannot bring a witness out of the parish that will give her a good character; she, at night, has two or three men with her, and so has the other woman that is with her likewise, and that is the woman, I can be upon my oath, that took the things away. I have not been in London long, I have come from Richmond; I did not know but what I should be tried at the Hall, and so I have not sent for any witnesses here.</p>

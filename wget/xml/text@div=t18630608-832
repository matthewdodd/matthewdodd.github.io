                  </hi>. I live at 13, Richmond-buildings, Duke-street, Soho, and am a silver chaser—this acceptance, which purports to be accepted by Frederick Dubber, is not my handwriting, or written by my authority—there is nobody of the same name at my address.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say it is not your signature? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not; or written by my authority at all—I never accepted a bill for the prisoner—I have been security for him—I have signed for him four or five time at benefit clubs; perhaps more, beginning, I should think, eighteen months ago—they were not loan societies—it is a subscription club of so many members, who pay in a certain amount every week, each one has their turn for a prize, and then they take their money out, but they require some one among the members to sign for them—one society is "The Sovereign" in St. Martin's-lane—I have only been security for the prisoner once there—I subscribe to four societies—there is one in Silver-street; the prisoner used to subscribe to that—I signed for him there as a security; last year I signed five times for him, for the same society—I think I signed for him when I first knew him for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at the York, in Rathbone-place—I did not share in the loan—I was not a subscriber to that society myself—I think he has only signed once for me as surety—I think that was in Charles-street, Middlesex Hospital—I know a person named Lowe—I have been surety for him two or three times perhaps—the prisoner never signed the same paper with me; he might have been surety for Mr. Lowe—I cannot say; I think he has once, not more that I know of—I know Mr. Johnson—I have never been surety for him—I think I have only four bills of exchange outstanding at this moment—I do not know the amount I am indebted at this moment—all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186306080091"></xptr>
               <p>the entries that I require are in the books of the different societies, which they keep in their possession—I have no memorandum of my own, by which I can tell to what amount I am indebted at this moment—there may be ten bills outstanding with my name on, written by myself—I am sure there are not twenty—they amount generally to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am not liable to the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there must be a great deal of it paid, it is being paid every week, and finishes every year—I don't think there is one outstanding now in which I am the borrower and the prisoner the surety—I cannot swear there is not—I always write these documents myself; nobody has ever written my name for me—I never authorized anyone to do so—I have never been security for Murphy or for Gyme—I have known Gyme five years and Murphy fourteen—we have only met together at these clubs, about once a week—we don't drink water there, but not more than a pint of porter, or a glass of gin and water each—there is no society at Hurst's public-house—at one time I went there mostly every evening, but I do not now, since Mr. Hurst has left the house, which was about a month ago—my name is upon all these bills (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are all mine—this is one not where I signed for Murphy, but where Murphy signed for me—the writing on the one in question for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., is not unlike mine; it is not exactly like mine, I think, by the appearance of it—that is my correct address on the bill; they are generally signed at the latter end of the evening—I signed for the prisoner in March at "The Sovereign" in St. Martin's-lane—I proposed to be surety for him at the end of April, at the Apollo, and this bill was drawn up, but in consequence of the prisoner getting tipsy, and not coming up for the money, it was not finished—I would have been surety for him on that, if he had not been too tipsy to come—I did not know that he was arranging with his creditors at that time—I knew there was an execution in the place, but I did not know what for—that must have been before this bill was presented—I have heard since that he made an arrangement with his creditors, and subsequently went into the Bankruptcy Court—I did not go there yesterday about this—I heard that he had to attend the court—the prisoner made me a suit of clothes—I had them on 21st February—the bill came to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not pay for them at the time—I afterwards paid him the money in at The Sovereign—I paid him six sovereigns in gold—the last clothes I had of him was on 6th March, the last part of the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on my oath this bill was not handed over to the prisoner in port payment for those clothes—I borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Murphy to pay Gillman—Murphy is here—I did not give Murphy any memorandum for it; he lent it me without that—I often lent him money and he me—not names also; he has been surety for me—I have signed for different members of the club—I have lived at Richmond-buildings eight years.</p>

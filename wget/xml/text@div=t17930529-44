               <p>Q. Is it a difficult point to determine, because you considered of it so long? - I was sober enough.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it taken in writing? - It was. There was another young man with me when we met these two women, and this woman was with her I took that night; this woman had my watch, because my property was found the next day upon her; it was the other woman that confessed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290094"></xptr>before the justice, this woman was taken up the next morning.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Duchamp and Co. they are dry salters; I am in the warehouse. Coming by Aldgate two women met us, Rowland and I were together, one walked by my side, and the other walked by the side of the other man; one of the women were near to him, and the other to me; before we came to the India House, in Leadenhall-street he said he had lost his watch; we went back to the George Yard, Whitechapel, to see if we could find the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you did not know which of the two had stole it? - We took the first up for being in company with the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Rowland know? - I cannot tell whether he did or not.</p>

               <p>On the 27th of April, in the morning, I took the prisoner into custody, and when I met with her in the street she had this watch in her hand, wrapped round with an handkerchief; I asked her where the watch was? she cried and I found it in her hand; I asked her where she got it? she said she had been along with some young man near Moorfields, and as she left him, the watch, by some means, got hold of her clothes; I took her into a public house and there I found another watch under her arm, which the prosecutor swore to be his property. (The second watch produced and deposed to by Rowland.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This young man picked me up one night, and would not let me alone, he wanted to go home with me, but he said he was short of money; I said, if you are short of money make me a present till another time I meet you; he left the watch in my care; the next morning he came, but had no money, and he said he would have the watch or he would charge an officer with me.</p>

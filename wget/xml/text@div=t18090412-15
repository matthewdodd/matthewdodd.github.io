               <p>Q. Is the whole house yours - A. Yes, I inhabit it. On Saturday last, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was at home in the shop; at the same time I believe the whole family was at home - my wife and three daughters. Two or three persons came in, and wished me to go out and see whether I had lost any thing; on my going out I perceived a corner of a square had been cut, and some seals had been taken out, with some instrument; the watchman ran after the persons, and brought them back; one of them took the seals out of his pocket, and threw them on the counter.</p>
               <p>- SATCHELL. I am a labourer in the East India warehouse and watchman of Bridge ward. It is customary for us to receive our money on Saturday night at the watchouse by London bridge. On my returning back I observed the prisoners at Mr. Kidgell's shop window; their appearance occasioned me to look at them; I perceived the pane of glass before which they stood was broken across in a corner direction; I judged from that they were robbing the shop; I went to the stand of coaches opposite Mr. Kidgell's shop, and communicated my suspicion to the waterman who was standing by the horses, either watering or feeding them, I do not know which; we both stood together, looking at them for the space of five or six minutes, not more, rather less; finding they left the window, I went into Mr. Kidgell's shop; I asked him if he had lost any thing out of the broken pane of glass in the window; he expressed his surprize that it was broke, immediately looked, and told me that he had. I immediately ran out of his shop and called the waterman to my assistance, followed the prisoners up Nag's head court, secured the prisoner Carter, and directed the waterman to secure the other. I brought them back into Mr. Kidgell's shop; the prisoner Carter immediately turned out the seals from his pocket and put them on the counter; he said that he was the person but that he knew nothing of the other young fellow. As I brought them into Mr. Kidgell's door I saw Salmon, who is a constable; I called him in, I told him I thought I should want his assistance. We immediately conveyed him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first observed these men at the window were they together - A. They were very close together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to you to be connected - A. I judged that they must be connected because that I observed one of them taking something out, or forcing it out; I could not understand the other to be a bystander; if he was, he must have seen it, he was so close to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you saw it, and you was at some distance - A. At first I passed close behind them, then I went into the middle of the street; they went away together and turned into Nag's head court.</p>
               <p>Carter. When I went up to the window the window was broken.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Satchell came to you as you were watering the horses - A. Yes. I turned my head, I saw the two prisoners close together; the prisoner Carter was active with his fingers; I saw them together till they parted from the spot; then they went up Nag's head court. The moment Mr. Satchell came out I followed him up the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the same men that you followed - A. They are. Satchell took Carter and I took Cooper. We brought them back to the shop; Carter produced twelve seals there.</p>

            . I am an officer; I have got the seals and a knife; I took that from the prisoner Carter; that was every thing he had about him. I searched the prisoner Cooper. I found upon him several rounds of wire; I am not certain whether I returned it to the prisoner or left it on the counter; it was an iron wire, about the size of a knitting needle; when it was pulled out it was about a yard long.</p>
               <p>Q. to Kidgell. Now with respect to this window, was it whole before - A. Yes, I saw it whole in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them produced the seals to you, look at them - A. This piece of glass is half the glass that was taken out; the hole was as big again as that.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they taken out - A. I do not know, unless by that wire. These are all my seals; they are worth above twenty pounds - at least twenty pounds; they are gold seals.</p>
               <p>JURY to prosecutor. You did not hear the window break, did you - A. I did not; I was in the shop at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Salmon. Was there any hook at the end of this wire - A. I cannot say I perceived it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window cut or broken - A. Broken.</p>
               <p>COURT, to Satchell. Do you know whether these two prisoners were talking together - A. I did not hear them; they appeared to be so close together that one could not do any thing without the other seeing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Rogers. Do you know from the position they were in, whether they seemed to have any conversation - A. That I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not think that Cooper was an indifferent spectator, do you - A. No. They were standing nearly face to face, and when they were taken they were both together then.</p>

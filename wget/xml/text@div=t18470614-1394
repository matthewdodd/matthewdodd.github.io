                  </hi>. I am delivery foreman at the wool warehouse, London Docks. On the 26th of Feb. one of Kenworthy's wagons came to the wool warehouse—a man named Pottle was a labourer at the wool warehouse that day—the prisoner brought in the first wagon that day—he brought it under—it was my duty to give a pass-note, and I did so to the prisoner—the pass<lb></lb>note goes to the office, to the clerk, for him to sign a gate-pass—that gate-pass passes the articles out—I gave the cart-note to the prisoner, which contained the account of the quantity of property in the wagon—when the wagon was about half loaded, a man named Joiner brought in an empty wagon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an extra labourer at the London Dock. On the 26th of Feb. I was at the spice warehouse, which is opposite the wool ware-house, perhaps about sixty feet from it—I remember the lunch bell ringing at twenty minutes past twelve o'clock—I saw one of Kenworthy's wagons at the loop-hole at the wool warehouse—it was loaded, and the wool tied in—it was under the loop-hole—it was level with the loop-hole—the prisoner was standing on one of the bales of wool, which was level with the loop-hole—I saw Pottle go on the wagon, and take off a woollen cloth that covers the wagon—it was folded up at the top of the wagon—he took it into the loop-hole, and laid it down—the prisoner was standing there, and they had a little conversation together, and I saw a bit of a turning of the head by the prisoner towards the gate, and a bit of a beckoning of the finger with Pottle and the prisoner—that led me to watch them more particularly—it caused my sus<lb></lb>picion—I could not see the gate from where I was—the prisoner looked towards the gate—I then saw Pottle bring a bag and give it to the prisoner on the wagon—the prisoner laid it between two bags of wool—there was a bag of wool behind—he put it rather behind that, and between two bags—Pottle then brought out the covering of the wagon and gave it to the prisoner, who covered up the bag with it—I saw Joiner come and put his horses to the wagon I had seen loaded by the prisoner—the prisoner went away immedi<lb></lb>ately—I went to my foreman, and told him there was something wrong—this is the bag of coffee that I saw handed into the wagon—I am certain of it.</p>

Q.</hi> That is pretty bold, swearing to a bag sixty feet off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I would not do it if I were not certain—the wool on the wagon was not higher than the loop-hole at the part where the prisoner was standing—there were some bales on the wagon higher than the loop-hole—I could see as plainly as I can see you at that table, not through the wool bags, but over them—I could see the floor of the loop-hole as plainly as I can see this table—the</p>

               <p>wool on the wagon did not shut out the view of the loop-hole—I was opposite, and I could see it—I was before the Grand Jury at the last Sessions—I told them the same as I have told you to-day—I swear that—I had not known the prisoner before—I might have seen him, but I do not know that I had—I believe he had a kind of grey tag dress on—he was not dressed as he is now—I told the Grand Jury I had only seen the man that time, and most likely I should know him in the same dress—he is not in the same dress now, but I swear to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a permanent labourer in the London Docks. On the 26th of Feb. I was at work in the crescent shed, which is under the wool warehouse—I saw the wagons loading with wool—I cannot say whose wagons they were—at lunch time I went to lunch in the wool warehouse—Pottle was there—he was not helping to load the wagon at the time I was there—I was in a corner—he could have seen me if he had turned his head—he did not turn his head that I know of—I saw him take from behind the loop-hole a bag, and place it on the flap of the loop-hole, which was hanging over the wool<lb></lb>wagon—directly after the bag was taken out, I saw a tilt taken out by Pottle and handed to some one on the wagon—I have seen the bag since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

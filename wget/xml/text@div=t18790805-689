I am a widow at Tachbrook Street, Pimlico—I was alone walking along Hatton Garden about 10.30 on 24th July, carrying this small leather bag on my arm, when a person came behind me and threw me on the road and tried to take my bag, but I screamed for the police, who came immediately, and the man ran away—my arm was hurt a good deal, and the skin grazed—my bag contained about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money and various articles—the man was brought back to me in a few minutes after, but I could not recognise him as I had not seen his face—my elbow was hurt, but not seriously.</p>

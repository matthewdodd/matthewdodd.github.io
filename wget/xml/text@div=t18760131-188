                  </hi>. I am a detective officer at the dockyard Woolwich—about quarter to 7 o'clock on Saturday morning, 15th. January I was in the Albion Road, Woolwich, and saw Brown who is a corn chandler come out of his own yard with a horse and cart, I went up to the cart, it was empty—I bid him good morning, and said "Are <hi rend="italic">you going to</hi> market" he said "No," and drove on—I watched the cart, and followed it to the corner of King-Street, and Charles Street, he pulled up there—Burrows was standing on the pavement, he went up to the cart, took it from Brown, went with it into Mr. Barth'syard, and closed the gates after him—Brown stood at the corner of the street berween 20 and 30 yards from the spot—in about ten minnaes Burrows came out again with the horse and cart, and came in the direction of where he had left Brown—I was standing there in company with Gibson another constable—Brown came up to the horse and cart, and they met in the centre of the road—it was dark—I said to Bur<lb></lb>rows "What have you there "he made no answer—I turned round and saw Brown going towards the pavement again as fast as he could, at a kind of jog trot—I looked into the cart, and saw that it contained four full sacks—I took them to the station, examined them, and found three contained oats, and one bran—I went to Mr. Barth's stable in company with the foreman, and found three empty sacks lying at the top of the ladder—there were other sacks there which were compressed as if somebody had been lying on them—I afterwards went to Brown's honse, and found three empty sacks marked with Mr. Barth's name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Brown four years—I don't know that he has kept a shop in the neighbourhood for forty years—I can't say whether he knew me—I know the Lord Whitworth public-house—that is where Brown got out of the cart—I should say that is between 20 and' 30 yards from Mr. Barth's yard—I could see Brown all the time he was there, and he might have seen me—when he went off at a jog-trot he did not go to-wards his own house; he went towards the churchyard—there is a path, across the churchyard to his house, but that is more than quarter-of-a-mile from the spot; it would not be his nearest way home.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I have pleaded guilty to this charge—before I was taken into custody I resided at 47, Artillery Place, Woolwich, and was in Mr. Barth's employ about six months as yard man to see to the horses and stables—I have only known Brown, a very little while, I had met him three or four times, that was all—I saw him on the Thursday before this Satur<lb></lb>day, along by the dockyard wall—he stopped me, but I could not stop to have much conversation with him then, and I said I would see him again; I had a horse with me; I saw him again shortly after along by the dock-yard wall, going towards his home he asked if I had got anything I could sell him—I said "I don't know, I don't like to do anything in that way"—</p>

               <p>he said if I had, he would not have it in Mr. Barth's sacks—I said if I did let have any I would have his (Brown's) sacks, nothing else passed between us then—the sacks were sent up to my place on the Friday night, and I took them with me to Mr. Barth's premises in the morning; I got there about 4.30; I chucked the sacks up in the loft and went up to see to the horses—as soon as all the men were out I emptied the corn out of Mr. Barth's sacks, and put it into those that were sent by Brown—I then went out into the road to see if Brown was there, he was not, that was between. 6 and 7 o'clock—I went out again, a little before 7 o'clock, and met him coming along King Street, with his horse and cart—he got out of the cart and handed it to me, and I went in and put the corn into the cart and brought it out again to Brown—he told me to drive down King Street, I knew he was coming that morning, the appointment was made for him to come—he said he would be there about 7 o'clock, or a little after—when I came out with the cart I saw the two detectives standing at the corner by the Lord Whitworth; Brown was on the opposite corner—the detectives came up and asked what I had in the cart—I made no answer—Brown stood about two or three strides away from me, he heard what the detectives said and then he started to run away, leaving me with the cart, he made a kind of a trot, to go as fast as he could, I had met him several times before the Thursday, but not to speak to him much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had spoken to him before, but not anything about this—when he made this proposition to me to sell him anything, I under<lb></lb>stood it was to rob my master, I have not had any conversation with my master since I have been in prison; I just spoke to him at Woolwich, when I was under remand; I said I was very sorry for what I had done, and I should never have done it if I had not been tempted by Brown—I know a man named Rogers, I did not send him to Brown, the night before to borrow his cart—Rogers worked for Mr. Barth—I did not know that Brown let out a cart; I did not tell my master or the foreman what Brown had said to me.</p>

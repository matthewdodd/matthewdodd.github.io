                  </hi>. I am draper, and carry on business in Broadway, Hammersmith—the prisoner was in my service for one month—he left me on Saturday, the 17th of April. On the Tuesday following I missed some property—the prisoner came for his box that day—I said to him, "I have missed five pairs of gloves from the department you had the charge of—I have a suspicion that you know something of them; will you let me see the contents of your box?"—he said, "Certainly"—he took the cord off his box, and these he turned back and said, "If you have missed the five pairs of gloves, I will pay you for them, if you think through me they have been lost"—I said, "I don't wish that, but let me see the contents of your box"—he said, "Very well," he felt in his pockets, and said he had not got the key—I said, "What have you done with it?"—he said he had left it at the house he had slept in on Monday night—the box was opened, and these gloves and other things were found in it—these collars are marked with my own private mark—one of these pairs of gloves is marked with my own private mark—this scarf has been marked, but the marked, but the mark has been taken from it—I can identify these things as mine—I had mot sold them—I said to the prisoner, "These are mine; will you tell me where you took them from?"—he said, "I have taken them from your shop; will you forgive me, and let me go?"</p>

I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—I examined Welham and Healey—Welham had an incised wound on the front surface of the right thigh, about 1 1/2 inches long and an inch deep—it was dangerous from its being near the main artery of the limb—behind the left knee was another incised wound about half an inch long—Healey had a wound about two inches long in the front of the right thigh, and about an inch deep—it became dangerous because a large abscess came near it—they were such wounds as would be inflicted with this knife.</p>

                  </hi>. The. prisoner was admitted to the gaol of Newgate on 3rd August and I saw him daily until the 7tn when I left town—I examined him and formed a very decided opinion that he was deranged in his mind—he had very distinct and powerful delusions that persons were about to throw him overboard and when he got ashore every one he met was about to murder him—he was likewise very terrified that any one should attack him while in the gaol for the first few days—all that feeling has passed away and very little remains now—I have watched his progress since and I am of opinion that he is nearly well—he says he should not like to go back to the ship, but beyond that he has no delusion I think—having heard the evidence I think it is such an act that a person in his state of mind would commit, he would suppose he was acting in self-defence.</p>

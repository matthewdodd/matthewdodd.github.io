                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Wm. Belcher, a chemist and druggist, in Dorset-street, Portman-square. He has two shops—the prisoner was our errand-boy three or four days—I missed some money out of the till, and marked some on Wednesday, the 4th of May—I put in 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper—the copper was not marked—I did not leave the shop without taking the key of the till with me, till ten minutes after two o'clock—I then left the key in the till, and in three minutes I was rang down by the prisoner—I immediately went to the till, and on looking in I observed, I thought, half-a-crown deficient—I had marked five half-crowns and other silver—I sent the prisoner down to get some water, and then looked thoroughly, and was certain there was half-a-crown gone—I requested him to come into the parlour, and charged him with stealing a half-crown from the till—I rang the bell for the servant, and sent for a policeman—the prisoner said he had stolen no money, and had not a far<lb></lb>thing about him—the policeman came, and I think he again said he had not a farthing about him—the policeman picked half-a-crown off the car<lb></lb>pet—I said, "You will find a T on the king's neck," which was the case—I will sweat this is the half-crown I marked (looking at it).</p>

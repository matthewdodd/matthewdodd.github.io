On the 28th of July the prisoner came to my shop in the evening, in company with two other persons; they asked for some silk, and one of my young men showed them some - there were some gloves on the counter, and some of them got on the floor; I saw the prisoner stoop and push something under her clothes - as soon as they were served they went out, and when they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100048"></xptr>had got about five doors, the prisoner was pursued and brought back; she produced these gloves - they had paid for what they bought, which amounted to about 4s. - I know the prisoner very well; she is married, and lives in the neighbourhood - she had dealt at my shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Was your attention directed to her? A. Yes, perhaps more from the person she was with, than from her own conduct; I did not charge her with it when she stooped down - we let her go away to be sure of the matter; I knew she had taken something - she was then about two yards from the door; I do not recollect these gloves, but I had seen some gloves on the counter - when she returned she produced these, and said she picked them up at the door; there is nothing on the gloves that I can swear to.</p>

            . I was serving in the shop - I saw the three women come in; I began to show them some silk, and then another young man took them - I stood opposite, putting away some goods; I saw some gloves on the counter were pulled off in some way, but I cannot say how - the prisoner stood opposite them; I saw her stoop - I do not know what she picked up; the others paid for what they had - when they went out I followed them, and overtook the prisoner; I asked her to walk back with me - she came back and produced the gloves, which she said she picked up at the threshold of the door - I believe they are my master's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the three persons staud together? A. No, a little distance; there was no one else near enough to pull the gloves off.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WILLIAMS. I am an officer, and took the prisoner.</p>

On Friday the 15th of March, I received private information that there were some silks in the possession of Mr. Dover, No. 26, St. John-street, Clerkenwell. I went to Bow-street office, got a search warrant, and went, accompanied with two officers, Mantz, and Donaldson, to No. 26, St. John-street; and in a closet in the garret we found some goods, which we have here, my property. We took the goods away with us. I produce them. Here are a variety of lengths of silk cut off.</p>
               <p>MR. DONALDSON. I and Mantz took the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070072"></xptr>in custody. In the prisoner's box we found a silk handkerchief, and a towel, belonging to Mr. Shears. I asked her if she had not left some things at a place. She denied it. I then said, suppose we go to No. 26, St. John-street. She then said, send for my master, Mr. Layton, and I will tell you all about it. She told Mr. Layton that the other servant girl that had gone off, had taken as much as her. Mr. Layton, thought the prisoner had brought the other into it. Mr. Layton got the magistrate to discharge her, as I found a small portion upon her.</p>

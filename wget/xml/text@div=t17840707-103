               <p>Court. How was he mounted? - Not very well.</p>
               <p>What was the colour of his horse? - As nigh as I can guess it was a dark brown, or bay.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - About half past ten at night, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Was it moon-light? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Was it a cloudy night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was you stopped? - I was driving a chaise, there were three people in it.</p>
               <p>Could you see very well that night? - Why it was rather cloudy, so that I could not see so well.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner at the bar the night before you was stopped? - No.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to see how he was dressed? - As far as I can make out he had a light drab coloured surtout great coat on.</p>
               <p>Can you describe any thing else? - No; he followed the chaise through Ball's-pound gate, I was coming to town.</p>
               <p>Had you observed him before he came to the chaise? - Yes, I saw him before about five hundred yards, and I drove on as fast as I could, and passed him.</p>
               <p>How often had you passed him? - Only once.</p>
               <p>In what manner did he come up to you? - He rode up quite opposite to me, and desired me to stop.</p>
               <p>Which side of the chaise? - The right-hand side, near the opposite horse to that I was upon, he was just opposite my horse's head; he desired me to stop three or four times.</p>
               <p>When you passed him once, had you any time to take notice of him, till he came to stop you again? - No, I had not time, I went on, and he damned my eyes for not stopping, and presented a pistol to my head; seeing the patrols so near, he made off directly.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070152"></xptr>How do you know he presented a pistol? - Because I saw the nozzle of it as plain as I see you now.</p>
               <p>What size was it? - It seemed to be a large one.</p>
               <p>Are you pretty sure it was a pistol? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing but the nozzle? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he ask you for any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. When he put the pistol to your head, did he go round your horse's head and go to the chaise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was tried here on Friday for a similar offence, and the post-boy could not then swear to my person.</p>
               <p>(See No. 740 and 741.)</p>
               <p>Court to Post-boy. How was that; did you ever say that you did not know this man? - I never said so.</p>
               <p>Did you give evidence against him before? - Yes, on Friday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I refer to the notes of Mr. Hodgson, the short-hand writer, if your Lordship will direct him to read his notes. This boy has been with the thief-takers since, and they have persuaded him to swear to me.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, we tried this prisoner on Friday, and we perfectly remember the evidence that the boy gave.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, I believe it is unnecessary to go on with this prosecution; this is an indictment upon a particular act of parliament, in the seventh year of

            , with intention to rob him, and the account he gives is, that he being a postillion, the prisoner rode up to him, and presented a pistol and bid him stop, but asked him for nothing, he never demanded his money, but damned him, and went up to the people in the chaise; therefore, supposing you believe the prisoner to be the man, which is by no means clear on the evidence, it is very clear he did not mean to rob the post-boy; but if you are clearly satisfied that he meant to rob the post-boy, and nobody else, then it will be a question whether he speaks to his identity or not.</p>

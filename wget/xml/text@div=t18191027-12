While she was with us my mother was taken ill, and wanting some assistance in her chamber, we took the prisoner to assist in the house. She continued in that capacity for ten or fourteen days, and then absconded - we then missed this property. Suspicion fell on her, we sought her in every direction, and in ten days we took her. She was taken to the Mansion House, and confessed stealing the things. We found some at the pawnbrokers. She said she pledged seven spoons with Robinson, but he says he has not received them.</p>

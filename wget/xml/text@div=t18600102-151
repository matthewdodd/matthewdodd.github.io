I assist my uncle, Henry Thompson, at his coffee-house, Thornhill-place, Caledonian-road—on Wednesday, 21st December, about half-past 6 in the evening, the prisoner came for a cup of coffee and a slice of bread and butter—he gave me a florin, and I gave him a shilling, a six-pence, and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, in change—the shilling had a King's head on it, I am positive—he put the shilling to his mouth—then threw down a shilling which was bent, saying, "Do you wish me to have this?"—I took it up and said, "You don't mean to say I gave you this?"—he said, "You</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 136). On 21st December, I was with Newbold, in plain clothes, in the Caledonian road, about half-past 6 o'clock, and saw the prisoner and two more lads standing against the wall, about two doors from Thompson's shop—they commenced running from the shop—we followed them, caught them, and told them we should take them on suspicion of having counterfeit coin—I saw the one whom Newbold took, drop a bad shilling—I picked it up—they were discharged, there being only one shilling against them—I afterwards went to Thompson, and re<lb></lb>ceived a shilling from him, and a florin from Ann Bull—Newbold and I afterwards went to the place where we had seized the prisoner—and I saw Newbold find two bad florins in the mud—this piece of tissue paper was on the top of the mud—that was about an hour afterwards.</p>

I was with Stammers, and assisted in taking the prisoner and the other lads—a policeman in uniform, named Higgings, who is not here, had charge of the prisoner—I was not in uniform—I saw the prisoner draw his hand out of his trousers pocket, throw something away into the mud, and put his foot on it—I saw it fall—I noticed the spot so as to know it again—we then went on to the station-house, and on the road I saw another lad drop a shilling, which I picked up—I afterwards came back to the spot, and found these two florins and this piece of paper in the mud.</p>

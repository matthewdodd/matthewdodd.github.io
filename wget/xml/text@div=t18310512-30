               <p>COURT. Q. Are you able to say that the prisoner never paid you the 5s. 3d. for that leg of mutton? A. I am, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had Mr. Ridley furnished the house with beer? A. No - the prisoner went and fetched a pint of beer when he wanted it; I have a house in Eastcheap, and I live there - I have given up the shop the prisoner was at from the losses I met with; I do not know that he was about to set up in business - he gave notice to his father, and his father came to my house; we had an argument - we had some words; he threatened to take his son instantly out of the house - I deny that I begged him to let him stay a fortnight longer, or I should be ruined, not having a man; I said, "If you please let him remain another week, and I will send my son down to take the money, and see if the charge is well founded;" the shop then answered - his father did not wish to take him away; he gave me the offer - I said,"Let him stay another week," and that I had no one but him to manage the business; I was not in the least intimate with Mr. Ridley, except speaking to him as I passed him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you after this charge make a request that the prisoner should remain with you? A. Yes - he has struck the pen through that 5s. 3d. for the leg of mutton, and he has struck out twenty things that I can get no account of; it is a late invention of his own - the 1l. 18s. 6d. was the money I received that day.</p>

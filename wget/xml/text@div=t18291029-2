On Wednesday evening, the 23rd of September, I went out at half-past six o'clock; my wife had gone out before me - I locked the door, and put the key in a secret place for her when she came home; the window was quite as safe as it had been for twelve months - it is a sort of casement window; I had nailed it up - part of two squares were broken in it; I had covered them with canvas, and pasted paper inside to keep the wind out. I left a clock close to the window, behind the door, and a shirt in the room; I heard something had happened amiss before I came home: I have known the prisoner six years - his father used to work with me; I met him about ten o'clock that night, told him my house was broken open, and I had a strong suspicion of him - he denied it, and I gave him in charge; he was taken to the watch-house - Jessopp, the watchman, searched him, in my presence, and found 1s. 6 1/2d. in his right-hand pocket, and in his fob a duplicate of a shirt.</p>

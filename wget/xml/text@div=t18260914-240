               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. What time was this? A. About half-past nine o'clock; I was afraid to take him that night; it was just twilight; I had seen him once before; I went up again on the Thursday evening with a friend or two - the prisoner came up, and the first thing I saw him do was to take a pair of boots - the officer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140110"></xptr>came to ask me if I had been robbed - the prisoner was taken on the Friday evening; I have seen the prisoner's father; I did not say to him, that if he would pay me 15s., I would make such a representation, that the Grand Jury should throw the bill out; I did not intend anything dishonest, but they were always at my house; they were willing to give me money, but I would not accept of it till the trial was over.</p>

I went there, and found the cart at the Castle, in Castle-yard, at Brentford; I had taken the prisoner within half a dozen yards of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any horses in the cart? - Not when I found it; I took the prisoner and put him into Brentford cage; I never saw the prisoner before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any number on your cart? - Yes, the number board is here broke all to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. When you lost it, was the number board on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found it was there any remains of the number board? - No, the number board was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. If the number board was taken away how did you know it to be your cart? - By particular marks in the cart, the cart is made of each side with a whole board, not joined in two boards as many carts are, likewise the tail board is of one whole board, I know it by the copses which goes across from shaft to waft which goes over the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had this cart? - About a year and a half or two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a painted cart? - The wheels were painted red, I have no doubt but it is my own.</p>

               <p>I live along with a gentleman at Brentford, a servant, the prisoner was absent from Tuesday to Thursday, he is a <rs id="t17931204-29-deflabel162" type="occupation">horse keeper</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. I hired him in my room to do my work while I was gone a couple of days.</p>
               <p>Court to Downing. What sort of business do you do? - The gentleman that I am with, he is rather out of his mind, only fit to be with women, and I was hired to be with him of a night. The prisoner asked me to look after his work; I got out of bed on Thursday morning and I saw a horse tied to a coach wheel, the prisoner called me, and I asked what it was tied there for? the prisoner said have you got the key? yes, says I, come on, says he, and set the horses a feeding, says I, what horse is that? says he it is a horse that came down with me; I was doing his business for him while he was absent, he got me to do it without asking his master leave.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come home that morning? - I went into the yard about a quarter after five as near as I can tell; the horse was tied to the wheel of the coach of one of the Brentford stages; after that I had set the horses feeding he said that he had got a cart up the yard and he would be glad if I would take the number board off.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040071"></xptr>Q. Did he say the horse belonged to that cart? - He said, the horse came down with him, and I went and looked at the number, and did not like to take it off, and told him I could not take it off; says he, it must be taken off; then he goes and takes it off, and asked me to hold the candle, and I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took it off? - He did, and after that, he went and concealed it in the dunghill; he then wanted me to conceal it away to be burnt, and I put it down and trod on it, and broke it, and takes it away to a public house, and put it together again, and saw it was the gentleman's board, where it belonged. I have got it here.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was the board? - Black.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew the board to the prosecutor any time afterwards? - Yes, I brought it him, and shewed it him; I found Mr. Terry at a public house, just by his own house, at about seven o'clock in the evening, by enquiring all over Pancras.</p>

               <p>Q. You found it at Brentford? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You broke it at Brentford? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find your way to Chapel-street, Mary-le-bone? - By the direction on the board. I did not carry the wood with me, I carried him a bit of a note; he went with me to Brentford the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know it? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, when the prisoner came home that morning, was he drunk or sober? - He was not drunk, nor yet sober; he is not a drunken man.</p>
               <p>Court to Terry. Did you know the number? - It is forty-seven thousand some odd number, but I cannot speak positively; I have got it at home in some paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had a wife come down to see me with two children. My master was gone out, and I asked my mistress to go out with them; I went out with them on Tuesday. On Wednesday morning there was a man called me up about half after four, who brought the horse and cart into the yard, and hallooed out postilion; I went to him, says he, my horse is knocked up, says he, give him a feed of corn, and take the cart in; and he desired that I would send them up to the Three Kings, Piccadilly, as soon as I had given him the feed of corn; he desired also to have the cart, and send the horse up by the side of one of the chaises, and he would call for the cart in the course of a day or two.</p>
               <p>Terry. I missed this cart Thursday morning, and I found it concealed in his yard, on Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, you lost it from your door; did you leave it at your door? - There is a piece of ground opposite that, I have the liberty of putting it in. I saw it about five o'clock the over-night; I saw the man take the horses out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Woolwich. On the 14th of Feb. I was standing by Woolwich church-yard, about half-past twelve o'clock at night—the prisoner ran against me, put her hand into my left waistcoat pocket, and took three half-crowns out—she went off—I followed and gave her into custody—I had seen her go into a pork-shop before I suc<lb></lb>ceeded in giving her into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He asked me where I was going to. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I did not speak to her till after we got into the town—I was afraid I should lose her, and I said, "You had better come along with me, I want to speak to you"—she refused—while we were speaking, two men came up, but before that she had had two females with her—the men were saucy to me—I had called the police—I suppose the men were going to thrash me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 298.) I heard a call of "Police!" and found the prosecutor and prisoner together—the prosecutor said he had been robbed of three half-crowns—she said she knew nothing about them, she had not taken them—a few moments elapsed, and I said, "You have got them, I am sure"—she said, "Come on one side," and gave me two half-crowns, on her person was found two shillings and some halfpence, some pudding and pork—I went to the shop where she had been; but, there being so many customers in the shop, they could not tell who they had taken the half-crown of—the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>

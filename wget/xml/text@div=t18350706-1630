                  </hi>. On the 20th of June, I was looking towards the prosecutor's shop, and saw three lads loitering about the window. The prisoners are two of them—I had seen them for about three minutes together, looking at some bills, and looking in at the window; and I have seen them loitering about together down Whitecross-street—they seemed to know each other—they spoke to each other at the window—I saw Norgrove go into the shop, and return immediately with a roll of bed sacking—he gave it to Hill, who came away with it, and went down Mitchell-street—Norgrove and the other person went towards Old-street, in a different direction—I went into the shop, and told Mr. Collins.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. The things that are not ironed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290019"></xptr>Mrs. Fountain brought to her sister to be ironed, as Mr. Davis was going to remove on Monday morning; I pledged them to get some breakfast; her husband was transported last sessions; on Wednesday my own flannel petticoat was very dirty, I put on her's till I washed my own, and Mrs. Davis asked me to get the handkerchief out of pawn; her husband gave her the ticket in Newgate, and when they were gone out I put on these stockings on my own feet, to go and get the handkerchief; being gone a good while Mrs. Davis came to the pawnbroker's after me; I told her I was very willing to go to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutrix.) Are you very sure that the the things which form the subject of the present indictment were at your house on the day that she left your house - A. Every stitch was, upon my oath; she had left me to fold them; she has taken twenty-five pounds worth of things of mine; I am quite sure they are all mine, every one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever authorized this woman to pledge any of these things to accommodate your sisster? - A. My sister never wanted: I always allowed her so much a week.</p>

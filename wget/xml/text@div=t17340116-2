            . I lodge at the White-Bear at Hadley, near Barnet; the Prisoner came thither on Sunday, the 9th of December, about 9 in the Morning, he call'd for a Pen and Ink, and went into a Room to tell some Money. He came out again, in a little Time, and told me and another, he could shew me such a Sight, as I never saw with my Eyes. He pull'd out a Bag, and put twelve 3 l. 12 s. Pieces, and one Guinea into my Hand; from another Bag he took out several other Outlandish Pieces of Gold, but did not tell the Number of them; putting his Hand in his Pocket, he shew'd me Parcel a of Guineas, I can't say how many there might be; and then, opening a Paper, he produc'd a Diamond-ring, and said, he believ'd that was of more Value than all the rest; he likewise pull'd out a Purse of Gold, as he said it was, but he did not open it - and as for Silver I did not see any. He told me that his Master, who (he said) liv'd at Nottingham, had sent him about the Country with Orders to receive this Money for Goods, but I thought it more likely that he had committed some Robbery, or Murder, and so I fetch'd Assistance and apprehended him on suspicion, upon which he at first said he'd make me pay for stopping him on his Journey - But afterwards he own'd that he had robb'd his Master East.</p>

             told my Father, and me, that he suspected the Prisoner, and wanted a Constable. I said any Man might take a Thief. My Father, Humphry Buckle, seiz'd the Prisoner, and said he should go with us before the Justice. The Prisoner refused, and pulling out a Pocket-Book, said, Here's my Orders from my Master in the Country. I did not see the Writing, for he made a Hand of it; but I saw 48 Guineas, 12 Portugal Pieces of 3 l. 12 s. each, and some Doubloons, and double Doubloons, I think they call 'em. The Morning ( after he had been before the Justice ) as I lay by him on the Bed at the White-Bear, he confess'd to me, that he had robb'd his Master East of that Gold, and that he took it out of the Scratoir.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say he had taken any thing else?</p>
               <p>Buckle. Yes, I remember a Piece of White Dimity and some other Things.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tell you where Mr. East lived?</p>
               <p>Buckle. Yes, it was somewhere in London near the Monument; but I forgot the Name of the Street. And he wrote this Letter to his Master, who thereupon came down that Monday Night.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him write the Letter?</p>
               <p>Buckle. Yes, I sat close by him when he writ it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it may be read in Evidence.</p>

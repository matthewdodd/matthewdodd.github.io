             sworn - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a servant belonging to Mr. Restall: I was ordered by Mr. Oliver, on Thursday the 8th of March, to watch the sawyers; the next morning I marked four pieces, and three of them were found in Mr. Fitch's dwelling-house; on Tuesday morning following, about half past eight o'clock, I saw King go and take three or four pieces of scantling, and put them in the saw-pit to his partner Walker; Walker was in the saw-pit; the bottom part of the saw-pit against Mr. Fitch's premises is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110059"></xptr>level with the ground, and an open pale-fence, and to one of the boards there was a nail out at the bottom, so that the board could be put of either side; it was only fastened at the top, and when it was shoved on one side, any thing might be put in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to Fitch's premises with the officer? - A. Yes; I saw some scantlings in his outhouse where the coals were, belonging to Mr. Fitch, I saw seven or eight; I knew three, I had marked them before; Fitch is a publican, he keeps the Cherry-tree.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose if it is necessary for a carpenter or a sawyer to make his work higher or lower when he is at work, at any given piece of wood, he may remove any piece of wood honestly and fairly to make his work more easy? - A. Justly so.</p>
               <p>Q. The man who is at work on the wood can see every body that is in the yard? - A. He might, perhaps, if he had known where I had been watching.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Here is a saw-pit six feet deep; the situation of the man who stood on the top of the wood, could not he see over six feet; he could see you if he had looked round? - A. He could not see me in the yard, because I was not in the yard; I was in a house that looked into the yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Where is this outhouse of Mr. Fitch's, that you saw these scantlings taken from? - A. An outhouse very near the yard of Mr. Restall.</p>
               <p>Q. And there you found three pieces of oak-scantling? - A. There were seven in all, three I had marked.</p>
               <p>Q. How are these premises of Mr. Restall guarded? - A. With high paling; some part is ten feet high, and other parts are not above seven feet, and some part with a brick manufactory at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the outhouse of Mr. Fitch, is that very well secured? - A. Yes, for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. The skittle ground is behind that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a yard that any body may have access to? - A. If they do they have no right.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Tell us how Mr. Fitch's yard is situated: in the first place there is a paling belonging to Mr. Restall, that you have told us is seven feet high; what is Fitch's fence of the other side? - A. I cannot say.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are clerk to Mr. Restall? - A. I am: On Thursday, previous to the thirteenth of March, I marked as many pieces as the sawyers had been collecting together, for some unknown purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they pieces to be sawed up? - A. They were not; they are called oak-scantlings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. By no means to be sawed up? - A. They had been sawed up a year before.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had marked them on Thursday morning did you go there, and did you miss any? - A. I went there every morning after I marked them, but I found more added to them; I had missed some for some time previous to that; but on the Tuesday following, as soon as I went into the yard, I found every piece that I had marked was gone excepting one; I immediately applied to Davis, whom I had put in a situation to watch their conduct.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some information he gave you, you got a warrant? - A. I did, and we, with some officers, went to Fitch's premises on the thirteenth of March; when we went to Fitch's house, we found him at work with a carpenter, making a skittle-frame in the yard; I immediately recognised a piece of fir-scantling, and a piece of fir-batten; it was a piece of fir that I had missed out of the yard; we immediately, in company with the officers, told Fitch that we had come in search after some stolen timber; he said he had got none: Smith then called him on one side; I heard what Smith said; Smith told him that he had a warrant to search his premises, and if he knew of any he had better tell him and the others where it was; he then said, that a man had left some pieces of scantlings for some gentleman over the way; he then pointed to his coal-cellar; the coal-cellar is level with the yard under his dwelling-house; as soon as we approached the coal-cellar, there I found the pieces I had marked; there were seven pieces to the best of my knowledge; in the whole there were four pieces that I had marked, and three Davis had marked; Smith asked him if he had any more, he said not to his knowledge; I then requested him to open the door adjoining his coal-cellar; I believed he called it his wine-cellar, and there I found two oak-ends I had missed out of the yard; I had no private mark on them, but they were such as I am positive that they were my master's property; Mr. Fitch told me these oak-ends were appraised to him when he came into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long since had you seen the oak-ends? - A. I am positive they were in the yard after the twenty-seventh of May, last year.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Fitch kept the house? - A. I do not know; I have very little knowledge of the man; I had marked a piece of fir that was in the skittle-ground; he assured me they were appraised to him; the principal part of the frame I had not missed out of the yard till I saw the fir; they were then framing it and nailing it together, and closing it to some batten that it was confined to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Was it that part that you had not missed before; was it marked before you saw it? - A. There was a bad end; it was marked with an axe mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. There is a great many more men<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110060"></xptr>about this place? - A. Not at that time; there are at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you always upon the spot? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you tell? - A. They are not suffered in the yard without my leave; I had a person watching at this time; he can speak.</p>
               <p>- SMITH sworn. - I went to Fitch's premises with a warrant; I found in the coal-cellar what the last witnesses described, and that which made the skittle-frame was taken away by Mr. Oliver's servant; it is all here; the moment I went into the yard I saw Fitch with the carpenter; I told him I had a warrant to search for some stolen timber; he said, I have none here; a man has left some timber; it is in the coal-cellar; I have not purchased it, nor have I stolen it; he said he had no more than what was in the coal-cellar; I said, are you sure; he said, yes; and when we found more, he said they were appraised to him when he came into the house, about ten months ago; Mr. Oliver identified the piece of frame; he was very ready to let us search; there were two oak ends, that were in the wine-cellar, and two pieces of fir that were in the skittle-ground.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You say he was very ready to let you search? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>(The timber produced and identified by Oliver and Davis.)</p>
               <p>King's defence. I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Walker's defence. I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Fitch's defence. I cannot say any more than what I have said.</p>
               <p>The prisoner King called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Fitch called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

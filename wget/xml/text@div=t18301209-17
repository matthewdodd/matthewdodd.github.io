On the 1st of November I saw the prisoner come out of Half Moon-alley, alone, and cross Bishopsgate-street, with a roll of something, between half-past ten and a quarter to eleven o'clock - I stopped her, and asked where she got what she had; she said it was her own - I took her to the watch-house, and gave her to the night-officer - I heard nothing more: she was a stranger to me.</p>

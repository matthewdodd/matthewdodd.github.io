                  </hi>. I am a rule-maker and live in King-street, Soho. I met the prisoner about half-past one o'clock in the morning on the 25th of April—I was sober—she took me to a court in Broad-street, and we went into a room a there—I put my great-coat on a table—I felt rather sleepy when I had been there some time—I laid down on the bed and dropped asleep—the prisoner and the coat were there then—when I awoke she was gone—in a few minutes two policemen came and asked me if I had lost a coat—I looked and my coat was gone—this is it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>, He asked me if I would give him credit—I said, "No, "and he said he would give me his coat to pledge—I was to have 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and another young woman was to have 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Witness. I told her I had no money—hut I had some—and when I had been with her I should have paid her—I believe I gave her sixpence and fivepence in copper—she did not go to bed with me—she was in the room when I fell asleep—I thought she was going to blackguard me before I went to sleep, and I told her I would satisfy her—she in a manner threatened me—sometime after I entered the room she asked me what I meant to do—I replied that I told her I had no money and she had no right to expect any, and I did not like to go into the room—I never gave her authority to take the coat—I lost a sovereign, a silk handkerchief, and an umbrella beside.</p>

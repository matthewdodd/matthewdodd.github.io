            : I know the prisoner at the bar, he had been in my service two years, I believe; he had quitted my service within about a month of this, perhaps; I had got my father and mother-in-law supping with me, between eleven and twelve o'clock on Sunday night; one door of my house comes into the manufactory, and the other comes into the street; I attended my company to the door about half past eleven, on the Sunday night the 7th of April; my dog took to the centre of the yard, and made a very uncommon noise; I went there and watched, I could see nobody, the candle would not keep a-light; I watched in the yard at the gateway, the place where I supposed he should have come over; I then heard the alarm of my servant, and my wife; I then saw a person attempting to get up, in the inside of my manufactory, into the street; I came round and went out at the other door, and when I got round, I saw him dropping down into the street; I could not perceive whether the person had any thing with him; I pursued him, and perceived another person, which was a watchman, coming to the alarm; the watchman met him first, at the top of Mary-le-bonne-passage, which is about twenty yards from my house; I heard a piece of iron drop; when I came up to him, I found it to be the prisoner at the bar; he then said to me, he hoped I would do him justice, I had always behaved well to him; I told him I most assuredly would; a piece of iron was found in his coat-pocket, I saw it taken from his coat-pocket; I saw two pieces that were dropped, and we went to look if there were any more, and we found another piece; there were between twenty-six and twenty-eight pounds of bar iron, valued at about three or four shillings; the iron was put into two parcels, between the railing, for the convenience of carrying it away.</p>

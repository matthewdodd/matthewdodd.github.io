                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder, in great Queen-street. The pri<lb></lb>soner was in my service for twenty months or two years—he left in the begin<lb></lb>ning of Jan.—on 25th Jan. I saw this book (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>) at Mr. Stibbs', in the Strand—it was one which I had care of for Miss Levy—it was sent to be bound in 1842—I had not missed it—I am positive of it—it must have been in my possession at the close of 1845, because I built some workshops, and this book was stowed away there—I produce a tool which fits the orna<lb></lb>ments in the corners—I bound it myself—a man robbed me formerly, but it was in my possession after he left—I know I moved it when the workshop was completed.</p>

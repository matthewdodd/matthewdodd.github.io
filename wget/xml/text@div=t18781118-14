I live at 23, Little Turner Street, St George's-in-the<lb></lb>East—the deceased Catharine McCarthy resided in the same house—I know the prisoner, he is a sailor—he came from New York on the evening of the 30th October—I saw him and the deceased together at my house between 11 and 12; they were sitting in the kitchen—the deceased was in liquor—they were having a few words—I asked what was the matter—the deceased told me to mind my own business—I stayed with them about an hour-and<lb></lb>a-half—they kept on having words all that time—the prisoner was sober—I left them in the kitchen and went upstairs to bed—the deceased's room was in the parlour leading out of the kitchen—I had been in bed about five minutes when the prisoner halloed, "For God's sake, for God's sake come down"—I did not go down then—shortly afterwards he sang out again and I went down to her room, and found her lying in bed dead, bleeding at the mouth; the prisoner was lying in bed by her right side—he said "I have done it"—I went for a constable—I saw marks of blows on her forehead and her left upper lip was cut right across and that was where the blood was coming from.</p>

I am servant to the last witness and live at her house—the deceased lived there, no one else—the prisoner came in on 30th October, about 9.30 or 10, with the deceased, and they had supper together—I went out for an hour leaving them very comfortable together—when I came back the prisoner was putting on his coat to go out—he said he would do for some of us before the night was out—those were the only words I heard—he then went out and swore he would not come back again—I went out after him to Mrs. Blackleg's, not three minutes off—the deceased sent me—he said he would not come back with me—he said he would not come into the place any more—I went back and in about a quarter of an hour he returned with Mrs. Blackley—he and the deceased were then very com<lb></lb>fortable and happy together—they were very fond of one another—she told me to go out and leave them together, so I walked out—that was about a quarter to 12—I went upstairs to sleep with Cording about half-past 12 or 1—I generally sleep in the kitchen—after I had been upstairs I heard the prisoner call out "Eliza, Eliza, come down, I have done it"—she ran down and I ran after her and saw the deceased lying dead on the bed, and the prisoner lying alongside of her—she was bleeding from the mouth, her lip was split and her forehead all bruised—there had not been anything the matter with her before—she had been drinking all day and was very aggra<lb></lb>vating.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 176, Commercial Road—I was sent for and found the deceased lying dead in the bed—she had a wound on the right upper lip and there was blood from that on her face and neck, and on the bedclothes—I made a post-mortem examination—there were two bruises in the centre of the forehead close together, one on the chin and one in the centre of the upper lip, the bruises were each larger than a shilling—they would probably be caused by a fist, or a fall—they were not serious, I believe they were recent—the cut was a lacerated cut, not a clean cut, cutting through the lip to the extent of half an inch outside and inside, running to a point to the extent of an inch and a quarter—that might have been caused by a blow from a fist—on opening the head there was congestion of the membranes of the upper part of the brain generally, and a large clot of blood at the base of the brain—she was not in a healthy state, many of the organs were diseased—I believe they were not sufficiently diseased to cause death independently of the blow—in my opinion the cause of death was extravasation of blood at the base of the brain, caused by violence—I believe a blow from the fist would be sufficient to cause it—there was nothing else to account for death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. With such diseased organs drink would be a very bad thing, or to engage in quarrels—it must have been some material violence which caused the clot of blood, I don't think mere excitement would do it</p>

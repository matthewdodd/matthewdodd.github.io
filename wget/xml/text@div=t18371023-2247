                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Williams, and live in James-place, Stepney-causeway, in the hamlet of Ratcliffe, in Stepney parish. On the 13th of October I was sitting at my tea—I was called out by my next-door neighbor, and went to the door—I saw the prisoner, in a ruffians sort of way, having a neighbor's little boy by his two arms, inside his door—he was threatening him that he would beat him I and ill use him—I asked the boy what he had been doing to the man—the boy, in a flood of tears cried and said, "Nothing, Mrs. Williams"—the prisoner said he would do for the boy, and said he had been making noise—I turned round and said, "Fetch his father and mother"—on my saying that, the prisoner made use of a very bad expression—he called me a b----b----, and jumped out of his house, and said he would make father and mother of me—he ran out of his own house, and knocked me down with his fist—he struck me about the head and face—one blow knocked me down—he hit me on the face with his list, and then kicked me on the head, and in different parts of my body—he struck me three or four times with his fist after I was down—my eyes struck fire—there was like sparks of fire came out of my eyes—he kicked me either three or row times, I cannot say which—he kicked me on the back of my neck, make shoulder, and right arm, and on my head—and he kicked me in * * * *—he tore my petticoats all off, every string, even to my pocket—I lost 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was rolled up in a bit of white paper—I had wounds from the kicking and beating—the surgeon attended me eight days—I</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, James-place. I was present on this occasion—I heard the cries of the children—I had a boy of my own, about nine years of age, with the children—I went out and saw the pri<lb></lb>snore, having James Phillips, a boy, by the arm—I asked the boy what he had done—I was at the prisoner's door—the prisoner said what was that to me making use of a very bad expression—the boy said he had done nothing—I called Mrs. Williams out—she went to the prisoner and Baked him what the boy had done—the boy answered, Nothing—the prisoner said nothing at that time—Mrs. Williams said, Don't ill use ton, send for the boy's mother or father"—Mrs. Williams turned round to go home, and the prisoner followed her to No. 6, where he knocked her down—I think, to the best of my knowledge, the blow struck her on the head—when he had knocked her down, he repeated the blows five or six times on the head and face, with his fist—he then jumped on the back part of her peck, between the shoulders—and in her turning round to try to get up, he stepped on her chest—I cannot say whether he turned her round, or whether she turned round herself—when he jumped on the back of her neck, her back was towards the ground, at least sideways—she toned on her back, and he stepped on her chest, and then kicked her twice, to my knowledge * * * * both behind and before.</p>

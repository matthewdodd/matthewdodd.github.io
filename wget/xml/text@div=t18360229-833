                  </hi>. I keep the Bull and Crown, in Kingsland-road. On the morning of the 20th of February, there were some recruits in my house—they came to the tap-room—the prisoner came in at the same time with a strange man—they had a pint of porter, and one of the recruits had half a quartern of rum in a glass, with a spoon in it—I served them with the pint of porter, and the recruit with the rum; and after the recruits were gone, the prisoner removed to the side where the recruits had been—I went to take the glass away, the prisoner was using it with the porter, and the spoon was gone—I went and asked my wife if she had taken the spoon—while I was doing that, the glass was missing—the prisoner then left the house—I followed her, and asked what she had got—she said</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ruislip. On Wednesday, the 6th of Jan., I saw the two prisoners, between five and six o'clock in the evening—they came for some bread and butter—I knew them before—I am quite sure they are the persons—they took four shillings out of a three-quarter pot on the mantel-shelf at the time I was serving them—I saw them at what they should not be at—they were reaching up at the pot—they both stood over the pot—there was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pot—they left the shop immediately after they got the two last half-quartern loaves—I then examined my money, and four shillings were gone out of the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I pursued after the prisoners—it was very dark—I could not overtake them—I had seen them reaching up to the mantel-piece, and that made me examine the mug immediately—they stood close together, and both reached their hands up—the money had been put into the mug that afternoon, two or three hours before—no one had been in be<lb></lb>tween my seeing the money safe and missing, it but the prisoners—nobody lives there but myself—I am a lone man—I have neither wife nor child.</p>

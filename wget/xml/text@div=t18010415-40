               <p>Q. Was that the same sort and quality of wool that you had in your warehouse? - A. Yes; the constable searched him, and found three quarters of a pound more in the back part of his breeches and in his great coat pocket, exactly of the same sort of wool.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of its being your's? - A. No; I will swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Other people may have the same sort of wool? - A. No; mine is a particular sort of wool.</p>
               <p>Q. It is such wool as you never had before, or never will again, unless by a miracle? - A. I dare say we shall have such again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that no other persons have not the same sort of wool? - A. It is what we call prime wool, from different sorts of sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. South Down? - A. None South Downs; that makes me so perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this wool drest, or undress? - A. Drest.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the same man who drest that wool, had not drest wool for other persons? - A. Yes, I would.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that person? - A. The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the prisoner is the only person in the world who has the skill to dress wool in that way? - A. No; there are many men, I dare say, that dress wool in that way; this was a sort that no sorters ever send out in that way; it was all the best of the choice lot that goes into the Prime, that makes me so positive.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear that he never dressed any wool for himself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know? - A. I should suppose not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you access to other woolstaplers? - A. Yes, a great many; and we can hardly find any sorts that are just like ours.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body with whom he worked before would dress like him? - A. Very likely.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you venture to swear that on that day there was any deficiency? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>- DAVIES sworn. - I am a constable, (produces the wool); I took it from the breeches of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Swaine. This is the sort of wool that I lost.</p>

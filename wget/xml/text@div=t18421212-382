                  </hi>. I am a dealer in osiers, and live in Red Lion-street, Spitalfields. These are golden willows—I have vast quantities of them—they grow very commonly about—I have sold the prisoner some—here is one that came from Squire Russell's park, and here is another that has passed through my hands.</p>

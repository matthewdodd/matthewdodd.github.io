                  </hi>. I am a daughter of the last witness, and am fifteen years of age. On 11th May I saw the prisoner in the shop, and after he had gone, my father said something to me—on the following Saturday, 16th May, he came again, bought something, and paid for it—after he had left the shop. I spoke to my father, and he went after the prisoner, and brought him back, having looked at the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece which the prisoner had given him—he then gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

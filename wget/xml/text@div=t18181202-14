               <p>Q. On the day you paid the money you had five 50 l. notes - A. Yes; two of them I paid to Messrs. Drummond, one to a Mr. Bray, and the other two, I am certain, were paid for this receipt.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Littler. About five or six months ago I met the prisoner, Faulkner, and another man, at the corner of Whitcombe-street, he said he was going to draw 100 l. out of the savings bank, just above and he would give me 1 l. to go with him. I said I would go if I could do him any good. When we got to Panton-street, opposite the saving bank, it was not open. We stepped into the road, he then said one of the stewards of the society was ill, and he wanted me to sign his name - I have forgot the name he mentioned. I told him I would not do it for 500 l. I left him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you give this account - A. I was having a horse shod, they were speaking of the business, and I mentioned it.</p>

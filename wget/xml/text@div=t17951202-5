               <p>I am a beadle; I was at the watch-house when the prisoner, Wiles, was brought, on the 23d November, between ten and eleven at night; I searched him, and found this duplicate (producing it) in the fob of his breeches; it has been in my possession ever since; the prosecutor, Davis was present; I asked him if there was any body concerned with him; he said, there was; that he was a little man, a breeches maker. The constable said it was Osmend, and went and fetched him; and he confessed, voluntarily, that he took the things, and gave then to Wiles; he confessed the same before the magistrate; he said he took the bundle and gave the soldier, and he put it under his coat, and went out undiscovered; this was the confession of both of them.</p>

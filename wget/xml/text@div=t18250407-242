On the 30th of March, these baskets were in my parlour, but in consequence of a fire, which took place between two and three o'clock in the morning, in the next house, we were obliged to go out; our house was open, and the neighbours removed some of our property - the two baskets were left behind me in the room.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner that morning when I was at the fire; she said she had lost all she had at the fire - I afterwards overtook her with a bundle on her head, and asked her where she brought it from; she said, from High-street, Mary-le-bone - I said,</p>
               <p>"I have a suspicion you brought them from the fire;" she then threw it down, and d - d me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Are they your's?" she then took out the two baskets, and said,</p>
               <p>"You rascal. these are my daughter's baskets, they came from Paris;" I said,</p>
               <p>"If they are your own, you shall go to the watch-house."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say, that these two baskets were what a gentleman gave me to take care of, as they belonged to his daughter, who had brought them from Paris? A. No, you did not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man in a rusty black coat, gave me a shilling to carry them for him; I said I was going out to a day's work and he gave me a drop of beer, and took my bonnet off my head and left me without it; I have lived in respectable families, but I am now reduced; and had been but a few days out of the work-house; I lost my father and my eldest son in the flames, and have been reduced to the greatest distress.</p>

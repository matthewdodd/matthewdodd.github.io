                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Indiarubber, Gutta Percha, and Telegraph Works Company—I produce a Certificate of Incorporation—they carry on their business at 100, Cannon Street—they also have works at Silvester, in Essex—the officer has the letter of the 4th November, after receiving which I went to 21a, Hyde Park Place, and saw the prisoner Tow, and spoke to him with reference to certain goods which had been delivered to them—I asked him to settle for them—I also asked what had become of the goods, as I saw no signs of them being there; and he said they had used them up—I know of some indiarubber sheets being sent to Hyde Park Place, No. 21a—the first delivery was on the 15th November, the second on the 4th December, and the last on December 9th—there was some indiarubber sheet and packing—the value altogether would be 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am not certain as to the day I called, but it would be about the 1st December, at all events before the 4th, before the last delivery of goods—Tow said he represented the firm—he said Fennell was in the City, or in the country, I am not sure which—I think it was the City this time, but he told me different stories at different times—he said the firm was doing a large business in Belgravia—they were fitting up houses there—I believed this account at the time, and we supplied them with further goods after<lb></lb>wards—when I asked him what had become of the sheet rubber, he said it was used up in some billiard rooms for flooring—that was on the 10th</p>

               <p>December perhaps—I applied many times after for payment—I applied at Bayswater Road—that is Hyde Park Place—I did not receive any money—I always saw Tow—I was a special constable—I took Tow into custody in Hyde Park Place—it was the same day he was examined at the Mansion House—I was not alone—we came away quietly, and did not accuse him till we got to the station, when we accused him of obtaining goods under false pretences—he said he was a clerk to Fennell &amp; Co.—I afterwards (with others) went over the house, 21a, Hyde Park Place, and found it was empty—there were eight rooms—there was a desk and a book in one room, and a few papers—that was the room I always saw Tow in—before the goods were sent, those two letters were received—likewise the third.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> From what you have seen of Tow's handwriting, you believe that to be it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have soon him about twenty times—at Hyde Park Place sometimes—I did not see him write those letters—I did not dictate the letters—I saw him writing while I was at business in the office—I was talking—I never inspected his handwriting—I did not read the letters he wrote—I pledged the goods myself in my own name and proper address—I never borrowed money on the ticket—it was said to be lost; but unfortunately it turned out not to be lost—it was said I lost it—I don't know what became of it—I gave it to Fennell—Tow worked as a clerk to Fennell—I was not aware there was a firm—I had not the pleasure, at all events, of knowing it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Tow write letters?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I suppose he ordered goods, but I don't know much of the particulars of the office—I saw them after they were redeemed at Layland's—the goods were removed from the pawnbroker's to a warehouse, and thence to Layland's—as to the ticket king lost, Fennell came to my house and accused me of losing it—he said he had a customer for the goods and wanted the ticket—I looked for it but thought I could not have had it—it could not be found—then he said, "You must go and make a declaration"—I did not know of money being raised on the ticket. (<hi rend="italic">The letters containing the orders for the goods were read. They fere dated the 4th, 8th, and llth of November. A memorandum of the 3rd of December was read, as follows: "Gentlemen,—The bearer will look out what I require, as follows. Please send them to-morrow, if possible. "A list of india<lb></lb>rubber goods was attached to this memorandum</hi>.)</p>

I took Pennicaud and Fennell into custody—Pennicaud on the 13th, and Fennell on the 20th—he asked me, on the way to the station, for his cheque-book, which I refused to give him—there did lot appear to be any business carried on at the house at Hyde Park Place—he was at 4, Windsor Terrace, Kensal Green—Tow gave mo as his address, "11, Tyndal's Buildings, Gray's Inn Lane"—it is a lodging-house.</p>

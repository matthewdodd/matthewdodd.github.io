            . I am an officer. On the 19th of April, between eight and nine in the evening, I stopped the prisoner in Worship Street, he was carrying this canvass, it was all in this outside wrapper, it looked like a truss. I asked him what he had got there, he said he had got this bundle to carry to a shop in the Borough, or to some Inn in the Borrough, I asked him whether he had a bill of parcels, he said no, I took him to the public-house next door to the office, and opened the bundle, and found it contained the goods now present, he told me it was to go to one Mr. Essey at Portsmouth, who kept an old iron shop. I took care of the property, and Bishop and my son went in search of the owner. I have had the property ever since.</p>

            . I am an officer, I just came up after Armstrong had taken the prisoner, and in consequence of what the prisoner said about Mr. Newman on the following day, I, in company with the prisoner, went to Mr. Newman's house in Willow-walk; on searching the lower apartment, I found this old sailcloth, it is ochred over with red ochre The prisoner said he had brought it there and was going to carry it into the Borough for Mr. Essey of Portsmouth.</p>

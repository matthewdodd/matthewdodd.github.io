I live at 13, Plummer's Row, and am the wife of Johan Tannervitz, a dyer—the prisoner lodged with me on Mon<lb></lb>day, 30th March—about 3.30 on the afternoon of that day I was making his bed with Catherine Furness—the prisoner was in the room, and his things were packed up—he said that he wanted to go away—and I said "You had better wait till my husband comes home"—I said "Where shall I get my rent from"—he said "I know perfectly well where Plummer's Row is, and where No. 13 is, and I will send the rent"—I said that I was not satisfied, that I could not run after him in London"—then he took his boots underneath his arm, and a little box in his right hand—I took it from him and went towards the bed—I received three stabs with a knife on the chin and each side of the cheek—I fell on the bed, got up, and ran down stairs—the prisoner followed, and, before I left the room, he stabbed me in the left breast—I got out of the room, and down the stairs, but before I came to the street door he had stabbed me seven times in the back—I got outside into the street, and ran into the arms of another woman—I returned to the street door, and fell down, and I don't know any more about it—when I recovered consciousness I was in the hospital, and was there seven weeks—I saw that the prisoner had a dagger in his hand when I was stabbed.</p>

I am the prosecutrix's servant—on Monday, 30th March, I was making the bed with her, and the prisoner was in the room—I heard him say that he intended to go away—my mistress told him he had better wait till her husband came home—he took his stick down from the wall, and struck her with it on the back and head, and the handle fell off—she screamed, and went down stairs—he ran after her, took a white handled knife out of his pocket, and struck her, on the stairs, once in the back and once in the breast—I followed her out in the street—she ran into a woman's arms and fainted—the prisoner ran after me, and one of the neighbours pulled me in—the prisoner followed my mistress to the door—I remained in the neighbour's house five minutes, and my mistress was taken to the hospital.</p>

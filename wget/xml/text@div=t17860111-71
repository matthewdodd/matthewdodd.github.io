               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Le Mesurier; on the 13th of December, about four in the afternoon I was going to my business after dinner, and I saw a man in the passage taking the lamp, I had no thought of his having bad designs, I thought the lamp wanted some repairing, and the man wanted to take it down, I saw no more of him, the lamp was taken down, the lamp was gone, and I went to my business.</p>

               <p>From the sight you had of that man, was it the prisoner? - It was rather dark, it was about four, the man was dressed in a light-coloured coat, I believe that man was not the prisoner.</p>

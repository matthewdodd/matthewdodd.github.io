               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had called on an employer in Windmill-street - the weather being cold, I was running at a gentle pace; I was knocked down by a gentleman's servant, and as soon as I rose I was seized by the witness, who said I had stolen a coat - I said I had not; he sent for an officer - it does not seem feasible that I should steal the coat: surely I am not to be robbed of my liberty, and every thing dear to me, on the evidence of one witness; what the witness says is false.</p>

               <p>What is the value of it? put the lowest value on it. - Two shillings, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Have you had it any time? - I have had it these thirty years, but it was whole and good; and I then said, Good God! watchman, this is my bundle; why, says he, if so, you are robbed; so I dropped the bundle down, and ran home, and alarmed my family, and I ran up three pair of stairs, where I knew this gown was, and there I missed what are contained in the indictment; they were all in the two pair of stairs and in the garret, that I am quite sure of, I saw them that day in their proper places, not tied up in a bundle; when I missed these things, I went down stairs, and the watchman brought in the bundle, and it contained the things mentioned in the indictment, except the looking glass in a mahogany frame, which was taken away intirely; there were in the bundle, including the blanket that tied up the bundle, three woollen blankets, value twelve shillings, I have had them some time, I do not know the blankets by any marks, only missing them from the bed; two pair of linen sheets, value 10 s. I do not know that they had any mark, I only suppose them to be mine by missing them from the bed; there was one woollen surtout coat, value 14 s. this is it which I have on; it was not finished, and had not the buttons then, I can swear to it, it was my own making, there was a pair of velvet breeches, that were in my room; the value of them is about seven shillings, they were not finished, they were my son's work, the stuff cost me seven and sixpence, they were in the garret, there was a cloth coat belonging to one of my lodgers, which I had to repair; that was in the room, I know the coat extremely well, it was a blue one, it had my work in it, I value that at three shillings; I kept the things, but I have not brought them with me.</p>
               <p>In what situation was your family at that time? - There were some in the fore room, and some in the kitchen, the garret windows were entirely broke; one of the casements entirely broken wide enough to let in the body of a man, I was in the garret about four.</p>
               <p>It was light then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is your house adjoining this empty house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any possible communication from this empty house to this garret window? - They got in at the back door of this empty house and got up stairs and out of the garret window, and went along the leads to our house.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any disturbance in the garret at any time? - No, but I have no doubt, but they came in that way, they broke one casement all to pieces; that was the casement that was fixed, not the one that opens, I imagine they put their hands through to undo the other casement, because the other was open but not broke.</p>
               <p>Can you speak whether the other window was open when you last saw it? - I am sure it was not, there is a bed in the room, and I pasted paper all round the casement, and I am sure it was all safe when I saw it; the watchman afterwards brought this chap.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Your family were not gone to bed? - No.</p>
               <p>You had not shut up your house fast all over? - No.</p>
               <p>It was as it is in the day time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not as it is when you go to bed? - No.</p>
               <p>What is the value of these old second-hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230060"></xptr> things, would not seven or eight and twenty shillings be the value of them? - No, nor two pounds nine neither.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman in this neighbourhood, my box is opposite the empty house, I came out between eight and nine, and I examined the back door of this empty house, and it was seemingly fast.</p>
               <p>I what way did you examine it? - I shoved my stick against it in the usual way, and it appeared to be fast, I examined about the court, at that minute I heard the bolt of a door, or something like it put back; I turned about, and saw a man with a bundle, and another man underneath that rushed out, and two others.</p>
               <p>Who had the bundle? - I do not know; the prisoner at the bar and another man rushed out, immediately after this I looked about, and then I called out stop thief! and sprung my rattle and ran, but the three were soon out of sight.</p>
               <p>Was there any lamp near the door? - It was quite light, the lamp was not quite four yards from this door I am sure, besides my lanthorn gave a very good light; I ran after them, and when I came to the prosecutor's door, I came up to the man that had the bundle, and made a blow at him, and came within a blow of him, and he dropped the bundle; I do not know him, I saw only his back.</p>
               <p>Did the two men come out at the same instant? - Yes, the two first and the two last.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the prisoner at the bar was one of them? - I am sure he was one of the two last that came out, he with the bundle came out first, and another man along with him.</p>
               <p>Did they all four run? - Yes, but the other three run faster than the man with the bundle, one of the two last had something under his arm, which appeared to be a glass; I saw something of the frame, something of wood, but I did not see the glass.</p>
               <p>Can you say, whether the prisoner was one of the two last or the two first? - One of the two last, but there was very little difference between them.</p>
               <p>Was it the prisoner or the other that had the wood underneath his arm? - I am not sure which of the two had it, but still I am of opinion that it was the other, the man dropped it, and I stumbled against it, and it tumbled me over and over, that hindered me from having them; he who had the bundle was last then, I then sprung my rattle, and the prosecutor came out.</p>
               <p>When did you take the prisoner? - This was the 8th of January, and the 15th I was was walking through Whitecomb-court, and I saw the prisoner and two girls of the town together, and I knew him again and took him.</p>
               <p>Can you speak with certainty, that the prisoner at the bar was one of the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did you see him? - He only looked about he went off as quick as thought, he went along as quick as he could I dare say, for he knew me.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner at the bar before? - Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>Do you know his person? - I do.</p>
               <p>Ho w long have you known him? - I have seen him several times since May last.</p>
               <p>Was there any conversation between you and the prisoner at the time of the robbery? - Not a single word, I had seen him several times before.</p>
               <p>Had you conversed with him before? - No, never, but I have seen him in company.</p>
               <p>Did you know him by name? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him when you took him? - I do not remember any particulars, it was in an entry in a public house, I went in, there were liquors, he paid for his liquor, and asked me to drink, I said no.</p>

               <p>What is the name of that public-house? - One Sargent keeps it; I then followed him, and told him he should come with me, he asked where, I said he should know by and by; he seemed agreeable to come, and I thought to have made him fast, and when he came to the door he sprung away, and said, you buggerer you have not got me yet.</p>
               <p>Did he get clear away from you? - Yes, he got into Sydney's-alley, and two gentlemen stopped him.</p>
               <p>How long did you lose sight of him? - About a minute, and then I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. But hark ye! my master watchman, you knew this man from having seen him in company several times? - I never was in his company, but I have seen him drink a glass.</p>
               <p>Did you pursue these people that came out of the house? - Yes, or I would not have got the fall I did.</p>
               <p>You did not take any of them? - No.</p>
               <p>From the 8th to the 14th, did you lodge any information against the prisoner, before any Magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>As you knew the man, how happens you did not? - Because I thought I could soon meet with him, and I did not know his name.</p>
               <p>Do you remember asking him to give you a glass of gin that night, when you took him? - I remember I did not, I searched him.</p>
               <p>Did you search his lodgings? - Never.</p>
               <p>You have never found any of the property of this man, except what was taken from the first man that came out? - No.</p>
               <p>What sort of night was it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>It was a sort of a by place? - It was Whitcomb-street.</p>
               <p>This man past you as quick as thought? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So you think yourself warrantable upon that, to come here and swear positively to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Well, you may get twenty pounds by it, perhaps? - I do not want a farthing.</p>

               <p>As I was coming from Market-lane, I had been to one Mr. Innes, an acquaintance of my father's; I went into a house the corner of Coventry-street, and two young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230063"></xptr> women said, it was a very cold night; the watchman came in, and asked me to give him a glass of something, I denied him because I did not know him; he went out at the door, and turned round, and asked me who I was, I said, I was a cabinet-maker; says he, you must come with me, I went, and when he came to the door, I said, I had done nothing, and I will not go with you; when he took me to the watch-house, he said, he had several suspicions of me, for foot-pads, and burglaries; he said, he knew nothing of me himself, but he said, he could bring some body to swear to me, I do not know at this time where the gentleman lives, nor the street; I had been moving that day, which was the 8th of January, all the day, from Lambeth to Covent-Garden, and my wife and father was putting up the things in the room, and I returned home about seven or eight at night; the woman that lives in the one pair of stairs let me in, and she said, I believe your father or wife are gone out, will you come in; I went to my sister's and returned, and the gentlewoman can prove I went up stairs soon after, and was not out afterwards; the watchman said, in my presence, that he never saw any body come out of the empty house.</p>

               <p>Court. The prisoner has said, that you have declared, you never saw any body come out of the empty house, in his presence; is that true, did you make any such declaration? - No.</p>

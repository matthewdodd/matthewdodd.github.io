                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Butterworth and Co., paper and rag merchant, of Manchester, who have several branch establishments in England and Wales—their London branch is at Weston Street, Bermondsey—the prisoner has been their manager there for I think six years, at a salary of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he could make sales, and his duty was to enter them and report them to Manchester—a sale would be entered first in the sale-book, and on the delivery of the goods they would be entered in the delivery-book, and, being sent to the customer, an invoice would be made out the same day—that ought to be copied into a book, and copies taken in triplicate, one of which would be sent to Manchester, one would remain in London, and one would be sent to the customer—the money, when received, would be entered by the prisoner, first in the cash-book and then into the ledger—he would give a receipt for the cash and advise Manchester of it—he would retain the money for the purposes of the business—crossed cheques, or cheques requiring endorsement, he would send to Manchester—that rule was invariable—if otherwise, he could cash them at the bank on which they were drawn—this is a copy of our rules for his guidance; it was either on his desk or close to him—rule 10 is: "Particulars of all contracts, purchases, and sales to be entered in books for the purpose, and at the time they are made"—No. 17 is: "Cash accounts and receipts for all payments to be posted every Saturday, or Monday at the atest, up to Saturday night"—No. 24 is: "All cash, bills, cheques, &amp;c, received by post or otherwise, to be given to cashier as soon as possible, with written statement of particulars of them in a book for that purpose initialled the person giving and receiving the same, intact"—No. 30 is: "A second copy of all letters and invoices you write to come here (Manchester) daily</p>

Forwarded to St. Neots"—the 72 is a private mark to designate the quality—they are both very fine qualities, first and second—the bales are packed by hydraulic pressure—it was the prisoner's duty to enter the invoices in the delivery-book, invoice-book, and copy-book—I find no entry of a sale to Toogood Brothers on August, 1874, in any of the books of the firm—this receipt is in the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Toogood Brothers, to E. Butterworth and Co. To goods, 371<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "July 31st, 1874. Received cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. These last two cheques I have had to get a man to put them through the bank for me, because Smith Payne will not pay them unless you put across them 'Smith, Payne, and Smith.'") For the purpose of our London business we issue cheques to Smith Paynes, and the cashier forgot to write that, and Smith Payne would not alter it—I was not aware of the prisoner having a banker of his own till the day before we gave him in custody—the endorsement on this cheque is in his writing, he had no authority to endorse cheques—this invoice is in the prisoner's writing: "October 1st, 1874.

He had no authority to en<lb></lb>dorse that—I find no entry in the books by the prisoner of the receipt of that cheque between 14th May and September 7 th—the prisoner took stock at the London house from June, 1874, to December 1875—I took stock in June, 1874, and again in 1876, when I found a deficiency of 160 to 165 tons and about 2,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—I told the prisoner that, and he seemed very much surprised—he said that he could not believe it, there must be a mistake somewhere and he would try and find it out—I then put a man named Henderson to act as his cashier, and the prisoner subse<lb></lb>quently gave me notice to leave—I had frequent conversations with him after that, each time 1 saw him—he left on 14th December and I told him on that day that we should begin to investigate the accounts—he said you find out that, if I have done anything wrong I will make it good,</p>

               <p>to work all my life for it"—the week after that I saw him, having a paper in my hand with an account of the deficiencies—I said that since I saw him before I had, been investigating the accounts and I had discovered where some of the deficiencies had gone to—he said "Where is it?"—I! said "It Is in Toogood's account," and I enumerated the different items, and as I read each he said "Yes," and seemed to assent, except on some items, to which he took exception, and I found that those items were in<lb></lb>correct—he assented to those two items, 371<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 227<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which were included in the list—I asked him for an explanation—he said "Well, I have had the money, but as there is a God in Heaven, I do not know what I have done with it," and he said that he would pay it—I said "Will you do so at once?"—he said "No, but I will repay it"—he was given in custody—on the way to the station he said "Do you remember the remark I made, that if you found out anything I would make it right?"—I said "Yes"—he said "If you will not go on with the prosecution I will pay you 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum till it is all paid back. I can work and you know that I can work, and I will show you a statement showing that I can repay it"—I said "How can you possibly repay us the amount you have taken, 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the least"—he said "I don't care if it is six, I will pay you if you do not prosecute, but if you do you will not get anything."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He entered the service in 1868 I think, as traveller, and was made manager in 1871—he occasionally had to travel in the country and abroad—about twenty-five persons altogether were employed at the London branch—the firm is composed of Mr. Edwin Butterworth and myself—about 1873 and 1874 we purposed to shut up the London business for eighteen months, owing to the loss on which we were trading in London, and a board was actually prepared, saying that the premises we to let—I do not know whether it was put up—we did not instruct the prisoner to buy nothing during that time, we probably told him to sell only that which he had in stock—this is our original letter of 24th July, 1873. (this <hi rend="italic">was addressed to the "prisoner, stating that there was a deficiency</hi> of 2,670<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and that until the matter was unravelled he was not to buy anything</hi>.) I took no stock between then and June, 1876—there are great losses of goods of this description if kept long, and the turn over is, on an average 40 tons a week—there is a loss owing to what is called waste, but not a great loss—our instructions to the prisoner were to enter the goods at the weights invoiced—short weight would be debited in another book, or else he entered the net weight—the fair average loss on high grain rags is 1 1/2 per cent., and on low grain rags, probably 3 per cent.—that is the loss on the premises—rags shipped from abroad sometimes vary in weight, and sometimes they come out exact—a quantity of rubbish is found among rags, so valueless that it is not worth carting away—the prisoner gave us fourteen days notice to leave—I had not heard before I came to London that he was going into partnership with Mr. Carrington, a rag merchant, but I heard it subsequently—he left on 14th December, saying that he would return on the 16'th, which he did, and he was written to to come to the office on the 21st—he suggested that his brother-in-law should go through the accounts see if anything was owing between him and us, and if so he said that would work all his life to pay us, and would pay us 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—it was not 200 per cent.—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) about discounting two drafts, refers to bills of exchange—I have never seen cheques sent to Manchester,</p>

               <p>bearing on them "Central Bank of London," as being the bank they had passed through—our bankers in Manchester keep our cancelled cheques we never see them—Smith Paynes are the London agents of our Manchester bank—the prisoner would take any open cheque to the bank on which it is drawn, and they would pay it—we deduct for waste every six months in the balancing—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) shows it. (<hi rend="italic">This contained an entry</hi> "Loss in weight 41 tons; cash, 318<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., January 1st, 1876.") The stock taking is in the prisoner's writing—the deduction for waste is in my writing—I was not present when the stock was taken, but I came up a few days afterwards—bills of exchange were sent to the prisoner, with instructions to send them to certain discount houses and pay the proceeds to our bankers—they amounted to 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but not at one time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Mr. Ashford was employed by our firm in London—the idea of closing the London branch had been abandoned in 1874—I am able to say from his writing in the books, and from the letter we had from the prisoner, that he was in London when he received these two cheques—it was his duty, if Toogood corrected the weights, to make entries of it in the books—this notice to produce was sent to me from London to Manchester last Friday, but I had left before it arrived—the cheques for the last eight years are not in our custody—the prisoner would get private letters from us in 1874, 1875, and 1876—there are no letters that I know of from us to Mankey in London subsequently to August, 1863, about closing the London branch—the deficiency in weight excludes the 40 tons of waste—he gires credit for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one is the result in weight, and the other in money—at the time he proposed that his brother-in-law should go into the accounts, we had not got these documents from Toogood.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. The loss of weight, if it had been in the place, would have been worth so much, so the absence of goods produced absence of funds—we include the weight for six months only—we began with the actual weights in the establishment in January, and on 30th June we took what was actually in the place—the books show that a certain amount of weight should remain, but we found so much less; 20 or 30 tons out of 160—the prisoner, I believe, had access to all these papers which were taken at Dartford.</p>

I am a wholesale importer of wines and spirits, and a commission agent, at 24, Cranbourne Street, Leicester Square, acting for a person residing abroad—I have been in the trade about twelve years—at the end of April, 1874, a rag collector, named Bryce, of Chonie, near Rouen, came to me and said that he had some rags in London, which had been consigned to a Mr. Sigus, which he wished me to get him a customer—for—they were not then unloaded—I went to the prisoner, who went with</p>

I paid the cheque to ray bunkers—the entry is "Two sorts of French rags, first and second quality"—I have heard of a rag merchant in London, named Rechard—Sigus was agent for a M. Sieger, he did not trade on his own account—Sigus has told me that Mankey had transactions with him, he was the only person I put in communication with I him—it was Sigus who gave me Mankey's address—after that first transaction, I was present when an arrangement was made between Sigus and Mankey to supply Mankey with rugs—I was the agent between the parties, I and took a commission from Sigus as vendor, and from Mankey as purchaser—this contract was entered into between them; it is in my writing, (<hi rend="italic">This was in French, and was a contract between Sigus and the prisoner, dated</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 5,000 <hi rend="italic">kilos of rags, to be delivered at the quay in London</hi>, <hi rend="italic">specifying the quality and prices</hi>.)

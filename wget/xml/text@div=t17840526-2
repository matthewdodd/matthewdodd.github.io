               <p>Did you hear any body in the night? - No, I did not; when I got up I missed two guineas and a half, that was in my breeches pocket under the foot of the bed, I did not miss my money till a sailor, to whom a guinea and a half belonged, came and asked me for it, that was about nine in the morning, the money was in my pocket when I went to bed, I am positive to that; one of the witnesses came to me and asked me for his bag, which I had in my custody; when I went up I found the bag was cut open, and a coat was taken out, the coat that was taken out belonged to one M'Mullens, and a handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. It was in my custody; I also lost a silk handkerchief of mine; I believe one Mr. Lee went down first, if the things had not been found upon him, I could not have said that he robbed me.</p>
               <p>When had you any conversation with him about this fact? - When he was taken, which was the same day.</p>
               <p>Was his confession taken in writing? - Yes, it was taken down I believe.</p>
               <p>When did you first hear him confess any thing? - The same day before the Justice; he was taken at ten at night, he was going in the stage to Portsmouth, I was present, there was seven shillings and fourpence halfpenny on him, and a coat, and a handkerchief round his neck.</p>
               <p>(The handkerchief produced and deposed to by the Prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I lodge at the prosecutor's on the 10th of March I rose in the morning between five and six, and came down stairs, it was just between light and dark, I went to the backyard and found the door unbolted that leads to the street, it was just drawn to, but not quite to, I took the prisoner myself about a quarter after ten at night, on the 11th of March, we had some suspicion of him, he had the prosecutor's handkerchief round his neck, and this coat on his back, I brought him to the prosecutor's, he said when I took him, O good Lord!</p>
               <p>Did you ask him how he came by the coat and handkerchief? - I took him at the Spread Eagle, he was going to Gosport, we put him in a coach, and I found seven shillings and fourpence halfpenny in his hands, which he was shifting from one hand to another, and was going to throw it down; when he came to the prosecutor's, he said he was sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>This was before he was carried to the Justice's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he say he had done? - He said he had taken two guineas and a half out of the prosecutor's breeches pocket, and four shillings in silver out of his wife's pocket.</p>
               <p>Did he say how he got in, or in what manner? - He said he secreted himself up stairs and came down, and with a knife he pushed back the bolt of Mr. Vandane's chamber door, and that he had taken the things away, the coat and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Did he say what time he took it? - He said it was between three and four in the morning, he was taken before the Justice next day and searched.</p>
               <p>Did he say what time he got out of the house? - He said he came out immediately after he unbolted the back door, and went over the yard door.</p>

               <p>I am a sailor, I left my coat at the prosecutor's on the 10th of March in a bag, which the prisoner confessed robbing the prosecutor of, and two guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Did he say how he got into the chamber? - No, he did not confess that before me, I did not hear the whole of the confession.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I met a man in the street, and he had this coat and handkerchief under his arm, and he asked me to buy it, and I bought them of him.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this coat that is charged to be the property of the prosecutor, proves to be the property of another man, therefore it is only a circumstance in the case; the sta tute of the 12th of Queen Anne enacts, that if any person shall enter into the mansion or dwelling house of another by day or by night, with intent to commit felony, and shall break out to get out of the same, he or they shall be ousted of the benefit of clergy; the breaking open any chamber door in the night time, if you are in the house before, in order to commit a robbery, is a burglary.</p>

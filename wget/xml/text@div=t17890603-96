               <p>(Mr. Hodgson, the short hand writer, was then ordered to read his notes, which he accordingly did.</p>
               <p>Court. It seems to me, that no one of the assignments, which state that Radenhurst swore that Frazier did any thing, are proved. I will tell you my doubts upon that assignment, which struck me upon reading the abstract originally, and I put a query upon it; whether that assignment is or can be a material assignment for this reason, I am inclined at present to be of opinion, that what is in that part of the indictment stated that Radenhurst swore, is not evidence; now if it is not evidence, it cannot, by any possibility be material; as to what the woman swore before the magistrate, it was not admissible evidence, and if it had come out in a state of the prosecution, where it could affect the prisoner, I should not have received that evidence; but on looking over the short hand writer's notes, I find it was not at such a time, but where it was desired by the Prisoner himself; for previous to that I had declared my opinion, that supposing all that Radenhurst swore, to be true, it did not amount to felony at all; therefore it was before that clear that the prisoner was to be acquitted; it therefore became unnecessary for the Court, to watch with any degree of accuracy, whether what Radenhurst said, subsequent to that, was strictly admissible evidence, or not; I doubt even this, whether any thing that Radenhurst said upon examination, subsequent to that direction to the jury to acquit the prisoner, whether any thing he said after the inquiry, whether the Court should give a copy of the indictment, can be considered as material evidence; I have a very clear opinion of that; and the consequence of that on this indictment, will be, that that assignment cannot be brought home to the prisoner; then as resting on the other assignments, it seems to me, that Mr. Hodgson's evidence, as to what the prisoner said, does not support any of the assignments, which charge him to have sworn that Frazier did any thing, for he has in no part of his evidence swore that Mr. Frazier did any act, but that it was done by a person, whom he believed to be Frazier, that it was done by a gentleman like him in green, and assigning as the perjury, that in truth and in fact, he did not believe it to be Mr. Frazier that so did; and in truth and in fact, that the person who so did, is not Mr. Frazier; that will reduce the whole of this indictment, to the first assignment; that Mr. Jenkins did not call a gentleman out of the room, by the name of Frazier.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. That will not do my Lord, because there was a Mr. M'Cree called out instead of him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was one of these persons, present at the dance, which gave rise to this dispute? - I was.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was a man who came there with oysters for the company? - He was.</p>
               <p>Was you called out by Mr. Jenkins at all, to speak to the prisoner? - I was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030143"></xptr>Did you in fact, beat him all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you take any money from him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Are you positive that you was not called out of the room by Mrs. Jenkins? - Most undoubtedly so, clearly so.</p>
               <p>Was any body called out? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was you out of the room? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>At any time when the dispute was between him, and somebody else? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. The man was beat by somebody? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Mrs. Jenkins, about the time of that transaction, while Radenhurst was waiting there, call to you at the door of the room, on any occasion? - She did not.</p>
               <p>COLIN M'CREE sworn.</p>
               <p>Was you one of the party who were present at this dance? - I was.</p>
               <p>There was a dispute between the oyster man and somebody? - There was.</p>
               <p>Was you called out by Mr. Jenkins? - I was.</p>
               <p>By what name? - By my own name, Mr. M'Cree; Mr. Frazier was not called out, he had no share in the dispute.</p>
               <p>The dispute was between you and the Prisoner? - It was.</p>
               <p>It was the other person, that he was desired to look at? - He was desired to look at all that were present, and point out the person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Frazier had nothing to do in the dispute with him at all? - He had not.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure Mrs. Jenkins did not call you, by the name of Frazier? - She did not I am sure, he was dancing at the time; he was beginning to lead down the dance, and I was at the bottom; after she called me, she went to the place where the prisoner was; the dispute was not in the place where the prisoner was, the time the prisoner was sitting in the supper room, I was called out of the dancing room, to the supper room; the prisoner was sitting at the table, behaving in a very riotous manner, insulting all those that passed thro' the room, and Mrs. Jenkins came up to me; the dispute began there but the scuffle began below stairs; Mrs. Jenkins did not go down stairs, Mr. Frazier had nothing to do in the scuffle, above or below, the whole scuffle was between him and me, whatever was done, was done by me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I believe you were all dressed alike in green, at the trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you green, on the night of the dancing? - I was not in green, I believe they call it, the mud of Paris, it had an edging round, and singular from every other dress in the room: Mr. Frazier was dressed in green that night, as well as at the trial; I believe the very colour he now wears.</p>
               <p>I suppose there was some noise before you was called out? - Yes, there was a great deal of noise and confusion; it was in consequence of the noise and confusion, that I was called out.</p>
               <p>You do not take upon yourself, to say positively what words Mrs. Jenkins used? - She came to me, and said Mr. M'Cree, there is a man in the next room, behaving in a rude and riotous manner, and frightens me; I wish you would come out and speak to him: she was alarmed, she is subject to nervous complaints.</p>
               <p>Then you came out, and I believe you struck him? - I defended myself, and of course I struck him; from the appearance of the man, I wished to avoid every dispute with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you pay him the money? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Who acted as master of the ceremonies? - Mr. Frazier.</p>

               <p>Do you remember the dispute between the prisoner and Mr. M'Cree? - The prisoner was asked up stairs, to have some supper with the servants, and he was swearing and cursing; I asked him who had affronted him, he said nobody; I asked him if he was paid, he said no; I went to the room, I meant to apply to Mr. Frazier, and found Mr. M'Cree at the bottom, and he turned round, and I nodded to him, and did not mention any name at all, and he came and I asked him to lend me 6 s. he asked me what was the matter, and I said the oyster-man is abusing us, I wish he was paid and was gone; Mr. M'Cree came out, and asked him to come out of the supper room, and he would pay him; he not having change, returned into the dancing room again; the prisoner pushed, and tried to follow him.</p>

               <p>Did you mention the name of Frazier? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the prisoner you would fetch Mr. Frazier? - No.</p>

               <p>Is it not customary for him to pay the bills? - I don't know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>When this man was riotous who was the person that ought to have paid him? - I was going to pay him myself, I generally pay for such things, and am paid afterwards, the next morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did you, at the time understand, was to pay him? - Mr. Jenkins.</p>
               <p>What was Mr. Jenkins about at this time? - I don't recollect particularly what he was doing.</p>
               <p>When your husband is employed, who takes care of the management.</p>
               <p>The master of the ceremonies directs the dances, and Mr. Jenkins pays the bills. I was by myself and much alarmed.</p>
               <p>Did you not mention any name? - No, I beckoned Mr. M'Cree.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the prisoner your husband would pay him? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know what Mr. Jenkins said to him? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to call M'Cree particularly? - He had been master of the ceremonies, before Mr. Frazier came, and I had some knowledge of him.</p>
               <p>Court. When you found you had not money sufficient, who did you mean to apply to for the deficiency? - Mr. M'Cree.</p>
               <p>Suppose you or your husband has not money enough in his pocket to pay, who did he usually apply to? - I don't know he ever had occasion.</p>
               <p>When you found you had not money enough, did you say any thing, and what to the prisoner? - Nothing, I went to the dancing room, and meant to have him paid, and have done with him; and nodded to Mr. M'Cree, he being at the bottom of the room. I asked him to lend me 6 s. he asked what was the matter; I said a nasty man had affronted me; he came out; and called the prisoner to the door, and he put his hand in his pocket, and found he had not enough, and went into the dancing room, and the prisoner pushed and tried to get in.</p>
               <p>M'Cree. When I came out of the dancing room, I asked him the reason of his behaviour, he said he wanted to be paid; I told him if he would go to the bottom of the stairs I would pay him; he refused, I put my hand in my pocket, and found I had not enough, and went into the room, and borrowed some silver.</p>

               <p>Did you mention the name of Frazier? - No.</p>

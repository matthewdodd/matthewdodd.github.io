                  </hi>. I carry on business as a ribbon manufacturer, at No. 25, Wood-street, Cheapside; I have one room on the second floor. On Saturday, 31st May, I locked up my premises, and left them perfectly safe—on Monday morning I went, and found the padlock broken, the pre<lb></lb>mises had been entered, and I missed the whole of my stock of ribbons, worth 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., except a very small portion—they consisted of a quantity of lutestrings and Petershams, which are waist ribbons, and these narrow Petershams for the neck, but the bulk were wide, for the waist—there was also a small quantity of black gauze ribbon—I immediately communicated with the officers, and on 24th June, from what they told me, I accompanied two officers to the shop of William George Wilson, in Beech-street, Barbican—that is a low neighbourhood—I saw the officer Foulger find a quantity of lutestrings, Petershams, and gauze (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are of a similar quality to what I lost; they are mine—I haw no mark on them—here are three patterns of Petershams, in a variety of colours—they are manufactured exclusively and expressly for me by one manufacturer, who is here to-day; I only sell them to respectable retail drapers, of the first class—I have sold as large a quantity of Petershams to one customer—I find here two pieces of Petersham, in an undressed condition and unwatered—I have them dressed and watered in London; they are almost invariably sold dressed and watered—I have occasionally sent out one or two pieces in this con<lb></lb>dition, but a very small quantity indeed—I have no doubt that these two pieces are my property, but cannot say whether I have sold them at any time—it is not so rare that it would excite suspicion to have it—the value of the property here is about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the Petershams are about half that value—I have seen some ribbon purchased by my wife, it was Petersham, similar to what I find here—I sell it to the retailers at 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece, rather more than 10 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard—some of the lutestrings were rolled on blocks—I find the rolls are nearly all cut; they are about one-third of what they were when taken from my place, as if some had been sold—when William George Wilson was taken, this property was taken possession of—I never send out ribbons of this sort without blocks, and it is very unusual for them to be kept in a draper's shop in this way—on the same evening, the 24th, I went with two officers to the shop of John Wilson, No. 19, Clare-street, Clare<lb></lb>market—I judged that it was a draper's shop, but it was in the middle of the night; it is rather small, but not so small as the other—I saw a quan<lb></lb>tity of lutestrings and Petershams (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) taken possession of by the officers; among which were these ten pieces of Petersham, in an unfinished state, neither watered, dressed, nor on blocks; also some lutestring similar to what I lost on the night in question—these two rolls of lutestring I speak to from certain marks—the value of the property found in William</p>

               <p>George Wilson's shop is about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., out of which the Petershams were worth 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—during the time I have been in business I have never sold so large a quantity of Petersham ribbons to any customer, nor have I ever sent goods out in this state, without blocks, and without dressing, and many of them are half pieces—it is very uncommon for us to sell half pieces—the largest retail shops generally buy these in quarter pieces, nine yards long, or in eighths—I found among the Petersham ribbons at John Wilson's shop some similar to what my wife purchased—the waist ribbons I sell at 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the piece, except one pattern, which is 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; my wife purchased some of that—I should sell this at about 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard; I do not pay as low as 6 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard—one of these three patterns found at William George's shop was only ordered of the manufacturer about two months previous to the robbery, and came into my stock about a fortnight afterwards, and some colours which were in my stock were ordered as late as three weeks before the robbery, and were not in my stock till ten days or a fortnight previously, and some of the others, found in John's shop, the same.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, M</hi> 29). I accompanied Knight to John Wilson's shop—I heard Knight tell him that he need not answer any questions, and I likewise told him so myself—I then said, "Mr. Wilson, where did you purchase these ribbons? did you buy them at your brother's, in the City, or where did you buy them?"—ha said, "I shall decline to answer that question"—I then asked him where he saw the ribbons, if he did not buy them at his brother's—he said, "No, I did not, but I saw the patterns there"—I afterwards assisted in searching the place.</p>

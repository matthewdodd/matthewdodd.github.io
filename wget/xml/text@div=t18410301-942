                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist in Kingsland-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. On the night of the 10th of February, I was called out of my parlour by a neighbour, and missed from the window two bundles of sheroots and a cigar-case—the square of glass they were taken from, had previously been broken, but not enough for a hand to be put in—I had put a piece of board against it—I found it broken sufficiently to put a hand in, and some broken pieces of glass were found under the window—the board was removed—I had seen the sheroots safe about half an hour before—while I was noticing the state of the window, Kemp brought Humphreys and Peak to me—I followed them to the station shortly after, and there saw the cigar-case and sheroots.</p>

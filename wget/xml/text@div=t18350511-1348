                  </hi>. I know the prisoner. On the 25th of April I slept at my own lodging with a young man named Powell—there were two beds in the room; the prisoner occupied the other bed—I knew nothing about the prosecutor being there till I awoke about three o'clock in the morning,</p>

I said, "I don't mind"—I was gone three quarters of an hour, because the door was not open, and when I came back I saw Powell was up and dressed—I said to him, "What are you up for, you had better go to bed, it is too soon to get into the barracks—he said, "No; come and have something to drink"—I went with him, and the pri<lb></lb>soner came after us—we were going on the way to Woolwich, and, just as we got by the White Horse, she pulled out her glove and said, "I have got two sovereigns which have not been changed"—we told the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. About nine o'clock in the morning, on the 25th of April, I received information from the last witness that a sailor had been robbed, and they were in the eating-house—I went, and found the prisoner and a marine with her—I found 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on her, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—I took them to the station-house, and then went to the prosecutor, who said he had been robbed.</p>

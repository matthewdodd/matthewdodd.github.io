            . On Sunday, the 19th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I went out to church - I left my landlord in the house, and left my room door open, but my box was locked; I went from church, and drank tea with my brother - I returned at ten o'clock at night, found my box broken open, and missed a 10l. note and seven sovereigns - I had received the 10l. note from my brother.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What parish is the house in? A. Harrow; the prisoner lodged in the house - he passes my room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170026"></xptr>to go to his own; there is a passage between my room and his - I left him at home when I went out; he is a sign painter. I saw the note safe on the 18th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How many 10l. notes had you on the 18th? A. Only one; there were two lodgers besides him in the house - the prisoner's mother was at church.</p>

            . I am a timber-merchant, and live at Paddington. On Tuesday, the 11th of January, the prisoner came into my yard - he was a perfect stranger; I was in the counting-house with a customer; I went into the yard, and sold him two six-feet deals - he tendered me this 10l. note to pay for them; I asked him into the counting-house, and asked his name - he said Ewer, of Pinner, which I wrote on the note; I asked if he was a son of Mr. Ewer's, of Pinner - he said No; I said, "Are you any relation?" he said No; I said, "Do you know Mr. Ewer, of Pinner?" he said, "Perfectly well;" the goods came to 5s. 9d. - I gave him nine sovereigns and the rest in silver - Taft was present when I took the note from him; I have had it in my possession ever since, and am quite certain it is the note I had from him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not expressed a doubt about his identity? A. I did some few days after - I did not before the Magistrate; it was to himself - his features were familiar to me, but he was dressed different; he had a flannel jacket on, and an apron down to his ancles, which changed his appearance - that was about four days after the transaction; I never parted with the note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say four days after, you intimated some doubt about him - are you now certain, and were you certain before the Magistrate that he was the man? A. I was, for he had the identical coat on which he wore then.</p>

            . I am a stone-mason. I was in Dalgleish's yard when he took a note of the prisoner; I am certain the prisoner is the person who gave him the note - I have not the least doubt of him; I saw the change given to him - Dalgleish put the 10l. note into my hand at the time, to look at it; he was quite a stranger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was he there? A. Perhaps ten minutes - it was on the 11th of January; I know the day by the different transactions I had that day, and referring to my books, I made no memorandum of this, but when I was called upon I looked back at my books, and the transactions of that day enabled me to name the date - I think it was on the 19th that I referred to my books.</p>

On Tuesday, the 11th of January, the prisoner brought me two deal boards, and asked me to let them abide there a little while, and then asked for a bit of chalk to mark them with - I had none; he said they were to remain there till they were called for - he has never sent for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he a stranger to you? A. Yes - nobody else was present; he had no whiskers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say before the Magistrate that he wore large whiskers? A. I did not take much notice of his whiskers - he is the man; he might have had large whiskers for what I know.</p>

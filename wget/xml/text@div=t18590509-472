                  </hi>. I am a cook's-mate at the Strangers' Home, at Limehouse—I know the prisoner—on 18th April, he delivered me four six-pences—he said, "Take these four sixpences to different shops and get some tobacco, and we will divide the money"—I said the money was bad, I would not take it—he said, "It is nothing to you; if they come to know it is bad money they will cut it, and break it, and bend it, and give if you;</p>

               <p>they will do nothing to you; it is nothing to you"—I refused to take them. On the Wednesday afterwards, he gave me four more sixpences—he told me to buy tobacco with them—I gave them to Mr. Chapman—the prisoner asked me afterwards about these sixpences—he said, "Where is the tobacco and change"—I said the money was bad—I showed him one of the six-pences—I bent it with my mouth, and said it was bad—on the Saturday, he gave me two shillings and two sixpences—I was to go to the shop and buy some tobacco, and the money was to be divided between him and me—I gave that money to Mr. Chapman also—the prisoner spoke to me in English—he understands it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am messenger at the Stranger's Home, at Limehouse—on the 18th April, the last witness made a communication to me about money, and I gave him instructions what to do—on 20th April, he brought me these four sixpences (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I afterwards made a search in a box belonging to Ram Sammy—on the Saturday afterwards, I received from Powell two shillings and two sixpences, which the constable has—on Thurs<lb></lb>day evening, the 22d, I saw the prisoner leave the Home about half-past seven o'clock in the evening—I saw him meet Ram Sammy—they went together into a house, and remained some time—they both came out together, and Ram Sammy went to the Sailors' Home—he came out, and went to Mrs. Koch's baker's shop—I afterwards went in there, and Mrs. Koch gave me a bad shilling. On the 24th, the prisoner and Ram Sammy were brought before Colonel Hughes, the secretary, and Powell and Mrs. Koch were present—when they were all present, the Colonel asked Ram Sammy where he got the shilling that he passed to Mrs. Coates—he pointed to the prisoner and said, "That man gave"—the prisoner made no reply to that—I then produced some sixpences that I found in Ram Sammy's posses<lb></lb>sion, and the Colonel asked him where he obtained them—he pointed to the prisoner, and again said, "That man gave"—the prisoner made no reply—I then produced the two shillings and two sixpences that I had that morning received from Powell—the Colonel asked Powell where he got them—he said he got them from Francis—I went out at that time, and I don't know whether the prisoner made any reply—a constable was called in, and the prisoner and Ram Sammy were given in custody—I marked the two shillings and the two sixpences, and gave them to the constable—the pri<lb></lb>soner had been at the Home ten or twelve days—he speaks English and understands it.</p>

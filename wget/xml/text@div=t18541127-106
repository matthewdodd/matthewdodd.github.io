                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Thomas Cabban, a draper, in Stockwell-street, Greenwich. On 30th Oct., the prisoner came to the shop, between 1 and 2 o'clock—she asked to match some silk; I said I could not exactly, but I showed her some silk, and some lining—she did not take them with her, but asked me to send them to Mrs. Jones, at New Cross—as she was leaving the shop, I observed her left hand was close to her side—in consequence of what I saw I followed her, and saw her go into a shop in the market—I walked up and down outside, and passed the shop once or twice—I returned to any master's shop, and missed one piece of those silks</p>

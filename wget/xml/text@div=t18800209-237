                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, of 68, High Street, Deptford—on Wednesday, 21st January, at 8 p.m., two pairs of boots were hanging a nail outside the shop, and at 8.30 two boys outside gave an alarm, and I missed the boots—a boy brought one pair back—I saw the prisoner on Friday in custody.</p>

I live at Upper Hosier Street, Deptford—I was standing outside the shop when I saw a boy cut two pairs of boots off and give them to the prisoner, who put them under his coat and ran away—one pair dropped from his coat, and another boy picked them up—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

I saw the prisoner on Friday, 23rd January, about 9 p.m. in a public-house at the top of High Street—I I called him out, and told him I was going to apprehend him for stealing two pail's of boots from Mr. Turner on Wednesday evening—he wanted to know what time, and I told him between 8 and 8.30.—he said "I did not steal any boots; I have plenty of witnesses to prove where I was. Prisoner's Defence. I never said "I have plenty of witnesses." I am not guilty. It is hard they should swear to me when they say they saw another boy.</p>

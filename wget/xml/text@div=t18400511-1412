                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the D warehouse of St. Katharine's Docks. On the 24th of March I attended the weighing of some hemp for Mr. Baker, the prisoner's father—it was part of the cargo of the <hi rend="italic">Thetis</hi>—I was particularly attentive to what was done, and took a memorandum of it in writing by direction of my officer—the two prisoners were present at the deli<lb></lb>very—they both came close to the scale when the draught was called, and counted the weights—22cwt 1qr. 71bs. was in the scale on the first deli<lb></lb>very, and 22cwt. 1qr. 5lbs. was booked, allowing 2lbs. for the draft—the weight was called out in a loud and distinct voice, and Radford must have heard it from the position he was in—he was about nine feet from the scale when I called the weight—there was nothing between us—when the weight was struck I was assisting in discharging the hemp, and the fore<lb></lb>man (Radford) called out, "What was the draught, did it take the half or the quarter," meaning the 1/2 cwt or 1/4 cwt., and the answer was, "22cwt. 1qr. 5lbs. to book"—that was the second time it was called out—Baker was then present—when the hemp was discharged a man named Ryland hove it out at the loop-hole—I then saw the other draught weighed, and that was 20cwt. 0qr. 15lbs., and 20cwt. 0qr. 13lbs. to book—I heard Radford call out, "I want 20cwt. 0qr. 131bs. clear of every thing"—that I most solemnly swear, because I heard it—I took a memorandum of the second weight as well as the first in pencil directly, and inked it afterwards—I delivered the paper to Mr. Landy the next morning—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I did not know at the time this was weighed whether it was wrong or right, as I had not possession of the order.</p>

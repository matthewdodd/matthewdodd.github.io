                  </hi>. I am single, and live with my mother, in a cottage in Pocock's-fields, Islington—MR. Templeman lived in a cottage facing us. On Tuesday morning, the 17th of March, I went to Mr. Tem<lb></lb>pleman's cottage, at half-past eight o'clock, with two sheets of writing-paper—I knocked at the door, but received no answer—MR. Templeman used to sleep in the further room from a cottage inhabited by Mrs. Jarvis, and the further room from the door—the door opens into one room, and then you go into the other—there is a window to the bed-room—when I received no answer I went to the bed-room window, and found it shut down as usual—there was a short curtain to it inside—I was too short to see over the cur<lb></lb>tain—I then went to the sitting-room window, and found it open—I then returned home, and told my mother what I had observed.</p>

Mustow's cottage is at the back—that makes five—it was a beautiful moon-light night the night before I went—I think it was frosty—the ground was dry by the window where I was standing—it</p>

               <p>out of the house behind—you must come either through the door or one of the front windows—there is a wooden partition between the two rooms—I saw the body of Mr. Templeman lying on his back on the floor, not far from the bed—his room is small—his feet laid towards the fire-place, and his head towards the window—his hands were tied across with a cord in front of him—there was one cord round the wrists, and a smaller cord tied round the other cord—a stocking was over his eyes, and tied be<lb></lb>hind—there was another stocking on the floor—both stockings were co<lb></lb>vered with blood—I suppose the blood on the one over his eyes came off the floor where he lay—there was blood on both sides of the stocking—Sergeant Collins came to the cottage soon after, and he found some of the deceased's clothes on a sofa—he had nothing on but a shirt—I did not observe whether it was a night-shirt or day-shirt—his legs were not tied—there was a chest of drawers in the sitting-room—the two top-drawers had been forced open, it appeared to me, by a chisel—in one of the drawers was a box open, which Collins has—I do not know what wood it is made of—I suppose it is mahogany—I should think it is about six inches by ten or eleven—there was nothing in it—in the bed-room Mr. Roe, the surgeon, picked up a tooth off the pillow, and one off the chair, and I myself picked one up off the floor—there was a pool of blood close to the body—the body lay on the top of the blood—most of the blood was about the head—the tooth was in part of the blood close to the head—the pillow of the bed was all bloody—the sheets were not—the most blood was on the pillow, and the rest on the floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Brown-buildings, Islington. I accompanied Mr. Lord and a policeman to Mr. Templeman's cottage, about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock—the policeman got through the window, opened the door, and let us in—I saw the deceased with only a shirt on, lying with his feet towards the fire-place, and his head towards the door of the room—the body was in the bed-room, towards the door, which is between the two rooms—he was lying on his back, rather inclining to the left side, lacing the window—his eyes were firmly bandaged with a stocking—if he had been alive, he could not have seen—there was a good deal of blood on the stocking, which I think must have been saturated with the blood on the floor, after it was tied on his eyes—I have no doubt his head had fallen on the floor, and the stocking got into the blood—his hands were securely tied by a cord in this posture—(<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—a small cord secured the other cord fastened between the wrists, through a noose in the cord, to make it more secure—I did not notice the wrists then—I did after the cord was removed, and they were galled, and the hands and nails blue—that would unquestionably show that it had been put on during life—I have no doubt he struggled—the blueness would be occasioned by the pressure of the cord—I observed several bruises on his face, a severe blow over the left temple, and a cut on the nose—the lower jaw was fractured on both sides—I observed four clean cuts on the back of the head, and one or two bruises on the breast bone, in conjunction with the collar-bone—his knees were much abraised, rubbed up, as he had, no doubt, been struggling on the floor—there was some blood on the floor immediately under the deceased's head—I should say perhaps ten ounces—the wounds would most likely continue to bleed some time—there was no contused wound on the left temple to cause the blood—I have no doubt a good deal of the blood came from the jaw, and also the clean cuts on the back of the head—the blow on the temple was most probably given by a blunt round instrument, similar to a policeman's staff—it might be done by a piece of wood—the same instrument might have produced the fracture of the jaw, and one blow might produce both fractures—I think the wound on the nose was from a kick, or something of that description, not done by a sharp instrument—the wounds on the back of the head were inflicted by a very sharp instrument.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060207"></xptr>
               <p>—I examined the jaw, and found three teeth had been forced from the sockets—they were not front, but tide teeth—I think that was very probably done by the blow which produced the fractures—there were se<lb></lb>veral blows about the mouth, and I think one while he was lying in bed, from the circumstance of the tooth being found on the pillow, and the blood there—the tooth on the chair was as if it had fallen out when he got out of bed—I found a small piece of stick, about two inches and a half or three inches long, with hair attached to it, and saturated with blood—it was the hair of the head—it was dark hair—I can scarcely call it grey—this is the piece of splinter—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is hair on it now—a kick from the heel or toe of a shoe might have made the cut on the nose, if there were nails in it, and I think it might be done by a shoe or boot without nails—from the appearance of the body when I saw it, I should judge it had been dead fire or six hours—it retained a little warmth about the region of the heart—the body was quite cold—the time in which a body gets cold depends occasionally on the kind of death the person meets with—a body has retained warmth occasionally two days after death—ten or eleven hours is not at all an unusual time—I have no doubt, had the body remained in bed, it would have been warm a long time after it was—MR. Lord accompanied me—he was also present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the injuries which I saw on the body, produced death—I have no doubt the death was owing to the violence I have de<lb></lb>scribed.</p>

I am potman at the Duchess of Kent public-house, Devereux-street, Dover-road, where I have been seven weeks—it is about four miles from Mr. Templeman's cottage—I have known the prisoner from seven to eight months—I saw him on the 12th or 13th of last March, I am not positive which—I think it was the 12th, Thursday—he came to the Duchess of Kent public-house about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, and called fur half-a-pint of porter, and put down a penny, saying he had no more money—I did not take the money—I brought him a pint of porter—I then went out to deliver my beer—I returned about half-past eight o'clock—the prisoner was then standing on the outside, opposite the house, talking to a young man, a potman in the neighbourhood, named Richard Squires—there was no conversation between them after I came up—we had some porter together—as soon as we had had the pot of porter between us three, the prisoner and I walked up the street together—while we were walking together he said he had been ill, and was without money, and for want of money he was getting worse—he stated that he knew an old man who had got money—I asked him how he knew he had got money—he said he had heard he had bid 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a cottage, and he had <hi rend="italic">flashed</hi> a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and said if that was not enough he had got more—the prisoner said that he had put the notes into a drawer, and it would be like a gift to him, for he knew where to put his hand on it—he said he should like to have a right one along with him—I said, "A right one!"—he said, "Yes, a right one, or I could do it myself"—I asked him where the old gentleman lived—he said, "Oh, not far."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Not far from when? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From where Gould lived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he said, not far from him, that it, signifying where Gould lived—he said, "Not far from home"—those were the words be used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, is that all you remember of what passed, or was any thing else said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is all I remember—when he was in the tap-room he named to me that he had been to a publican whom he once lived with, and that he should endeavour to get a situation, and try that man if he would give him a character, that he would send to him—that was before I walked with him—he said nothing further than I have stated with reference to the old gentleman's money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know where Mr. Templeman lived? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in Pocock's-fields, at the back of Liverpool-terrace—a sawyer lived in the next cottage to Mr. Templeman's when I served him—I do not know who lives in it now—I think the sawyer's name was William Izod—he worked in the City-road—I served him—I served most of them near Mr. Templeman's cottage, all round the field—I served the principal of the cottages—I think there were not ten persons who did not deal with me when I carried beer round there—nobody lived with Mr. Templeman then—I do not know who took care of his house—this cottage was build<lb></lb>ing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060212"></xptr>
               <p>at the time, and after Izod left, he lived in this cottage till his cottage was built—MR. Tiffin was building this cottage for him while he lived in Izod's—he took possession of the new cottage about two years back—I have known him as long as that—that is the only cottage into which he shifted—when I first knew him I was living at Mr. Ralph's, the William the Fourth public-house, at the corner of Park-street and Minerva-place—I left there because I got another situation—I did not like it—there was no other reason for my leaving—I went after that to the Craven Arms pub<lb></lb>lic-house, Bayswater—I was about twenty-six weeks at Mr. Ralph's the first time—I did not go with a character to the other place—I was eleven months at the Craven Arms public-house—after leaving there I went to work for Mr. Ralph a week, till he got a man, and then I went to the Hope and Anchor public-house, Islington—the landlord left the house, and Mr. Walton took it, and there were a few words between us, and I left—there was no charge against me—the words were about stopping out a few hours—I stopped out between four and eight o'clock—I went away of my own accord—the words were with Mr. Walton, who keeps the house—there had been no charge against me of any kind—there has been a charge, but it was not from Mr. Walton—it was from the Duke of York public-house, Glou<lb></lb>cester-street—I asked permission to go out; while I was out, a cash-box was lost, and when I returned home I was taken up on suspicion, and charged with stealing it—that might be between four and five years ago—there has been nothing further—I never was in custody before, nor yet charged with any thing—I lived at the City of London public-house—I was not in custody respecting any thing there—it it at the corner of Syd<lb></lb>ney-street and Dalby-terrace—I left there to take a beer-shop, after nine years' service—I left of my own accord—there was a cellar there—nothing was said about my conduct in that cellar—that I swear—that is somewhere about the time after I came out of Hatton-garden office—I went to live there again—I lived there about ten months—I opened the beer-shop be<lb></lb>fore I went to the Duke of York public-house, but it did not succeed—I know Mr. Jarvis's cottage very well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long before the night Mr. Templeman lost his life, were you in Pocock's-fields do you think? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 9th or 10th I was there—I went to visit Mr. Allen of Wilson-cottage—I had lodged there some time before—there are two rooms in Allen's cottage and, an old back kitchen, and a wash-house adjoining it—there is about half an acre of garden—the privy is in the wash-house, adjoining the bed-room—you can go from the parlour into the little, kitchen into it, and you can go into the garden to get to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mentioned something about what the prisoner said about a drawer, do you mean to say he said that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I recollected that in my statement at the time I was at Hatton-garden at my last evidence—I think I recollected it at the time I was at Hatton-garden—I am certain I did—I have been twice to Hatton-garden—the first time was on a Satur<lb></lb>day—the Saturday after Mr. Templeman's body had been found on the Tuesday—I did not recollect it when I first went—I do not know any thing of this little mahogany box—I am not positive that I ever heard of a mahogany box—I think, but I have never mentioned it, because I was not positive of hearing of it—I can read—I have read an account of this in the newspapers—I read the newspapers between my first and se<lb></lb>cond</p>

               <p>examination—I did not read any account of where the money was kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did you not read in the newspapers where the money was placed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have read the papers, but I speak from the words Gould named to me, that the money was in the drawer—I have no recol<lb></lb>lection of reading in the papers where the money was placed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you read the newspapers for, was it to refresh your memory? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it a Sunday paper you read? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have read the "Dispatch" once, but not the whole of it—I think I read it the Sunday after my first examination—I do not know that I did—I am not certain that it was the Sunday after, because in our business I catch hold of a paper, and lay it down again—I did not read the whole account of the evidence—I had not the opportunity of doing so—I might read part of it—I recollected about the drawer after I had been to Hatton-garden on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you mentioned about the drawer till you read the "Dispatch?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How old are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty-seven—the last time I lodged at Allen's is about seven weeks back—I left Allen's to go to the situation I am now in—I was lodging there last Christmas, and Gould lodged in the same house—he did not lodge there at Christmas—he was at place—he had been at place a week or two, at Mr. Bartlett's, the Barns<lb></lb>bury Castle public-house—I was living there alone at Christmas—I knew Mr. Templeman's cottage, and the window, but never took particular notice of it—I cannot say whether it was a whole window, or whether there was any thing the matter with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you aware that in the conversation you say took place a rob<lb></lb>bery was intended? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I understood his intent was to commit a robbery—it was mentioned only in my bearing—I did not suppose any violence was to be done to the old gentleman—I understood him to mean by "a right one," somebody to assist him, that he could depend upon—I understood there was to be a robbery only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you shocked at it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I took very little notice of it—I named it to Squires when I went round at nine o'clock, and said I did not know whether it was intended or not—Squires lives at the Two Brewers public-house, the next house—I did not name it to any police<lb></lb>man—Squires said he did not think if he had any intention he would have named it—Squires is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you think it was a joke? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not think he was joking—I took no notice of what he said, till I named it to Squires at nine o'clock, and neither of us took notice of it—it never entered my mind till I read—till I heard of the murder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic"> Q.</hi> Why name it to Squires if you thought nothing about it, and if you did think any thing about it why did you not name it to a policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I named it to Squires, and it did not enter my mind afterwards till Squires told me he had read in the paper of a murder, and I read of it when I got home—I first heard of it on the Wednesday—Squires had read the paper, and named it to me—I do not know James Rogers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked about a cash-box—had some charge been made against you about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—only suspicion—I think I was in custody a week—I was afterwards discharged by the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060214"></xptr>
               <p>—I did not come to trial upon it—except on that occasion I have never been in custody in my life, and I never bad any charge of dishonesty theft of any kind made against me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give evidence in this case of your own accord, or were you called on to do so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had not time to come over—I sent word over to Mr. Allen on the Wednesday, about an hour after Squires made the communication to me—I went before the Magistrate on the Saturday—one of the officers called on me—that was after I had made the communi<lb></lb>cation to Allen—I stated at the office all of the circumstances as near as I could recollect—I never had any quarrel with the prisoner—I had always been on friendly terms with him—Squires is living at this place now—(<hi rend="italic">a messenger was here sent to fetch Squires.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Dotset-street, Spitalfields, and am a print-colourer—I colour caricatures, and principally religious prints—that is the way in which I get my living—I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner between four and five years—I saw him on Friday evening the 13th of March—I left off work about half-past seven o'clock that evening, and when I came down stairs there was a person in the passage inquiring for <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>—I did not see him—I heard him, and when I came down in the passage the woman below said <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> was not at home, and then I saw the prisoner "Arthur Nicholson"—that was the name he gave me—"a private in the 11th Light Dragoons, Canterbury"—the prisoner was present when I wrote this paper I have in my hand—that if ever he should be tried as a deserter, I might know his right name—he gave me this, as near as possible, twelve months ago last December—he desired me to write down his name that I might know if he was ever tried as a deserter, he was the man—it is my handwriting—he saw me write it—I put it into the drawer, and there it remained till this occurrence took place—when I saw him in the passage, I said, "Dick, how do you get on?"—he said he wanted to see <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>—I asked him what he wanted to see <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> for—he said he wanted to see him, for he wanted to borrow a <hi rend="italic">screw</hi>—I asked him what for—he said he was going to <hi rend="italic">serve</hi> an old gentleman in a lonely cottage—I told him he had better not do any thing of the kind, if he did he would be sure to get trans<lb></lb>ported—he told me he might as well be transported for that, for if he was takes as a deserter, he was sure to be transported—at the end of that con<lb></lb>versation, a fight took place at the bottom of our street, and I and the pri<lb></lb>soner went down together to see it—seven or eight rounds were fought—the police came up to disperse the mob, and I and the prisoner returned back again about as far as our door, and I wished him good night—he said, "You had better not go yet, for I want to see <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> very particularly"—I asked him what he wanted to see <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> so very particularly for—he said he wanted a <hi rend="italic">darkey,</hi> that he had left there some time ago, and it might be handy—I told him if he wanted to see <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> so very particularly, he had better go over the way to the public-house—he said he could not go over the way, for he had no money—he further stated, that if he served the old gentleman, as was his intention on the Saturday, he was going over the water to see his aunt or cousin, and would give me a call on Sunday, and let me know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let you know what? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Whether he had robbed the old gentle<lb></lb>man, I suppose—that is the inference I drew from what he said—he did not say he would rob him—he said he would call on Sunday and let me know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said he spoke about a <hi rend="italic">screw</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">darkey,</hi> what is meant</p>

               <p>by a <hi rend="italic">screw</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell, only from what I have been in the habit of reading—I have read "Bell's Life in London"—I know what <hi rend="italic">screw</hi> means according to the <hi rend="italic">defamation</hi> I have heard in the book—according to the <hi rend="italic">defamation</hi> I have read in "Bell's Life in London," it means a picklock-key—I bid the prisoner good night, and we parted—I saw no more of him—I afterwards saw an account of the murder at Islington in the newspaper, and the day after I gave information to a policeman of the H division—that division is in the neighbourhood of Spitalfields—I then stated what I have to-day, I believe, word for word—I was examined before the Magistrate, after recognising the prisoner—I was taken by a policeman to be sure of him—Waddingtoo the jailer said, "You are to recognise the prisoner"—I believe I said "Yes," and I pointed to him, and said, "That is the man."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known Gould? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between four and five years—that was as near as possible my first acquaintance with him—I only knew him then as Dick or Richard, nothing further—that was at Mr. Webber's, at the public-house at the corner of our street—I never inquired his other name—I should say I knew him three years as <hi rend="italic">Dick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was be living when he got you to write this card? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I gave him a lodging, to tell you the truth, at Now 7, Dorset-street—I have not known him up to the present time—he has been absent some time—I have not seen him but once previous to the Friday, for eight or nine weeks—that was at the Weaver's Arms public house—<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> is a party who had moved in below me—his name is James Rogers—he had moved in very likely two months—it is not my house—I am only the tenant of one apartment—I have known Rogers, I should say, fourteen or fifteen years—it was not by my introduction that he came into the room below—if I had had the letting of the house, I would not have let him in at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You knew him too well? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never knew any dishonest action of the man—he is a labouring man—he has only a small apart<lb></lb>ment at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—he gets his living among the wharfs, on board the barges, to carry flour or corn, or any thing on shore if barges come up, and if they wanted any body to unload them, they would as life employ him as any body—he may have regular masters for any thing I know—I do not know that he has.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What has he been during the fourteen or fifteen years you have known him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He got his living by going about buying and repairing old umbrellas, portering, or any thing like that—I do not know whether he comes in at good hours at night—he never lived in the same house as me before—I had no objection to having him in the same house, but I have not the letting of the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why should you object to let him the house if you had the letting of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he is a man so often out of work, and could not afford to pay his rent—I have been in business about twenty-four or twenty-five years, not always colouring religious prints, but latterly I have done them—I have done some thousands of prints for Mr. Fairburn, No. 110, Mino<lb></lb>ries, principally religious prints—I have occasionally done maps, plans, and charts—that is the only trade I have been in—I never kept a shop—I have been eleven years in my present lodging—I have a wife and family living with me—I have three children out of eight—they live as well as they can since my work has been stopped—my work has been stopped since this fatal occurrence—I have had one little job since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why could you not colour prints notwithstanding this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On account of my giving evidence—it got into the newspapers, and my master stopped the work—I suspect so—I do not buy and sell things at all—I never did to my knowledge—I bought this coat the other day, and I might sell it to-morrow—I bought every thing I have got on.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You never bought anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was never said that I did—I was never charged with buying any thing—I was never in any scrape about a robbery, I am certain—I will tell you, the prisoner and I were together at a public-house, a man charged me with robbing him of a shilling, and the prisoner went with me to the station-house, and offered the man 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to let me out—I was not let out—the man came between one and two o'clock in the morning, said he had found the shilling, and wanted the man to discharge me, but he said he could not, as the charge for felony was signed—the man never appeared afterwards—it happened at the Bluecoat Boy public-house, in Dorset-street, within a door or two of my own house—the man was a butcher—I have known him in the neighbourhood for years—that is not quite two years ago, I think—I was once locked up for being drunk and disorderly—I have never been in any difficulty about other people's property, except about the shilling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the prisoner said he was going to commit a robbery, did you endeavour to persuade him not to do so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said if he did he would be sure to be transported—I did not endeavour to persuade him not to do it—I did not believe him—I understood what he meant by a <hi rend="italic">screw,</hi> by reading "Tom and Jerry" and "Bell's Life"—I have seen that expres<lb></lb>sion in "Tom and Jerry" many times—I have borrowed the book once or twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you thought he really meant nothing, how came you to tell him he would be transported if he did it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why he would if he did it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I thought you considered he was in fun? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not think he was in much fun—I did not think he was in earnest—he has laughed and joked with me many times before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you really think him in fun or earnest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should firmly believe now that he did mean it, but I did not believe he meant it at the moment—I should sooner say he was in joke than in earnest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why persuade him not to do it, then, and tell him he would be transported? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said if he did it he would be transported.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, while you were pausing to give me an answer, did not you hear what that gentleman (MR.

                  </hi>. I live at Wilson's Cottage, Pocock's-fields: I am a boot and shoemaker—I have seen Mr. Templeman's house since his death, but not before—I know it now—I should say it is between 300 and 500 yards from where I live—I have known the prisoner, as near as I can tell, about twelve months—he has lodged at my house several times—I cannot possibly state when he commenced lodging with me the last time—he lodged with me at least seven nights before this occurred—I know he had very little money, if any, before the 16th of March; and I was confident, from circumstances which occurred, that he had no money—when he has come home of an evening he has said he had no money; and I considered by his getting up of a morning, and not having breakfast before he went out, that he had none, for few people like to go out without food, if they have money to purchase it—on the Saturday night before this occurred he had none, because he made an observation when he came into the house that he had no money, but he should have some in the course of to-morrow, which was Sunday—on the Monday morning following that Saturday, I think he went out between eight and nine o'clock—he had no breakfast with us before he went out that morning—I believe he was dressed some<lb></lb>thing similar to what he is now, but I cannot positively swear whether he had that coat or a jacket on—as far as I can tell, I believe he was dressed much as he is now—he had on a pair of shoes, which I made—I did not make them for him—they were misfits, but I sold them to him—they were ancle-shoes, similar to what I have on now, shoes the lea<lb></lb>ther of which comes above the ancle—they had nails—I saw Gould</p>

               <p>nailing them about a fortnight before—they were then getting the worse or wear, still they were wearable—I had seen them everyday on his feet—at the time I saw him nailing them they were fit for wear, I am certain, and would have lasted much longer for nice fine weather than for wet—I have no recollection whether he went out alone or in company that morning—I have no recollection of seeing any body before he went out—the next time I saw him was, as near as I can tell, on the Tuesday morning about three o'clock—I was then lying in my own bed, and my wife likewise—he came into the house—it was very light at the time, the moon shining—it was the lightness of the moon—the instant he came into the house he went into his bed-room, as the door opens into the room—he opens his bed-room door and closes the front door while he passes to his bed-room—my wife said to him, "Richard, it is early," or "late," I am not sure which, and his reply was, "It is early"—nothing more passed—the next time I saw him was, I believe, between eight and nine o'clock on the Tuesday morning—we have no clock to judge the time, but as near as I can tell I saw him between eight and nine—I got up between six and seven—he got up between eight and nine—I was in my sitting room—he came into it, passed through, and went to the wash-house—the wash-house leads to the privy and to the back-yard—he remained in the wash-house, as near as I can tell, from twenty five minutes to half-an-hour—when he came out of his bed-room he had his coat and waistcoat on his arm, and I believe his boots in his hand, but I am not certain whether they were on his feet or in his hand—when he returned, he came through the room where I was sitting at breakfast, and went out at the front door—he went straight from the wash-house to the front door and went out—I observed nothing particular about him when he went out—I believe he had on the same clothes he has now—he had on the same shoes as I had made him, but they were blacked—when he was in a situation he blacked them every morning, but not at other times—how he got the brushes to clean them I do not know, but the brushes were in the back place when he was gone—they were my brushes and blacking—if he used it, it was my blacking.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell whether, on this night, he used any candle or rush-light to go to bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw Richard have a candle in our house all the time he was in it, unless he asked for such a thing, and that was very seldom—if he wanted one it was merely for a minute to get something out of the room, and he was supplied by our candle which stood on the table—I have not found any candle or rush-light about my premises since that night—he returned about a quarter past seven o'clock on the Tuesday evening, much about that time—I had heard of the murder about half-past ten, or near eleven o'clock—when the prisoner came home I was gone to fetch a pint of por<lb></lb>ter and a rasher of bacon for supper—when I returned he was sitting in my room talking to my wife—the conversation when I came into the house was, I believe; on the subject of the murder—the first time, I believe, I spoke, or Richard spoke to me, was, "It is a shocking thing: do you consider he could not have done it himself?"—the reply I made was, "Richard, how could it be possible for persons to do such things themselves, having their hands tied and their eyes blindfolded; is it likely?"—that is all the con<lb></lb>versation I remember between Richard and me, till afterwards—he was sitting at the table a few minutes after, then got up and went into the back place—he went through the wash-house, as if he was going to the privy—he said his inside was out of order, and he went out at the door as if</p>

               <p>was in conversation with the prisoner that evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I went to fetch some beer, therefore I could not—I went to fetch the beer and bacon after he came home—it was not his bacon I cut when I disco<lb></lb>vered his shoes, it was my own bacon—I did that while the prisoner was sitting at the table, before I went to fetch his bacon—I believe I ate my own supper before I fetched his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At that time had there been any conversation about the murder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The conversation might have been about the murder, but I took very little notice of any of the conversation, therefore am not bound to answer the question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you to answer the question, had any conversation taken place about the murder before, as you say, you cut the bacon, and saw his new shoes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have already answered that the conversation when I entered the house was on that subject, but I paid so little attention to the conversation between my wife and the prisoner, that probably I could not utter fifty words of the conversation the whole evening, unless the prisoner spoke to me—I mean, I could not utter fifty words of the conversation between the prisoner and my wife, except I had the leading point to lead to it, named—there was a good deal of conversation between him and my wife—I had some suspicion at the time I discovered the new shoes—I cannot say whether it was after that that I went and fetched the bacon for the prisoner—I believe I had eaten my own supper before I fetched it, but I will not swear it—I am not confident whether the bacon was cooked before or after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you went out to fetch the bacon, had you any suspicion as you have stated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly I had at the time, and before—I had before he came into the house—I fetched it from a person of the name of——I cannot recollect—it was about a hundred yards off—I was absent about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—on my return I found the prisoner sitting at the table in conversation with my wife—as soon as his bacon was cooked he had his supper, smoked his pipe, and went to bed—when I bolted him in his bed-room I said, "He is in, he shall never come out any snore by me"—if my face had been towards him I think he may have heard that, but my back being to<lb></lb>wards him, he might or might not—it is a question I cannot answer—I sever bolted him in before—I have merely put the bolt to to keep the children in of a morning, but not bolted <hi rend="italic">him</hi> in—the window of his room looks into the front garden—it is about two feet and a half or three feet from the ground—I cannot tell whether he paid me for the old shoes which I made him—what I have no dealings with I never answer, I left it to my wife—he paid her in part, whether she had the whole I cannot tell, I know nothing of it—I have been ill this twelvemonth, and have had very little dealings with any person whatever—I have done very little shoe-making within the last twelve months—I was once in the police—I left it, I think, eight years ago—I went after the first division that went to Whitechapel—I was in it, as near as I can tell, a year and four or five months—I left it entirely of my own accord, without any complaint being made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, do I understand you distinctly that there was a great deal of conversation that you cannot recollect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, distinctly, that I know nothing of whatever—if it were repeated, I believe, I might then tell, but not without, for I did not pay the least attention to it—I did not take any notice, very little indeed, for my thoughts were far beyond any conversa<lb></lb>tion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184004060224"></xptr>
               <p>—I did not want to hold any conversation—my two children slept with the prisoner—one is about six years old at Michaelmas, and the other four years old—they were in the bed with him that night.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you bar the door, I do not understand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I had a suspicion he knew something of the charge—barring the door would prevent his getting out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could he not get out of the window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That he might, but he could not get into my room, and if he had got out of the door I did not mean to go to sleep—I was not particularly afraid of him, but I did not intend that he should have gone out of my house, without he did get up—if he did get up I should have given information—it was for the public interest as well as my own.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. The prisoner lodged at our house, and did so on the 17th of March last—I do not know Mr. Templeman's cottage, I never saw it—I know it is but a short dis<lb></lb>tance from our house—I have never been to it, but I know where it is—the prisoner has been lodging with us nearly a twelvemonth, off and on—the last time he was with us for a whole week, the only week he has been with us since he had been at the Barnsbury Castle public-house—he was with us from Saturday night till the Tuesday week, a week and two days—he did not pay me—I never received any money from him for that, because he had none—he told me he had no money many times.</p>

Jarvis brought him some bacon and eggs on the Sunday morning, as he came on Saturday night—on the following Sunday, (the Sunday previous to the murder,) he asked me if I had any breakfast, he wanted some breakfast—I did not answer him, because we had none in the house ourselves—that was between eight and nine o'clock—he said he should go over the water to his cousin's, but his handkerchief was so dirty, and I lent him a stock of my husband's—he then went out directly—he returned at one o'clock in the day—I was at home—he said he had been out, and drank too much beer, and it had made him very ill on an empty stomach—he went out, and was very sick—he came in again, and I asked him if he would have some dinner—he said he was too ill—he asked if he might lie down—I said he might, and he did so—my little boy called him up at five o'clock, for me to make the bed, and put the children to bed—he had gone to lie down in his own room—my children slept with him—he got up, and came into the room where I was sitting—he asked me if I had got any tea—I told him I had not—he asked me to let my little boy go and fetch him some, for he had taken 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. while he was out—my little boy did fetch him some—he said, "I have got 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left"—he gave my little boy 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he fetched some tea and sugar—I made him some toast—he had his tea, and went to bed—on the following morning, (Monday,) before he got up, Mrs. Jarvis came, I think, about eight o'clock, or a little after—she came to my door and asked if Richard was up—I said, "No"—I opened the door, and she called, "Richard"—if the front door is open you can hear any body</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do know to whom that stocking belonged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw a pair of stockings rolled up on a box, at the side of the prisoner's bed on Monday afternoon, at the time I made the bed—I cannot say whether it was five o'clock, or what time—it was in the afternoon—it might be five o'clock—it was while the prisoner was out—I took hold of the stockings and laid them down, and thought to myself, they are Richard's stockings—I knew them to be similar to what he always wore—I washed for him—they were exactly like what he wore, and did not belong to me—they belonged to Richard—they did not belong to me, and are like what I used to wash for him—I believe them to be his—he had two pain of stockings when I washed for him, before he went to Mr. Bartlett's—I washed for him three weeks after he went there—I had washed a pair of stockings similar to those for him, just before Christmas—that is all I know—my children's clothes were not kept in that room—nobody's clothes but the prisoner's would be kept in that room—they were two odd stockings, I had mismatched them when I washed them, I think it must have been six week before Christmas when I mis-matched them—these were formerly two pairs, and I put one stocking of one pair to another.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since you have been at the police-office, have you conversed with your husband about the time he came home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My husband said, when he came home, "Mary, Richard did not come home till morning"—I be<lb></lb>lieve my husband did not speak when the prisoner came in, because I spoke—I did not ask my husband whether he was awake, nor did I speak—I was out of bed three times to nurse my child—the prisoner got up between seven and eight o'clock next morning, and went through the wash-house to the privy—there is a catch to the privy-door—it is what I term a night-bolt—it shuts and bolts—there is another entrance to it from the garden—if the door is shut you must go through the wash-house—if the door is open you can come in that way—the bolt is in the wash-house—it is the wash-house-door bolt—the privy-door was off its hinges at that time—the privy joins the wash-house, and when in the privy you can go out of the privy into the garden—you cannot get into the wash-house without the door is left open—you can get to the privy, through the wash-house, without going into the garden—the privy has two doors—the door leading to the garden was off its hinges at that time—I heard of Mr. Templeman's death, I think, at twelve o'clock in the day—I had been out—my husband went up, and he told me all the particulars when he came home, of the old gen<lb></lb>tleman being murdered—I cannot remember whether be told me any thing about the state he was found in on the floor—I knew all about it, and be<lb></lb>gan to talk to the prisoner about it before my husband came in—when he came in he broke upon the conversation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was his going for the bacon and beer the only occasion when your husband went out that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—with the exception of that inter<lb></lb>val he heard every thing that took place—when my husband said Richard had got a new pair of shoes, I said, "I think not, I think he has blacked and shined his old ones"—he said so to me the moment Richard walked across the room, while he was gone to the privy—when he came back from the privy he asked my husband to fetch him a drop of beer, and I believe he went out to fetch it—I think he was eating his supper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not after that, he talked so despondingly as you say about being such an unlucky man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was during the conversation.</p>

I re<lb></lb>plied, "I don't need a warrant"—he then said, "What do you want me for then?"—I said, "I suppose you have beard of the murder?—it is that I want you for"—he smiled, and said, "If I was as innocent of every thing as I am of that, I should not have much to fear"—I do not recollect his saying any thing more then—as he was packing up his clothes to dress himself, I found 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his trowsers' pockets, all in shillings—while I was counting it, I asked what money he had, and he said 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in his waist-coat-pocket I found seven lucifer matches, and two duplicates for a pair of trowsers and a jacket, dated, "22nd February, 1340, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" and "25th February, 1840, 35."—one in the name of Richard Gould, and the other in the name of Ann Jarvis—on the way to the station he said that a pot-boy at the William public-house had taken a warrant out against him for an assault, and it was that he supposed I was after him for—I had missed him for some time, and asked where he had been—he said, "To Norwich"—I searched him at the station-house, and took off his feet a pair of new shoes, or ankle-boots, which I produce—I asked him where he bought them—he said, in Kent-street—a constable who was standing by, said, "The Borough?"—the prisoner said, "Yes"—I then asked him what he had done with his old ones—he replied, "Thrown them away"—shortly after that, I minutely examined his clothes, and took from him this waist-coat, which he was wearing at the time—he had three waistcoats on—two besides this—this was the middle one—this waistcoat I noticed at the time was stained with blood, and it is also burnt in one particular spot, as if a cinder or a pipe had fallen on it—on my saying that the waistcoat</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe maker, and live at No. 93, Tottenham-court-road—I consider this pair of boots produced by Miller, were purchased at one of my shops—they are marked 92 and 8, which is a private mark—the 8 is the size, the 92 is the private mark—I have seven shops, one in Howland-street, another in Tottenham-court-road, two in Oxford-street, one in Regent-street, one in Walker's-court, Berwick-street, Soho, and one in King William-street, London-bridge—I live in Tottenham-court-road—I was there on the 17th of March—my daughter resides there—she is occasionally in the shop when I am up-stairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who marks the cost price? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes one, sometimes another—all of my shop men know the mark—when my shop-men leave my service, they know it just as well, and I now know that they use it as well—I did not before—I only know one who uses my mark, that is Mr. Wright, who has a shop in Lambeth-walk, where I sold him the business and the stock; and I believe he has another shop at the Marsh-gate, Westminster-road—I now know he uses the same mark as</p>

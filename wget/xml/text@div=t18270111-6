At six o'clock in the evening of the 16th of June, 1822, I placed a metal watch and a silver watch, a metal key, a gold key, and four sovereigns, in a drawer - I went out, leaving the prisoner in the house; I returned in twenty minutes; he was gone, and this property also; it has not been found - it was in a drawer in the first-floor front room; he had no business in that room, but could go there - I saw them safe two minutes before I went out - the drawer was shut, but not locked; it was all my husband's property; I had left the prisoner in the first-floor back room, where he lodged - my mother and father were in the house, and nobody else - I saw the prisoner in his room five minutes before I went out, and spoke to him: the two watches were worth 7l., and there were four sovereigns and a seal.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. On the 26th of December, I apprehended the prisoner in St. Martin's workhouse - I asked Mr. Clark, who was with me, if he was the person - he said, Yes; I told him I apprehended him for stealing four sovereigns and two watches from Mr. Clark - he said he was very glad of it, for he had suffered a great deal ever since he had stolen the articles. When we came out of the workhouse, he said I had no occasion to lay hold of his arm, for he would not run away - that he told some of his shopmates that he had done the robbery, in order that Clark might hear of it, and nobody else be accused.</p>

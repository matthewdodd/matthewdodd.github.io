             then took up the seal which he had before in his hand and said he would give me thirty five shillings for it as I was anxious not to keep the ladies at the door; I said he should have it; there were two or three ladies in the carriage; upon which he agreed to it, and left a three shilling piece deposit, saying he would call as he returned from the Hay market and pay the remainder and take it. He left the seal with me; they both left the shop. I sent my nephew and a little boy to watch these men to see if they went into any of my neighbours.

               <p>Q. Was the errand boy in the shop - A. No he was not. I went after the prisoners, I found my nephew watching them. I went into Mr. Blissets two doors lower down thinking they might come in there; they did not come into Mr. Blissetts; as they came by, Mr. Blissett being a constable, I asked him so pursue him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Blissets from your house - A. About two hundred yards, I waited a little time at Mr. Blissetts untill he came back and told me where they were gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were they taken when you saw them - A. When I saw them. they were taken at Mr. Hunters a jeweller in Fenchurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see them searched did you - A, No, I saw my property after they had been searched, it was two seals; I saw the two seals laying on Mr. Hunters glass; I knew them to be two seals that I had in my tray.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the worth of these two seals - A. Four pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Who had the knife - A. I cannot recollect that. I have the three seals here; I have kept them ever since; these are the two seals that Mr. Taylor claimed; I produce them.</p>

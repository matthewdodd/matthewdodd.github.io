                  </hi>. I am shopman to Alfred William Edward Joyes, of Whitechapel-road. In consequence of information, on the 5th of Novem<lb></lb>ber, I went in pursuit of the prisoner to Buttress-street—I saw a person standing at the corner, watching—I went to Mr. Greedus's house, asked them to open the door, they did so, and I found this linen, which I had seen safe an hour and a half before—it is my master's.</p>

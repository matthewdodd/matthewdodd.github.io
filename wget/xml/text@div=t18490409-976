                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, of Park-place. Mile-end-road. On 3d March, about half-past six o'clock in the evening., the prisoner came and asked to look at a metal tea-pot—he chose one at 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and an iron saucepan and tea-kettle—I had never seen him before, but am sure he is the man—he did not pay for them, but asked me to make out a bill; I did so, and he asked me to send my boy with the things—he said he was only going to Stepney-green with them—I sent a boy with him to carry them, who was to bring back the money—he came back in three-quarters of an hour without the tea-pot—on 29th March I went with an officer to 63, St. John-street, Clerkenwell—the prisoner came to the door—I asked if he knew Dr. Coward (he had spoken to me of Dr. Coward)—he said he knew a chemist of that name—I charged him with taking a tea-pot; he denied it—he was in my shop twenty minutes or half an hour—I noticed his speech, and that he. walked limping—I swear he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old, and was in Mr. Stapleton's service—I remember the prisoner coming—I heard him speak, and swear to him—I carried the things—he said he was going to 18, Ocean-street—at Stepney-green he said it was only a little further up; and said, "My little man, you had better let me take the tea-pot, if you scratch it, I won't have it"—I gave it him; he said, "You go and knock at No. 18, and I will over<lb></lb>take you, I am going to make water;" and went up the second turning in Ocean-street—I went on, he did not come; I went back, and he was not there—I noticed that he limped, and looked at the ground all the way he went.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Dr. Blackman, a surgeon, of 18 High Street, Whitechapel—on Wednesday evening, 8th January, abou' 6 o'clock, I was in the back surgery having my tea; the boy, William Fayers was in the front surgery—the prisoner came in, walked round my back, and sat himself down by the side of the fire—he was an entire stranger to me—I spoke to him—I said, "Good day," he made no reply; then, thinking, perhaps, that he was a patient I had forgotten, I said, "How do you do?"—he immediately got up, and said, "That's it," and walked away, passing round the back of my chair into the front surgery—I then went on with my tea, but on looking round a moment or two after I saw him standing at my desk in the front surgery overlooking my books—I called to him, and said it was not customary to allow strangers to look over our accounts—he immediately moved away to the front of the counter, at the back of which the boy was placing a number of bottles in a cupboard—I heard a crash of bottles, and looking into the front surgery I saw that the prisoner had driven four or five dozen bottles off the counter—as I got up, the boy ran to me and said, "He has stabbed me, sir"—I told him to go and fetch a policeman—in passing from the back surgery into the front the prisoner overtook me, and he immediately began stabbing me, although I did not feel the knife in the first instance—he stabbed me in two places on the right breast and then on the left—the third time he stabbed me I saw the blade of the knife; I could not see the handle, as he had that in his hand—it was a pen knife—the blade was about two or three inches long—I received five stabs, one in the arm and one through the hand, which I think I received as I struck my hand up to knock the knife out of his hand—I had a desperate struggle with him in the passage—he ultimately broke away from me, and ran into the back surgery, apparently to get the fire<lb></lb>irons—instead of taking up the poker he took up the top bar of the grate where the fire was burning, and pulled it off—the moment I found him in the back surgery I closed the door on him, and kept him there at bay as far as I possibly could—it is a glass door, with short blinds—he immediately knocked the blinds all to pieces and broke four or five squares of glass, and attempted to stab me through the broken window, but I kept out of his reach—he tried to open the door, but, I suppose from his hands being burnt, he could not turn the handle; I had not locked it—this state of things continued until the police arrived—I lost a great deal of blood, so much so that I became unconscious, and do not remember anything more that took</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187302030033"></xptr>
               <p>place—the wounds were all punctured wounds—they were serious, and very alarming, although not in their effects; I think the smallness of the knife was my safety, and the thickness of my clothes—it went through several folds of my clothes; through my coat, waistcoat, flannel shirt, and shirt into my chest—I have not yet quite recovered from the effects of the wounds, but I think they are progressing well.</p>

I am the wife of Donald Glass—I lodge at Dr. Black<lb></lb>man's—on the evening of 8th January I heard a noise, and went down stairs—I saw the prisoner and Mr. Thomas struggling together in the passage—the prisoner was raving, and swearing, and halloaing—he said, "Hell is opening, hell is opening; will none of you speak, will none of you speak!"—I saw him lay hold of the grate—the polios came and took him away—he was in a very excited, violent state—I saw him stab himself—he laid the knife on the table, undid his shirt, and stabbed himself in the pit of the chest.</p>

On 8th January I was sent for to Dr. Blackman's, and with the assistance of another constable I threw the prisoner on the sofa, and took this knife from him—I sent for handcuffs and handcuffed him—at the station he said "What do you keep the hand<lb></lb>cuffs on for now?"—I said "For fear you may hurt yourself again"—he said "I have not hurt any one else, have It if I have I am very sorry for it"—the police-surgeon was sent for, and in consequence of what he said, I took the prisoner to the workhouse to be taken care of—on the way to the workhouse he said "It is coming on again," and threw his arms out—we then put the handcuffs on him again—they had been taken off—he was not violent after that—he made no resistance to the handcuffs being put on again, I rather understood that he wished them put on.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 86, High-street, White<lb></lb>chapel, close to Dr. Blackman's—on the evening of 8th January I was called in to Dr. Blackman's surgery—I found Mr. Thomas there and the boy Fayers—Mr. Thomas was suffering from wounds in the chest and arm—they might be produced by a knife like this—the boy had a very slight wound; it had just cut the skin—I saw the prisoner there—I was there when he was taken by the police—it was very difficult to take him—four or five policemen were there—I examined him a few minutes after they had got him to the station, not with a view to ascertain the state of his mind, but for his wounds—he was stabbed in the belly, and his hands were in a frightful state—the little finger was nearly off, the flesh was severed completely round and burnt—I had very little chance of judging of his mental con<lb></lb>dition—he scarcely spoke—I did not see him afterwards, only for a few moments, while I attended to his wounds.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187302030034"></xptr>
               <p>he was not of sound mind at that time—he had considerable reasoning faculty, and talked very quietly and calmly to me, but he was evidently labouring under mental disease, which would render him liable to paroxysms of mania—he was in my opinion then suffering from mania—I ordered his removal to the lunatic ward of the Whitechapel Workhouse—assuming the facts to be true, he was, undoubtedly, then of unsound mind—I believe he had no control over his actions.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184104050176"></xptr>
               <p>on the following Saturday I went to Mr. Hawes, the pawnbroker's, and there got information that the jacket had been redeemed—in consequence of what I told my husband, he took the prisoner into custody—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in the habit of coming often to our place, several times, I can<lb></lb>not say how often—I was on very good terms with her.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it not strike you as strange that he should call once so long ago, and never call on you again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never thought any thing of it—I do not know from any husband that he has ever seen him from that day to this—I do not think he has seen him—he has not told me that he has seen him—he never said that it was very odd he had never seen my father since—my husband is a seafaring man—he was formerly a midshipman—he has not been a midshipman since we were married—we have been mar<lb></lb>ried two years and a half—he gets his living in the Docks—he is a labourer in the Docks, in the tea department, carrying things backwards and for<lb></lb>wards—he gets half-a-crown a day.</p>

               <p>was ill, and a little sugar, nothing else—she never did that but once—she never gave me any other things—I could not forget it if she did—she gave my husband a pair of trowsers about nine or ten months ago—it was a pair that was left off of her son's—they were good enough to work in—I am sure she gave us nothing else—I understand the prisoner is a French woman—my father came from Germany last—he had not been to Belgium, <hi rend="italic">as</hi> I know—the prisoner has lived at a great many places—she was conti<lb></lb>nually moving—she lived last at the corner of Farnham-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She drank tea with you on the Thursday, did she not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she was there again on the Friday morning, and she was there to tea on Friday—she came on Saturday morning—she did not have any thing then—we missed the ticket on Thursday after she bad left—the jacket was taken out of pawn on Saturday morning—I found it out about two hours after it was taken out—I found it out by going to the pawnbroker's—he told me it had been taken out by a person in black—he described the per<lb></lb>son—I saw the prisoner again that evening—the policeman and my husband were looking for her, and found her—I was not with the officer when he took her—I understood that the difference between the prisoner's name and ours was that there were two e's in her name, and only one in ours—bars is Valentine, and ours Valantine—I became acquainted with the pri<lb></lb>soner by her telling me she knew my father—that was before his arrival in this country—she said he had been a great friend to her—the prisoner has a son, whose father is dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You got so acquainted with her, that not only she, but her son, came to your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I cannot say whit way of life her son is in—she told me my father had got some papers belonging to her, and wished me to get his direction, and she would write—my father's direction abroad was, I believe, given, to her—I did not see it given—I have not seen her since my father has been in England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why, this happened on the 6th of April? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not tell her on the day I pawned the jacket, or any other day, that my father was in England—I had no reason for not wishing her to know his direction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you been cautioned that he did not wish to have any thing to say to her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he did not want to have any thing to do with her, or to see her, and in consequence of that I never told her he was to be found in London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to mention the woman's name, or he to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When my father came I said there had been a lady inquiring for him, and mentioned her name, Valentine—he did not say any thing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said just now he did not wish to see her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but he said nothing when I mentioned the name—he said, "I do not wish to see her"—considering he had some reason for that, I did not let her know he was in London—I did not know of her claiming to be his wife—I never heard her say any thing of the sort—I never understood it from my husband, or any one else—I did not ask my father why he did not wish to see her—he did not tell me any more than that he did not wish to see her—I thought it was very strange of my father—I thought he had his reasons for it, and did not tell her where he was—he did not tell me his direction—I told him directly he came in that a lady named Valentine had been inquiring for him—he did not tell me he was aware of it—I had no quarrel with the pri<lb></lb>soner before I missed the duplicate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Hawes, a pawnbroker, in High-street, Shadwell. On Thursday, the 25th of March, a jacket was pawned by the prosecutor's wife for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the following Saturday it was taken out by the prisoner between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning—she produced the duplicate, paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and took it out—I have both the duplicates here—people often come to redeem things which they have not pledged themselves—when the prisoner brought the duplicate, she said, "Make haste, I am in a hurry;" and as soon as it came down, I gave it to her, she paid me the money, and took it away—nothing further passed—she did not mention her name—she was dressed in black—I have not the least doubt of the prisoner being the persons—the jacket is worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the trade—it would cost the man about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should think—it was a beautiful jacket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you seen her at all before you went to the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw her, on Saturday night, in our shop, with the po<lb></lb>liceman and her son—I had never seen her before she redeemed this jacket—there was another female in the shop at the time—no one else—on one belonging to the shop—when the prisoner, came in on Saturday night, she made a face as if she wanted to disguise herself—we do not ask ques<lb></lb>tions of persons redeeming an article, if they produce the duplicate—when I saw the prisoner on Saturday night, I did not say she was the person—I said, I did not know—she made such a face, nobody would have known her—I knew her on Monday morning—I said, on Saturday night, I did not think she was the woman, from the dreadful mouth she made—she shut her eyes, and made a face, and that she did all the time she was in the shop—she was brought to me to be identified—she had no teeth out of her head when she took the jacket out—the policeman has three teeth in his possession, which he found in her pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fifteen years and a half old—I was at my bro<lb></lb>ther's house on the Thursday, when the prisoner was there—my brother and his wife went out, and me and the prisoner remained—I did not see her take any thing—no one came into the room till my brother came back—the prisoner went away about half an hour after they were gone—I did not touch any duplicate—I saw there was one there, when my sister put it into a little gallipot on the mantel-piece—when my brother and his wife came home, the duplicate was missed, and the loss of it mentioned—I was there again the next night, Friday—the prisoner was there—her son was</p>

               <p>not—he was not there on the Thursday—Mrs. Valentine, myself, my bro<lb></lb>ther and his wife, were there on the Friday—nobody else—I am sure her son was not there—I remember the loss of the duplicate being mentioned in the prisoner's presence on the Friday—she said, there was plenty of time yet to go and see about it; three months was plenty of time to go and stop the ticket, because there was a new regulation in the law—she said, she could go and get an affidavit to get another ticket—my brother had told my sister to go about it in the morning, which would be Saturday morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see Valentine, that came from Germany, when he came to visit you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I remember his coming to see us—it is about three weeks ago since he came from Germany—I saw him—my brother and sister were at home—they were greatly surprised to see him—I live with my brother and his wife—I was not present exactly when he came in, I was out with the child—I came in just after—I was there along with him, and my brother and sister were there—I recollect my sister telling him that there was a lady wanted very much to see him, a friend of his—he did not ask who she was; he seemed to know who she was—I did not hear exactly what he said—I did not take notice.</p>

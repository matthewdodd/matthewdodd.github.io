                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Hawkins, an oilman in Bishopsgate-street.

                  </hi>. I deal in bags. I have employed the prisoner for the last three months to get orders for me—he was paid by commission for what orders he got—it was part of his business to receive money for me, which he was to pay to me every night—these bags were delivered on Thurs<lb></lb>day morning, and on the Tuesday night following I asked the prisoner, when he returned, what business he had done—he said, "I expect some orders to<lb></lb>morrow, which I will give you an account of to-morrow"—I said, "Have you been to Mr. Hawkins, in Bishopsgate-street?"—he said, "Not to-day; I was there yesterday"—I said, "Have they paid for those bags?"—he said, "No, they have not"—I said, "I called there this afternoon, and they told me they paid you this morning"—he said, "I can assure you they have not, and I can bring proof that they have not"—I said, "That won't do for me; the best thing you can do is to give me the money"—he said, "I can assure you they have not"—I was then called down, and when I returned he was gone to bed—I got an officer, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Wild. On 6th Dec. I brought ten quires of newspapers from the <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi> office to Mr. Wild's, in Catharine-street—I left three quires of them at Mr. Herapath's in Red Lion-court, Fleet-street.</p>

About 25 minutes before 2 o'clock, and I left the three quires about 20 minutes before 2—I laid them down on the counter, and went off directly—there were the three Mr. Herapath's there—I went in and laid down the papers a yard or two from the door—the door was not open when I went; I opened the door—I did not close it—I saw nothing more of the papers—I left them because the load was too much for me—I did not go for them again.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Red Lion-court, Fleet-street. I recollect Russell leaving three quires of papers at my office, last Saturday week—they were put on the counter not far from the door—I afterwards saw the prisoner take them away—he had been in the service of Mr. Wild, and therefore we let him have them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time were they left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say exactly, it was between half-past one and two o'clock—my two brothers and myself were in the office—they were fetched away five or ten minutes after they were left—when they were fetched I was just moving off to the end of the counter—I was about two yards from them—there are two desks in the office—one of them would intercept my view—the prisoner did not say any<lb></lb>thing, he took them up, put them on his shoulder, and went away—I had seen him come for papers from time to time—he had a cap on which I believe was black, and a dark coat—I knew his person before, and swear he is the man.</p>

               <p>the prisoner—he had been in my employ but had left me two Saturdays before that—I only employed him on a Saturday, he was an extra hand—I did not authorise him to go on Saturday week to fetch the three quires of papers from Mr. Herapath's—I had not seen him for two Saturdays previous—I have not had the papers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On the 3d of March the prisoner came to me under pretence of hiring an apartment; he requested that I would sell him some honey, as he was commissioned by a friend in the country to send him some. I agreed to sell him nine pound, and he wished to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070056"></xptr>take it without paying for it. I objected to that, and requested that he would let my boy go to his house, and if it was a respectable house I had no objection. He took the boy with him. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>ROBERT WILLIAM PLAYFORD. I am servant to Mr. Luck. I went with the prisoner; he took me to a house in Union-street, in the Minories. He told me he lived there; he would not trouble me an further. I did not see him go into the house. He went into America-square, and then I lost him. I met him again in a few minutes; I believe he went into Crutchedfriars. I met him again coming over Tower-hill; I followed him into Old Gravel-lane, into the shop of Mr. Edmond's where he sold the honey for fourteen pence a pind, and when he came out of the shop I lost sight of him. I am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>MR. EDMONDS I am a chemist and druggist, in Old Gravel-lane. T. Birch, as he signed the receipt; he came to my house and said that he had a little honey that came out of the country, that he was recommended, me by Mr. Bedford.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by T. Birch - A. The prisoner. I believe him be the man, I could not swear to him. I gave him fourteen pence a pound; for the honey This is the receipt he gave me for it. The honey weighed between eight and nine pounds. The boy came in and told me the circumstance. I told him to pursue the man, instead of that he kept talking, and the man got off.</p>

             CORMACK. I am porter to Mr. Edmonds. The prisoner came into my master's shop with a jar of honey and offered it for sale. I weighed it; it eighed about eight pounds and a half, or three quarters, not nine pounds; they agreed about the price, and my master paid him; a boy came in and I went about my own business.</p>

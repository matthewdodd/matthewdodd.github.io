               <p>Q. Do you know who that man was? - A. No; I was apprehensive they would recommence their attack upon me, and I said, don't use me ill, and I will give you what money I have; I put my hand in my pocket, and took out what money I had and gave them; while I was doing this, the man had got his finger and thumb into my sob, and slipped the watch out; some signal was then given, and away they all ran; when they first came up, there was a kind of whisper amongst them, "has he got one?" by which I suppoted they meant a watch, and the man said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them were there? - A.There<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180057"></xptr>must have been at least twenty before me, as I stood on the step.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of a watch was it? - A. A gold watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not knocked down? - A. No, I saved myself by holding the rails, they took away my hat and my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if the prisoner was one of them? - A. No, I cannot speak to his person.</p>

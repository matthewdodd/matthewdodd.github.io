               <p>Price. She own'd them at a Neighbour's House.</p>

               <p>Price. They are here, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at those Stockings. What are they?</p>
               <p>Price. They are pink-colour'd Worsted Stockings; the Worsted the other Evidence has.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see these Stockings and Worsted in the Possession of the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Price. No, my Lord; but I had a Suspicion of her. She came in the Morning to pay my Wife a Farthing that she ow'd her: My Wife was not come down Stairs; I was below Stairs, and I suppose she took the Stockings then; the Worsted was taken the Day before; but the Evidence knows when she brought them. After I found the Handkerchiefs, I found the Stockings, at a Pawnbroker's in Marybon-Street.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure these were the Stockings that were found at Parry's the Pawnbroker's?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes, my Lord; these were at Parry's.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your Business?</p>
               <p>Price. A Hosier, my Lord, and Haberdasher.</p>

               <p>Court. You will swear these are the Stockings?</p>

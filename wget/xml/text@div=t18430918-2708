               <p>used to live at St. Alban's—in the early part of All year he was erecting some houses at Hillingdon, and the prisoner was employed there—the prisoner was a labourer, and had these tools to use—he worked continually on the work till February, and after that he worked oc<lb></lb>casionally to open and shut the windows, and look after the property—he finally left, at the latter end of April, or the beginning of May—I saw him before he left, and told him to send me a list of the tools he had had in use, and he sent me the list—he was to take care of the took in a bakehouse at the rear of one of the houses, which are on my father's pre<lb></lb>mises—he was to deposit them there, and leave them—he still had the care of the bakehouse—he had not occasion for these tools—about a month ago, I sent Dell there to dig a well, and from what I heard I went to the prisoner's cottage on the 14th of Sept.—his wife was there, but he was not at home—I went with a policeman about two hours afterwards—we found a wheelbarrow, three planks, and a shovel, and all the things mentioned in this indictment—they were things he had the use of, and which should have been in the bake-house—when the policeman asked the prisoner whether he had not got some things belonging to Mr. Guttridge, he hesitated a little time, and said yes, he enumerated two articles, and then stopped, and said, "That is all"—I am not certain whether he said he believed that was all—tne Officer asked him if he was sure that was all, and after some time he mentioned something else—we went to his premises and found these things—he had no authority to keep them on his premises, and certainly not to keep them till Sept.</p>

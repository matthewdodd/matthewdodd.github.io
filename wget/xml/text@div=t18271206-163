            . I live in Ratcliff-highway. On the 8th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came to my shop together; Bush came behind my counter - she said, "I beg pardon for making so free, but I want a pair of shoes;" she took up a shoe; I told her to walk on the other side of the counter, to take a chair, and try them on; she went round, but said she could always fit herself by her hand; I gave her several pairs, which she put her hand into, and objected to them; I observed, as I gave her them, that she took them with only one hand; I came round, and said, "What are you doing?" she was stooping - she said, "I beg your pardon, but my clothes are all coming down;" I then looked and missed a pair of men's shoes off a nail - she denied taking them; I said I would send for an officer; she then dropped them from some part of her dress - she had her hand as if she was adjusting her clothes; Martin stood by her side - my wife then said,"Perhaps the other has got something in her basket;" I went to Martin, and said, "What have you in your basket?" she said, "Only a bottle of medicine;" I took it, and found this one pair of shoes, and an odd one in it - I asked where she got them; she replied, "They are not mine - they are the other girl's." I sent for a constable.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took them in charge - Martin said the basket was hers; Mace claimed the shoes which were in it. As I took them along I asked where they got them; they at first said they found them: I said, "I am sure you stole them;" Martin said, "Well, we did steal them, not far off." There was an empty bottle, but no medicine in the basket.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

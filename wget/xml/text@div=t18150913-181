As soon as I got as far as Grays-inn street, I forgot that I had to call in Grays-inn-lane, and came back again. The prisoner was standing at the corner of Charlotte Buildings, and putting his foot behind me, knocked me into the passage; I put my hand into my right hand breeches pocket, and felt his hand here that was where the notes were. I hallooed out that I was robbed, and he swore he would rob me more. I was knocked senseless for some time; and when I got up, we went into Grays inn lane, and fought; at last he said he would not fight any more, and I ran to Hatton Garden, and got an officer.</p>

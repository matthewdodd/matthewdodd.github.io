                  </hi>. I reside with Ebenezer Davis and Richard Davis; they are drapers at Woolwich. On Saturday evening, 18th Nov., the two prisoners came to the shop about a quarter before 7 o'clock—one of them asked for some black twilled handkerchiefs—I got down a paper parcel, and found we had not any—we had some plain ones—they were kept in the same parcel—they looked at the plain handkerchiefs—there were in the parcel three pieces containing about six handkerchiefs in each, and one single handkerchief—Dean opened the single handkerchief, and by that means covered the three other pieces which were lying on the counter—it hid the others from my view—there were four or five other customers in the shop beside the prisoners—I left the prisoners for about half a minute—I was about two yards from them—I returned to the prisoners—they were in the same position as they were before—nothing attracted my atten<lb></lb>tion, only that the single handkerchief had been opened—I think it had been opened just before I left the prisoners, but I cannot recollect—I folded it up, as they decided that it would not do—they then left—they did not purchase anything—I followed them, out immediately—they turned to the right, and I could not find them—I went to the station—I had missed one piece of handkerchiefs as soon as they had left—this is the piece I missed—I am quite sure of that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 80). In consequence of information I went to the Miter tavern, High-street, Woolwich, on 18th Nov., about five minutes before 7 o'clock in the evening—I saw both the prisoners standing in front of the bar—I said, I must take them into custody for stealing silk handkerchiefs—Wyles said she had got nothing, and turned her pocket inside out—Dean said he had got nothing, but if I would go up stairs I might search him—I was in the act of taking Dean into custody, and he was forced away from me by some persons standing in the door—he made his escape out of the door by the assistance of some bystanders—he ran about 15 yards, when he was stopped by a bystander—I immediately pur<lb></lb>sued him, and took him to the station—I found a quantity of silk in his possession, which I produce—I asked him where he got it—he said he</p>

               <p>bought it of a broken down shopkeeper in Woolwich—I went in search of Wyles, and found her about half a mile from the public house, against the dock yard—she was in company with two marines—I took her into custody—she said, "How funny you are"—I took her about 100 yards, and she said, "What do you want with me, I have not done anything"—I told her she was charged with being concerned in stealing silk handkerchiefs with a man—she said she had not been with a man, and she denied all knowledge of the handkerchiefs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were not the words which she used, that she knew nothing about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Mr. Waters lives in High-street, Woolwich, which is about three quarters of a mile from the dock yard gate—when I went in the public house I spoke to the two prisoners, not to one individual—they were both standing close—I said, "I must take you into custody"—I believe I said "you"—I did not see Wyles searched—I was standing outside, and nothing was produced.</p>

I was sober - he asked if I had got my watch; I said Yes, and asked why he wanted to know; he said I had better give it him, or very likely I should be robbed before I got home - he lived at Hounslow. I have met with an accident, which prevents my defending myself. He took it from me - I did not give it to him. I thought he meant to return it. I went on Monday, and asked him for it - he denied having ever seen it. He was taken into custody three weeks after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LOVITT. Q. Have you not often drank with him - A. Yes. I was not tipsy that night: I have been tipsy at times, and thrown my money about - he has taken care of it, and given it to me afterwards. He walked some way with me, and said I had better let him have the watch - I did not object to his taking it from my pocket, having no idea that he meant to steal it.</p>

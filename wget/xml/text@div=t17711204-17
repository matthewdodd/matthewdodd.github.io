I saw a drawer had been opened, out of which the spoons were taken, which shut in between two cup-boards, and could not have been easily discovered but by a person that knew of it. I went out of the bar and ran up stairs in a fright; I said my house is robbed, my bat is broken open; I found all my lodgers a-bed that went to bed at night; I came down again and could not find any place where the thieves could have broke in. Mince went and called the watchmen. I suspected someby must have let them in finding the outer door a-jar.

               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular about the door, the bar, or the till?</p>

               <p>Belinger. There was a hole made by which they could pull back the spring lock, the drawer of the till was cut with a knife in order to get at the lock.</p>
               <p>- Mince. I have lodged in this house eleven years. When I got up at five in the morning. I saw the bar open, and I alarmed Mrs. Bellinger. The top shutter was put down against the door; the till appeared to be cut open with a knife.</p>
               <p>- Wetherby. I am a watch man. I came down by the prosecutor's door at ten o'clock, then all was safe; at half after twelve having called the hour I went to my box; there was a young fellow. in a white coat, whistled between his fingers; then a man opened a sash in the prosecutor's house, and put his head and shoulders out at the window, and said where are they: the man in the street said, they are all together, will not you come down and go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040010"></xptr> along with them? He replied, no, he could not come down. Then the clock struck one; I took my lanthorn and went round to call the four. I cou'd see no person there then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be before you came back?</p>
               <p>Wetherby. More than a quarter of an hour. The place where the back door is, don't belong to me. It is within sight of my stand. I look'd at the door when I came back; all was fast then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise in the house?</p>
               <p>Wetherby. No; I called the hour at two; I saw nothing then. When I came back from calling the half hour after two, Sam came up into the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his sirname?</p>
               <p>Wetherby. No; he had been a servant to the prosecutor but a short time before; I thought he had been so then: He threw something up at the same path that the man had before looked out at, which was two stories high. I told him not to offer to throw any thing up at that time, for I would not suffer him to do any such thing. Then I saw the sash go up, and a man put out his hand, and wagged his fingers, by way of beckoning to him. Then Sam went away, and the man pulled the sash down again: Then the clock struck three. I took my lanthorn, and went round, and called the hour. When I came back, my candle was almost out; I had left a spare candle in my box, which was gone when I came back. I went and challenged some draymen with having taken it; they said they had not. I walked into the alley, and saw the door standing a little a jar; that was about half an hour after three. I thought I heard something stirring about the place: I struck the door three times with my staff, and two young fellows jumped out at the door. I asked them what they were doing there: They said they were going to their work. Then presently another came out. I saw the glimpse of a candle a going up stairs, but it was put out in a minute. I took care of the door till Mr. Mince came down: Then I told him they had got careless lodgers, for I did not think they were thieves; if I had, I would have had them all taken. Sam was the third that came out of the house: I did not know then that Sam had left the service.</p>

               <p>Wetherby. No.</p>

            , and I think four more, on the 20th of November, in the court near Mr. Bellenger's house, about twelve at night. I saw Sam the waiter, and one Bowman, and another man that was taken up and discharged at Sir John Fielding's. There were five or six standing in the court. Sam said Moxon, I wish you would lend me six-pence, for I have left my place, and have no money. I was going to lay at Mr. Bellenger's that night; it is a public-house. As I was going to lend Sam six-pence, while I had my hand in my pocket, Farrell put his hand into my pocket, and picked out a glove and comb. Sam said, if you take any thing out of his pocket, I'll knock your head off; so he gave me my comb and glove again. Shepherd was coming home along with me; Moody attempted to pick his pocket; I am certain Farrell was one of the men that was in the court. When we searched him, we took about 4 l. out of his pocket. Edridge lay with me that night.</p>

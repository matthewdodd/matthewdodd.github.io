When we got within fifty or sixty yards of him, he called to me, and said there was something; there was some boggy ground between us: I said, if there is any thing, pick it up. Upon that, he put his hand down, and at four several times, brought up four silver spoons: we brought the prisoner and them to Mrs. Fitzpatrick, and she owned the spoons: we took the prisoner before Justice Welch, and he committed him. Mr. Welch asked him what was the reason of his running? he said, that he and I were running for apples.</p>

On Saturday the 24th of August, I met the prisoner coming out of my mistress's parlour; I missed the spoons, and went out, and called Stop thief; he ran cross the fields; Mr. James ran, and he and the other witness brought him back. These spoons are my mistress's property.</p>

Mr. James was running; he said, Stop stop; I said, What must I stop for? he said, you must go back again. I was willing to go back with him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector D</hi>). On 30th November, about 4.40 a.m., Burke passed me in the Marylebone Road, near Quebec Street, going east, and carrying this rush basket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—three men had passed me two or three minutes before going in the same direction, about 80 yards in front of Burke—I have no doubt that Donovan was one of the three—I 'stopped Burke—the basket was rather heavy, and I said "What have you got in the basket?"—he said "My tools, with which I am going to set a stove at Battle</p>

I have been told that Burke has lived in the same house in Providence Place twenty years—I do not know that he is 65 years old, or that he has been in the receipt of parish relief for two years—three gentlemen are here to give him a character—I saw three men walking ahead, and this poor old man (Burke) was carrying a basket—he said that he would rather go to the station with me—this prosecution is conducted by the Treasury.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FRITH</hi>. I was standing still, and the three men passed me close—they were eighty yards ahead of Burke when I stopped him—he was going towards King's Cross, and he compelled me to take him to the station, which is half a mile in a contrary direction—the charge against Donovan was loitering with intent to commit a felony and assaulting the police—I took Burke's daughter to the station with me, and she very kindly assisted me and pointed out Donovan afterwards—I was sure of the man, but I took her down that she might be a witness at the police-court, and to identify Donovan as <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—I asked her to see whether Tom was there—I did not ask her to point out Dovovan—she picked him out without any asking at all—she knew what she was coming for—I had sent her there as she said she should know the man <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—I had told her what her father had said—she is a witness for the prosecution.</p>

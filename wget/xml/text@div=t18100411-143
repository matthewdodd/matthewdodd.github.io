               <p>MR. CARPENTER. I am an engraver in Aldgate High-street.</p>
               <p>Q. On or about the 18th of January last, did the defendant call at your shop - A. He did, within two or three days before or after; he called the first time with a book entitled the Worthies of Devon, a quarto volume; he asked me to purchase it; I declined it; a Mr. Bond came in before the defendant had left the shop. Mr. Bond was asked if he would purchase it; Mr. Bond paid thirteen shillings for the book, and the book was left at my house till the evening, when Mr. Bond called for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the defendant is the man - A. Yes, I have known him for twenty years. The next day the defendant called again with two more copies of the same work; he pressed me to purchase one; I did, for ten shillings and sixpence; this is the one I purchased; I wrote my name on it, when I gave it up; the defendant took the other out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, in consequence of your seeing an advertisement, you caused information to be given - A. That was the case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You said you had known the defendant for twenty years - A. Yes; I never knew any harm of him before this time, and this I leave you to judge of him.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BOND. Q. Were you at the house of Mr. Carpenter at the time that he stated - A. Yes, I purchased this copy for thirteen shillings; there are my initials.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GALE. Q. You are clerk to Mr. Worrall, the attorney - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on the 10th of February last, by the direction of the prosecutor, go to the lodgings of the defendant - A. I did; I told him that I had called on Mr. Carpenter, who had purchased a book entitled the Worthies of Devonshire; that Mr. Carpenter had informed me, that at the time he bought his, he had another undisposed of; he said that he had; I told him I should he very glad to purchase it of him. I agreed to give him twelve shillings for it; he said that he had not the book by him at that time, but if I would call on Monday afternoon at four o'clock, I should have the book, paying him the twelve shillings; I asked him whether he had any more than one; he said no he had not. I then asked him whether he could procure any more; he said that depended upon whether he could see his friend between the time of my calling on Monday afternoon. I said, at any rate you will let me have the copy you have got; he said, at any rate you shall have the copy I have, by my God. On Monday I went again; I was accompanied with Hancock, the officer, Mr. Longman's clerk, and a warehouseman. I first went up alone; I asked him if he had the copy; he said no, he had not got it; I came out of the room, and went into the street, and called Hancock. When Hancock went up, he searched the lodging; the defendant then said he had sold one to Mr. Carpenter, and that was the only one that ever he had; I said, Mr. Polack, you are certainly mistaken; you have already disposed of two, and at the time that you disposed of the second to Mr. Carpenter, you had a third in your possession in Mr. Carpenter's shop; he still denied that he ever had more than one in his possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. That could not be, because he told you that he had two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Mr. Gale, did you enquire how long he had that one or more - A. He said that he had that one in his possession two months; he said he bought it along with a parcel of waste paper.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, in the month of January last, put up the works, the Worthies of Devon, in boards, for Messrs. Longman and Co. - A. Yes, we received the sheets of letter-press from the printer about the 4th of January, and part of the copper-plates from Messrs. Fox and Barnet, and the other part from Mr. Trepas, Mr. Longman's servant. We were to put them in boards for Messrs. Longman and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these two of the copies that you so put in boards - A. They are; they are marked No. 10, by our sewer.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day were the copies delivered by you to Messrs. Longman - A. The first copies on the 6th of January; and on the 10th, 11th, and 13th, there were regularly deliveries afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. TREPAS. Q. Are you in the service of Longman and Co. - A. I am; I delivered out part of the copper plates of this book to the last witness about the 2d or 3d of January.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive the first copies from him. - A. I think about the 8th; it was a book published by subscription.</p>
               <p>Q. When were the first copies delivered out to subscribers - A. On the 12th of January, they were sent to Rees and Curtis for the subscribers at Plymouth. I think I sent them three hundred.</p>

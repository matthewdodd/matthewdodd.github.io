On the 14th of April, about nine o'clock at night, I went to get a sample of wheat, and told him to light me to the barn, which he did. I then saw both my barns were locked safe. The prisoner left me and went into the stable to look after his horses. In about twenty minutes I came out again for a better sample, and found the prisoner was not in the stable - I called him, but he did not answer. I found a candle burning in the stable - I suspected something, and concealed myself; I then saw the oat harn-door open, and the prisoner come out with something in a sack; I collared him, and found two bushels of oats in the sack; he said it was to give to the horses, as he liked to see them look fat. I asked him when he had his corn out? he said, that night; the bailiff told him he had given him three bushels of oats that night. I found his corn-chest full of oats-there was plenty for the horses.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I always tell my servants if they steal corn for the horses, I will prosecute them. The prisoner slept in my house that night. I did not lock him up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the barn-door open, and found the boy there with the oats. I brought them out, and said I was going to feed the horses, to screen the boy.</p>

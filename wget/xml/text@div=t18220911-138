The prisoner came between four and five o'clock, and produced the duplicates of two books, pawned for 1 s., saying he wanted to redeem them. The prosecutrix had been before - I asked where he got the ticket; he said he found them in Cloth-fair. I asked if he had any objection to wait till I sent for the woman, he said No, and sat down. There were two other persons in the shop, who could have prevented his leaving.</p>

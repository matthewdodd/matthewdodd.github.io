The two prisoners came to the shop together on the evening of the 22d of August - Haggerty bought half a silk handkerchief for 7d.; they took the handkerchiefs off the line at the door, and brought them in to me; there were three parcels - I missed one from off the counter; I looked over the counter and they were on the floor - Shay took them up; I cut off the handkerchief for Haggerty, and then I missed some more - Shay was then gone; I asked Haggerty where she was gone - she said she did not know; I said I would detain her, but finding she had a bundle of more value than the handkerchiefs, I said if she would leave that, and bring Shay back, I would let her have it; she agreed to do so, and she went to the door, went across the road and joined the other - I followed and brought them both back - I found on Shay a bonnet in a little blue hat; I took that out, and in the crown of the bonnet were the handkerchiefs I had lost; I had asked Shay before if she had seen the handkerchiefs, and she said with an oath, she had not - nothing was found on Haggerty.</p>

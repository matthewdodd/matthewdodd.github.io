On Wednesday, the 20th of August, the prisoner came to hire my truck; I refused it to him, and some time after I missed it - I saw him on the Friday; I asked him when the truck was coming home; he said that night, but it did not come - on the Saturday I saw him; he said he had taken it home, but I took him - it had not been returned; when I asked him for it, he d-d, and said I might get it as I could.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had hired the truck before. Witness. No- he never hired it in his life; I believe he had worked for me part of a day - I do not know when.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner that Wednesday night, in a house, in Bunhill-row; he said he had a truck for sale, and asked where he could sell it - I declined to do anything with it; and next morning I saw him going down Holborn with a truck; he spoke to me - I returned in an hour and a half, and he then took the truck and went away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time were you in the Borough with me? A. I went to the Borough with him I think four weeks ago last Wednesday; he said it was on business for his master.</p>

            . I live near the prosecutor's shop. I saw the prisoner there on the 20th of August; he looked at the shop, went in and came out; went in again, and took the board of the truck into the shop - he then went and took the truck out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not seen me before? A. Yes - I have seen you in Gray's Inn-lane; I never saw you in the house, nor the shop - I have seen him in the yard, and in the Bull public-house: I have to mind the shop while the men go to dinner - it was at dinner time I saw him.</p>

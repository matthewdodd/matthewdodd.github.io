             I did; Williamson had robbed me in February, and was tried for it; at this time they had a woman in company with them; there was a large bottle at the end of the counter, and Savage put his hand behind and reached this bottle of peppermint down; I saw him put his hand behind him, but I did not see him take the bottle; after he had turned himself round, he bolted out with the bottle, and ran so fast we could not find him; my wife took hold of Williamson, and by assistance we took him to the watch-house; the bottle was never found.</p>

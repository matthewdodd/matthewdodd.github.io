                  </hi>. I am a bedstead-maker, and live at 2, Pedley-street, Bethnal-green. I knew George Smith, the deceased, he kept a beer-shop at the corner of Pedley-street, on Fleet-street-hill. On the evening of the 21st Oct. I was going home, and passing Mr. Smith's beer-shop I saw him at his own door—I know the prisoner; he is a beer-shop keeper directly opposite Smith's—Wells was with Smith, and Mrs. Smith was standing at her door—Smith said he wanted to know what became of the money that they had from the <hi rend="italic">"lead"</hi>—I do not know what a <hi rend="italic">"lead"</hi> is—he said that to Cousins—Cousins said, "I will let you know what becomes of the money;" and he up with his fist and struck him—young Cousins crossed over with his father—it was the prisoner who struck Smith—they had a very few words before the blow was struck—they had a few words after that concerning this <hi rend="italic">lead</hi> money, and Mr. Cousins there and then <hi rend="italic">butted</hi> him on the left-side, and parties that stood by said, "Cowardly, cowardly that!"—Cousens was close to him at the time he <hi rend="italic">butted</hi> him—his head touched his body as soon as he leant it down—there were other persons round; no one that I knew—when there was a cry of "Cowardly!" Cousins said it was a mistake, his foot slipped—Smith made no answer—that was all I observed—the deceased went in-doors after that, and I went home—I was standing close to Mr. Smith's door at the time this took place: I live next door to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver, and live at 10, Silver-street, Stepney-green. On Monday evening, 21st Oct., I was at Mr. Smith's beer-shop, from seven or eight o'clock till about twelve—Mr. Smith was serving and attending there—about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve he and I went out, and went to the Seven Stars public-house, and had half a gill of gin between us; and on our return home we met with Stockings, and he asked Smith where all the money went to of the friendly; <hi rend="italic">leads;</hi> to which Smith replied, "I should like to know"—the prisoner, who was standing at his own door at the time, came into the middle of the road, and said, if Mr. Smith wished for any information he had better go to the secretary and see—Smith turned round, and said, "I am not addressing myself to you, Sir"—then the prisoner, with his son-in-law, came over to Smith's door, and while I was standing there I received a blow in the face from the son-in-law, who instantly made off—with that the prisoner's son took Smith by the neckcloth, and pinned him against</p>

Q.</hi> I believe you are paying your addresses to Smith's daughter, are you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is my business—I did nothing more than release the deceased from the prisoner's son—I was rather endeavouring to make peace—I had not my coat off, I swear that—I had not offered to fight—I had had three or four pints of beer during the evening, not all to myself; I asked several friends to drink, and Mr. Smith also occasionally—I am quite sure it was Stockings who said, "I wonder what becomes of the money for these <hi rend="italic">leads?</hi>"—it was not Smith that said that to Stockings—nobody was called a b—informer that evening in my hearing—Stockings was nearer to me than Smith—he must have seen the <hi rend="italic">butting</hi> as well as me—I did not hear the police desire Smith to go in; he came in a few minutes after me—I left him outside, talking to the persons round—the <hi rend="italic">butting</hi> took place while the prisoner's son had him by the neckcloth against the wall—it was two distinct <hi rend="italic">butts</hi>—I did not hear the persons round cry out anything—I must have heard it if they had—when Mr. Smith came in he did not complain at all of being hurt; he did not appear to be in any pain—this seemed to me like a general affray—I cannot say how many persons were engaged in it—there was nothing to provoke it, except what Stockings said—Smith had no license to sell spirits—I had been with him for four or five hours that evening—he drank with me occasionally—there were several engineers of the Eastern Counties Railway there—we were all drinking together—only I and Mr. Smith went to the Seven Stars—I have not said that we had two glasses of gin a piece there—I did not hear young Cousins say, "You shan't strike my father"—I used frequently to go to Mr. Smith's—I did not see him again till the following Saturday—I then saw him at his own house, in the bar—it was between nine and ten at night—he was attending to his business and serving, and frequently in the tap-room—I did not consider myself at all overtaken with drink on this night, nor did Smith consider me so—he saw me home as far as the Whitechapel-road, after this affray, between twelve and one o'clock, to protect me—during our walk he made no complaint of any injury or pain; nor did he complain on the Saturday after—he appeared to me quite well, as well as usual—I saw him again on Sunday, the 27th, and had tea with them—I cannot recollect whether there were any customers there—Smith was in and out of the bar-parlour—I stayed there till twelve o'clock—he did not complain of any pain or injury then; he seemed as well as he was before; he went about his business as usual—on the night of the affray, after Mr. Smith came in, Stockings came into the house, and sat down for a short time—I</p>

                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. I knew the deceased upwards of ten years—he was not given to drink—I have been in his company a great deal, and never saw him the worse for liquor—he was in good health up to 21st Oct.—I have walked upwards of twenty miles with him on several occasions, and he has come home quite fresh and well, not the least fatigued—he was a strong, healthy man, of a good constitution—I called on him on 25th Oct., and saw a very great difference in him—he was sitting by the fire with some linseed-tea, and appeared very bad—I saw him in bed about three days before his death, but he was too ill to converse with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and have been in practice twenty-five years. I saw the deceased on 31st Oct.—he complained of pain in the left side of his chest—I examined him—he was suffering from inflammatory action of the chest—I wished him to be bled; he objected—I proposed leeches, but he wished to try medicine first—I gave him some, and cautioned him to come to me if he was not better—on 3rd Nov. I was called to him about four o'clock in the morning—he complained of the same pain in an aggravated degree—his breathing was very difficult indeed, he was unable to lie down in bed—I bled him freely, which very much relieved him for the time, and applied a blister to his side—he was much better next day—I attended him every day—he had a relapse, and was cupped in the side on 5th Nov.; but the vital powers were going then—I was not present at his death—I did not suggest that his body should be opened—I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exami<lb></lb>nation—death was caused by extensive inflammation of the pleura—a large effusion of water and matter had taken place, three pints and a half or four pints, which occupied the whole cavity of the left side as much as could be, the lung being compressed and displaced by it—that effusion might have been produced by a man <hi rend="italic">butting</hi> against his left side with his bead, on 21st Oct.—if he had submitted to be bled, when I first saw him, he would have had a rather better chance, but I think it would have been too late.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Inflammation of the pleura may proceed from a thousand other causes than external violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From other causes—his constitution did not appear to be injured by intemperance—there was functional derangement of the stomach and digestive organs, when I first saw him—I then thought that phlebotomy would do much for him, but I do not now—he was a strong hale man of about forty-six—catching cold in a man who had had two fits in two and a half, or three years, in one of</p>

               <p>which he had broken or dislocated his ribs, would predispose him to inflam<lb></lb>mation, which if not timely attended to, and the suggestions of the medi<lb></lb>cal man complied with, might end in death—the main cause of pleurisy is cold, it often produces death—he was a moderately full subject; not of a plethoric habit, but one upon which inflammation would take hold readily enough—there was no inflammation of the right lung—its being confined to the left, indicated mechanical violence—inflammation from violence it limited to the part injured, but it is not usually so when it arises from cold—if the death was caused by inflammation arising from cold, I should have expected to have seen both lungs inflamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it an inflammation of the lungs, or of the pleura? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of the pleura, and a small portion of the left lung—when the left side of the thorax is inflamed from cold, I should as a general rule expect the right side to be inflamed—if it arose from a draught, it would be more strongly developed on one side than the other—it might reach the other side in four or five days, but that would not be the case from a blow, it would cause mischief in the part where it was directed to—I do not mean to say that pleurisy on the left side could not happen without the right being affected; not even from cold—where the inflammation is very acute and virulent it will extend to the other side—the deceased had suffered from inflammation of the right lung at some distant period—it was carni<lb></lb>fied, and had adhered to the chest, but it performed its functions—he de<lb></lb>pended entirely on that lung, while the inflammation was going on on the left side of his chest—the left lung ceased to be useful perhaps the day previous to his death—it had gradually been approaching that state for several days—I cannot tell when the effusion began, but when it did it encroached upon the lung—inflammation might be caused by a blow, with<lb></lb>out any extravasation under the skin—I think there ought to have been some external mark of the blow in the early days, but I did not strip him; I felt his chest and ribs to ascertain whether there was any fracture, but found none—I did not lift his shirt—that was so long after the 21st Oct., that any external mark might have disappeared—it must have been a very violent blow—the room was dark when I examined him, and I did not particularly look for an injury—I went to treat him for acute symptoms under which he was suffering—inflammation might exist from a fortnight to a month without such an effusion of matter as I saw; I cannot say as to two months; inflammation sometimes proceeds very slowly—I cannot judge accurately—it depends on the temperament and habit of body—a man who lives incautiously is more liable to inflammation—I found all the organs of the abdomen healthy; I did not examine the head; I should have done so if he had died from a fit, but I considered I had found the cause of death, and went no further—that was my nephew's opinion also—besides cold, pleurisy may arise from intemperance, or inhaling bad air.</p>

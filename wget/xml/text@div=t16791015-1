               Clipping of Money
            </rs>, she liv'd amongst her Neighbours in very good Equipage; and was accounted Rich, but it appears she got her Money by very base practises, making it her Trade to Buy stolen Plate, which having a considerable Stock she would keep a great while by her, till all remembrance or inquiry after it was over, and then make Money of it, to this purpose she held correspondence with the most noted Theives, amongst whom one having a long time been eminent both for House-robbing, and Exploits on the Highway, being now reclaimed and allowed his Pardon, that he might discover the rest of his Gang, did now come to give Evidence against her, and swore that one time going to sell a parcel of stolen Plate, being well acquainted with her Habitation, he went up staires, and opened a door so suddenly that he surprized her in the very act of Clipping a Shilling, holding it in the Sizzars in her hand, and just before her, a large parcel of Clippings, but he then spoke nothing to her of it at that time, but only blush'd and presently removed the Clippings, and so fell to bargaining with him for his Plate. And when he first discovered her, Captain Richardson and other officers going to apprehend her, took her with 27 shillings in her hand, just newly Clipt; which she endeavoured to shuffle away. They also found several large parcels of Plate that had lately been stolen <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16791015002"></xptr> from several Persons of quality, and of which Publique notice had been given, a stolen Diamond Ring on her Finger, a parcel of melted Silver, and a Book of Receipts, whereby it appeared what Vast quantities of Plate had passed through her hands, Besides there was found in her possession, about 300 pound in Silver, which the Witnesses testified was all their Money; and generally the largest for such a quantity that ever they saw. The Prisoner was or at least pretended to be very Deaf, and therefore was brought from the Barr into Court, the better to hear what was proved against her, which she had fitter material to alleadge, but only denied the crime: confessing that she did indeed buy Plate, but knew nothing that it was stolen; and that the Witnesses swore against her, to save his own Life and merit his Pardon. But the other circumstances being so apparent the Jury could not but find her <rs id="t16791015-1-verdict3" type="verdictDescription">

About half past four, Lovatt, Warren, and I, saw Corty and Edwards come out, and go up Marshall-street, as if they were going towards Broad-street; upon which Lovatt and his nephew took them into custody; I continued on the watch till six o'clock, when I observed White and Kitchen come out, and Lovatt and his nephew took them also into custody, in Broad-street, and they were taken before the Magistrate. I will swear the prisoners are the four men.</p>

             Sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street: On the night of the 21st of July, I was called up about half past three o'clock in the morning, and about a quarter past four, we saw Edwards and Corty come out of Skully's house; my nephew and I apprehended them, and took them to St. James's watch-house; and afterwards apprehended White and Kitchen. I searched Corty and Edwards as soon as I got them to the watch-house, and found a great number of Banknotes, and seven guineas, upon Corty; and about fourteen pounds in Bank small notes on Edwards; I was desired to take care of three of the brightest of the guineas. I searched the others, and found ten pounds on White, in two two-pound, and six one pound notes; and a twenty pound note on Kitchen, and a pair of wet dirty stockings in his pocket; I desired Hillham to take particular care of the house while I got a warrant to search it. About half past six o'clock I went and executed it, and found a lump of what I conceive to be silver, rather warm, on the top of a bureau in the parlour, and a great number of things in the jewellery and goldsmith line, which I took to the Magistrates, and a crucible. Skully is a jeweller, and keeps four or five men at work; he was not at home then, nor have I seen him since, though I searched diligently after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. It is nothing uncommon to find melted silver in a jeweller's shop? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the trinkets that were found, none were owned? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a twenty pound note on Kitchen, which was returned to him? - A. Yes; it was not owned, and I was ordered to return it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. (To Langdale.) Q. Look at those three bright guineas, - among the nine you lost, were there three such as those? - A. Yes; I had seven new, and two old guineas; three exactly corresponded with these.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. They are three common guineas, without any particular mark on them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said they were innocent, and left their defence to their Counsel.</p>

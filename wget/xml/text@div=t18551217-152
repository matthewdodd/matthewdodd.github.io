                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Wandsworth. On Satur<lb></lb>day, 17th Nov., the prosecutor came to my surgery about 10 o'clock in the morning; I examined his head, and found a contused wound on the back of the scalp, which had laid bare the bone—it must have been produced with con<lb></lb>siderable violence, with a blunt instrument—it was about an inch long—it was bleeding slightly at that time—it had bled a great deal—all wounds on the scalp are dangerous, they are likely to produce erysipelas and inflamma<lb></lb>tion of the brain—I considered this certainly a dangerous wound—I should say this poker (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>), or a similar instrument, produced it—I dressed the wound, and it did very well—he was under my attendance about a week—it soon healed, as wounds in the scalp generally do, if they take a healthy course.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the water side, at Wandsworth, and am a waterman. On Saturday morning, 17th Nov., about 10 ten minutes before 8 o'clock, I was at the railway tap at Wandsworth—I was going to have some beer with some of my mates—the prisoner came out of the tap room door near where I was standing—he said, "We have all <hi rend="italic">got the sack</hi> from the distiller's"—he had before worked with me at the brew-house, and the distiller's—a young man named Bennett, who was with me, said, "What is that to do with us? we have got one job; we don't want two or three"—the prisoner went outside the door, and came in again, and began to black<lb></lb>guard me, and called me all the thieves, and b—snotty nosed liars, and <hi rend="italic">poodle</hi> men, and under price men, he could think of—I said, "Don't call me a b—snotty nosed liar again; if you do, very likely I shall bit you"—he took and kicked me on the leg, and after we had two or three rounds in fighting, I thought it was all over—we fought with our fists—before he kicked me I had not done anything to him, nor had any one else—the fight lasted three or four minutes—we both fell down—during the fight he kicked me two of three times—when the fight was over, the prisoner went into the tap room—I was still standing before the bar, as I had done—I did not see him come out of the tap room again—I was standing with my back to the tap room door, and he came behind me, and hit me over the top of the head with the poker—I did not see him before he struck me—it was a very hard blow—I tried to get the poker away from him, and he struck me on the. side of the head with the knob end of the poker—he struck me twice on the side of the head—the wound on the top of the head bled very much, it knocked me silly at the time—another man got the poker away from the</p>

               <p>prisoner—he went in the tap room again, and came out again to the front of the bar—he said, "You b——, I will rip your b——guts out; I will be the death of you"—and when he got outside the door, he said, "I will stone you to death"—I went afterwards to Wandsworth police court, for a summons against the prisoner—while I was there, the prisoner came to take a summons out against me—I charged him with this assault—the Magistrate granted a warrant, and he was remanded—I went afterwards to Mr. Brown, the surgeon—I suffered a good deal of pain from this wound.</p>

Q.</hi> When you got to the police court did you meet the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he came after me—I had the first say before he came into the room—I do not know whether it would take a great deal to stone me—I call myself a waterman—when my master has any work I work on the barges—I have been a prize fighter—I have fought three or four battles in my days—I never was in a place like this before—I have been charged with assault—I was tried in the police court—I never had six months—I was sent for a month once—I have been sent to gaol for committing assaults two or three times—I have not been committed six times for committing assaults on other people, never six times in my life—other people assaulted me as well—I have not been six times taken into custody, and brought before a Magistrate for committing violence; never with violence—I have not been six times taken up, four or five—I know a person named Hookham—about a year ago I was taken up on a charge of assaulting him—I was not sent to gaol for that, it was dismissed—I know Thompson—he was in the tap room, and he ought to have stopped the prisoner from coming out with the poker—I know Morris, he was there—I know Hollis—the prisoner kicked me—I had not hit him before he kicked me—I told him I would hit him—I hit at him before he struck me, and he gave me the kick on the leg—I was going to hit him—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, don't call me a liar again, or else I shall hit you"—I have known the prisoner some time, and worked in the same establishment with him—this matter began with some altercation, in consequence of himself and others being discharged—I was not working at that establishment myself, I was work<lb></lb>ing at Mr. Wood's, a coal merchant—the prisoner and I had several rounds—a regular fight, what I call a <hi rend="italic">mill</hi>—I did not give him as much punish<lb></lb>ment as I could—there were no blows struck at all hardly—when he went to the police office, he was bleeding from the nose—I did not give him a blow on the eye which caused him to hold up his handkerchief.</p>

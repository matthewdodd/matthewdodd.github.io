             sworn. - I am an officer: The prosecutor came to me to apprehend the prisoner; he went into the room, there were two women in bed, and he said, that is the woman who robbed me of my watch; she got up in bed, and said, how could I rob you, I have not got a shift on, if I had robbed you I should have bought a shift; she acknowledged that she was with him in Cork-street, but knew nothing whatever of the young man's watch.</p>
               <p>Q.(To prosecutor.) How many girls did you pick up that night? - A. Only that one, she did not undress herself that night; I could not see what she had got on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The first time I saw that young man was at the top of Cork-street, he asked me where I was going; I told him I was going home; he said he was locked out, and he asked if he might come to bed with me; he went with me, and treated me at the watering-house, Piccadilly; there were three or four other girls he caught hold of, and he went up a court with them, and when we came home he had only one shilling; he said, if he saw me again he would make it up to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never saw one girl after I met her in Cork-street.</p>

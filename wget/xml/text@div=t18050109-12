             sworn. - I am a painter, I was at work at this public-house at the time this man missed his basket, I went with two more to find him; we went from this house in Swallow-street to Berwick-street, we found his wife down in a cellar in Peter-street, we asked if that was Savage's; she said, yes; we asked for some oysters, we wanted to have them in the cellar, she refused us going down into the cellar; I fled down, and crossed to the bed-room in the cellar, and undeneath the bed, I pulled out the basket, with three turkeys and two quarters of mutton; I said to my friends, we do not want oysters, here is enough; there were only two cloths, one cloth was gone with the turkey and goose; we sent for a constable to take the woman to the Magistrate's, she was committed for re-examination; coming from the office we met Savage, and we took him there, and the Justice released the woman and put Savage in her place; the property was given to Powell, as the goods were perishable. (The basket produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

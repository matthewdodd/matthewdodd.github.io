                  </hi>. The prisoner was occasionally in my employ—it was his duty to pay me money if he received it for me—on Friday, the 1st of May, I desired him to take a horse to Smithfield and sell it—if he received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, he has not paid me.</p>

I am not a dealer in horses—the prisoner has sold horses for me three times before—he never bought one for me—I fix a price on the horse, and pay him for his time—I did not sell him this horse—I never sold him a horse—he is a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, I believe—I was driving the horse in Bridge. Blackfriars-road, in my cart to Smithfield, and met him—I in street, structed him to sell it for me—I went with him to Smithfield and was present while he was showing it, but did not interfere—I did not come up and ask how much was asked for it—I was in the market when he sold it—I saw the people looking at it—I did not hear what they said—I know Watford, who bought the horse, now, but I did not then—I had never seen him before to my knowledge—I am sure I was not in company with another person of that name—I met the prisoner a fortnight to-morrow in the tap-root of the Wagon and Horses—I said, "You are the man I want, you must go to the station with me; I believe you know who I am"—I did not say if he would give me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he should hear no more about it—if I had asked him to give me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I do not suppose he had it—I have known him some time—I always found him honest before—he did not talk about buying the horse for himself—he made no offer for it—I am quite confident of it—as I was going along I said, "Peploe, I want you to dispose of a horse; I want you to walk it up and down and sell it for me"—I took it out of my cart and let him take it into the market—I waited at the public-house where he was to bring the money to me, but he never came.</p>

On 9th November I was with Obee, another officer, in Cheapside, and saw the prosecutor endeavouring to get away from two persons, not the prisoners—I saw the two prisoners come from the opposite side of the road—Pheby placed himself immediately in front of the prosecutor—Carter went on his left side, and put his right hand on the prosecutor's shoulder, and drew the pin from his scarf—Pheby, at the same time, was preventing his getting from the crowd—Carter's hand was immediately seized by myself and Obee—he had the pin in his hand, and it went through the inside of one of his fingers, and it commenced to bleed—he passed the pin—there were ten or a dozen hands endeavouring to get it—it went from Carter to some person, I could not say who—I took Carter</p>

I was with Whitney—I have heard his account, it is correct—when Garter drew the pin from the gentleman's scarf Whitney and myself tried to get his hand—at the same time Pheby put up his hand, and Carter pressed his hand in the struggle, and Pheby took the pin and threw it up in the air—I caught it as it came down on one of their shoulders, and just managed to reach it—this is the pin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

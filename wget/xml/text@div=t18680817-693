                  </hi>. The prisoner is my father—on 16th July, between 9 and 10 in the morning, I started with him to look for some sheep which had been at the back of my father's house, and were gone in the morning—we went across the Little Field, out into Muddy Lane. and down the lane till we met Curtis—we then went down in Taylor's field; father sat on the gate, and I went in to see whether the sheep were there—I did nothing there—they were not there, and we went into Muddy Lane—I did not drive the sheep past my father—we found the sheep at the end of Muddy Lane, and some of them in Greenford Road, and collected them together—we then went on to a public-house, and father stopped and had something to drink, and brought some out to me—I then went on with the steep, and father came and <hi rend="italic">overcatched</hi> me, and we went up to the White Hart—father went in there and had something to drink, and I went a little way on the road, and stopped the sheep, and he came and catched me—we went on to Mr. Whittington's, and I went on round the corner with the sheep, and stopped by a pond—my father came in a quarter of an hour, and brought seven sheep, and then we went on past another public house, and met Hawkins—we then had twenty-two sheep—Hawkins said if we had any sheep drop he would pick them up as he came along—we then went to another public-house, on to the turnpike, and father paid the turnpike, which is before the public-house—he paid a little girl—father and I then went in and had something to drink, and the sheep went on—we did not stop anywhere else; we went straight home, and fifteen of the sheep were <hi rend="italic">steeled</hi>, and the rest turned out at the back—I was in the slaughter-house when they were <hi rend="italic">steeled</hi>, and helped to skin their legs.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How old are you <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ten years last Tuesday—the little girl is not here to whom my father paid the turnpike—the turnpike is just to the right, as you come out—we did not let the sheep through the turnpike-gate, but we had to pay—the turnpike is about ten yards up the road, to the right, from Whittington's farm—the girl is a lit<lb></lb>tle bigger than me, she was standing up the road—there is a chain up across the road there—my father had had the sheep which were lost, a week—he had sixteen the day before, and had killed one over-night—he kept his sheep at the back of the house in Gibson's field—they are but dry-houses there—he does not rent the field of Gibson—I do not know whether he pays for putting his sheep there, or how long he has put them there—it is building ground—he only turned out a few there sometimes—he had thirty at the beginning of the week, they came by railway, and he killed them as he wanted them—the building ground has grass on it, which they ate—I saw the fifteen sheep there the night before, at 7 o'clock—I did not count them, and do not know what sort they were—they had all strayed away next morning, at 7 o'clock, when I got up, but Ned the butcher had missed them first, and went in search of them, but could not find them; and about 10 o'clock my father and I started off to look for them—we went down Wexley Lane, towards Wells Farm, and saw that man (<hi rend="italic">Osborne</hi>)—I do not know whether my father said a word to him about the sheep being lost, and our looking for them—I saw Curtis trimming the hedge; I said nothing to him, I do</p>

               <p>not know whether my father did, about the sheep, but he spoke to Curtis—I went into Mr. Taylor's field to look for the sheep, there were a large num<lb></lb>ber there, and I walked in among them to see if I could see any of my father's sheep—my father did not come and help me, he was sitting on the gate—I went down through them, and went back and told him I could not find any of them—we found some of them in Muddy Lane, and some in Green<lb></lb>ford Lane, before we got to the other public house—Muddy Lane is five or six yards from where we found the last of the sheep—we did not drive them back to my father's, instead of driving them all round here, because father had seven more to get at Mr. Whittington's—that is the longest way round—I never saw Mr. Goodenough at the Hare and Hounds—I did not try to drive the sheep down the private road opposite Nutman's, and my father did not tell me to try and get permission to drive them that way—I was left to mind them—he did not tell me it would be better to go down the private road—my father went into Whittington's farm, and told me to go on with the sheep—he did not tell me to wait—I did not know that there was a pond round the corner—when I got to the pond I waited, and he joined me, driving up the seven sheep himself—he had driven them to me before I saw Hawkins—Hawkins was a bit further than the pond; further from Whittington's.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many sheep had your father two or three days before he lost any? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sixteen the day before, but we killed one every night—I do not know of his having any between the thirty coming and the fifteen being lost—we got safe home with the twenty-two sheep about 2 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go back from Wexley Lane into Muddy Lane? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I went across the field and father sat on the gate—I went into the field to the gate, that is the gate in Muddy Lane—I went back into Muddy Lane, and then went into the field at the gate, and my father with me—he sat on Mr. Taylor's gate, and I went into the field to see where the sheep where lying—they were in a pit some way down the field—I do not know whether the sheep we lost had white faces, father said that some had black faces and some spotted—I had seen them at my father's—when my father went in at Whittington's gate he told me that he had to go in there for seven more sheep—I am sure he told me that—the sheep we lost were marked N. on one side, and I looked for the N. mark and found those fifteen sheep with the N mark—some had spotted faces, and some white—there were more spotted than white.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and servant to the prisoner—on 16th July, about 6.30 in the morning, I missed some sheep from a field behind my master's—I looked about the fields and could not see them, and I went and told my master they had got out—he said that I had better go and look for them—I did so, but did not know much about the place, and I told him I could not find them—he and his son then went to look for them—they had been in the field a week or rather more—I fetched them from the railway station, thirty of them—I paid 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the carriage of them, and received a ticket—I cannot read this ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) nor say whether that is it—when my master returned he brought back twenty-two sheep—fifteen were killed that day—I saw them taken away to London, and helped to load the cart—my master sends between twenty and thirty to market every week—their skins were in the cart, and also some beef—a policeman was there while the cart was being loaded, he comes to call master up in the morning—I was examined before the Magistrate at Brentford.</p>

I am staff-sergeant of pensioners of the Woolwich division—I enroll men for the Army Reserve Force—on 5th November the prisoner came to the Pension Office, Woolwich, and produced this paper, saying that he wished to be enlisted in the Army Reserve, and that his name was George Faulklaud—it is the practice for me to enroll men who have been discharged, if they are under the age of thirty-four, which he is—I asked him his age, found the certificate, and sent him to the doctor—on his return, I asked him if he was enrolled already—he said, "No"—I said, "If you are you will be severely punished"—I then referred to the attesting books, and found that a George Faulklaud was already enrolled—I then held his papers up to the light, and found that there had been an erasure in the name and date—I told him that I thought I knew him, and that he was George Faulkland—he said "No"—I sent for a policeman, and he opened the door and ran away, but I gave him in charge—the money paid on enrolment is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

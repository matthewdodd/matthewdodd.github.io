             was standing on a step of a passage in Parker's-buildings I came along close by the side of her and she asked me if I would give her some gin? I said I did not mind giving her a glass of gin, she said come along then, and I went along with her to the Sugar loaf, where we drank a glass of gin a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there? - I did not stay with her five minutes that time. We made an agreement to go out of the public house and to go to her apartment, and we stopped there about five minutes; I was to give her a shillings, I had no shilling about me, only half a guinea, and I said, she might hold my watch while I went down to change the half guinea; I gave her the watch and went to the public house and got change at the bar with the landlord, when I came back I gave her the one shilling that I owed her, and she gave me the watch again. I put my watch into my pocket and went into the public house again and sat down with my company that I at first went into the house with, and she came and sat down at the end of the same box, and we had something to drink more, some beer and some gin; we stayed there till between six and seven o'clock in the evening; my uncle then asked me what o'clock it was? and I pulled my watch out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300014"></xptr>of my pocket and told him, and put the watch on the table that he might see, she sat the outside of the box, and took the watch up, and went out to the door with it, I got up in less than a quarter of a minute after, and went out to see for her, and there being two doors to the tap-room, I chanced to go to the wrong door, and I did not see her afterwards, nor have not seen the watch since.</p>

               <p>I was present at the Sugar Loaf, in the same box, I saw the watch in this woman's hand, it was between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it immediately before she went out of the room? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her go out of the room? - I did not, while I turned round she went away, she was gone in an instant round the corner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Wednesday evening I was standing at the Sugar Loaf door, and this man came up and asked me if I would have any thing to drink? and it being a public house we all went in together; afterwards he asked me if I had got a room of my own? I said yes; says he, if you will go up stairs I will give you a shilling, and I being a poor woman, a shilling was very acceptable to me; and having a child to keep; and I said to him, I will go up with you, and then before any thing passed, I asked him for the shilling, and he said he had not a shilling, only a half guinea, and he gave me the watch to hold while he got change for the half guinea, so afterwards he went and got change for the half guinea, and I gave him the watch out of my pocket. Now, says he, come in along with me and I will treat you, and I went in and sat along with him and his companions, and we had about six half pints of gin, and six pots of half and half, after that, being disguised in liquor, I went and laid myself down by the side of my child, and Mr. Ash, belonging to the public house, came and took me up.</p>
